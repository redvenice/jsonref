While Tesco and Marks \u0026amp Spencer were seeing strong food sales, hospitality firms were suffering from weak trading as the Omicron variant kept customers at home. Pub chain Mitchells \u0026amp Butlers has reported that a recovery in trading last autumn stumbled, after Omicron “led to calls for further caution in socialising”.  M\u0026ampB, which runs the All Bar One, Harvester and Toby Carvery chains, adds that: M\u0026ampB also warned that its costs are rising: Victoria Scholar, Head of Investment at interactive investor, has the details: CEO Iain McPherson is to step down with immediate effect.  Countryside has also struck an agreement with activist investor Browning West, which has been pushing for change.  Peter Lee, partner at the US hedge fund, will join the board, with Browning West agreeing not to propose resolutions at general meetings or try to remove directors from the Board. Card Factory has reported total sales of £337.3m since the start of February, ahead of the Board’s expectations.  That’s still sharply lower than pre-pandemic (it made £424.5m in eleven months to 31 December 2019), as restrictions forced shops to close at times last year.They’re still close to their highest level since 2014, though. Michael Hewson of CMC Markets says: This morning’s reaction seems ‘a little churlish’, but doesn’t mean Tesco shares can’t climb higher in the longer term, he adds: M\u0026ampS shares had rallied strongly in 2021, hitting the highest since May 2019, as it upgraded its profit forecasts twice. Today it only nudged that guidance higher, saying it was “more confident” in hitting those targets. Online fashion group ASOS is sticking with its recently downgraded guidance, after being hit by supply chain problems and rising costs. It says that the pandemic continued to disrupt business: Customer growth slowed, after surging earlier in the pandemic as lockdowns drove people towards home shopping. ASOS added another 300,000 customers, lifting its total to 26.7m. ASOS issued a profits warning in October, with CEO Nick Beighton stepping down. Mat Dunn, COO, says ASOS is delivering on that guidance “despite challenging market conditions”.

Photograph: iStockLegislation aimed at keeping so-called “cowboy” builders out of the industry has been published by the Government.The Regulation of Providers of Building Works Bill 2021 requires builders to sign up to a statutory register. However, registration will not be compulsory for another two years.A voluntary register was established by the Construction Industry Federation (CIF) in 2014. Legislation will put the Construction Industry Register Ireland (CIRI) on a statutory footing but it will continue to be operated by the CIF.“Everyone should be confident in the knowledge that their homes are built to the highest standards and that any professional services they use are also of a certain standard,” he said. “This legislation will ensure that the construction sector operates to the highest standard and that people have confidence in its workforce and practices.”The Government was taking “firm action” to guard against a recurrence of housing defects that were “legacies of poor construction design, workmanship and materials,” he said.“By driving regulation in the construction sector, the State will ensure the mistakes of the past are not repeated and we have a more sustainable housing system and construction sector in the future.”CIF director general Tom Parlon said while the legislation still has to progress through the Oireachtas, the register already operated “very strict” criteria.“There is a very tight independent admission and registration board. The competence and experience criteria is set out, if they fail on any of these things they don’t get through. They have to show they are fully compliant with all regulatory and statutory provisions and sign up to continuous professional development,” he said.AppealsThere is an appeals board to which people can make complaints about a registered builder, but “there isn’t any redress, it’s not an insurance scheme” he said.“It’s in the selection process. By selecting from the register the customer has the comfort of knowing they’re getting a competent person who is fully compliant and has all the skills to do a professional job. The combination of the building regulations and CIRI should give massive comfort to customers in the future that they are going to get a good job done. “Orla Hegarty assistant professor in the UCD School of Architecture, said the new system “must have teeth” if it is to be anything more than a marketing tool for builders.“What we need is consumer protection, so if someone hires a builder and there is a problem with the work, or the company folds, they should have the same consumer rights as when they buy a pair of shoes. Otherwise this is just a badge for marketing.”She was concerned the register could be used to keep builders from other jurisdictions out of the market.“We must ensure this doesn’t turn into protectionism, limiting who can participate in the market. There is no such job as a ‘qualified builder’ and I would have concerns about the CIF being the gatekeepers, deciding who in the European Union and outside the EU including Northern Ireland, will be admitted for entry.”Statutory registration will start in early 2024 the Department of Housing said to give the industry “time to adapt to these new requirements”.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"miriam lord golfgate trial lawyers come out swinging","story":"Donie Cassidy leaves Galway District Court in Co Galway after attending a hearing where he is one of four people accused to have breached Covid restrictions by organising a golf society dinner. Photograph: Andrew DownesPA Wire What did we learn from Day One of the Great Golfgate Trial?We found out that lawyers – if the legal heavyweights who turned up in force for a district court case in Galway are anything to go by – have a rather sniffy attitude to golf. Not quite their cup of tee.And that the Oireachtas Golf Society was a hitherto unrecognised major force in Irish political history until it hit the headlines last year due to the “Golfgate” furore.We learned that the size of a gap in a partition is a moveable feast. It certainly was moveable at the particular feast under the spotlight in Judge Mary Fahy’s courtroom on Thursday.We discovered that the annual President’s Prize dinner was not a “frivolous” event in 2020 and that the traditional presentation at the 19th hole after a convivial day on the links was anything but “a frolic”.That this event was, in fact, “poignant”. This is because it was held in honour of a politician who was behind the much-underestimated Golfing Revival Era in Irish politics 50 years ago. The late Mark Killilea was a driving force in the resurrection of the Oireachtas Golf Society, which had fizzled out after it was founded by a TD called Major Somethingorother in 1929.We heard that the then captain of the guard in Leinster House, an enthusiastic member of the society, had two breakfasts and one evening meal in the hotel which is now at the centre of this court case. And that a member of the Seanad and his wife left the dinner before the formalities commenced because “we’re not dessert people”.And that guidelines issued with the “imprimatur of the State” and bearing the harp of Rialtas na hÉireann on printed communications may, or may not be, worthless.We also learned on the opening day of the trial of politicians Noel Grealish and Donie Cassidy and hotel bosses John and James Sweeney for allegedly contravening the Covid emergency health act by holding a dinner indoors for over 50 people, that all of the witnesses called by the prosecution had nothing but praise for how the defendants managed the event.Bending the rulesThe story of the Oireachtas Golf Society’s now-infamous dinner hit the headlines late in 2020. In the early days of the pandemic, claims that politicians had been bending the strict rules painfully and dutifully observed by wider society caused uproar. But the lawyers acting for Grealish and Cassidy set out from the start to show how their clients acted with the utmost propriety at all times and their actions have been gravely misunderstood by the public.Which brings us back to something else learned on Thursday: when push comes to shove, it’s all the media’s fault. In this case, according to Donie Cassidy’s lawyer Colm Smyth SC, for getting involved and then “public hysteria was whipped up and hysteria was whipped up”.This, he said, led to “a lot of very good people” having “to resign from their positions”.Near the end of the first day, Martin Brett, a Fine Gael councillor from Kilkenny who was at the golf outing and dinner in Connemara, said he didn’t even know how many people were at the function until he read it in the paper.“Don’t believe what you read in the newspapers and the journal,” said Eoghan Cole BL, for the State.Barrister Cole was up against it. A lone ranger on the DPP’s side against the heavy guns hired by the defendants. The place was coming down with junior and senior counsel and instructing solicitors.Smyth, for Donie Cassidy, made the most running on day one, with bracing interventions from Senator Michael McDowell SC (for former PD colleague and now independent TD Noel Grealish) and the country’s leading libation lawyers Constance Cassidy and Eddie Walsh (for James and John Sweeney, respectively).Bewildering meanderThere isn’t much you can tell those two about the licensing laws. When Constance, in the midst of a bewildering meander through statutory instruments and hospitality regulations, talked about “the consumption of intoxicating liquor”, you knew it wasn’t the first time she said those words.Among the ranks of the BLs was junior counsel Willie Penrose, the former Labour TD. He is part of the Cassidy squad.As for the journalists sent to cover this trial of the half-century (50 years a-fourballing, and all that), there was no room in the court building for them. Two were allowed inside to hear the proceedings, the rest given a video link to download and hope for the best.Enter the hero of the hour: Fergal McGrath, brother of former TD Finian, who runs the Town Hall Theatre opposite the courthouse. Fergal made a room available to the hacks (which is more than the Courts Service could manage, despite this being a case of national interest which was flagged months ago).Business for Fergal has been hugely impacted by Covid, but he has a tasty line-up of events coming in the new year. The panto, sadly, had to be cancelled so all the kiddies in Galway missed out on the fairy godmother saying: “You shall go to the (golf) ball!”After a morning spent mostly in legal discussion, Colm Smyth got round to telling us of Donie Cassidy. A man who has never been before the courts in his life, has had a distinguished political career and is the owner of four hotels in Dublin, and that’s just for starters. “A lawmaker, not a lawbreaker.”Donie, in Colm’s words, sounded like Santa. Before the event, “he checked the regulations. He checked the guidelines. He consulted with people.” Probably to make sure nobody would be naughty and everyone would be nice.Former TD and senator Cassidy was president of the society. His co-defendant, TD Noel Grealish, was captain on the night.No hand, act or putterMichael McDowell said this was very important because his client’s position is that president Cassidy organised the do as it was his dinner. Noel Grealish, as captain, had some involvement in organising the first day of golf but “I just want to be 100 per cent clear” he had no hand, act or putter in organising the shindig on the second night.Eddie and Constance, meanwhile, said that the “company” as opposed to the two Mr Sweeneys should have been charged.Then Colm Smyth started talking about “potentially an unsavoury aspect” to the prosecution, without explaining entirely what he meant.“Substantiate the unsavouryness,” challenged Eoghan Cole, for the State.The witnesses so far are all people who attended the golf dinner.They were blown away by the Covid prevention measures taken by management.The mainly retired minor politicians who attended this dinner were “exceptionally impressed”. But then, they don’t get out as much as they used to. There would be no “intermingling” at this hooley in Connemara.One of the guests recalled the rigid attention to the pandemic prevention rules on the night.“A waiter said to me: table service only. You don’t move unless you go to the toilet.”One of the lawyers pointed approvingly to “the liberality of sanitisers and so on”.There was some discussion as to whether they were separated by a “partition” or “a solid wall” but there was a definite ision until the gap appeared at prize-giving.It was seven to eight feet on either side of a pillar, according to one witness, and “probably the width of a person”, according to another.But did two separate rooms of people attending the dinner constitute a single event or multiple events? It’s a bit like St Patrick and the shamrock – three leaves on the one stem. St Donie and the dinner – two rooms on the one feed.Judge Fahy will have to decide.She admitted she isn’t much into golf, with the course in Ballyconneely more “the Dublin fours”. Michael McDowell and Eddie Cassidy were similarly unmoved by the joys of the game.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"shared","story":"A new  series on the future of the island of Ireland begins todayFormer Fine Gael leader Enda Kenny eased the path for North\u0026rsquos re-entry into bloc in 2017Conversation about a shared island must have boundaries, many unionists argueStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"state","story":"State papers: Perception on the Shankill Road in 1990s was \u0026lsquofear of encroachment\u0026rsquo-the-  each Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday"},{"url":null,"title":"government cautiously optimistic on further easing of restrictions","story":"Chief Medical Officer Tony Holohan said the possibility of lifting Covid-19 restrictions on hospitality and other sectors was ‘all in play’ next week. Photograph: Gareth ChaneyCollinsSenior Government figures including Chief Medical Officer Dr Tony Holohan have signalled they may decide later this month to ease restrictions, despite continuing record numbers of Covid-19 infections.A discussion among Ministers at Wednesday’s Cabinet meeting was “cautiously optimistic”, according to sources present, with a view forming in Government that the worst of the pandemic has passed.“The mood is becoming more optimistic,” said one Minister. Later Dr Holohan said the possibility of lifting Covid-19 restrictions on hospitality and other sectors was “all in play” next week when the Government’s public-health advisers meet to consider the impact of the Omicron wave of infections in more detail.At a media briefing, Dr Holohan said it was “fair” to question why hospitality settings would not be reopened fully when higher rates of infection among younger people from the surge in Omicron infections were likely to lead to a high level of population immunity.The National Public Health Emergency Team (Nphet) needed another week to ensure all that the things that it “might have feared” from Omicron had not played out, he said.Dr Holohan said the measures announced by the Government on Wednesday on relaxation of isolation and testing rules, replacing them with new directions that Covid-19 cases and close contacts wear higher-grade face masks and undergo regular antigen testing, was a “proportionate” response to a variant that was not leading to serious levels of illness.But Dr Holohan also urged caution at a meeting of senior officials on Wednesday, according to people briefed on the exchange. “We’re not out of the woods yet,” said one source. CollegesThere is also some nervousness in Government and health circles about the return of most students to colleges in the next fortnight, as many have not yet received their booster vaccine doses.However, several senior sources said if things go as expected in the coming weeks restrictions should be lifted in early February. Ministers will be keen to give notice to businesses and sporting organisations about the prospects for lifting restrictions.An Nphet meeting is scheduled for next week at which Dr Holohan and other senior officials will review the latest data. Ministers hope they will then be in a position to give clear signals about the plans for the lifting of restrictions in February, including the prospects for forthcoming large sporting events such as the Six Nations rugby championship. Public opinion research published by the Department of Health suggests the public is also growing more optimistic about the current wave, with an uptick in the past week in the numbers who believe the worst of the pandemic is behind us, and a decline in those who believe it is yet to come.MasksMeanwhile, there was confusion last night around who will pay for the higher-grade masks recommended for use by close contacts. The Health Service Executive took the unusual step of issuing a statement which contradicted earlier comments by Dr Holohan, who suggested that the health service would be providing the masks to people for free.The HSE said it “currently provides face masks to healthcare settings, residential care settings and test centres, and there is no plan or intention for us to distribute masks more widely”. The Government memo discussed by Ministers on Wednesday explicitly says it is not intended that the State would provide the new masks, according to sources familiar with its contents.This would result in members of the public having to pay for medical-grade or the more expensive FFP2 respirator masks to abide by the State’s new rules.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":null,"title":"inside","story":"Decades of progress overshadowed by Putin crackdowns and confrontation with WestRussia\u0026rsquos land of the midnight sun said to have inspired creator of Chanel No. 5Atomic icebreakers and floating power plants to help Kremlin develop Arctic shipping routeMinority nations feel squeeze as Putin\u0026rsquos \u0026lsquopower vertical\u0026rsquo crushes republics\u0026rsquo autonomyHistory of bloodshed and tragedy haunts stunning region shared by Muslims and ChristiansOil wealth and new mosque and churches help keep Tatarstan on Kremlin\u0027s sideOfficials claim West wants to \u0026lsquoGermanise\u0026rsquo and instil special identity in strategic regionNato monitors heavily armed Kaliningrad as locals long for borders to reopenAttack on renowned Memorial rights group deepens opposition anger and international alarmSaint Petersburg Letter: Russia\u0026rsquos old imperial capital celebrates 200 years since birth of Crime and Punishment creatorEnergy giant hopes vast forests will offset carbon costs and ease green transitionCircassian heritage trampled and property rows continue as Winter Olympics city boomsKremlin criticised as most Russians reject vaccination and hospitals face huge strainKremlin changes tack on global warming and looks to vast forests to offset emissionsRussia and Japan co-operate on Sakhalin despite row over nearby Kuril islandsIndustry and struggling communities fear wildlife support could stifle Far East developmentCity with echoes of San Francisco is thrillingly original, yet tarnished by graft and neglectGrowing energy, security and diplomatic links between Moscow and Beijing worry WestDecembrist rebels and their aristocratic wives embraced \u0026lsquoreal Russia\u0026rsquo in Siberian exileFears for permafrost as tusk hunters feed Chinese market starved of elephant ivoryInside Russia: Melting permafrost threatens critical infrastructure and feeds global warmingStalin\u0027s popularity growing as Kremlin focuses on Soviet triumphs, not tragediesInside Russia: Party wonders how far it cane press Putin after years in soft \u0026lsquosystemic opposition\u0026rsquo roleInside Russia: More protests planned as officials reject calls to address e-voting complaintsMoscow Letter: Poet\u0026rsquos statue has been a magnet for generations of Russian dissentersOn the eve of an expected sham election, many of Putin\u0026rsquos political opponents are already jailed or dead"},{"url":null,"title":"young africans","story":"African country\u0026rsquos tech innovators call for international investment and domestic supportYoung Nigerians dance out onto world stage with pride, confidence and high ambitionWomen-led organisation aims to stop atrocities of dictatorship from reoccurringIn the Gambia, a flourishing comedy scene is used to convey serious messagesStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"duped covid lab leak deniers","story":"Inch by painful inch, the truth is being dragged out about how this pandemic started. It is just about understandable, if not forgivable, that Chinese scientists have obfuscated vital information about early cases and their work with similar viruses in Wuhan’s laboratories: they were subject to fierce edicts from a ruthless, totalitarian regime.It is more shocking to discover in emails released this week that some western scientists were also saying different things in public from what they thought in private. The emails were exchanged over the first weekend of February 2020 between senior virologists on both sides of the Atlantic following a meeting arranged by Sir Jeremy Farrar, head of the Wellcome Trust, with America’s two top biologists, Francis Collins, director of the National Institutes of Health, and Anthony Fauci, head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.Freedom of Information requests sent last year produced farcical results in both Britain and America: ghost emails with all the contents redacted. Now, the US government has been forced to make unredacted versions available to Republicans on the House of Representatives’ oversight committee for an “in camera review”.Thankfully, staffers transcribed some of the contents. They show that Dr Fauci, Dr Collins and Sir Patrick Vallance, our Government’s Chief Scientific Adviser, were briefed, on and after February 1, by several virologists who thought at the time that the new virus showed signs of having been manipulated in the laboratory.Not only did they never breathe a word of this suspicion to the media or the public, they rubbished it. The meeting on February 1 led to an article from the very virologists who were making the case that the virus showed signs of having been in a lab. Yet, in the words of Dr Collins, the job of that article was to “settle” the matter and “put down this very destructive conspiracy” lest the rumours do harm to “international harmony”.Three of the five authors in that paper are shown in the emails to be leaning towards the conclusion either that a key part of the genome of the virus had been manipulated in a laboratory, or that the virus had mutated in human cells while in a lab. Yet they dismissed both possibilities in the paper they drafted.We do not know what was in the first draft, prepared just three days after the meeting, but the final article, published in Nature Medicine on March 17, concluded that “we do not believe that any type of laboratory-based scenario is plausible”.By then, two other articles had been rushed into print. One, in The Lancet, set out to “strongly condemn conspiracy theories suggesting that Covid-19 does not have a natural origin”. The other, in Emerging Microbes and Infections (EMI), by Liu Shan-Lu and colleagues, found “no credible evidence supporting claims of the laboratory engineering” of the virus. The Lancet article failed to disclose (for 18 months) the conflict of interest of several authors including Peter Daszak, a close collaborator of the Wuhan Institute of Virology who secretly orchestrated the article.The EMI article failed to disclose the fact that a senior virologist, Ralph Baric of the University of North Carolina, had agreed to help edit it, saying: “Sure, but don’t want to be cited in as having commented prior to submission.” Scientific journals have not behaved with transparency.At the time, given that I had written extensively on genomics, I was asked often about the chances that the pandemic started with a lab leak and I said this had been ruled out, pointing to the three articles in question. Only later, when I dug deeper, did I notice just how flimsy their arguments were.For example, the Nature Medicine paper included a passage saying the virus “would have then required repeated passage in cell culture or animals with ACE2 receptors, but such work has also not previously been described”. It is surprising to learn now that Sir Jeremy Farrar himself thought this very “passage” operation was a “likely explanation” of how the virus came to have its unique features. At the time, I trusted senior virologists who told me the lab leak could be dismissed. Frankly, I was duped.Matt Ridley is the co-author of ‘Viral: The Search for the Origin of Covid-19’More from NewsBoris Johnson latest news: PM pulls out of planned visit due to family Covid case amid Downing Street party backlashCovid latest news: Jonathan Van-Tam to leave post as England’s deputy chief medical officerDozens of migrants rescued after crossing Channel overnightOmicron symptoms: What they are and how the Covid variant differs from previous strains\u0026#39Is he fit to lead?\u0026#39: how newspapers around world are now questioning Boris\u0026#39s futureMeet Lewis A Kaplan: The judge overseeing the Prince Andrew sex abuse caseMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"royal navy has lost ambition says outgoing sea lord parting","story":"The Royal Navy has “lost its ambition”, the outgoing Second Sea Lord has said, as he criticised “traditionalists” reluctant to embrace new technology and AI.In his valedictory letter, Vice-Admiral Nick Hine, the Second Sea Lord, turned his guns on “pedants and naysayers” holding the Navy back.The note, addressed to all Navy personnel, Royal Marines and civil servants, did not single out iniduals but instead praised those who “strive so hard for the success of the organisation today, tomorrow and always”.Vice-Adml Hine said: “Those of you who have known me for a long time will have heard many times my bugbear that our great Navy has lost its ambition. “I have despaired at times that collectively, we had become self-censoring, risk averse, and lacking in curiosity, confidence and critical thinking skills.“We have these qualities but have allowed a rose-tinted view of tradition, and a spurious belief that you can avoid risk by sticking to a failing status quo, to avoid driving transformation.”Vice-Adml Hine, who retires after 37 years of service, has spoken in the past of the Navy’s need to sacrifice “organisational sacred cows” blocking progress, as well as how a tradition of caution is part of Royal Navy culture.He is known to admire Adml Jackie Fisher, a Royal Navy legend seen as an outstanding innovator whose reforms helped transform the fleet into a modern fighting force at the start of the 20th century.Speaking exclusively to The , Vice-Adml Hine said the ingrained bureaucracy of the military sometimes gets in the way of progress.“The one thing you can’t buy is time,” he said.Vice-Adml Hine said transforming the Navy would rely on changing its culture. “I don’t need people to pull ropes,” he said. “I need people to pull data.”His critical comments are directed at those who have failed to embrace new technologies such as drones, robotic mine hunters and artificial intelligence. Handing over as deputy head of the Royal Navy to Vice-Adml Martin Connell, Vice-Adml Hine said he had made it his mission during his two and a half years in post to challenge all naval personnel “to grasp the nettle, to be bolder in the face of the future and to truly be the people that you can be”.“I have been heartened that there are so many people prepared to give their all to move the service in the right direction and at the pace needed,” he said.“As I go, I say to those who would prefer to have the brakes on, the pedants and naysayers, remain critical (always) but please understand that the need for, and the value of change is not a fantasy - if we don\u0027t transform we will fail and we will lose. It is that simple.”The  understands the First Sea Lord - the head of the Royal Navy - saw the letter before publication and is happy with its contents, as it emphasises the need to be more efficient and use money more wisely.A naval source said: “The transformation programme has delivered some successes, but there are some in the older generation who are resistant to change. They know what they bloody well like and like what they bloody well know.”“If they don’t get on the bus, they’ll get run over by it.”Vice-Adml Hine said he was “saddened” he had “not been able to realise the level of ambition that I know is possible and needed”. He called on all personnel “to be braver and more audacious to help lead this great service to the position that it and all of you deserve…to be ready in all respects to win whenever and wherever”. He added: “Strive to leave the service in a better place than you found it.“Be better than yesterday. I hope that remains any legacy I have.”More from NewsCovid latest news: Jonathan Van-Tam to leave post as England’s deputy chief medical officerBoris Johnson latest news: PM pulls out of planned visit due to family Covid case amid Downing Street party backlashDozens of migrants rescued after crossing Channel overnightOmicron symptoms: What they are and how the Covid variant differs from previous strains\u0026#39Is he fit to lead?\u0026#39: how newspapers around world are now questioning Boris\u0026#39s futureMeet Lewis A Kaplan: The judge overseeing the Prince Andrew sex abuse caseMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"discovery ancient wooden figure suggests britain rapidly romanised","story":"An ancient wooden figure has been unearthed by archaeologists, and the 2,000-year-old “gift for gods” may reveal that Britons were rapidly “Romanised” after being invaded.HS2 excavations of a 1st century AD ditch in Buckinghamshire uncovered the two-foot tall oak sculpture, one of only a handful of wooden figures from this period ever found in the UK.The rare carving preserved by layers of thick clay may have been deliberately placed in the ditch 2,000 years ago, experts have said, and may represent a local god or the body of a worshipper hoping to be healed.The totem sports a Roman hairstyle and short tunic, despite experts believing it was placed in the ditch very soon after imperial troops invaded Britain in the 1st century, indicating that locals may have been quickly Romanised by incoming continental fashions.Iain Williamson, an archaeologist for Fusion JV working at the site, said the figure found near Three Bridge Mill has “hair bobbed at the back and cut fairly short”.He added: “It gives the impression of a more Romanised figure that perhaps we could expect, rather than native dress.”While the dress shows Roman influences, the sculpture, which shows signs of expert carving and long-term care, may have been tied to local religious traditions.Mr Williamson said: “It could be the effigy of an ancestor or a local god, it could have been there as a totem to look out and protect the landscape.“They could also be more personal. We have examples in France of pilgrims and they are depositing these as gifts to the gods, for healing.“They are giving a depiction of themselves so the gods know who to cure. That’s one theory.“They are given as a gift for the god here, probably so they know who they are dealing with.”Experts are set to precisely date the wood and determine whether it was grown in Britain, or on the continent and then brought across the Channel by newcomers to the island.More from NewsCovid latest news: Jonathan Van-Tam to leave post as England’s deputy chief medical officerBoris Johnson latest news: PM pulls out of planned visit due to family Covid case amid Downing Street party backlashDozens of migrants rescued after crossing Channel overnightOmicron symptoms: What they are and how the Covid variant differs from previous strains\u0026#39Is he fit to lead?\u0026#39: how newspapers around world are now questioning Boris\u0026#39s futureMeet Lewis A Kaplan: The judge overseeing the Prince Andrew sex abuse caseMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"russias alliance china beginning falter","story":"A new era of the Great Game is afoot in Central Asia, only this time the adversaries competing for power and influence in the region are not Western nations such as Britain and the US, but Russia and China.Back in the 19th century, when the term was first coined to describe the bitter rivalry between the world’s major powers for control, it was Britain and its allies who were the main protagonists, as they sought to fight off rival forces, whether they be Imperial Russia or Islamists.Today, however, any remaining hopes that Britain and allies like the United States might have entertained of maintaining a vestige of influence in the region disappeared with the Joe Biden administration’s bungled withdrawal from Afghanistan. At a stroke, the US president brought decades of Western involvement in Central Asia to an ignoble end.In Afghanistan as well as other strategically important countries such as Kazakhstan, the decline in the West’s standing has resulted in new powers, seeking to fill the vacuum.The deepening rivalry, moreover, between Moscow and Beijing for mastery of this vital geographical region raises serious questions about the viability of the alliance which Russia and China claim to have formed as they seek to usurp the established global order created by the world’s democracies.Only last summer, Chinese and Russian forces participated in joint military drills in north-central China, involving around 10,000 ground troops and fighter aircraft. These prompted speculation that the two states were aiming to pool their resources in a bid to counter Western alliances such as the new Aukus pact between the US, UK and Australia.The feasibility of China and Russia forming an effective partnership always, in my view, needed to be treated with a healthy dose of scepticism, not least because of the long-standing rivalry between Moscow and Beijing dating back to the period when they espoused different brands of communist doctrine.The enduring tensions between the two countries were reflected in the complaints made by some of the Russian participants in last year’s SibuCooperation-2021 exercises in China’s Ningxia region, who claimed they were mocked and bullied by their Chinese partners.Now, judging by the scale of Russia’s so-called “peacekeeping” mission in Kazakhstan, Moscow’s rivalry with Beijing for influence in the region of Central Asia has become a key factor in the Kazakh disturbances.While there is evidence that the initial clashes were the result of an internal power struggle between Nursultan Nazarbayev, Kazakhstan’s so-called “Father of the Nation” and former long-serving president, and the incumbent, Kassym-Jomart Tokayev, China’s growing influence in the country’s affairs helps to explain why Moscow found it necessary to deploy a detachment of elite Spetsnaz paratroopers to help end the violence.The sheer scale of the Russian response, involving an estimated 5,000 troops and an airlift carried out by some 70 planes, suggests that the Kremlin is more concerned about asserting its own authority over a country it regards as part of its “near abroad” of former Soviet-era states than in saving Mr Tokayev’s political skin.Moscow certainly has good reason to fret over the ties between Kazakhstan and China, which date back to the Nazarbayev era and were part of his regime’s attempts to distance itself from Moscow. This has resulted in Kazakhstan supplying China with one fifth of its gas imports, as well as supporting the Chinese economy with supplies of oil and copper.More recently, Beijing has identified Kazakhstan, which provides 40 per cent of global uranium supplies, as a key component of its controversial Belt and Road infrastructure initiative which aims to secure Beijing’s domination of global trade. Nor has Mr Tokayev helped matters by forging closer ties with Beijing and moving away from Kazakhstan’s signature “multi-vector” approach of balancing relations between Russia, China and the West.Clearly, so far as Moscow is concerned, the Kazakh leader’s flirtation with Beijing was a provocation it was not prepared to tolerate, with the result that Russian special forces have been deployed to key locations throughout Kazakhstan in a bid to restore Russian influence. While Mr Tokayev continues to express his gratitude to the Kremlin for its help in putting down what he calls a “coup”, it is clear Vladimir Putin will be the main beneficiary of the Russian intervention.By deploying his so-called “peace-keeping” force, Mr Putin has re-asserted the Kremlin’s ability to interfere in the affairs of ex-Soviet states when it is deemed to be in Moscow’s best interests to do so. He has also sent Beijing an unequivocal message that, while Russia is no match for China economically, it still has the military strength and resolve to defend its interests – especially when it concerns countries that Moscow firmly believes should fall within its own sphere of influence.More from NewsCovid latest news: Jonathan Van-Tam to leave post as England’s deputy chief medical officerBoris Johnson latest news: PM pulls out of planned visit due to family Covid case amid Downing Street party backlashDozens of migrants rescued after crossing Channel overnightOmicron symptoms: What they are and how the Covid variant differs from previous strains\u0026#39Is he fit to lead?\u0026#39: how newspapers around world are now questioning Boris\u0026#39s futureMeet Lewis A Kaplan: The judge overseeing the Prince Andrew sex abuse caseMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"thursday morning uk news briefing todays top headlines telegraph","story":"Ordinarily, he would be by his boss\u0027s side at Prime Minister\u0027s Questions. Yet as Boris Johnson faced the most difficult day of his political career yesterday, Rishi Sunak was conspicuous by his absence while Conservative chatter turned to talk of potential successors. Last night, the Chancellor declined to fully endorse Mr Johnson until he had seen the results of the investigation into allegations of lockdown-breaking parties in Downing Street. He issued a carefully worded and lukewarm message on Twitter after eight hours of public silence. Mr Sunak\u0027s post fell short of the public support shown by Cabinet colleagues.Associate Editor Camilla Tominey argues that, by keeping 225 miles away from Westminster yesterday, Mr Sunak set himself apart as a first among equals. After Mr Johnson faced ridicule for his Commons statement, Juliet Samuel says that playing dumb was his last line of defence.What next, then? As a growing number of Tory MPs called for Mr Johnson to resign (view the full list here), there is speculation that he could face a confidence vote.A lot now rides on the outcome of the inquiry by Sue Gray, a senior civil servant, into rule-breaking parties. Gordon Rayner explains how Mr Johnson has effectively bet his premiership on her not pulling the trigger. Tony Diver examines the six possible scenarios that could come next.

The discovery process - when both he and his accuser, Virginia Giuffre, will be questioned by the other\u0027s lawyers under oath before the world\u0027s media - is likely to cause embarrassment not only to the royal father of two, 61, but his family. As our analysis explains, it perhaps goes some way to explaining why Prince Andrew\u0027s team are refusing to rule out a settlement with Ms Giuffre in a bid to avoid any further humiliation.How to emulate the success of Line of Duty if you are a rival broadcaster in search of a hit?

The ex-Vote Leave chief has spent much of the last year attacking the Prime Minister’s handling of the Covid- pandemic which has killed more than , people.But last week he set off a new grenade - revealing yet another No  party on May ,  - and shattering Mr Johnson’s fragile truce with mutinous Tory backbenchers. Mr Cummings claimed he warned the PM against going to the event but was ignored - and hinted that there was an email trail that would confirm the gathering was social.  Journalists then got to work, first of all digging out extraordinary details about the garden party, attended by Mr Johnson and his we Carrie, and then the explosive email invitation. At the same time that around  staff were knocking back drinks in the No  garden, the Mirror was working on a story that Mr Cummings himself had breached the rules. Two days later - on May  - we published explosive claims that Mr Cummings had driven hundreds of miles to his parents’ home in County Durham at the height of the lockdown. The following day, we revealed that while there he took a -mile roundtrip to Barnard Castle with his family on what was his we’s birthday. On Monday  May, he gave his now infamous press conference in the same Downing Street garden where days earlier colleagues had been partying. He told an astonished public that the trip to Barnard Castle was to test his eyesight. The PM’s claim that he thought the ‘bring your own booze’ gathering the week before was a work event has been met with similar incredulity.

Labour ’s leader joined a string of MPs saying the Prime Minister must “do the decent thing” after he broke and undermined his own ultra-strict rules in May . Mr Johnson told MPs he “went outside for  minutes” to thank staff on May , , but with hindsight I should have sent them back indoors. But he tried to wriggle out of censure by saying: I believed implicitly that this was a work event. And he once again urged MPs to wait for an inquiry by Whitehall enforcer Sue Gray. “After months of deceit and deception, the pathetic spectacle of a man who has run out of road, Sir Keir said. His defence ... that he didnapost realise he was at a party is so ridiculous that itaposs actually offensive to the British public.  Labour’s leader added: “It turns out he was at the parties all along. “Can’t the Prime Minister see why the British public think he’s lying through his teeth ” MPs are not allowed to accuse each other of lying in the Commons chamber, but Speaker Lindsay Hoyle allowed it - saying: “It was what the public think, not what a member is saying.” There were huge cheers from the opposition at the Speakeraposs ruling. Tory MPs cheered when the PM arrived but were motionless and mostly silent as he trotted out his excuse - while Labour MPs jeered, waved order papers and heckled. When the PM said he regretted that “people in Downing Street were not following those rules”, several opposition MPs shouted: “You!!” Theresa May sat with her arms pulled across her chest, staring impassively at the floor as Keir Starmer called for the PM to resign. In a statement ahead of the PMQs clash, Mr Johnson said: I know the rage [the public] feel with me and with the Government I lead when they think in Downing Street itself the rules are not being properly followed by the people who make the rules. The PM said he went into the garden for a short while but he should have sent everyone back inside. He added: “I should have recognised that evenit could be said technically to fall within the guidance, there are millions and millions of people who simply would not see it that way, people who have suffered terribly, people who were forbidden for meeting loved ones at all inside or outside, and to them and to this House I offer my heartfelt apologies.” But the Labour leader hit back, demanding to know why he hadnapost resigned when others had been forced to quit for breaking the rules. When the Prime Ministeraposs former health secretary [Matt Hancock] broke the rules, he resigned and the Prime Minister said he was right to do so, he said.  When the Prime Ministeraposs spokesperson [Allegra Stratton] laughed about the rules being broken, she resigned and the Prime Minister accepted that resignation. Why does the Prime Minister still think that the rules donapost apply to him  Labour MP Karl Turner said the PM “must resign”, saying: “He’s sorry because he’s been caught… He is bang to rights. “While my constituents were making sacrices he was hosting boozy parties in Downing Street.” Labour MP Toby Perkins said he had debased the office of Prime Minister. And Labour MP Chris Bryant, chair of the Commons Standards Committee, added: “The PM didn’t spot he was at a social event  Come off it.  “How stupid does the Prime Minister think the British people are  “He’s making fools of every single MP who cheered him earlier.” SNP Westminster leader Ian Blackford said thatBoris Johnson has no sense of shame, then the Tory backbenchers must act to remove him. Mr Blackford said that while the public suffered pain and anguish, the Prime Minister was drinking and laughing behind the walls of his private garden. He added: The public overwhelmingly think that the Prime Minister should resign.  Trust has been lost and the public will not forgive or forget. If the Prime Minister has no sense of shame, then the Tory backbenchers must act to remove him. The Prime Minister replied: I just want to thank the right honourable gentleman for his political advice, which I will take with a pinch of salt since it comes from the Scottish Nationalist Party. I think that most people looking objectively at what this Government has delivered over the last  months would agree that ... and I renew my contrition for the mistakes that have been made, but we have delivered the fastest vaccine and the fastest booster rollout in Europe, and the result is that across our whole of our United Kingdom, we have the record number of people back in work.

Shadow Pensions Minister Matt Rodda wrote to the Pensions Regulator calling on it to probe the “unpaid debt” owed to the Merchant Navy Ratings Pension Fund . The Mirror revealed this month how the logistics firm DP World had failed to stump up the cash, yet put towards £m prize money to sponsor the  European Golf Tour.Mr Rodda told the regulator the behaviour was “deeply inappropriate”, adding: “I believe that the company may have broken pension rules both by leaving this very large debt unpaid and by its wider conduct”. And he warned the behaviour towards tens of thousands of former ferry workers risks “setting a precedent” for other firms to do the same. “This conduct seems to fall below the standard expected of a leading British company”, he added.  “Pensioners and staff in the shipping industry deserve to be protected, they work long hours at sea and in all weathers for modest pay. “The pension scheme offers members security in retirement.” He added: “If you do not believe you hold the power to investigate this conduct, I would seek your view as to whether Government can do more to protect hard working people’s pensions and ensure that pension debt is successfully paid to pension schemes.” DP World is one of the globeaposs biggest port operators. It is majority-owned by the Dubai Sovereign Wealth Fund and, therefore, ultimately by the Dubai Royal Family. The company declined to comment but has not previously disputed the figures. The firm is thought to have paid more than £m into the pension pot since .

Energy bills are soaring. And working families are paying the price.A decade of incompetence, dither and delay on energy have got us here. Of course, there is a global gas price crisis. But Conservative failure to regulate, store gas, and make inroads on insulation, renewables and nuclear energy have left Britain uniquely exposed. Labour has a fully-funded plan to give families facing rising bills security now. Our plan would save most households around £ off their bills – with up to £ in total for those who need it most.That package includes a VAT cut on everyone’s home energy bills for a year from  to  percent. And it has extra help for the squeezed middle, those on lower incomes and pensioners, boosting the Warm Homes Discount and expanding it to  million households. We’d pay for this with a windfall tax on North Sea Oil and Gas profits –companies that have had a booming year. But we need to keep bills low in the future too. That’s why a Labour government will make us rely less on imported gas by speeding up home-grown renewables and nuclear. Our plan to make sure  million homes well-insulated will save households £ every year on their bills.  And we’ll regulate the market better – pledging to never again let energy companies make promises they can’t keep. When it comes to the energy crisis - as with so much  - the Conservatives have been asleep at the wheel. Labour has a plan that would ease the crisis now. But a Labour government will create the secure energy supply we need for the future too.

A further  of Teach First alumni - who trained to become teachers through their programme but now work outside the profession - have expressed an interest. Teaching unions said the numbers barely scratch the surface and are a drop in the ocean compared to the challenge caused by the Omicron iant.It comes as the Department for Education estimate that one in of teachers and school leaders in England - around , of staff - were absent at the start of term. Meanwhile, some .% of teachers and school leaders were off school due to Covid on January , up from % on December . Responding to a written question, Mr Walker said: As of  January, the spend relating to marketing and communications in support of the national appeal for former teachers toto the profession is £,.. He said the figures broke down to £,. on paid search advertising and £,. for design work for a toolkit of assets to be used by partners of the department. Liberal Democrat Education spokesperson Munira Wilson said: Teacher absences across the country are skyrocketing, yet creating an army of reserves for teachers should have been done  months ago before schools reopened. To see such a small amount of money spent on getting ex-teachers back into the classroom, at a time of crisis, just proves the Education Secretaryaposs heart’s not in it.The DfE published the initial data based on a sample of % of supply agencies - and said the true figure was likely to be much larger.Some volunteers may have approached schools directly which was not captured by the figures. Mr Zahawi said: Making sure all children and young people can attend school or college remains my number one priority. I want to thank all former teachers who have come forward to support the national effort and help keep our children in face-to-face education. I call on all other former teachers who are able to do the same to come forward now. The vaccine continues to help us pave the way out of this pandemic and more than ever it is absolutely vital that all those eligible get their booster or second jab, as well as continuing to test regularly. Shadow Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson said: These figures show the Governmentaposs reliance on the good will of ex-teachers alone is an utterly inadequate answer to staffing shortages, equating to just one additional teacher for every  schools.Geoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders , said he was delighted ex-teachers were coming forward.But he added: The numbers quoted by the government barely scratch the surface of the huge level of staff absence caused by Covid-.This initiative, while well-intentioned, was too little, too late, and the government should put more resources and effort into supporting measures to reduce the risk of transmission such as ventilation and testing. Paul Whiteman, general secretary of school leadersapos union NAHT, said: Unfortunately, the number of former teachers who have ed to classrooms is a drop in the ocean compared to the scale of the challenge faced. The latest government figures show that over , teachers were absent from the workforce in the first week of term.

Hannah Stratton, aged , said sheaposd never lost control of her body after drinking in her le, especially not after a few glasses of wine. One minute I was sitting with my friends talking, and the next minute I had no ability to hold my drink at all, she told the Home Affairs Committee. I just put my head on the side table and I physically couldnapost lt it up. Ms Stratton, from Newquay Cornwall, said she wished the term aposspikingapos would be ditched as it belittles the experience of victims.  I felt overwhelming shame. It was so, so shameful, she told the Home Affairs Committee. “And it sounds really silly – a number of people have said to me: ‘No, no, no, don’t blame yourself, why are you feeling disgusted in yourself ’ But you do. “It takes quite a while to actually switch that around and realise that actually, I’ve got no self-blame or I shouldn’t be blaming myself, but that’s why I didn’t report it.” The -year-old victim was joined by Alexi Skitinis, from south Wales, who was spiked while on a trip to Las Vegas in a nightclub with a colleague. Mr Skitinis told MPs he acknowledged the majority of spiking victims were female but insisted it could happen to anyone at any time.  After he was spiked, he lost control of his hands and ended up in hospital days later with liver and kidney problems. For me, it took away the enjoyment of going out with friends, or planning anything with friends - to be honest with you I didnapost touch alcohol for nearly two years afterwards, he told MPs.University of Nottingham student Zara Owen said she lost her memory after being spiked on a night out and woke up in “horror”.She couldnapost recall ever being taught about spiking incidents at university but said it is a “sadistic” crime that can be committed for “humour”.Ms Stratton said she believes she was drugged “for fun” because the perpetrator would have known there was no way a group of middle-aged women would leave one of their friends alone to be exploited while so vulnerable. Helena Conibear, chief executive of the Alcohol Education Trust, said surveys suggest between % and % of females and % to % of males have been spiked. Dawn Dines, chief executive of the group Stamp Out Spiking, told MPs it is not just alcoholic drinks that get spiked. She gave an example of a -year-old girl who died after drinking from a Lucozade bottle that had been laced with MDMA.Home Secretary Priti Patel asked police for an update on their findings of spiking incidents last October. There has not been an update since.Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Priti PatelBoris JohnsonHospitalsCrimePolitics\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

No tousling of the blond barnet, no words of Greek or absurd chat about Peppa Pig or even starting World War Three will get the great charlatan off the giant hook heaposs impaled on.Because heaposs discovered the hard way that an unprincipled politician can fool some of the people all of the time, and all of the people some of the time, but they canapost fool all of the people all of the time. And voters taken for fools want revenge, a head on a silver platter, when they realise there were taken for fools... and the head they want is Johnsonaposs. Hiding the truth about parties then trying to hide behind Sue Grayaposs inquiry is both self-destructive and cowardly.Self-destructive when lies and cover-ups ignore the old advice to stop digging when in a hole.Had Johnson half-admitted and apologised for partying when the first bashes were revealed last month, the controversy might, just might, be over. Accepting short-term pain produces long-term gain. Instead heaposs buried himself by leaping into the cab of a JCB and enlarging that hole into a cavern swallowing him up. And cowardly when Johnson frantically twists, contorts and deceives to avoid uncomfortable truths. There arenapost enough hours in the day for him to apologise personally to everybody who couldnapost say goodbye to a loved one or attend a funeral to follow the rules the ruler imposed then ignored.Angry Conservative MPs on the end of hostility from voters know the only way to staunch the party charges is to axe the host, an election-winning leader in  transformed into a liability in  and probably  and .Attempting to legitimise sleaze, defending Owen Paterson, followed by the mishandling of responses to endless parties illustrate the poor judgement of a Johnson who always acted asrules were for little folk inferior to him.Those MPs fear in the Year of the Squeeze, tax rises and soaring energy prices consuming living standards, the British electorate will not forget or forgive the carouser-in-chiefaposs partying and lies.Demanding sacrices from the public then running Whitehall as party central will be Johnsonaposs undoing.He deserves to be kicked out of the saloon for , Covid deaths, a disastrous Brexit or  other crimes.And what a delicious irony his old mucker Dominic Cummings, a Brexit co-conspirator, is orchestrating the campaign to topple him. When heaposs crying into his beer, Johnson will still be blaming everybody . Infamy! Infamy! Theyaposve all got it in for me! Lies have a habit of catching up with liars. Johnson has nobody left to lie to when an entire nation recognises heaposs incapable of telling the truth.

Image: UK Press via Getty ImagesByAbigail OLearyNews Reporter:,  Jan The Royal Family have remained silent after Prince Andrew failed in his bid to dismiss a sex case brought against him. Prince Andrew is being sued by a victim of paedophile billionaire Jeffrey Epstein, who alleges he had sex with her three times after being trafficked at . Virginia Giuffre claims she was introduced to the royal by the now-deceased Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell, who was convicted of sex offences herself in December. After a judge ruled the case could proceed despite Andrewaposs objections, the Royal family issued only a brief statement through Buckingham Palace saying: We would not comment on what is an ongoing legal matter.’’ In a statement today, Virginia Giuffre’s lawyer David Boies said: Virginia Giuffre is pleased that Prince Andrewaposs efforts to avoid a trial have been rejected and that evidence will now be taken on her claims against him. She looks forward to a judicial determination of the merits of those claims.  Ms Giuffre began a legal battle against Prince Andrew in the US on August , , accusing him of sexually abusing her at Jeffrey Epstein’s mansion when she was , a minor under US law. The royal has vehemently denied the allegations. In court documents, Ms Giuffre alleged the duke sexually assaulted her on three occasions causing her signicant emotional and psychological distress and harm. In a  BBC interview, Ms Giuffre claimed that she was introduced to Prince Andrew by Epstein and Maxwell. The -year-old recounted that was told by Maxwell that she had to do for Andrew what I do for Jeffrey.  Mum-of-three Ms Giuffre filed the lawsuit on August , just five days before the window closed. In her lawsuit, she says of the royal: Prince Andrewaposs actions constitute sexual offences as defined in New York Penal Law Article , including but not limited to sexual misconduct as defined in Article ., rape in the third degree as defined in Article ., rape in the first degree as defined in Article .. According to Ms Giuffreaposs allegations, she had sex with the duke for the first time at Maxwellaposs house in Belgravia in .  She alleged that the second time was at Epsteinaposs mansion in New York, and the third at Epsteinaposs private island, Little St James, in the US Virgin Islands. Ms Giuffre also claimed in the court documents that she was forced into sex by explicit or implicit threats by Epstein, Maxwell, and or Prince Andrew, stating that the duke knew her age and that she was a sex-trafficking victim. She is filing the case under New Yorkaposs Child Victims Act, which allows survivors of childhood sexual abuse to pursue a case which otherwise would have been barred because too much time had passed.Follow MirrorFacebookTwitterMORE ON Ghislaine MaxwellPrince Andrew, Duke of YorkRoyal FamilyBillionaires\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily royal round-up direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The Times reports that ministers could agree the shorter period on Thursday and that there is consensus about the need to introduce it. A Government source told the outlet: With the epidemiology going in the right direction, the merits are becoming clearer.  Any move would be imminent The Sun also reported, with a source saying: “A decision is imminent and the mood music is very much towards cutting self-isolation and allowing more people back to work.” In the Commons, Simon Fell MP said that up to % of staff at his local hospital trust were isolating. He said: So with that in mind will my right honourable friend consider reducing the self-isolation period,it is seen to be safe to do so, down to five days and also accepting any MACArequests which come through to help get people back out into the community and into social care. Mr Johnson said: Yes, we are certainly looking at reducing the isolation period. I hope to bring you more about that as fast as possible. We will certainly look at all MACA requests. But more fundamentally what we can do to alleviate the pressures in his hospital is to fix the health and social care ide which is what this government is also doing after a generation of neglect.  The UK Health Security Agency has submitted data to the government which shows around % of people leaving quarantine after seven days are still infectious and that number would go up to %the quarantine period is reduced to five days, it is reported. Absences among teaching staff are also causing chaos in education and schools minister Robin Walker said he would back a five day isolationthe science supported it. The Department for Education has estimated that .% of teachers and school leaders in England - around , of staff - were absent at the start of term last week. When asked whether schools would remain open for the remainder of the year, Mr Walker told MPs: This is an absolute priority for us. He added: We want to do everything we can to support schools to remain open. We have seen, of course, huge challenges and Iaposm extremely grateful to school leaders and teachers for the immense amount of work that they put in to keep schools open.

Mohammed Yaqub Malik, , said he “lost control” when he killed Ishrat Ahmed and seriously injured her husband, Afaq Ahmed - the parents of his former son-in-law Wasim Ahmed.The jury at Preston Crown Court heard healthcare worker Malik was ‘seriously provoked’ by Wasim in the days leading up to the attacks in July , reported Lancs Live.During the trial the court was told Wasim had married Malikaposs daughter, Fatima, against the wishes of her family and that the marriage turned sour. Earlier in the day the family had called Lancashire Police as Wasim had allegedly posted ‘sexual material’ online about their daughter, amid other accusations. Earlier in the terial Peter Storrie QC, prosecuting, said: It is his explanation he should be excused some of what he did because of Wasim Ahmed.  It is a powerful motivation for what he did. Because of Wasim Ahmed he lost his temper and because of Wasim Ahmed he sought to do harm to Wasimaposs parents. He despised Wasim Ahmed and he wanted to avenge the humiliation he had heaped upon him. Malik left his home at around pm, picking up an axe from their garden, and drove to the Ahmeds’ home to confront his former son-in-law. When Ishrat opened the door he swung the axe, penetrating her skull and killing her, before swinging it at her husband, causing serious brain injuries. Following the attack, Malik, a healthcare worker, got back into his car and drove home, stopping to ask a pedestrianthey knew where Wasim Ahmed was, Tim Storrie QC told the court. The witness described Malik as covered in blood with the murder weapon in full view in his car.  He was later found at his home in bloodied sandals and admitted attacking them, but denied murder. Malik earlier admitted manslaughter and denied murder and attempted murder. The jury found Malik not guilty of murder and attempted murder.

Noel also shared an image of him and we Sue with their son Sue waved a pride flag in the background.The -year-old bravely opened up about his sexuality during episode two of the reality series, and mum Sue, , was also supportive of her son’s news.She said she she was ‘so incredibly proud’ of Luke, and confessed she already knew he was gay. “It is an emotional and strong episode, but I think it will help others going through the same thing with their parents,” she told The Sun.“When he told me, I told him I already knew. As a mum you just know, but you can’t force them to come out. I am very proud of him for doing this,” Sue added. Last year, Luke announced her was bisexual in an emotional post on social media, and said he had been coming to terms with who I am’ since he was . “I’m bisexual. That’s me. My core. The part that makes mythe way I do. This post will help me push myself to be more comfortable with who I am and hopefully get me to where I need to go mentally,” he wrote, as he fired back at online bullies. “To all those who support us I can’t thank you enough and to all those who look down on us, I wish your ignorance clears soon,” Luke stated. The mother-son duo attended Luke’s first-ever Pride parade in August, and he shared touching snaps of Sue wearing a T-shirt with the words ‘love is love’ as she held a giant flag.  “Felt Welcome. Felt Accepted. Felt Right,” Luke wrote. Recently, the family have been sharing more details of their busy lives on their Channel  show,  and Counting. In the latest episode, they were given the shocking news Noel was a high risk for a heart attack or stroke. Sharing an update on their upcoming Channel  show, Noel said he decided to go to the doctor after struggling while running. He says: I run a few hundred yards and I’m knackered and out of breath. It just doesn’t seem right.  “I don’t want to keel over and drop down dead on the pavement.”Noel is then given the news that while his BMI was normal, his blood pressure was high and he was at risk of a stroke or heart attack due to higher cholesterol.He was told he needed to change his lestyle and diet habits to healthier options as opposed to takeaways. Noel says: “It’s not what you want to hear is it, I was surprised that I was on the high risk. We Sue then continues to say Noel is the main provider of the family and works really really hard for us before their -year-old son Max says: “I don’t want his [Noel’s] cholesterol to sky rocket and him have a heart attack, it wouldn’t be too good, because he could die.  “Frankly I don’t want my dad to die, summed up.” In the opening episode of series two of their Channel  show,  Kids and Counting, the Radfords debated whether they should have baby number  - but decided against it in the end. Asking all the family to join them in the living room, the kids predicted there was a big announcement ahead. Noel shared with his huge family: Right kids, we’ve got you all in here because we’ve heard the rumours going around the house. You’re all sort of thinking me and mum are going to have another baby, so we’re going to put the record straight.  He added: Mum and me have both decided no more. We’re done, there’s no more babies, no more brothers and sisters for you lot, we’re happy with what we’ve got. Little Heidi is the last of the bunch, the last of the Radford clan. However, their kids were less convinced they would stick to their word. One of their older sons replied: You’ve said this multiple times, that this would be your last one.

The move from the UKaposs third-biggest gas and electricity supplier comes as part of a restructure to save costs amid crisis in the industry, it is understood.Sky News said Ovo may announce the plans as soon as today.Reports said about , out of , roles are expected to be cut as part of a voluntary redundancy programme. A source said the announcement would be include a commitment to increase minimum pay across the company to £ an hour. It would also include plans to reshore all customer-facing jobs to the UK, with a new academy to open in Glasgow, reports said. Plans reportedly involve closure of a number of sites as part of a consolidation to three locations in London, Bristol and Glasgow.Ovo declined to comment when contacted by The Mirror.This comes after the boss of Ovo Energy said his company made a mistake by telling customers they can keep warm by eating lentils as gas bills look set to soar. Stephen Fitzpatrick said the advice from SSE Energy Services, which is owned by Ovo, was unhelpful and upsetting.Speaking on BBC Breakfast, he said: Iaposm glad you brought that up because this is one of the reasons I wanted to come on the show and explain just what a big mistake that was, and how embarrassed I was to find out that this was something our company had sent out. Itaposs a ridiculous piece of advice. It was something that was really stupid. It should never have been written, it should never have been sent, and we should have caught it. About half an hour after we found out that it had been sent out, we retracted it, we made a big apology. And clearly for all the customers that we know are worried about paying, this kind of message is just deeply unhelpful and even upsetting and I apologise. It was a bad day, we made a mistake, and weaposve tried to put it right as soon as possible. Other advice included wearing a fleece and thick socks, keeping active, and eating whole grains and ginger - but avoiding chilli, which makes you sweat. Customers were also told they could open their oven doors after cooking to let the heat into the house, cuddle up to pets or loved ones, open curtains to let in sunlight, and patch up cracks and crevices where heat might be escaping.  During the same interview, Mr Fitzpatrick also called for the Government to cut green levies and social costs on energy bills, and instead raise the money through normal taxes. Itaposs important to note that consumers will need to pay the real price of energy, he said. But what we have in our energy bills todaynot only VAT, but also a whole bunch of environmental and social costs that the poorest in our society are paying the highest proportion towards. We think these should be paid through general taxation. Thereaposs a wide consensus across the industry that the energy charges that go on everybodyaposs bills are really regressive. They lead to the poorest paying the most.  If we paid for them through general taxation, we could ensure the wealthiest in society shoulder the biggest burden. Itaposs something that the Government could do today. We think thereaposs an announcement coming, but so far - five months into this crisis - we havenapost seen anything. On the same show, Chris OaposShea, who leads British Gasaposs owner Centrica, warned that high gas prices could stick around for at least  months to two years. Gas is a big transition fuel, so as you turn off coal-fired power stations in other countries, maybe thereaposs more demand for gas, he said. Over the long run you do get more balance in the system, but there isnapost an abundance of gas that you can just turn on quickly. So I canapost say that this will be done in six months, in nine months, in a year. I can simply look at what the market says at the moment, and the market suggests that high gas prices will be here for the next  months to two years.

But as Kate and husband William rise up the line of succession there is a change the Duchess will get a new title.When Prince Charles becomes King, William will become the heir to the throne and will probably take on the title The Prince of Wales.It is not a given that William will get the title, as it has to be bestowed upon the heir by the monarch. However, experts predict it is more than likely that Charles will pass on his title to William. If this happens, Kate would automatically become the Princess of Wales. The last person to hold this title was, of course, Williamaposs late mother Princess Diana. Charlesaposs second we, Camilla, decided against using the title out of respect for Diana.And according to a source,and when this is to happen, it would be an emotional moment for William.They told the: I’m sure it’ll be a bit of a bittersweet moment.

Most famously, Kate wears Dianaaposs diamond and sapphire engagement ring.Meanwhile, in two of her th birthday portraits, Kate also wears a pair of gorgeous pearl and diamond drop earrings that once belonged to Diana.Photographer Paolo Roversi, who snapped the portraits, said: Taking the portrait of Her Royal Highness, The Duchess of Cambridge, was a true honour for me, and a moment of pure joy. “I was moved by her warmth and friendly welcome and enchanted by her shining eyes that reflected the loveliness of her soul and her smile showing the generosity of her heart. “It was a profound and rich experience for me, an unforgettable moment. I have met a wonderful person, a person who, with her positive energy, can bring hope to the whole world.” The photos, part of the National Portrait Gallery’s Coming Home exhibition, will go on display in Berkshire, where Kate grew up, St Andrews, where she met Prince William, and Anglesey, their first marital home.

Pupils at Bishop Heber in Malpas, Cheshire, can only wear a costly branded school jacket on school grounds. Photos taken by furious parents show staff milling around outside in warm overcoats while some children are just in jumpers, Cheshire Live reports.One mum said her asthmatic son was put into isolation for retrieving his confiscated coat because he was cold. The school says it believeschildren were allowed to wear their own coats, it would erode the great relationships we have with the students, because they might end up wearing hoodies. The schoolaposs policies have been slammed by Cheshire MP Mike Amesbury, who is currently pushing a Bill to make sure parents are not being saddled with hefty bills for branded unorms.Do you agree with the schoolaposs unorm policy  Have your say in the comments section below Parents have also complained about the cost and quality of the branded windcheater which costs £. One parent who has bought the branded school anorak said it was not sufficient to keep her children warm. She said: They would literally have to have a branded polo, branded sweater, branded fleece and branded anorak in order to be warm and dry outside. Given Mike Amesburyaposs law, that is extremely excessive branding - and Iaposve never heard of another school having a branded outside coat before now. Those four items would set parents back by £., ignoring the need for multiple purchases sensible for some items. An angry mum added: “They confiscated his [my sonaposs] coat yesterday - outside - which I thought was absolutely ludicrous. He has asthma, which he is on constant medication for, so getting cold does him no good whatsoever. Because he went and got his coat back because he was cold, he has been put into isolation, that was his punishment. “Why would you take a coat off a child when you know they’ve got asthma   She continued: “Kids should not be worried about getting into trouble for keeping warm. It’s just nonsensical. When they’re going into a warm classroom it’s totally dferent, but when you’re going into a classroom with the doors and windows open, you soon get cold when you’re sitting down. “At some point, common sense has to prevail. These kids should not have to be cold.” Another mum said: “It was bitterly cold, freezing all day, and his hands were so cold that he couldn’t hold his pen in English. When he came out of school he was absolutely frozen. “These children are freezing outside, then they’re going into a classroom with the windows all open - they need to be warm. If we’ve got to have this rule,that’s what the headteacher wants, then please can he ditch his padded coat and can the teachers lead by example by all standing outside without their coats on  Because I think that would set a good example for the children. She added: “These children have a right to be warm. Another mum said: Some of the policies of the school are absolutely archaic. A lot of parents have been asking why their children have been put into isolation, and they’ve not really received any answers from the school.  Whether it’s raining, sleet or snow,it’s really Baltic cold, they’re not allowed to wear their jackets. Teachers will go up to them in the yard and tell them to get their coats off. They’re preaching about what an amazing school they are, but they’re not treating pupils with respect. A fourth parent added they felt Bishop Heber is more akin to a Victorian workhouse than a school. In an email to the parents of Year  students, head teacher David Curry explained the rationale behind the coat ban. He said he was aware that there’s been some discourse on social media about coats and why students cannot wear their own in school The email reads: I’d like to take this opportunity to state that students are allowed to wear coats to and from school as some have long journeys and have to wait for parents and or buses in the morning afternoon. However, once they arrive at school after registration period, we expect that an undergarmentalong with a school polo shirt, jumper, fleece and optional jacketwould be sufficient to keep them warm and conversely allow them to take layers off when in warmer classrooms. In essence, the four five layers of clothing we suggest should be more than ample to ask them to go out at break to get a blast of fresh air and withstand almost all weathers. We are fortunate at Heber that students almost always understand this and so usually it works really well. If we allowed non-unorm coats, we believe strongly that it would erode the great relationships we have with the students day to day as inevitably students would push the boundaries and wear hoodies and other coatsthat undermines the high standards we have. More importantly, I also believe that it would become a status issue for us and possibly make some students feel vulnerable. Many of the most expensive coatsand wearing owning the ‘right’ coat could become the motive rather than its thermal properties which I feel, could undermine what we stand for as a comprehensive school and put pressure on students in school and families to conform to a set of norms expectations that aren’t healthy, marginalising some students and putting at risk that sense of belonging which we work so hard to achieve at Heber. I hope our rationale makes sense and that our drive to ensure every child can be the best they can be is central to the decision. An Act of Parliament designed to reduce exorbitant school unorm costs was passed this year, and is set to come into force from this September. The Bill was introduced and championed by Mr Amesbury, MP for Weaver Vale and Shadow Local Government Minister. He said: “The reason I championed this cause was because too many children, families and carers were facing the strain of increased, prohibitive costs in terms of school unorms up and down the country, particularly around branded items of clothing. “Schooling should [be] about a child’s ability to do not their family’s ability to pay. “What is being reported by parents is clearly against the spirit of the Act. To hear about coats being confiscated in the middle of winter because they are deemed non-compliant with unorm policy, is plainly ridiculous. I agree with the principle of school unorm but would encourage Bishop Heber to get ahead of the game by adopting a more reasonable approach in its policy, with greater emphasis on affordability and less emphasis on insisting on every item must incorporate school branding.” Cheshire West and Chester Council and Ofsted both said that they do not have a policy on school unorm, and so could not comment on this case.

However, despite being much milder than iants like Delta, the new iant shares a similarity with other coronavirus strains. It can cause long Covid symptoms in many peopleWhile some people remain completely unaffected after recovering from Covid, others who have been infected have been dealing with side effects or health issues, for months after they’ve recovered from the virus itself. These long-term symptoms can be both physical or emotional. Hereaposs your full list and a few ways to relieve some of the issues. Physical symptoms of long-Covid  While people generally tend to test negative for Covid after  days of having the virus, there are a proportion of people who are left with long-term dficulties following the illness.The severity of these symptoms ies, but many have spoken out about how le-changing the virusapos longer-lasting effects can be.Many recovering Covid patients have reported experiencing the following long-lasting physical problems:muscle weakness and joint stfness extreme tirednessand a lack of energy reduced mobility breathlessness phlegm build-up weaker physical fitness loss of appetite and weight loss lack of sense of smell or taste stomach problems - this includes heartburn, diarrhoea and vomiting dficulties swallowingMental and emotional symptoms of long-Covid  While physical struggles of long-Covid can be tough to live with, mental and emotional effects of the virus can also be debilitating to sufferers.

He now goes out three times a week in good weather, in Bellahouston Park, near Ibrox, GlasgowDon Morton took up his new hobby during lockdown Image: Katielee Arrowsmith SWNSByHamish Morrison:,  Jan | comments A grandad who took up skateboarding aged  insists age is no limit - but has ruled out trying halfpipes.Grandfather-of-two Don Morton took up his new hobby in September after previously being a passionate skier and rollerblader, which he took up aged nearly . He taught rollerblading at Glasgow Caledonian University’sArc Sport Hall and only gave it up last year because he felt too old to be an instructor. Don, a former businessman, from Newton Mearns, East Renfrewshire, got into rollerblading when he retired and wanted a hobby he could do year-round because the ski season is so short.His friend Colin Dalgliesh, , a technician at GCU took him out for his first try on a skateboard in September, and now goes out three times a week in good weather, in Bellahouston Park, near Ibrox, Glasgow.He does not wear a helmet and only wears wrist guards on his board because he is not worried about hurting himselfhe falls off and said he is living proof age isn’t a barrier.  Dad-of-one Don said: “I am the living proof at my age that age is not a barrier to doing it. It’s good to try something a bit dferent - it’s a barrier we have to break down a bit. “There is no reason to not take it up - older people can have a very fun time just going on the pathways. I’m in the process of building up speed. “I go out every week, in the summertime maybe two or three times a week. I’ve only been doing this for a few months. “I am not a skatepark boarder, I’m too old to go down and do that kind of stuff. The skatepark is for younger people not for me. “It’s far too physical for me - you don’t expect an -year-old to be doing halfpipes, ramps and bowls. “I’m not attempting to do anything reckless. I’ve been rollerblading for more than  years. “I’ve been a skier and when I retired, I had more time and skiing has such a short season so I was looking for something I could do all year round. “So I thought skiing and skating are vaguely similar so I’ll try skating and see how I get on.”  Having a friend to give him hints and tips on how to improve has got Don up to speed. He added: “I got into this because I met Colin, who is a letime skateboarder. I’d always had a fancy to try. “Starting off, it’s quite tricky and it’s not something you can do immediately. All these types of sports, skating, skateboarding, you have to practice it to be able to do it. “Before skateboarding I did rollerblading, and Colin came to the track and that’s how it all started.” Don’s interest in rollerblading took him down to London at the Millennium as it had not proved so popular in Glasgow, and he then became an instructor - despite being . He said: “This was around the turn of the century, and at that point, there was no skating activity in Glasgow so I had to go down to London to find out about it. “People kept asking me about it and how do you get into skating and that encouraged me to take certication to be an instructor to teach people to skate. “You don’t go to get a skating lesson and expect the instructor to be  years of age so it was time to give that up, so again, I found myself looking for something extra to do. “It wasn’t such a big step to transfer to go from skating to skateboarding. I gave up instructing in the last year, there is a time when you have to retire. “I’ve not given up skating just the instruction side. The public’s perception of skateboarding is when you get to , you don’t do it anymore. “If I asked any adult over the age of they would like to try skateboarding they’d say ‘I could never do that’. “They might fear they would make a fool of themselves and people over-worry about falling. But anyone who wanted to do it would be able to do it. “It’s fun, it’s pleasurable, it’s recreational and it’s not demanding physically. It’s invigorating and it tones you up. “I’ve had a couple of falls, but I know that from my skating experience there is no way you’re not going to fall. They are inevitable. I just wear my normal clothing and wrist protectors. “I’m not worried because I’m not challenging myself the way younger people are.” Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON SkateboardingSkiingPensionerDaily Mirror,callToAction:ltpgtGet weekly highlights from Mirror editor Alison Phillips direct to your emaillt pgt,buttonText:,contentId:,newsletterImage:https:i-prod.mirror article.ece ALTERNATES sd _AlisonHeaderFinal.png,endpointUrl:https:response.pure interface list.php,profile:Reach_Mirror,isPureNewsLetter:true,pureMailingListId:Mirror - Alisons Newsletter,isDoubleOptIn:,newsletterSiteName:Mirror\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get weekly highlights from Mirror editor Alison Phillips direct to your emailInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Jasmine Johnson, who lives in Grange Court, Southwick in West Sussex, has to carry her disabled daughter, who is five, down four flights of stairs whenever she needs to go out.And Ms Johnson, , said it will get even harder after she has her baby, which is due in around eight weeks, reports Sussex Live.I feel like I’ve been stuck in my home for three months, Ms Johnson said. Jasmine, along with -year-old Terry Healey, expressed their disgust at Adur District Council back in November after the Grange Court lt had not been fixed for four weeks.  Although the lt was eventually fixed a few days later, the call button remains broken on the second floor which means Jasmine has been unable to use it She told SussexLive: I can’t call the lt down so I can’t get the wheelchair out. I’m expecting in eight weeks so the baby could come at any time.The fear for me now is thatI have to get a C-section - like I did with my last pregnancy - I won’t be able to leave the house because I won’t be able to carry anything downstairs.I felt like I’m stuck in my home ever since the lt first broke three months ago.  This has made me really anxious, I could go into labour right now.As a result of complaints surrounding the lt, along with mould and cramped living conditions, numerous Grange Court residents claim they were told by a housing officer that their homes are unsuitable to live in.Therefore, they would be made a priority to bid for new homes. However, when the residents found on the housing system that they had not been made a priority for bidding, a council representative said they had misunderstood what was said. Many feel they are being fobbed off by Adur District Council, who are trying to back down from what they offered. Jasmine, who is among these select residents, says the council has given her  hope. She continued: They promised us that these properties were going to be on there After trying to contact the housing officer for weeks, I finally got through to the person above them. The council said they could give me a management transfer, but this means I could be rehomed in any area and wouldn’t be able to turn it down. This is not suitable for me a still have to get my daughter to school, and I need to be near my parents in Shoreham. My dad has been in intensive care for a month and is due to come home soon. I can’t just be plopped anywhere because I don’t drive. I’ve just been given  hope as they said I would be moved within six months. A spokesperson for Adur District Council said: Adur Homes has been in touch with residents living in Grange Court to provide the relevant help and support. Residents are not being moved out of their properties but have been advised that their housing needs will be reassessed where appropriate.

In a statement, Ms Giuffre’s lawyer David Boies said: Virginia Giuffre is pleased that Prince Andrewaposs efforts to avoid a trial have been rejected and that evidence will now be taken on her claims against him. She looks forward to a judicial determination of the merits of those claims. Judge Lewis Kaplan today ordered a trial over Virginia Giuffreaposs claims that the Duke of York abused her when she was trafficked by paedophile financier Jeffrey Epstein. Andrewaposs legal team had argued that the case should be dismissed. Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell, who was convicted of child sex trafficking crimes last month, forced the then -year-old into having sex with Andrew, Ms Giuffre claims. The royal has vehemently denied the allegations. The bombshell ruling comes after a secret -page arrangement between Giuffre and Jeffrey Epstein was made public.The document - signed in  - stated Ms Giuffre agreed not to sue anyone connected to the disgraced financier and inshe received a ,payout. The royalaposs legal team argued the document shielded him from claims by Ms Giuffre and the civil case against him should be thrown out without trial. US District Judge Lewis Kaplan made his ruling after a video conference hearing with representatives for the Queenaposs son. The prince was not present.  Outlining his reasons for denying the Duke of Yorkaposs motion to dismiss the civil case against him, the judge said an agreement in the civil settlement between Epstein and Ms Giuffre cannot be said to benefit him.

The image shows the eight-year-old alongside Prince Charles, the Queen and Prince William and was released at the start of  to mark the new decade.Not long after its release, Meghan and Harry made the bombshell announcement that they were stepping down as senior royals. Royal commentator Neil Sean had suggested on his YouTube channel that while that photo had made the Duke and Duchess of Sussex consider their position, it wasnapost what caused them to step back. Neil observed that it showed a new, streamlined monarchy.  He said: “We have Prince Charles, Prince George, and of course Her Majesty the Queen. And this was going to be showing, alongside William, where the next phase is. “Well, of course,you look at the picture, it makes perfect sense. Obviously, that is the next line-up.” However, the royal commentator claimed the Duke and Duchess of Sussexaposs plans to step down had been in the works long before the pictureaposs release.  He suggested: Harry and Meghan had decided more or less within the first few months of meeting that they could have a dferent le,” he suggested. “It wasn’t exactly mapped out word for word, what we’ve ended up with, but certainly for Prince Harry, he wanted to have a dferent role in his le. “We’d seen that already with him trying to branch out within the military, and of course, alongside Kate and William, he started those mental health charities.”  Even though he suggested the picture was not the final try he still claims it must have been a wake-up call for the couple. He said: I do believe that it could have been something of a wake-up call to realise that perhaps he and Meghan would never really truly be the superstars of the British monarchy. “That’s not to say that they don’t garner as much more interest than other senior members of the British monarchy, but sometimes it can be the wrong interest.” It comes as Prince William and Kate Middleton are said to have accepted their aposbrokenapos relationship with Prince Harry and Meghan Markle. This report comes after the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, alongside other members of the royal family, celebrated Kateaposs th birthday over the weekend. Andrew Neil, former chair of GB News, spoke to Channel  documentary, ‘: The Queen’s Terrible Year’, revealing that Kate and William are “reconciled” to the “broken” relationship with Harry, reports the Daily Record.

Pendle Inn, in Barley, is a village pub at the foot of Pendle Hill surrounded by picturesque village views and is rated the top eatery in the area, with . stars from  reviews. It is used to good comments with  of Pendle Innaposs reviews rating the pub as aposexcellentapos with several guests calling it a great pub with a friendly atmosphere.But one guest has left a scathing review calling the experience shambolic reported LancsLive.  They say: Well where do I start, my family and I came here on Christmas Day and it was the most shambolic experience I’ve ever had at a meal. I’m surprised there are not more terrible reviews given that half the tables there left before dessert and many were asking for refunds. At £ a head you’d expect good food and good service, the food was good, but the service was so disorganised. Some people didn’t even have tables when they arrived. Each course took around an hour or more to be served and cleared. A four course meal took four and a quarter hours. People were starving and complaining. The upper level staff seemed very dismissive of this fact and did not have any answers when it came to people leaving and wanted refunds, their comments were along the lines of aposwe weren’t expecting it to be so busyapos, which begs the question, why take on more than you can handle  Why was there no organisation at all  They added: Safe to say, we won’t be ing! The general manager of the pub, Stuart, took the criticism on the chin, responding just a few hours later. Thank you for taking the time to review your visit to us and on this occasion we are disappointed it isnapost a more positive one, he said. First thing I would like to do is apologise for the experience you had to which we offer our sincere apologies for as we accept it wasnapost good enough. The Mirroraposs newsletter brings you the latest news, exciting showbiz and TV stories, sport updates and essential political information.The newsletter is emailed out first thing every morning, at noon and every evening. Never miss a moment by signing up to our newsletter here.  Stuart continued: I would however like to thank the staff for there efforts at least, which didnapost get mentioned by anybody on the day as they had all given up their Christmas Day with their families to try and offer you all a good service. We accept we had taken too many bookings and that things took way longer than they should have done. We were unfortunately five members of staff down on this day due to a mixture of illness and COVID so that massively took its toll on our team but instead of cancelling the day which would have been the easiest option we decided to go ahead with it and give it our best shot. Stuart added that the Pendle Inn holds its hands up when it fall shorts. He said: We will always hold our hands on when we fall short and on this day we fell short of our own high standards and to that we cant apologise to people enough. The people in the senior roles run services like this every weekend, so I still believe they are the right people for the jobs it was just the simple fact they were understaffed throughout the team on this day. Once again I hope this wont put you off coming back to us in the future, as you mentioned at the top of the piece that the food was good so that is one crumb of positivity we can take moving forward. Please accept our apologies for this experience. Best Wishes, Stuart and the team. Other recent posts have been far more positive.Just last Thursdayone guest, user XOIjasonw , reviewed the pub saying it is a great pub with great beers and food and great staff.They wrote: The food was excellent and well presented I canapost fault it. The staff where very friendly and helpful. I shall definitely recommend The Pendle Inn to family and friends.

Aimee Wilkinson, , from Leeds, recently bought her first property, a two-bedroom flat, and has been looking into ways that she can cut costs to redecorate it. She estimates it will cost her £, but the canny shopper will cover this by selling items, cutting spending and making savings on her bills while getting maximum value on everything she buys.Aimee - who lives alone - has already done extensive research into how she can save money over the next year, reported LeedsLive.She is taking advantage of moving to a new home by giving her bills a total overhaul and is switching to Plusnet’s £. fibre broadband, saving her £ a year compared with her previous supplier. From universal credit to furlough, employment rights, travel updates and emergency financial aid - weaposve got all of the big financial stories you need to know about right now.  to our Mirror Money newsletter here.  She said: “Saving £ a month might not seem like a lot to some people, but that adds up to over £ a year. If someone added that on to your bills you’d notice. “But value to me means small changes that add up. It’s also about getting value from what you pay for. As well as my day job I also run a fashion blog, so having reliable broadband isn’t a choice for me - it’s a necessity. Aimee said she had a lot of problems with her old broadband provider so switching was a no-brainer”. She has also listened to tips from family and friends on how to save cash which has given her the confidence to hunt down bargains. She said: “My dad has always brought us up to understand the value of money and doing the research to make sure you’re getting a good deal. “For every service I need or item I buy, I really research the market to death – comparison sites are a great starting point, but I also look for other reviews online, news articles, checking out the company’s social media. I like to make sure I know as much as possible before making a final decision.” On top of researching her contracts and big ticket purchases, Aimee plans what she is going to buy to make sure she stays on top of her budget. She said: “I write out lists on my phone of everything I’m going to buy and look at how I can spread it out over time. Planning purchases helps me to not buy things on impulse – I try to find the best prices I can by finding discount codes and looking out for deals from smaller retailers and waiting for sales. Aimee’s other main saver is to sell on items she doesn’t need or use any more. This earns her around £, per year. “I have a pile of stuff that I need to sell on, cleared out from when I was renting. I make almost £ in a month on re-selling,” said Aimee. Overall, she has cut her grocery bill by £ a month, and will save around £ a month by getting rid of some subscriptions she doesn’t use as much as others - like a beauty product subscription, and paid apps. Aimee’s biggest save for refurbishing the flat has been to do some of the work herself with help from friends and family.

Just % of English rivers are recognised as having healthy ecologiesHigh levels of toxins such as phosphorus and nitrogen have been found in rivers Image: Manchester Evening NewsByNada FarhoudEnvironment editor:,  Jan | comments A vile “cocktail” of sewage, slurry and plastic polluting our rivers is putting public health and nature at risk, a government committee has warned.A probe by the Environmental Audit Committee found that poor water quality in England was a result of chronic under-investment. It also “uncovered multiple failures in the monitoring, governance and enforcement on water quality”. High levels of toxins such as phosphorus and nitrogen, from sewage and animal waste, are “choking rivers” and “suffocating fish and plants”. Members called for more enforcement against polluters and a public awareness campaign.The Tories voted against tighter sewage dumping restrictions last year. Committee chairman Philip Dunne MP said: “Our inquiry has uncovered multiple failures in the monitoring, governance and enforcement on water quality. The Government, regulators and the water industry have allowed a Victorian sewerage system to buckle under increasing pressure. “Monitoring regimes need to be reviewed, enforcement needs to be ramped up and public awareness needs boosting on what can and cannot be flushed down the toilet. “So many emerging pollutants are being missed by inadequate monitoring, and court actions against polluters have fallen dramatically.” Under a European court ruling, firms can release rainwater and untreated sewage into our waterways in “exceptional” circumstances. But sewage pollution was pumped into rivers and seas for over .million hours in  alone, in what campaigners call “routine releases”. Just % of English rivers are recognised as having healthy ecologies, with waste from agriculture, roads and plastics adding to the problem. Not one has received a clean bill of health for chemical contamination. But the committee said it struggled to get a complete overview of the scale of the issue partly due to budget cuts to the Environment Agency. Hugo Tagholm, of Surfers Against Sewage, said sewer overflows were now “pollution superhighways spewing a damaging cocktail of pathogens, chemicals, and microplastics into sensitive habitats and the blue spaces that people are using more and more”.

The Met Office has now issued a yellow weather warning for fog for a swathe of southern England and the West Midlands which is in place until am. The forecaster said those in the affected regions should prepare for the possibility of travel disruption this morning. Slower journey times as well as delays to bus and train services, together with aposdficult driving conditionsapos and aposrapid changes to visibilityapos have all been predicted. There is also a chance of delays or cancellations to flights because of the conditions.  The forecaster said: Areas of fog have formed in low lying areas over southern England and northwards into parts of the West Midlands. These are likely to be dense in places with the visibility falling to less than  m. Fog will gradually lt and clear through the morning though a few small patches may persist into the afternoon. It comes after temperatures reached the mid teens in eastern Scotland on Wednesday and it is set to be a similar outlook for the coming days with some bright skies in the north. It will also be bitterly cold in the south from Thursday with the fog becoming particularly thick on Friday.  BBCweather forecaster Louise Lear predicted temperatures dropping to -C on Thursday as weather maps show icy blue across the lower half of the UK.She said: High pressure still with us, a south westerly wind feeding clouds and a little bit of drizzle in the far north and west but under those clearer skies and very light winds we are going to see frost and fog forming once again so temperatures potentially down as low as -C in a few rural parts. The exceptionis the far north of Scotland and so yes it will be frosty but also it will be foggy particularly for parts of England and Wales. Some of the fog dense in places and it may well take most of the morning before it slowly lts into low cloud and hopefully disperses so a pretty miserable start but hopefully improving later on.  At the same time in Scotland there could be double figures for the temperature although in the far north there will be strong winds in excess of mph. On Friday the high pressure will remain and there will be even more fog and in parts the temperature may never rise above zero centigrade all day, said Ms Lear. She added: Fog can be more extensive on Friday and as a result it could be slow to clear andthat happens then one or two places may not find themselves climbing out of freezing. UK Weather Forecast Today: Fog patches over England and Wales clearing this morning, though the odd patch could linger through the day in parts of the southwest. Cloudier further N and breezy with some rain or drizzle at times. Tonight: Fog forming Thursday evening in south, spreading up into parts of the Midlands overnight. Cold here. Cloudier and milder further north with some rain in far north but winds easing. Friday: Fog patches mostly clearing by day leaving good sunny spells. The odd patch may linger over the Midlands. Again cloudier in the north with some rain. Outlook for Saturday to Monday: Settled in the south, cold at first with mist and fog on Saturday morning but becoming clearer thereafter.

The mum-of-five set herself the challenge of styling her outfits based on an item in a house every day in January and posting a picture on her Instagram page.They have included outfits based on everything from a tin of baked beans and a box of Quality Street to a packet of Always Ultra and a tube of toothpaste.  And her posts have gone viral, attracting more than a thousand new followers a day. Accessories designer Taryn, originally from Australia but now living in Donegal, Ireland, says: “The last few years was really hard work and I haven’t had a break. “I decided to take January off and do something creative, but then Covid numbers went up and I knew it would have to be something at home.  “On December  I was sitting on my bed and my eye spotted the sink unblocked in the en suite. I thought, yes, “I have the colours to do that. “Then I got really excited and went around the house finding all the items I could dress up as.  “Each day I just dress inspired by a dferent object, doing my best to replicate the packaging of whatever product it is. “I’ve been overwhelmed by the response. I get messages from people saying the first thing they do in the morning is check my Instagram feed to see what I’m wearing. “I’m really pleased I’m helping to brighten up other people’s January too.  “My one rule is that I have to use the clothes I have and not buy anything new for it, but I’m a hoarder and been collecting charity and vintage clothes for years, so it’s not hard.” Taryn has now decided to carry on her challenge into February, when she’ll try to dress as items in other people’s homes. She said: “I’ve been getting a lot of messages and requests asking me to dress up as something that’s important in their country or town, and some are really interesting.  “I think it will be a fun challenge, connecting with the world and people’s pride in their local brands. “Other people have messaged me saying, ‘please can you keep doing this forever ’ Maybe I will!”You can follow Taryn on Instagram.Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON HoardingAccessoriesDaily Mirror,callToAction:ltpgtGet weekly highlights from Mirror editor Alison Phillips direct to your emaillt pgt,buttonText:,contentId:,newsletterImage:https:i-prod.mirror article.ece ALTERNATES sd _AlisonHeaderFinal.png,endpointUrl:https:response.pure interface list.php,profile:Reach_Mirror,isPureNewsLetter:true,pureMailingListId:Mirror - Alisons Newsletter,isDoubleOptIn:,newsletterSiteName:Mirror\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get weekly highlights from Mirror editor Alison Phillips direct to your emailInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

We celebrated and had great time that is until it was time to pay, she wrote on Redditaposs AITA forum.I pulled my wallet out of my bag letting them know that weaposll split the check between us. Sam mumbled aposno you donapost have to, we invited you,apos but I insisted. He and his parents then stared at me I asked what was wrong and both mother and father-in-law said they didnapost have money on them. I was shocked and turned to Sam, who said he too forgot his wallet at home and didnapost bring enough money to cover even one round of drinks. His dad then laughed nervously, aposalright so guess we should let the doctor pay!apos  Taken aback, the woman responded by telling them it was too much money for her to spend on one dinner by herself and she never thought sheaposd be expected to pay the full bill. Sam said I should pay and heaposd pay me back later but I said no since I know he will have to get a job to pay that much money. I said Iaposm sorry but this isnapost the first time Iaposve been put in this situation by him and family where Iaposm expected to rescue them after they somehow forgot their wallets and expect brothers to pay hundreds for their extravagant dinner, she continued. I told them Iaposll only pay for what I had and thataposs it, he and his parents were shocked. They started arguing about how I have the potential to pay right there and then but I was acting asthey were strangers not family, but that doesnapost mean Iaposm obligated to pay. She continued: How could someone go out to a fancy restaurant, order so many dishes, desserts and drinks without bringing money  Sam begged that I just do it and call it a night but I refused. The argument got heated then I got up and walked out. Sam called later at am basically yelling that I ruined New Yearaposs Eve celebration and made his parents suffer because I refused to pay the entire bill and instead acted selfishly and paid only for myself after they were gracious enough to invite me. I told him how unfair it was for me to pay evenI have a good salary doesnapost mean I want to spend it all on fancy dinner. He didnapost reply he just said heaposll pray that my parents will let this go and not resent me after I basically damaged the relationship with them. The woman then revealed she now feels awful and questions whether she shouldaposve just paid the full bill instead of leaving. One Reddit user commented: They all conveniently left their wallets at home, it doesn’t seem likely they forgot them at all, and they invited you with the expectation that you’ll pay. You should rethink marrying this guy, he expected you to pay for an expensive meal, without your knowledge and you’ve been put in this situation before by him, it seems he’s using you for money and that’s extended to his family. They ruined their own New Yearaposs Eve, by trying to force someone  to pay for a meal they cannot afford. Itaposs so painfully obvious that your future husband and in-laws are using you for your money. They werenapost being aposgraciousapos to invite you it was a calculated move so that youaposd end up in a position to pick up the entire bill and your husband should be mortied that they did this. Instead heaposs backing his parents up and manipulating you into thinking that you shouldaposve rolled over and paid, another added. You need to rethink this marriage. This isnapost the first and it wonapost be the last time you will be put in this position and itaposs clear that your husband will always be on the side of his supposedly aposnice and lovableapos parents while they all take advantage of you.

Yesterday a man was arrested on suspicion of murdering Surrey businessman Saad al-Hilli, , his we Iqbal, , and his mother-in-law Suhaila al-Allaf, , who were gunned down in their BMW car in . French cyclist Sylvain Mollier, , also died in the bloodbath after being shot seven times at point blank range at a lay-by near Lake Annecy, eastern France. Officials have confirmed the man, who has not been named, was first arrested seven years ago and released without charge. The massacre happened close to Lake Annecy on September , , when the suspect is understood to have been seen looking lost.  The Al-Hillisapos daughter, Zeena, four, hid in the footwell of the vehicle and was unscathed, while her sister, Zainab, seven, survived. An e-fit photo of a prime suspect motorcyclist with a goatee beard was released in November  and showed him in a distinctive black helmet, of which only about  were made. The image, mainly produced by two forest rangers who briefly spoke to the man, finally led to a first arrest of the biker – a businessman from the French city of Lyon – in . He told police he had been on his way home from a paragliding trip in the Alps and was released without charge. But on Tuesday morning, the man was re-arrested at the home in Lyon that he shares with his we and children.  An initial custody period of -hours was extended on Wednesday, as prosecutors said there were inconsistencies with his alibi that needed to be resolved. He was being held on suspicion of murder and attempted murder, as his defence lawyer, Jean-Christophe Basson-Larbi, pleaded his innocence. Mr Basson-Larbi said: This is a judicial error. My client is going through hell. Quoting his client directly, Mr Basson-Larbi said: The position of this gentleman is always the same.I was strolling, I went to this region for something specic. The weather was fine, he was wandering on paths he didn’t know because he didnapost use his GPS. He crossed paths with motorists, maybe, but he didnapost cross paths with this poor family. The motorcyclist said he did not make the connection between his presence near the scene of the crime and the e-fit when it was first circulated, and that is why he did not initially come forward. However, investigators have now detected discrepancies in his testimony while interviewing him at a secure police station in Chambery.

And one dog, out of sheer stubbornness and spite, refuses to be left out of anything his brother is involved in - evenhe doesnapost actually want to be himself.In a TikTok video uploaded by @ msdfie, the Labrador cross, called Jake, is presented with a tangerine segment.The frosty-faced dog snfs at the fruit but it’s obvious that they don’t want to take it from their owner’s hand.  The video read: “Ever seen a dog know he doesnapost like something but eats it cause brother got some ” The woman passes his Staffy brother, named Blue, a slice of the tangerine, and all of a sudden, Jake’s interest piqued. He takes the fruit slice but instantly makes a face that shows his utter disgust, heaving and spitting it out onto the floor. The video has gone viral on the video sharing app, racking up . million views. But citrus fruits aren’t the only treat that Jake turns his nose up at - he’s done the very same with a slice of apple too. It’s safe to say that the Lab just doesn’t want to eat his fruits and veggies.  Viewers couldn’t help but relate, and said their dogs do the same thing, too. One said: “Mine politely take a treat they donapost like and then drop it on the floor after they walk away.” “My oldest used to hate veggies and fruit but since her baby brother joined the fam she likes everything just like him,” added another.Jake isn’t the only dog to throw a tantrum over food either, in fact, golden retriever Mango was left fuming after being served up a measly portion of kibble.Although she was put on a diet by her vet, that does little to appease Mango, who flashes her owner a desperate look when she realises that the small amount poured into her food bowl is all she’s getting. The short-changed dog gathered a lot of sympathy from viewers, with one person declaring: Mango - Iaposm coming to rescue you!

It goes against everything that every Retailer in the country spends their time trying to avoid, and that’s increasing prices.

It#s estimated that  million plant pots and seed trays are sold every year and the majority are sent to landfill or are incinerated.But there are non-plastic alternatives such as biodegradable pots made using materials like coir, wood chips, bamboo and rice husks.A growing number of garden centres and nurseries use biodegradable pots, but it#s worth checking out their sustainability policies.You can also make your own pots using newspaper or toilet roll tubes.And now is a good time to make your own supplies of biodegradable pots so you have stock for the planting season in a couple of months.If you#ve got a supply of old newspapers to hand, simply roll a cm-wide strip of newspaper tightly around a glass tumbler, leaving cm beyond the bottom of the glass.Fold the excess paper across the bottom, then press the glass down to flatten the pot#s base.There is no need to fix your paper pot with tape, just slide it off the glass.When ready to plant, just fill with compost.Taking good care of existing plastic is a good way to ensure you don#t have to keep buying it – so reuse any plant pots you have again and again for new seedlings, cuttings and plants.If you look after your propagator trays and lids, repairing themthey crack, they will last for several seasons.You can also reuse compost bags to store compost or turn leaves into leaf mould.The added bonus of recycling or reusing items in the garden is that it also reduces cost – as does growing from seed rather than buying established plants.Even in winter, you can grow something from seed, you just need a seed tray and a window ledge, or small cold frame or greenhouse – whatever space and budgets allow.For anyone growing their own vegetables, January is great for sowing onions.If you sow onions then, it saves the expense of buying onion sets – small bulbs – later, and you can have a much larger crop of onions in the summer.Onions seeds do not have a long shelf-le, so it#s best to buy new seeds each year.Seeds will germinate between C and C, one or two weeks after sowing.When large enough to handle, transplant to inidual small pots and keep in a bright, frost-free place until April when they can be planted outside.Varieties to try include: Setton – high yield, yellow skinned and good storage potential Red Baron – a late maturing red onion with globe shaped bulbs and strong taste and Hybound – an early iety with bronze-brown skins which is excellent for long-term storage.January is often the coldest month in the garden but there are still some things you can be doing to keep busy.As the Royal Horticultural Society says, January might be the middle of winter but, as the days en, the garden starts to grow.It is a great time to plan for the coming gardening year and to order seeds and plants.Enjoy the fresh air on dry sunny days, and check your winter protection, stakes, ties and supports are still working after any severe weather.Also, put out food for birds and leave some garden areas uncut, a little longer, to provide shelter for wildle in your garden.Top three jobs this month: clean pots and greenhouses ready for spring, dig over empty or unused plots, and prune apple and pear trees."},{"url":null,"title":"district news january 7 2022","story":"Tiny Glenbarr Primary School, which has just six pupils, has just missed out on being named Scotland#s most scenic school.More than , votes were cast in a Twitter contest organised by Henry Hepburn, news editor at education resource magazine and website Tes Scotland, to highlight the stunning locations of Scotland#s schools.The competition attracted  schools and celebrities even got involved, re-Tweeting posts to boost votes during the few days of competition in December.Despite having so few students, Glenbarr reached the nail-biting semi-final, just short of the final.With views overlooking Ben Nevis, Lochaber High School won in the end, narrowly beating Morgan Academy in Dundee.MID ARGYLLVolunteers are needed to help provide and expand PCR testing in several locations across the NHS Highland region, including Tarbert and Lochgilphead.Volunteers will be co-ordinated by the British Red Cross.

Only a small number of these entanglements were previously known, demonstrating that entanglements are hugely under-reported.The interviews also revealed that a wider range of species were involved than previously known.Fishers also participated in training events and workshops to promote best practice, reducing entanglement risk and safely disentangling large marine animals from fishing gear.This training gave fishermen the ability to call on each other and provide a rapid response to any entangled animal.#We all find it upsetting to see our majestic marine species in distress,# said Dr Kirstie Dearing, NatureScot#s fisheries advisor, #so we#re really heartened by the strong commitment and willingness of the fishing industry to work towards practical, safe and sustainable solutions on the issue of entanglement.#We will only solve this problem by working in collaboration on potential legislative changes.#The new reporting obligation will also help us to understand the extent of the issue more clearly.#Based on feedback from the fishers, the report recommends a number of ways to combat marine entanglement, including trials of weighted ropes – ropes which sink rather than float – and tighter regulation to limit the amount of gear in the water and caps on creel numbers, all of which were supported by fishers involved in the study.Other recommendations include developing seasonal distribution maps of vulnerable species to identy potential high risk areas and trials of #on-call# – or ropeless – fishing systems."},{"url":null,"title":"running shoes on as race

out most towns and communities in the east of the county.And most respondents insisted that the only place where they would be acceptable would be the Honest Toun.People were asked their views as East Lothian Council consulted over whether it needed to introduce a licensing policy for sexual entertainment venues.The policy, which could also apply to swingers clubs and private house parties, comes after the Scottish Government gave local authorities discretionary powers to introduce the additional licences.A survey launched on the East Lothian Consultation Hub asked for public views on whether venues should be licensed and which locations would be acceptable for such venues and which would not.The findings, which go before the council’s licensing sub-committee tomorrow , saw a majority of those giving a view naming Musselburgh as the only suitable place.Residents in the east of the county insisted that their towns and villages would not be suitable, with Gullane, North Berwick and Dunbar all ruled out by those taking part.The vast majority of people responding told the council that they did not believe anywhere was suitable for sex venues in East Lothian, with most also responding to a question about the number of licensed venues the county should allow by saying there should be zero.When asked which locations were unsuitable for such venues, responses included: “Gullane, North Berwick, Dunbar”, “wherever you’re thinking of putting them” and “the rest of East Lothian except for Musselburgh”.One respondent, however, suggested the county’s secluded Archerfield and Renaissance golf clubs as suitable sites, pointing out that they were “away from public locations”.While another pointed to unused sites across the county, adding: “There is a lot of wasteland areas in small towns such as Haddington I can think of from the top of my head that would be more than perfect for establishing a business like this.”This week’s sub-committee meeting will be asked to consider introducing a licensing policy, with members warned that having no policy would leave the county open to sex clubs opening without any controls in place to oversee them.However, a report to members added: “Introducing the licensing of sex entertainment venues is not equivalent to accepting or supporting such businesses.“That control could,deemed appropriate, include a policy setting the number of such businesses to be permitted at zero.”"},{"url":null,"title":"covid-19-impact-staffing-sees-pupils-study-home","story":"High school pupils in S worked remotely yesterday but ed to

in  to allow women members but it fell narrowly short of reaching the  per cent share required for a change.The move resulted in The RA opting to remove Muirfield from the rotation of Open venues.First Minister Nicola Sturgeon called Muirfield’s rejection of women members “indefensible”.Several high-profile golfers, including Rory McIlroy, also criticised the stance.A second vote was later taken and female members accepted, with changes being made to the club and the possibility of The Open ing to Muirfield restored.Already, there are no men’s or women’s sections, with women members participating in competitions alongside men.Currently, there are  female members, with that number expected to reach  by the time of The Women’s Open in August.Members of The Honourable

He has had to wait patiently for his chance this season given the excellent form shown by Mark Bennett, who he says has been of considerable help to him since he joined the capital club.“Mark has always been one I have looked up to,” Currie said after the announcement of his new deal, which runs for an unspecied period. “Its funny. It was a bit surreal when I first came in. “I was playing alongside him and playing against him, but he has been great as my role model and my mentor at the club. He has really helped me.“He’s in top, top form at the moment. Its just about learning from him. He has been great with me since I joined the club, helping me to analyse my game. And he pushes me to challenge myself and get better.”The Edinburgh squad for the London Irish match will be announced tomorrow [Friday], and Currie should be on the benchnot in the starting line-up. He has had to wait patiently for another chance after making those handful of appearances last season, but is determined to make an impactand when the chance presents itself.“It was great getting those opportunities, but Mark has been playing phenomenally and has had a big impact,” he continued. “I know I need to wait for my opportunities. At the end of last season I got a few opportunities and hopefully this season I can get a few more. When they come, I just need to grab them with both hands.“I’m really enjoying the environment at the club at the moment and I’m absolutely loving my rugby. I think Edinburgh is a great place for me to develop my game and it’s something I’m excited for moving forward - I can’t wait to get stuck into it.”Meanwhile, Robertson, who played on the wing for Edinburgh between  and  before becoming a sevens specialist, is ing after three years as a member of Clermont Auvergne’s SC department. He knows some members of the current squad well - he and Bennett both won Olympic silver medals in  as part of the Team GB sevens squad - and has been an interested observer as they have thrived this season under Blair. “It’s special to be joining a club that I have so many great memories from as a player,” he said. “I’ve watched from a distance as the club has gone from strength to strength on and off the pitch and I’m delighted to be part of its continued growth as a staff member.“I’m excited to link up with an energetic and creative group of staff. It’s clear to see they’re creating a unique way of preparing the team and I’m looking forward to adding to this.“The playing group has a great mix of experienced players playing at the top of their game and highly aspirational youngsters. They’ve already shown they can deliver at the highest level and it’s exciting to know they’ve not yet reached their potential.

They are inevitable.“I just wear my normal clothing and wrist protectors. I’m not worried because I’m not challenging myself the way younger people are.” "},{"url":null,"title":"letters-now-ever-uk-deserves-far-better-leader","story":"Boris Johnson has repeatedly misled Parliament, and the people of the UK, over too many issues and over too many months.His apologies and defensive rhetoric at Prime Ministers Questions was pathetic and frankly beggared belief. He is treating the people of this country with total disdain and like we are fools. This makes me very angry.Errors made by previous Prime Ministers, for which they humbly apologised and survived to carry on in their role, were by and large “one-off” events, not really “felt” by iniduals or households to any personal degree. This said, the most recent error made by Mr Johnson, flagrantly attending what was clearly a social gathering at No  – we now know with more than  people – at a time when every household across the UK was suffering in one way or another due to lockdown rules or restrictions, is one which is very deeply felt by every UK household.He simply does not realise the immense damage his actions and deceitfulness have done and the associated implications regarding his credibility and trustworthiness, to him as a leader.Displaying such irresponsible, selfish and misleading behaviour has resulted in him having lost the confidence and respect of the majority of UK voters, including myself as a loyal Conservative, and importantly as I understand it, many of his Cabinet colleagues.Not only is he now a real danger to the longer-term success of the Conservative Party, but there is no way he can possibly have the support and loyalty of those around him to develop, implement and drive those policies and initiatives we need to deal with and manage the very serious issues that the country faces and that require to be urgently addressed.The United Kingdom deserves, and indeed now more than ever needs, a far better leader than this.Paul McPhail, Glasgow.WHY MY DESPAIR TURNED TO FURYLISTENING to Boris Johnson at PMQs trying to weasel out of the mire that he has created for himself was quite excruciating. I then listened to Conservative junior minister Rachel Maclean talking on the BBC’s Politics Show and my despair turned to fury. When she was asked whether Boris Johnson’s attendance at the drinks party for  minutes was a breach of the regulations she responded that she didn’t know. I couldn’t decideshe is so short of intelligence that she doesn’t understand the rules that everyone in the country understands orshe thinks that the British public are as stupid as her and believe anything she says.I was reminded of the Dominic Cummings episode when the Tory Government first rehearsed its strategy for ignoring the rules that it had imposed. It all makes me despair at the lack of integrity of our politicians.Robin Mather, Musselburgh.* I LISTENED with great interest to the Prime Ministers apology on this weeks Prime Ministers Questions. It raised several questions in my mind: first, on whose behalf were invitations to the gathering issued  Secondly, did the PM receive an invitation  Thirdly, does the PM usually attend work meetings where those attending bring along their own bottles Christine R McLachlan, Milton of Campsie.REPLACEMENTS FROM THE SAME MOULDIT is hard not to agree wholeheartedly with the call by Ian Blackfordfor Prime Minister Johnson to resign. However, he cites as one of the reasons for this call Boris Johnsons “loss of moral authority”. Surely it must be glaringly evident that Mr Johnson never had any vestige of such authority As a proven serial liar, adulterer and power-hungry hypocrite, it simply beggars belief that sufficient of the electorate was seduced by his  bonhomie to put this person into a position of high office.Sadly, evenhe is forced to resign, the likely replacements are from the same awful mould, concerned only with clinging on to power in order to do the bidding of their shady billionaire backers, with no thought of the consequences for the rest of us.Dr RM Morris, Ellon.THIS IS WHY WE SHOULD STAYNO doubt the SNP and its supporters will use the allegations that Boris Johnson held parties in Downing Street during lockdown as yet another reason why Scotland should separate from the rest of the UK.In fact, the opposite is true. Regardless of our political views, we are fortunate to live in a country where iniduals, the media, Parliament and even elected members of his own party are free to report, investigate, criticise and publicise alleged wrongdoing by the Prime Minister. Once allegations are investigated, any proven misleading, lawbreaking or poor judgment can then be judged and punished either by his party, Parliament, the legal system, at the ballot box, or all four. This is the result of hundreds of years of evolving democracy and the rule of law in our islands and is something the citizens of many countries can only dream of.The absence of consequences following the Holyrood parliamentary committee’s conclusion that the First Minister had misled the Scottish Parliament about her actions during the handling of the allegations against Alex Salmond, combined with the SNP’s omerta-like intolerance of internal dissent, do not inspire confidence in swtly achieving similar maturityScotland were to separate.Mark Openshaw, Aberdeen.DISRESPECT FOR SCOTS DEMOCRACYThis is expressed most brutally by Alan Sutherland, whose aim is to take the UK and Scotland back to before  and the setting up of the devolved Parliament at Holyrood. I won’t try to summarise his argument because beyond that Mr Sutherland is not only opposed but contemptuous of what it is doing – despite the election of its governmentby the majority of those who voted last May – there is none. “This mess started with devolution and Labour, it should be its mission to clear it up”, or put it this way: “I don’t like it, get rid of it”, despite that voter turnout in the  election reached . per cent, the highest ever at a Scottish Parliament election.Peter A Russell offers a more subtle example, claiming “the precedents [for a national convention] are not exactly propitious”. However, his precedents appear to be the Russian Revolution and UDI in Rhodesia. Its not exactly clear how even the latter applies here, and as for the former, maybe there are some political developments not being reported .In his conclusion Mr Russell recommends an \"analysis\" of the independence case, concluding with the astonishing suggestion that“these questions are answered to the satisfaction” of % of the electorate, then and only then should there be a referendum. This suggests that Mr Russell has no awarenessthat the UK has changed so signicantly since  – most notably regarding Brexit, the consequences of which are still to become fully clear – that there is a parallel obligation on those of Mr Russell’s view to put forward a case for the Union, why Scotland should remain part of the UK.In this way Mr Russell shares Mr Sutherland’s disrespect for Scottish democracy. Only independence is to be scrutinised , but don’t even mention any possibility of the same for staying in the Union. Andthere is to be independence it should be by a majority which most certainly was not attained by the Brexit vote, and indeed has never before been required in the history of British politics.Alasdair Galloway, Dumbarton.SWINNEY IS THE FALL GUYYET again, this morning , John Swinney was on BBC radio struggling to explain some of the Scottish Government decisions with regard to Covid restrictions. I must be going soft as I am starting to feel sorry for him. There appears to be a developing pattern. Mr Swinney, the loyal number two, makes the uncomfortable media appearances and suffers while Nicola Sturgeon reserves hers for statesman-style performances at Holyrood where she avoids directly answering questions, uses paragraphs when a sentence would do to use up time and mocks those who dare criticise.She is so lucky that Boris Johnson provides so many reasons to deflect attention from her governance.Duncan Sooman, Milngavie.Read more: Labour should stay clear of devo-max"},{"url":null,"title":"charlie-peet-inspired-cricket-scotland-senior-mens-team-world-cup-exploits","story":"The Saltires thought their under- -over World Cup prospects had ended when they lost to Ireland in the Europe qualying final back in September. Then came the surprise but very welcome news that there would be a route back into the tournament for them after all.For Denmark  years ago it was the civil unrest in the former Yugoslavia and that country’s suspension from competitive football that got them off the beach and into the eight-team European Championships that they would then go on to win.This time it is, perhaps not surprisingly, Covid-related reasons that have given the Scots a back-door entry to the tournament - that begins in the West Indies tomorrow - after New Zealand withdrew late last year on the grounds of quarantine restrictions that made it untenable for their squad to compete.It may be a stretch to expect Gordon Drummond’s young side to make the most of their second chance and go all the way given they’ve been placed in a group alongside the hosts, Australia and Sri Lanka who they take on in their opening game in Guyana.Given, though, they hadn’t expected to be there at all, Peet hopes he and the rest of the squad can make the most of the unexpected leline and see where it takes them.“It was obviously a pretty big surprise for us to find out we’d qualied when we were all extremely disappointed with the way the qualiers turned out,” said the  year-old.“It was almost surreal when we were told and it didn’t really sink in for a while. But after that we got straight back into training and we had a good couple of tough months at the indoor centre.“Our expectations now are to compete. We’re not here just to make up the numbers. We’re going to try to enjoy the experience and be the best versions of our ourselves that we can be.”The senior men’s team made their mark on their own World Cup last autumn by winning their three first-round games against Bangladesh, Papua New Guinea and Oman.That took Shane Burger’s side into the Super  stage for the first time and propelled the players to wider prominence for their achievements.For youngsters like Peet it was the sort of encouragement that was needed ahead of their own World Cup journey, especially the performances of fellow left-arm spinner, Mark Watt. “The senior team are obviously a huge inspiration to us for what they did at the T World Cup,” he added.“Quite a few of our guys play with and rub shoulders with the first team quite a lot. So to see them put in those sorts of performances against the best teams in the world gives us the inspiration to think that we can do the same.“What Watty did at the World Cup was great. It was pretty amazing. AndI could enjoy as much success as he did then I’d be extremely happy.“I think spin will play a big part in this tournament. We have quite a strong spin attack and I think it plays into our favour when the pitches here are like this.”Edinburgh-based Peet plays his club cricket for Grange and credits Preston Mommsen – the former Scotland cap now operating as Grange’s lead batting coach – for helping shape him as a player and captain.“He’s been really influential for me,” added Peet, one of five who played in the previous under- World Cup in South Africa at the start of  before the pandemic descended.“Preston was captain when I first started playing senior cricket and you could tell he was such a successful international captain. Quite a few of the things I’ve tried to implement captaincy-wise have been influenced by Preston. I learned a lot playing under him.”"},{"url":null,"title":"novak-djokovic-included-delayed-australian-open-draw-uncertainty-continues","story":"It appeared a decision from Immigration Minister Alex Hawke could be imminent when the draw was postponed from pmat the last minute and without explanation.But it was then announced it would be held  minutes later, with Hawke now not expected to make his decision until Friday.Top seed and nine-time #AusOpen champion 🇷🇸 @DjokerNole begins his title defence against Miomir Kecmanovic.#AO pic MAlHNElG— #AusOpenJanuary , Djokovic, who is looking to win a record th Australian Open and st grand slam title, duly took his place at the top of the draw.If he is forced out of the tournament ahead of Monday’s order of play being announced, the seeds will be shuffled around, with fth seed Andrey Rublev taking Djokovic’s place.If it happens after that time but before the first-round match, he will be replaced by a lucky loser from qualying.Tournament director Craig Tiley attended the draw but did not take questions.Asked about the matter at a press conference, Prime Minister Scott Morrison declined to comment on Hawke’s decision but said: “Where fully-vaccinated eligible visa holders could travel to Australia without needing to apply for a travel exemption and enter those states, allowing them to enter quarantine-free, the inidual has to show they are double vaccinated or must provide acceptable proof that they can’t be vaccinated for medical reasons.“That’s the policy, which hasn’t changed.

It comes, however, only after millions in public funds have been spent on an ill-conceived vanity project opposed across parties and the communities most directly affected.#No-one disputes the need to modernise air traffic services, which support operations on our leline air routes. Sadly, months and millions have been wasted by SNP Ministers and HIAL on a centralisation that was never going to get off the ground.”Meanwhile, Alistair Carmichael MP said that the “costly and unnecessary” plans have ended “not with a bang but a whimper”, and called for reform of the board of HIAL to ensure the communities that the airport operator serves are heard.“Above all we need to reflect on how this sorry state of affairs came to be in the first place,” said Mr Carmichael.“Retreat on the centralisation plan is only a temporary fix of the underlying problem. HIAL is supposed to be accountable and responsive to the needs of the entire Highlands and Islands and it is clearly not living up to that aspiration.“If we are to avoid another similar fiasco in the future then we need to look at further reform to ensure that our communities are heard on the board of HIAL.”Richard Hardy, Prospect National Secretary, welcomed the announcement and said that the union and HIAL remain in “sensitive negotiations” in relation to the future delivery of air traffic services.A HIAL spokesperson said: “We have been clear that ATMS is the best option to maintain the long-term sustainability of air services for the Highlands and Islands. Nevertheless, we are committed to working with Prospect and our air traffic control colleagues to try and develop a new solution involving compromise by both sides.“We would encourage those with an interest in ensuring the delivery of a safe, resilient, and sustainable air traffic operation for island communities to recognise the delicate nature of these negotiations and engage in constructive dialogue to reach that end.” copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

People leaving the city are required to present negative Covid- tests and receive special permission.The city conducted mass testing for a second time for its  million residents on Wednesday, and asked them to stay in their homes until they receive a negative result.Tianjin’s proximity to Beijing makes the timing particularly fraught. During the Tokyo Olympics in July, Japan saw a widespread outbreak driven by the Delta iant.Despite that, the disruptions for people in Tianjin remain relatively light.“Everything is fine, the supermarkets and restaurants, you can go to all normally,” said Yu Xuan, who works at a university in Tianjin.Wang Dacheng, another resident, said his father who has trouble walking was able to get tested in their apartment. vw,vw,px, px\"Residents line up for Covid testing in Tianjin “Tianjin people are pretty optimistic, everyone’s been very calm and collected,” Mr Wang said.Elsewhere, in Xi’an to the west and several cities in Henan province, the measures are far more onerous, leading to complaints that people sequestered in their homes were running out of food.China has followed the uncompromising policy almost from the start of the pandemic, beginning with the unprecedented step of sealing off  million people in the central city Wuhan where the virus was first detected, along with other parts of the province of Hubei in January .It has been able to deal with local outbreaks through lockdowns, strict border controls and contact tracing aided by increased digital surveillance. The measures have kept the virus from spreading into a full-fledged national outbreak so far. The vaccination rate now tops %.With the Olympics due to begin on February  and support staff already arriving, the task has become even more critical. Whether Beijing’s safeguards will hold up in face of the Omicron iant is a crucial question.“I think it truly is a critical juncture for China. Can it stave off Omicron ” said Dali Yang, a professor of Chinese politics at the University of Chicago.China reported  domestically transmitted cases on Thursday, including  in Henan province and  in Tianjin. Authorities have reported a total of , cases, , of them currently active, and , deaths, a figure that has not changed in months.Beijing’s Olympic bubble is even stricter than Tokyo’s, which was mostly effective in stopping transmission, despite some leakages, said Kenji Shibuya, research director at the Tokyo Foundation for Policy Research and a public health expert.Beijing faces a potentially bigger risk because the more contagious Omicron iant has shown itself adept at evading vaccines.Moreover, the lack of widespread outbreaks means the Chinese population is protected only by vaccines and not from antibodies produced by previous infections, said Dr Vineeta Bal, a top Indian immunologist.“The Olympics would be the first trial,” said Dr Bal, adding that Omicron “can easily travel in China”.Unlike the Tokyo Olympics bubble, there will be no contact between those inside and the outside world.Officials, athletes, staff and journalists will travel between hotels and competition venues on specially designated vehicles in what is described as a closed-loop system.We want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

Dr Jaffa is essentially a spokesman and an apologist for the salmon farming industry.#It#s no coincidence that wild salmon stocks have collapsed in all areas of the northern hemisphere where open net salmon farming has developed.#Peter Cunningham, biologist with the Wester Ross Fisheries Trust, said: #It is the salmon farming industry#s inability to manage parasitic sea lice that is the major threat to wild salmon. It is a natural parasite but they multiply and become much higher in number on open cage salmon farms.#Sampling by the WRFT in the spring of  supports contention that cumulative levels of infective sea lice were again much too high between Skye and the mainland of Scotland to protect migrating post-smolt salmon within these waters in the next spring.#Salmon populations in rivers Applecross, Ling, Sheil, Glenmore, Glen Beag, Arnisdale, Broadford, Sligachan and many others around Skye are particularly vulnerable.#  "},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/258343311_483851062940065_6761478433370174788_n.jpg","title":"skyes mavis sails first tall ship at","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine, as part of the Greenock to Leith voyage last year.

So much of what we learn in terms of socialisation and relationships does not happen in a classroom but across all the other day to day activities and interactions that take place.“It is a huge issue. Our young people have lost a lot in terms of their formal education but for me, they have also lost a massive amount in terms of the other areas of development that their education brings.”Portree High School pupil Luke Eveling, who has published a book about facing mental health challenges as a teenager on Skye, believes the pandemic had taken a toll on his age-group.He said: #Lockdown and the pandemic more widely definitely had an effect on young people in school. A lot of my friends are finding it hard to cope with exams and more broadly the pandemic simultaneously. This has influenced how well they are doing at school.#I have a few friends who have turned to serious drug abuse as a way of coping with the combined pressure, and others have stopped going to school completely.”In April , Luke bravely shared his own challenges through his book ‘A Series of Essays About Mental Health’.Within the book, Luke, who lives in Broadford, wrote frankly about a wide range of issues including heartbreak, peer pressure, drug abuse, and suicide. at the time, Luke talked about being diagnosed with Asperger’s and coping with isolation during the pandemic.While last year Luke spoke warmly about the “overwhelming support” he had received from family, friends and the wider community after opening up about his own circumstances, he believed more support services should be made available to help other young people.He added: #There are some, but there just isn’t enough for everyone. Things like having a school counsellor sound good but just don’t seem to reach everyone who needs help.#Councillor Finlayson added: “We know the importance of mental health # people are nervous about the pandemic and have not been able to socialise as before. We already have and will continue to have a situation where some young people will really struggle to get back to being with their peers and to sustaining positive relationships.“Parents are rightly concerned. Their children are in a totally unique situation given the global scope of the pandemic and the impact it has had and will continue to have on how education is delivered.“Supporting all aspects of education in its widest form needs to be a priority for all levels of government from the UK Government to Scottish Government to local government.“We all need to realise that the young people who have been in schools for the last two years have been disadvantaged in many dferent ways.“We need to take account of this going forward in terms of additional resources and possibly a catch-up curriculum and perhaps even more importantly, support for all aspects of young people’s health and wellbeing including mental health.”Assessing the lay of the land in schools across the region, Councillor Finlayson said: “Within Highland we will be continuing to follow the rules and mitigation measures that were in place previously and have come from the Scottish Government # all these things masks in classrooms, social distancing, ventilation in classrooms, limiting contact with other year groups and classes as much as possible will continue. What the rest of the country will be expected to do.“Better ventilation is being encouraged in schools # but we must consider the time of year and the fact that some of the schools within the Highland Council are pretty antiquated and not in the greatest condition.“I am keen that schools should make decisions that suit their own circumstances # because each school is dferent.#"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/annie-johnston-with-John-Lorne-Campbell.jpg","title":"tobar and dualchais a visit to canna south uist and barra in","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineI have drawn on an intermittent diary kept at the time, to help with my present memories of the occasions., was by any standard a memorable experience.Campbell, a leading Gaelic scholar already well known internationally, had from the s carried out ground-breaking fieldwork recording Gaelic oral tradition in the Hebrides and in Gaelic Nova Scotia.

Ireland is stronger than ever as companies seek to exploit the dual market access offered by the Brexit protocol By David Young, PAJanuary   : PMFacebookTwitterEmailThe pipeline of investors considering moving into Northern Ireland is stronger than ever as companies seek to exploit the dual market access offered by the Brexit protocol, MPs have been told.Experts in investment and policy highlighted opportunities offered by the Northern Ireland Protocol as they gave evidence to a Westminster Committee.Under the terms of the protocol agreed by the UK and EU as part of the Brexit Withdrawal Agreement, Northern Ireland traders have unfettered access to sell products both into the European single market and within the UK internal market.While the experts emphasised the advantages businesses could secure under the protocol, they also stressed the need to resolve the uncertainty around the more contentious aspects of the protocol, primarily the trade barriers it has created for goods moving from Great Britain to Northern Ireland.NI has been nimble during a level of change that we’ve never seen before in our lives #NI is a test bed for the UK as an economy of the

fundamentals of the dual market access that we have, the proximity of a very signicant market for Northern Ireland and the UK basically on our doorstep – I think all of those basically in any context would be looked at as a very signicant competitive advantage that one would seek to leverage.”Mr Hagan highlighted other reasons why Northern Ireland is attractive to investors, such as a low-cost and business-friendly environment.He said the interest is not limited to foreign investors, highlighting that companies from where in the UK are also aware of the potential benefits of investing in Northern Ireland.“I do know, I have it on good authority, that the investment pipeline in terms of investors with an interest in Northern Ireland is stronger than it’s ever been,” he said.As well as the importance of the Levelling Up agenda and City Deals for the NI region, reflecting on what an Investor values, Northern Ireland provides the talent and skills beyond it#s small size. pic jEULfuxKhE— OCOJanuary , However, he warned that uncertainty and complexity around the protocol, as well as the political contention it has created, could hinder prospective investors from making firm commitments to the region.He said there is a need to focus in on the detail of the issues causing problems, and find solutions.“I think we can actually demysty quite a lot of that and create some clarity and some assurance to give us a stable basis to move forward,” he said.Ann Watt, director of the Pivotal Public Policy Forum, told the committee: “I think businesses will tell you the protocol offers big opportunities for Northern Ireland in the unfettered access to both markets.”She also stressed the need to find resolutions to the outstanding issues with the protocol’s operation.But she said some companies have already taken the decision to put operations into Northern Ireland to take advantage of the dual market access.“Businesses are already doing that, there are some that are already relocating operations to Northern Ireland because of the market access, so I think that’s something that can be built on,” she told MPs.Business and investors want certainty and they want predictability, and the political dficulties that there are at the minute mean that they#re not getting either of those thingsAnn Watt, Pivotal Public Policy Forum“However, of course, business and investors want certainty and they want predictability, and the political dficulties that there are at the minute mean that they’re not getting either of those things, they are not getting the

So, I think we need a quick resolution.”Ms Watt said the most crucial thing for prospective investors is stability in government.She also claimed that Stormont has “fallen short” in terms of long-term planning for investment.“All the evidence would suggest that the biggest thing foreign direct investors look for is stability in government,” she said.“Investors also look for a Government that has a clear economic plan and a clear investment plan for the future.“I would suggest that one of the shortcomings of the Northern Ireland Executive is it lacks that ambition for the future.“I would say the Executive has fallen short on that in terms of really grasping the opportunities and also has not put in place longer term plans for investment in infrastructure, skills, RD and so on, that would really convince investors of the future direction of government policy in Northern Ireland.”Most ReadNI doctor who hoarded hundreds of extreme child abuse images struck offWatch: ‘Traumatised’ -year-old girl escapes car stolen from south Belfast petrol stationIn pictures: Larne and Linfield supporters pack out Seaview for County Antrim Shield finalReprieve for seaside ice cream trailer as council does U-turn on revoking licenceThree horses killed after animals on loose at Belfast International AirportTop VideosPlayCCTV: Child flees for safety as man steals car in BelfastPlayBelfast man creates positive Covid test with fruit drinkPlayMPs voice anger at Boris Johnson as PM admits attending No  partyLatest Northern IrelandDavid Healy hits out at ‘lack of humanity’ in late incident during County Antrim Shield final and ‘definite push’ during Larne’s winning goalThe Undertones postpone gig at Derry Bloody Sunday commemoration over ‘Covid concerns’Truss says ‘deal to be done’ on Northern Ireland Protocol as she meets SefcovicKofi Balmer hailed ‘wise and brave’ as Larne delighted to win County Antrim Shield for team-mate after father’s deathLarne’s Albert Watson targets ‘flawless’ finish to title race while boss senses ‘something dferent’ in his squadLatestMan questioned over suspected murder of young teacherDavid Healy hits out at ‘lack of humanity’ in late incident during County Antrim Shield final and ‘definite push’ during Larne’s winning goalThe Undertones postpone gig at Derry Bloody Sunday commemoration over ‘Covid concerns’Rees-Mogg ‘wrong’ to call Douglas Ross a lightweight, says former MSPTruss says ‘deal to be done’ on Northern Ireland Protocol as she meets Sefcovic,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

That’s what we would like to know: what has exactly happened ”Causeway Coast and Glens Borough Council said the concessionary trading licence was withdrawn on January  due to breaches of the terms of trading following a number of complaints.“Prior to this action, letters were issued by council where the trader was asked to cease trading items outside of their licence agreement,” it added.“The situation remains under consideration at this time.”Ruth Pollock from Braemar Farm Ice Cream declined to comment.Many people shared their frustration over the council’s original decision online.One wrote: “The business is probably trying to make ends meet during this pandemic. So what — they sold tea, coffee and hot crepes “The council should be supporting businesses never mind penalising them by removing their licence, forcing them to close all together. Absolutely disgraceful.”Another added that it was a “disgraceful decision” by the council.Braemar Farm Ice Cream uses milk from its own herd and local ingredients to produce a range of ice creams.As well as selling from the trailer in Castlerock, the company attends many shows and events.Braemar Farm also supplies local shops, restaurants and cafes.Related topicsCauseway Coast and Glens Borough CouncilMore On Causeway Coast and Glens Borough Council PremiumRevealed: Councillors voted against the advice of planners  times in last year PremiumUnder strain: Six key areas where Covid staff shortages are affecting essential services PremiumCouncils spent £m on staff pay-offs over five-year periodDog of war: Council marks the retirement of decorated military canine PremiumGail WalkerOpinionResort’s Biblical inscriptions are writing on the wall for those who would erase our heritageMost ReadNI doctor who hoarded hundreds of extreme child abuse images struck offWatch: ‘Traumatised’ -year-old girl escapes car stolen from south Belfast petrol stationIn pictures: Larne and Linfield supporters pack out Seaview for County Antrim Shield finalThree horses killed after animals on loose at Belfast International AirportReprieve for seaside ice cream trailer as council does U-turn on revoking licenceTop VideosPlayCCTV: Child flees for safety as man steals car in BelfastPlayMPs voice anger at Boris Johnson as PM admits attending No  partyPlayBelfast man creates positive Covid test with fruit drinkLatest Northern IrelandDarragh McBrien: Five Irish League sides eyeing Dungannon Swts wingerDavid Healy hits out at ‘lack of humanity’ in late incident during County Antrim Shield final and ‘definite push’ during Larne’s winning goalThe Undertones postpone gig at Derry Bloody Sunday commemoration over ‘Covid concerns’Truss says ‘deal to be done’ on Northern Ireland Protocol as she meets SefcovicKofi Balmer hailed ‘wise and brave’ as Larne delighted to win County Antrim Shield for team-mate after father’s deathLatestProfessor Sir Jonathan Van-Tam to leave role as deputy chief medical officerChris Wood accepts ‘very special’ opportunity to help Newcastle avoid relegationDarragh McBrien: Five Irish League sides eyeing Dungannon Swts wingerFrance lts ban on UK holidaymakersNigeria lts ban on Twitter after seven months,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Credit: PAJanuary   : PMFacebookTwitterEmailAt last, some explanation and some contrition. But the Prime Minister’s long-overdue statement to Parliament on Wednesday at the stroke of noon posed yet further questions which will dog him in the coming days.That it took so long for the Prime Minister to even admit he attended the now-notorious party on th May  — which could have easily been delivered to camera outside Downing Street or in a studio hours or even days before — is yet more evidence he is being badly advised.  Or, as I strongly suspect, it’s worse than that: diligent advisers who did the job I used to are giving Boris Johnson the correct advice, but he is ignoring it.His excuses will not convince his MPs, or the public.The contention that “I didn’t know it was a party” has already been widely ridiculed, as have hollow words about the Downing Street garden being an extension of the workplace.Many quite reasonably ask: since when was a work event labelled BYOB  Downing Street has a beautul, large garden and as a journalist and former special adviser I have often attended s there in non-Covid times.Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up There is no doubt what the rules were in May .  Less than an hour before the party, the then-Culture Secretary even reminded us of those rules from another part of Downing Street at a press conference, beamed into homes across the UK.On Wednesday, I did what the Prime Minister took so long to get around to, and checked my diary from May .Less than  hours after the Prime Minister’s event with  colleagues, knocking back wine and enjoying the London sunshine, I attended the funeral of my great aunt Beryl in Lisburn. There was no service. Close members of Beryl’s family unable to even touch her coffin to say goodbye.  Around  people in total there, all socially distanced, for the shortest time possible.Countless other people will have similar — and indeed much worse — tales of sacrices made because of rules we were instructed to follow. Political scandals come and go. Who can honestly recite the finer details of the lobby scandal engulfing the former Secretary of State Owen Paterson in November Who can remember to whom David Cameron sent those Greensill WhatsApps, and why  The danger with Partygate is that it’s so straightforward: the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom imposed a draconian lockdown on the country, and then ignored it himself. Doctors died and Boris boozed.Ian Blackford, the leader of the Scottish Nationalists in Westminster, demands almost every week at Prime Minister’s Questions that Boris Johnson resigns, to the groans of MPs.For two years, Sir Keir Starmer has never once done the same, nor has he straightforwardly called the Prime Minister a liar.On Wednesday he did both, and that is signicant.And, late on Wednesday afternoon, the leader of the Conservatives in Scotland, Douglas Ross, called for the Prime Minister to go — the first Conservative MP to publicly do so.We know Mr Ross has also written to the chairman of the  committee — the backbenchers’ shop steward, essentially — Sir Graham Brady, to express his lack of confidence in Boris Johnson.The relationship between Johnson and Ross is fundamental to the fight for Scotland to remain in the Union, and it is now at its nadir.The Conservative bible, The Spectator magazine, asks this week on its front page, simply: ‘Is it over ’The veteran backbencher Sir Roger Gale has dubbed Boris Johnson a ‘dead man walking’.In contrast, the Prime Minister’s Cabinet colleagues Priti Patel, Michael Gove, Nadine Dorries and others attempted to rally the troops in support of their beleaguered general in the House of Commons tea rooms and on MPs’ WhatsApp groups.The Prime Minister remains in serious political danger.More evidence — perhaps photographs of Boris Johnson at the party — will most likely emerge by the weekend.It is clear these leaks and this campaign are co-ordinated by the Prime Minister’s political enemies, who are media savvy and possess a laser-like focus on their goal.Boris Johnson is — just about — still the most powerful man in the United Kingdom. The most powerful woman, now, is the former landlady of The Cove Bar on the Hilltown Road between Newry and Mayobridge, the senior civil servant Sue Gray.The question of whether she will call time on the Prime Minister’s career will be answered in the coming days.Peter Cardwell is a former special adviser to four Cabinet ministers, the Political Editor of talkRADIO and the author of The Secret Le of Special AdvisersRelated topicsBoris JohnsonMore On Boris Johnson PremiumAlliance councillor Michelle Kelly ‘sickened’ by Boris Johnson’s party after she suffered traumatic lockdown birth PremiumMark BainOpinionBoris Johnson apology: PM cut the figure of a man who knows he let country down over party PremiumNI’s Westminster parties voice opposition to planned MP pay riseBoris Johnson should resign over Downing Street party, claims Doug Beattie – while Sammy Wilson says PM must ‘come clean’ PremiumViewpointOpinionShannon’s tears are wake-up call to PMMost ReadNI doctor who hoarded hundreds of extreme child abuse images struck offWatch: ‘Traumatised’ -year-old girl escapes car stolen from south Belfast petrol stationIn pictures: Larne and Linfield supporters pack out Seaview for County Antrim Shield finalThree horses killed after animals on loose at Belfast International AirportReprieve for seaside ice cream trailer as council does U-turn on revoking licenceTop VideosPlayCCTV: Child flees for safety as man steals car in BelfastPlayMPs voice anger at Boris Johnson as PM admits attending No  partyPlayBelfast man creates positive Covid test with fruit drinkLatest Northern IrelandDavid Healy hits out at ‘lack of humanity’ in late incident during County Antrim Shield final and ‘definite push’ during Larne’s winning goalThe Undertones postpone gig at Derry Bloody Sunday commemoration over ‘Covid concerns’Truss says ‘deal to be done’ on Northern Ireland Protocol as she meets SefcovicKofi Balmer hailed ‘wise and brave’ as Larne delighted to win County Antrim Shield for team-mate after father’s deathLarne’s Albert Watson targets ‘flawless’ finish to title race while boss senses ‘something dferent’ in his squadLatestJohnson pulls out of planned trip after family member tests positive for CovidSteven BeacomOpinionJoe Gorman was old enough to know better when ‘Orangemen’ tweet appeared… how we all interact on social media matters a lotMan questioned over suspected murder of young teacherDavid Healy hits out at ‘lack of humanity’ in late incident during County Antrim Shield final and ‘definite push’ during Larne’s winning goalThe Undertones postpone gig at Derry Bloody Sunday commemoration over ‘Covid concerns’,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

On the night the tragedy unfolded they recalled how they feared for their lives.“I suppose it is the tenth anniversary and a lot of people have been texting me. But I just want to forget about it. We just want to move on,” Mr Moore said.“It is ten years ago and we want to leave it there. We just said, ‘look, it is gone — let’s move on’. We don’t want to revisit it. It is a fact of le — it happened.”Ten years ago, the couple admitted they feared they might not survive as the giant ship suddenly began to capsize.Mrs Moore said as the liner started to list, her first thought was of their three children.“I just needed to talk to the kids because I thought we were finished,” she said. “You just wonder, how are you going to get off this ship  Then peace sort of comes over you.

Produced by the British Youth Music Theatre , “Breadboy – The Musical” is the sequel to Tony Macaulay’s acclaimed memoir, “Paperboy” which had two sell-out runs at Belfasts Lyric Theatre in  and . The Lyric will again be hosting Macaulay’s new production and a star from Derry could well steal the show. Derry has a rich history of acting talent with the likes of Amanda Burton, Bronagh Gallagher, Saoirse-Monica Jackson and Jamie-Lee ODonnell all having starred on stage and screen. Auditions will take place at St Cecilias College on February  – although it may be moved online in order to comply with Government Covid guidelines. BYMT Executive Producer, Jon Bromwich, said: “At BYMT we develop talent and grow creativity to the highest level, for our  summer season we are looking for fierce actors, singers and musicians. BYMT offers young performers the rare opportunity to gain experience in a professional environment before entering the industry as an adult.” The storyline of “Breadboy” picks up from where “Paperboy” left. It follows the le of -year-old Belfast teen Tony in  who is the bread delivery boy for the last Ormo Mini-Shop in the world. As well as dealing with a iety of customers on the Upper Shankill, he also stumbles across punk music, via Derrys own “The Undertones” and their famous hit, “Teenage Kicks” which in turn reflects his own feelings on his school-crush, Judy Carlton, who sits opposite him in chemistry class. Tony Macaulay, writer of Breadboy, said: “Everyone involved in the musical adaptation for Paperboy were overwhelmed by the reception it received over the past two years. It was such a privilege to be part of this amazing project. The entire creative team especially the young cast were phenomenal. “I am delighted that BYMT has decided to bring Breadboy to stage for their new season. I wish all those taking part in the auditions the very best of luck and look forward to meeting and working with the young cast in .” Singer-songwriter Duke Special added: “I am delighted to be involved in the next adventures of Tony Macaulay as Paperboy transforms into Breadboy. Tony’s mind, as a  year old growing up in s Belfast, is a glorious mix of reality, imagination and downright fantasy! His muses may be the same as his slightly younger, paperboy self but this time he’s older, wiser and wearing Brut.

but it doesn’t need to be. Specsavers is encouraging avid readers to have regular eye tests so they can continue to indulge their hobby. Presbyopia is the gradual loss of our eyes’ ability to focus close up as the lens becomes less flexible. A natural part of ageing, it usually becomes noticeable around the age of . The condition is common and typically isn’t a cause for concern. But some struggle to adapt, and find they need to hold their book at arm’sto read the page or direct a light on it to see the words more clearly. For most people, the answer is a simple eye test which will identythey need reading glasses, multi-focal glasses or contact lenses to make words clearer – and le easier. Maeve Walsh, director at Specsavers Crescent Link in the Waterside and Ferryquay Street in the city centre, says: “It can sometimes be dficult for people to assess themselves whether they have presbyopia, which is why we always encourage regular eye tests, usually every two years. “As we age, it’s completely natural for our eyesight to worsen and it shouldn’t be something we worry about, providing our eyes are in good health. “My advice to those with presbyopia would be to carry your specs with you at all times and get into the habit of having them close by. This will help with activities like reading, and will also ensure you’re not straining your eyes, which can sometimes cause other problems.” To find out more about presbyopia, or to book an eye test visit:https:www.specsavers eye-health presbyopiaandwww.specsavers stores derryorwww.specsavers stores crescentlink Top five signs you have Presbyopia .

Reporter: Staff Reporter Dec   addthis, Lynch’s, the local family retailer which operates a number of Spar and Eurospar stores and supermarkets, have opened their third local supermarket bringing their total store number to eight across the North West and Mid Ulster. googletag.cmd.push Lynch’s Eurospar, Greysteel is the third outlet from the retailer to open under the popular Eurospar brand and has allowed management to more than double the number of jobs available, now employing  locally. Acquiring what was previously a Centra store on the site, company director Paul Lynch says the community needed a larger format supermarket brand that would not only bring a host of fresh and local produce and ranges, but would be convenient and complemented with services vital to the local area. Paul said: “We have invested around pound, to bring our supermarket experience to the Greysteel area and are so proud to open the doors. “We have more than doubled the size of the space which allows optimum navigation throughout the aisles, where shoppers will find an increased iety and range of fresh and local foods including our own meat offering and pre-packed ranges. “Importantly, we have continued the on-site partnership with Nicholl Fuels to offer locals a -hour fuel service with pre-pay pumps and we have  parking spaces to allow shoppers to conveniently load their cars safely.” The team has also retained important services including the Post Office, ATM, Lotto and PayPoint and added even more amenities and initiatives to bring value and choice to the area. The deli now serves an extended range of hot and cold food to go alongside Barista Bar coffee and Spar bakery, and shoppers can take advantage of the many deals available including the current  Deals of Christmas campaign which drops the price of big name items and festive essentials every week in the lead up to Christmas. Paul continued: “Eurospar also price matches over a thousand branded products to Tesco each week, so paired with our consistent schedule of value deals, we’re bringing a huge amount of savings for shoppers.” As is the Lynch and Eurospar ethos, the team in-store will implement outreach initiatives with the local community, sponsoring and supporting local clubs and organisations, while also fundraising for charity partner Cancer Fund for Children. Paddy Doody, sales and marketing director at Henderson Group, which owns the Eurospar brand in Northern Ireland added: “We now have  Eurospar supermarkets in Northern Ireland, each one bringing a wealth of convenience in a large format supermarket to their areas. “The Lynch’s are experienced independent retailers and know how to engage with their local communities, with an incredibly high bar set for customer service. “Its fantastic to see the Eurospar brand thriving under our independent retailers and we wish Lynch’s the best of luck with their new business.” The new supermarket in Greysteel joins Lynch’s portfolio of stores including Eurospars in the Skeoge area of Derry and Draperstown in Magherafelt, plus Spars in Dungiven, Claudy, Newbuildings and Trench Road in Co Derry, and Clonoe in Coalisland.  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on. --  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnailsADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Last updated    : Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Preloved Threads, on Derrys Waterloo Street, opens in a bid to reuse, repair and recycle unwantedclothingDerry NewsDerry woman opens store giving second le to unwanted clothing overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derry lads, Paddy and Shaun, open new barbers, SCTION, on their firstbusiness venture togetherDerry NewsDerry lads open new barbers on their firstbusiness venture together overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices -

Shaun said: I spotted the unit when I was eating in Da Vincis one day and I called up to book and to have a look. It was the perfect spot, I phoned Paddy, and the ball was rolling from then, everythingfell into place really quickly. We had both been thinking of moving on and going out on our own and it felt like the right time to do it and the right place for it. Shaun and Paddy handed in their notices and decided to take on the new challenge together. They are the only barbers in the shop at the moment, working Monday to Saturday. The store opened last Fridayand the boys have been fully booked since, with all their slots filled for the coming week. There is a complimentary drink on entry, both alcoholic and not, free parking, a comfy waiting area and music playing. They are set to help out at Tech, providing guidance, skills and advice to aspiring barbers, and may take on an apprentice at a later date. Paddy, who has barbered for seven years, and Shaun who has barbered for three, have many ideas for the store and cant wait to see the business grow. Shaun said: We have plans for a beer garden in the summer and to have the football on, Im really looking forward to it. But for now, we just want to get the name out there, let the brand grow and get as many people in as we can. I cant wait to see where well be in a year but weve been flat out since we opened and hopefully that continues.

Shaun said: I spotted the unit when I was eating in Da Vincis one day and I called up to book and to have a look. It was the perfect spot, I phoned Paddy, and the ball was rolling from then, everythingfell into place really quickly. We had both been thinking of moving on and going out on our own and it felt like the right time to do it and the right place for it. Shaun and Paddy handed in their notices and decided to take on the new challenge together. They are the only barbers in the shop at the moment, working Monday to Saturday. The store opened last Fridayand the boys have been fully booked since, with all their slots filled for the coming week. There is a complimentary drink on entry, both alcoholic and not, free parking, a comfy waiting area and music playing. They are set to help out at Tech, providing guidance, skills and advice to aspiring barbers, and may take on an apprentice at a later date. Paddy, who has barbered for seven years, and Shaun who has barbered for three, have many ideas for the store and cant wait to see the business grow. Shaun said: We have plans for a beer garden in the summer and to have the football on, Im really looking forward to it. But for now, we just want to get the name out there, let the brand grow and get as many people in as we can. I cant wait to see where well be in a year but weve been flat out since we opened and hopefully that continues.

Anne said: The business idea came originally from myself working in a local charity shop. A lot of clothing donations received by charities are stained, need freshened up or need a small repair. However, the majority of charity shops in Derry do not have washing or drying facilities. As a result of this a good percentage of donations need to be ragged. They are then sold on as rags of which a fair majority of these rags end up in landfill. I was horried, as I am very much into doing my bit for climate change. Fast fashion is the second most polluting industry in the world today. Textile production requires signicant amounts of chemicals, water, energy and other natural resources. It takes approximately , litres of water from growing the cotton to the dyeing process to produce one pair of jeans and one t-shirt. Anne continued: Throwing clothes away not only wastes money and resources, but can take over  years to decompose in landfill whilst releasing methane and other poisonous gases into the atmosphere. I dont feel like we can really justy this when so many of the worlds population are without safe and clean water. Renewable sustainable fashion has always been a passion for Anne, Coming from a working class background where spending money was limited, I loved shopping in charity shops which were like mini Aladdins caves to me, she said. Over the years I have had some amazing quirky finds for very little cost. I opened Preloved Threads the week before Christmas. For me, it was a case of now or never. Thankfully my family were  per cent supportive. We are located right in the heart of the city. We sell good quality second hand ladies, mens and childrens clothing and accessories, as well as some vintage items. Our aim is to provide clean, affordable clothing and to stop textiles ending up inlandfill. This has been a dream of mine for some time. It felt amazing to open. It has been hard work but I firmly believe it will be worth it. So far the response has been excellent. Local people seem genuinely interested and already we have our regulars. The items we sell are sourced locally. We have been buying clothing, etc. by the bag from local people. We have access to washing and drying facilities ensuring all our customers can avail of freshly laundered items. A lot of the items we receive I would describe as impulse buys, that is new with tags, that people have thrown in the back of the wardrobe and never worn. I do believe that now is the right time to open with much of the worlds focus being on climate change. Added to this, the current Covid crisis has forced the economy to its knees: with job losses, the ending of furlough, the abolishment of extra allowance which had been added to universal credit and the rise in electric and gas prices. This has left large numbers of people with very little money. We can all do our bit to combat this waste by reusing, repairing and recycling. According to a study by Re-dress, approximately , tonnes of textiles are dumped in Ireland each year and ending in landfill. This is having a devastating effect on our planet, Anne explained, Buying preloved second hand clothes is a great way to help the environment as it saves the resources needed to produce an entirely new item and saves these items from landfill.

Anne said: The business idea came originally from myself working in a local charity shop. A lot of clothing donations received by charities are stained, need freshened up or need a small repair. However, the majority of charity shops in Derry do not have washing or drying facilities. As a result of this a good percentage of donations need to be ragged. They are then sold on as rags of which a fair majority of these rags end up in landfill. I was horried, as I am very much into doing my bit for climate change. Fast fashion is the second most polluting industry in the world today. Textile production requires signicant amounts of chemicals, water, energy and other natural resources. It takes approximately , litres of water from growing the cotton to the dyeing process to produce one pair of jeans and one t-shirt. Anne continued: Throwing clothes away not only wastes money and resources, but can take over  years to decompose in landfill whilst releasing methane and other poisonous gases into the atmosphere. I dont feel like we can really justy this when so many of the worlds population are without safe and clean water. Renewable sustainable fashion has always been a passion for Anne, Coming from a working class background where spending money was limited, I loved shopping in charity shops which were like mini Aladdins caves to me, she said. Over the years I have had some amazing quirky finds for very little cost. I opened Preloved Threads the week before Christmas. For me, it was a case of now or never. Thankfully my family were  per cent supportive. We are located right in the heart of the city. We sell good quality second hand ladies, mens and childrens clothing and accessories, as well as some vintage items. Our aim is to provide clean, affordable clothing and to stop textiles ending up inlandfill. This has been a dream of mine for some time. It felt amazing to open. It has been hard work but I firmly believe it will be worth it. So far the response has been excellent. Local people seem genuinely interested and already we have our regulars. The items we sell are sourced locally. We have been buying clothing, etc. by the bag from local people. We have access to washing and drying facilities ensuring all our customers can avail of freshly laundered items. A lot of the items we receive I would describe as impulse buys, that is new with tags, that people have thrown in the back of the wardrobe and never worn. I do believe that now is the right time to open with much of the worlds focus being on climate change. Added to this, the current Covid crisis has forced the economy to its knees: with job losses, the ending of furlough, the abolishment of extra allowance which had been added to universal credit and the rise in electric and gas prices. This has left large numbers of people with very little money. We can all do our bit to combat this waste by reusing, repairing and recycling. According to a study by Re-dress, approximately , tonnes of textiles are dumped in Ireland each year and ending in landfill. This is having a devastating effect on our planet, Anne explained, Buying preloved second hand clothes is a great way to help the environment as it saves the resources needed to produce an entirely new item and saves these items from landfill. Also, it is easy on the pocket and is a guilt free way of treating yourself with the possibility of finding a unique piece. Buying preloved, second hand items helps us as consumers to use our collective power to help reduce global warming this can only be a good thing.

However, Phase Two of the stadiums redevelopment has yet to proceed.Reporter: Matthew Leslie Jan Email: matthew.leslie@iconicnews.ie  addthis, Local councillor, Brian Tierney, has urged Sinn Feacutein Communities Minister Deirdre Hargey to make a decision on the long-awaited phase two of the Sub-Regional Stadia Programme. googletag.cmd.push Cllr Tierney, who represents the Ballyarnett ward, said the project would impact on a number of local clubs in Derry, including both Derry City FC and Institute FC The SDLP man said that Derry City  Strabane District Council and the clubs had been waiting since  for the second phase of the programme to commence and that action to ensure that both Derry City and Institute, along with the community, would see the full benefits. He has written to Minister Hargey to ask her to make a decision on the future of the funding before the end of the current Assembly mandate. Cllr Tierney said: “At my request council officers arranged a meeting between councillors and officials from the Department for Communities to discuss the possible opening of the second phase of this scheme which has been talked about since . “Funding from this scheme would help local clubs prepare for the future and bring their grounds up to a modern standard. “There are a number of stadiums that would be able to commence improvement works as soon as the funding is improved, not least phase two of the Brandywell Stadium redevelopment that was guaranteed by Sinn Feacutein over five years ago. “The council and clubs across our area have been long awaiting an announcement on the scheme and we had hoped to see progress long before this point. “I was disappointed to hear from officials that there is currently no timeframe for it to open. “I understand that a wide consultation has taken place with clubs across the North and that any movement on the scheme requires a Ministerial decision. “My party colleague Mark H Durkan has been raising this issue with Minister Hargey since Stormont was restored two years ago and she has still done nothing to make good on her party’s promise regarding this funding. “The failure to provide proper investment is holding back a number of clubs from across Derry and Strabane who have the ability to play at a higher level, but unfortunately do not have the facilities required to meet the standards for entry in higher isions. “We have seen how successful the first phase of this funding was for Derry City who have seen massive improvements at the Brandywell, but there is still outstanding work to be done. “There is also a need for improvements at Dergview in Castlederg and Institute are still searching for a permanent home after their ground was destroyed by flooding in . “We need to see Minister Hargey deliver on her partys previous commitments so that our football clubs can reach their potential and provide facilities to benefit the entire community.” In response, a Department for Communities spokesperson said: “The Minster is actively considering the outcomes of the refresh and re-engagement exercise undertaken in relation to the Sub Regional Stadia Programme.”  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be

Its clothing perfectly suited to the GAA fan looking for something slightly dferent, without club crests and sponsor logos.Fergal, along with his twin brother Fergal and friend Paul Hughes – Chairman of Derrytresk– is happy with how their brand has progressed. Originally, they had planned to launch for Christmas, but a change saw them get the ball rolling in April, in time for the twins th birthday celebrations.“It gave us something to focus on and one of the jumpers has  on the back, to signy the year we were born,” Fergal told the County Derry Post.There was always an interest in designing and a clothing brand was never far from his thoughts. During his playing days, hed never be far away when new kits were being deigned. A retro jersey released as part of Slaughtneils gear range had his fingerprints on it.“We are from a farming background, it is not the sort of thing youd associate us with...getting into fashion,” Fergal jokes.“But, its always something we have been interested in. I just think a lot of the GAA gear is based on playing members and wanted to do something dferent to appeal to our non-playing members as much as players.“A lot of it will carry club badges and sponsor logos, whereas not everybody wants to wear that kind of product to go to games.”Still playing for the clubs recreational team, he coaches the U footballers and hurlers. There is a pride in pulling into Emmet Park and seeing the Gael Foacutersa range, across dferent ages and colours. Interchangeable caps. Beanies. Shorts. Sweatshirts. T-Shirts. Half-zips. From black to white and green to mango, there is something for everyone. “I am not necessarily going to pull on my club gear, but I still want to pull on something that will associate you with the GAA,” he explains of their brands unique selling point.The name – Gael Foacutersa #WeAllBelong – was spun out of that inkling he had all those years ago.“I always had it in my head, thatI ever did start up a brand, that Gael Force would be the name I would go with,” Fergal explains.“We wanted to keep the Irish slant on it as well. It is very important to the club and community.”And so, Gael Foacutersa – True Gael – was born. After some scribbling with the lettering, the logo eventually came to le by accident. “The plan was to launch it on the lead up to Christmas”, Fergal adds. “Then we thought, the idea is there and well get something out there. Me and Francis, it was our th birthday in April, wed give ourselves a date to work to, to have the product launched.“We are very thankful for the support we have got from everybody. You now notice now the orders coming in, even from other counties, so it definitely seems to be going the right way.”Nestled deep within the brand is the importance of knowing that the game is much more than being part of the squad and taking to the field. It is about identity. A sense of belonging and inclusivity. Being part of a community of like-minded people with a mutual love for traditions and heritage.“So much of our young children and adult lives have become about the constant need to train, to diet, to play, to watch, to support, to belong but ultimately to win,” Gael Foacutersa outline in the story on their website.“Gael Foacutersa is about getting away from these pressures and the responsibilities of the game.We want to take it back to the basics. It’s about the enjoyment of it all and putting smiles on peoples faces.“The Gael Foacutersa range offers high-quality, comfortable and eye-catching men’s and ladies leisurewear. It aims to reinforce the customer’s sense of identity. To be more than just about the game. It’s about being part of something bigger.” googletag.cmd.push For the full range, check out their website: www.gaelforsa.ie  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on. --  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnailsADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Last updated    : Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Preloved Threads, on Derrys Waterloo Street, opens in a bid to reuse, repair and recycle unwantedclothingDerry NewsDerry woman opens store giving second le to unwanted clothing overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derry lads, Paddy and Shaun, open new barbers, SCTION, on their firstbusiness venture togetherDerry NewsDerry lads open new barbers on their firstbusiness venture together overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices -

Pic by Mary K Burke.Reporter: Orlagh Mullan Jan Email: sport@derrypost  addthis, As Steelstown began their celebrations after becoming Ulster champions for the first time in their history, there was one person on manager Hugh McGrath’s mind. googletag.cmd.push McGrath guided his side to their first Derry championship in November, on the weekend of Brian Oacuteg McKeever’s th anniversary. And, as the manager explained, the man after whom the club is named was at the forefront of many conversations in the build-up to Sunday’s final against Tyrone champions Moortown. “All week leading up to it there was an excitement in the group about being in the final but the big thing we were saying that was that we were so proud that Brian Oacuteg’s name was being mentioned on a provincial level and in some places on a national level. For us that’s huge,” explained McGrath. “We all know in the city what he was about and why we’re named after him, but when you see the way we dug that out today – that’s Brian Oacuteg McKeever. That spirit is exactly what it was. “We’re really proud. Lots of teams say that they’re proud, but we are immensely proud of getting that name on the map and hopefully we can get it on the national stage and make even more people aware of that. “Evenits just to get them interested and to find out why we’re called Brian Oacuteg’s – great – because that story needs to be told all over.” If McGrath wasn’t considered an honorary Steelstown man by now, there is no doubting it after this weekend. The Saul native will have his name etched in the history books as the manager to lead the blue and gold to their first Derry, and now Ulster, titles.  BLUE IS THE COLOUR! Steelstown Brian Ogs are Ulster Intermediate champions!  Second half comeback sees Brian Ogs overcome Moortown   While he has tempered expectations and kept things calm along the way, when the final whistle blew at Owenbeg and the dream was realised – McGrath let all the emotion out. “We thought Derry champions sounded good but the Ulster champions certainly has a ring to it,” he said. Look, when you put the hard work in that these lads have and you’ve had so many close calls and disappointments, to get over the line in something so close and so tight and so nervy – it just means even more. “Steelstown as Ulster champions is one that will live in the memory for a long time.” His elation at the end certainly didn’t match McGrath’s temperament on the sideline throughout the  minutes of play. The Oacuteg’s knew coming into the game they were going to face a battle-hardened and defensive Moortown, but after scoring just one point in the opening half McGrath had plenty of notes for his men and, with a few timely changes off the bench, they got the job done. “We actually played into Moortown’s game plan and into their hands in the first half.

Pic by Mary K Burke.Reporter: Orlagh Mullan Jan Email: sport@derrypost  addthis, As Steelstown began their celebrations after becoming Ulster champions for the first time in their history, there was one person on manager Hugh McGrath’s mind. googletag.cmd.push McGrath guided his side to their first Derry championship in November, on the weekend of Brian Oacuteg McKeever’s th anniversary. And, as the manager explained, the man after whom the club is named was at the forefront of many conversations in the build-up to Sunday’s final against Tyrone champions Moortown. “All week leading up to it there was an excitement in the group about being in the final but the big thing we were saying that was that we were so proud that Brian Oacuteg’s name was being mentioned on a provincial level and in some places on a national level. For us that’s huge,” explained McGrath. “We all know in the city what he was about and why we’re named after him, but when you see the way we dug that out today – that’s Brian Oacuteg McKeever. That spirit is exactly what it was. “We’re really proud. Lots of teams say that they’re proud, but we are immensely proud of getting that name on the map and hopefully we can get it on the national stage and make even more people aware of that. “Evenits just to get them interested and to find out why we’re called Brian Oacuteg’s – great – because that story needs to be told all over.” If McGrath wasn’t considered an honorary Steelstown man by now, there is no doubting it after this weekend. The Saul native will have his name etched in the history books as the manager to lead the blue and gold to their first Derry, and now Ulster, titles.  BLUE IS THE COLOUR! Steelstown Brian Ogs are Ulster Intermediate champions!  Second half comeback sees Brian Ogs overcome Moortown   While he has tempered expectations and kept things calm along the way, when the final whistle blew at Owenbeg and the dream was realised – McGrath let all the emotion out. “We thought Derry champions sounded good but the Ulster champions certainly has a ring to it,” he said. Look, when you put the hard work in that these lads have and you’ve had so many close calls and disappointments, to get over the line in something so close and so tight and so nervy – it just means even more. “Steelstown as Ulster champions is one that will live in the memory for a long time.” His elation at the end certainly didn’t match McGrath’s temperament on the sideline throughout the  minutes of play. The Oacuteg’s knew coming into the game they were going to face a battle-hardened and defensive Moortown, but after scoring just one point in the opening half McGrath had plenty of notes for his men and, with a few timely changes off the bench, they got the job done. “We actually played into Moortown’s game plan and into their hands in the first half. They set up really well and exactly how they thought we would. For such a young group, it can take a while to actually figure it out,” he explained. “I was slightly more panicked than usual on the sideline but that was more down to the fact that our basics were poor in the first half. “The changes that we made in the second half, I don’t want to take credit for it because you don’t know what’s going to happen when they go in, but Gareth Logue was superb – the amount of dirty, horrible ball that he won Emmett Deane – hardly kicked a ball for us all year came in and scores an absolute wonder point to change the game and get us over the line. “An exciting day, maybe not one for the purists but we’ll take the win whatever way it comes.”  Its the stuff of dreams!

He cited the recent success of Derrys GAA clubs as inspiring new Gaels to take up Gaelic Games and insisted that the Council give them every opportunity to one day hit the same heights as todays star players. Mr Delargy said: “The recent success of GAA clubs across the city has inspired a new generation of Gaels in Derry. “The success of Steelstown Brian Oacutegs Senior Mens and Ladies teams, Seaacuten Dolans and Na Magha highlights not only the growth of Gaelic Games in all areas of the city but also the ersity of disciplines. “Now is the time to build on that success. It’s time to make sure that first class facilities are in place right across our city, and to make sure that all our children have the opportunity to play Gaelic Games. “We need to see facilities put in place to allow training throughout the year. At the minute, many clubs are forced into finding indoor or floodlit venues throughout the winter and much underage training can’t take place. “I am confident that the Council and Council officers are committed to make this happen. We look forward to working with them to see the continued growth of Gaelic Games in Derry. “It is important to note that this does not exclude other sports. All pitches should be versatile and allow for a range of sports. GAA provision will enhance existing facilities and boost the physical and mental health of children throughout Derry.”In response, a spokesperson for Derry City and Strabane District Council said the Councils Playing Pitch Strategy highlights any deficits in provision across sporting codes and that the strategy continues to shape Councils future pitch development plan. With regards to Gaelic Games, the spokesperson said it is one of the sports in which Council has begun to address the deficit in provision across the council area. The Council spokesperson added: “A number of projects have been undertaken in recent years with regards to this work, including the development of a full size G GAA pitch at Melvin Sports Complex the development of GAA playing and changing facilities at Corrody Road in Derry at a cost of over pound million the installation of ball catchers at Leafair G and extensive works to allow Gaelic training and matches to take place at Spamount in Strabane. “Council Multi-Use Game Areasacross the district are also multi-sport facilities, and that Council have also secured pound. million from the Levelling Up Fund for the Derg Active Project which will include upgraded pitches at Mitchell Park in Castlederg for use by local GAA teams. “Council Officers are working closely with the Derry County Board and Ulster Council of the GAA in assisting with the roll out of their GAA Strategy for the City, and this includes both facility development and programming initiatives.”   *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on. --  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnailsADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Last updated    : Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Preloved Threads, on Derrys Waterloo Street, opens in a bid to reuse, repair and recycle unwantedclothingDerry NewsDerry woman opens store giving second le to unwanted clothing overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derry lads, Paddy and Shaun, open new barbers, SCTION, on their firstbusiness venture togetherDerry NewsDerry lads open new barbers on their firstbusiness venture together overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices -

Hundreds of people turned out for the first day of vaccinations at the Centre, which played an important role in the initial drive to deliver First and Second vaccinations. The Foyle Arena is now open to walk-ins and bookings from am to pm, Monday to Saturday, and am to pm on Sundays. Mayor Warke joined them to receive his booster jab, and said he was impressed by the swt organisation of the effort and the professionalism of staff on site. He said: “This is a rapidly changing situation and I am extremely impressed at how these measures have been so quickly put in place to meet demand. I want to acknowledge the work of the Western Trust staff who are doing such an amazing job in very challenging circumstances. “I also want to thank all the staff at the Foyle Arena, and previously at Templemore, who are playing a vital role in this effort. “The Trust are aiming to vaccinate  people a day at the Foyle and I would appeal to everyone attending to please follow the advice of the professionals and lets do all we can to get as many people as possible protected in the weeks ahead.” The campaign is expected to continue until January and to safely accommodate the numbers of visitors to the centre Members of Foyle Arena, there will be some minor impacts to services over the coming weeks, though most will continue as normal. This includes changes to studio class timetables, and alternative temporary arrangements are now in place for Members, with a wide range of leisure services also available across other Council owned leisure Centres. Director of Health and Community with Council, Karen McFarland added: “There has been a speedy response to the recent developments in the Covid pandemic, and we were happy to be able to step up once again to provide much needed facilities to help progress the Trusts Vaccination Campaign. “Measures have been put in place to mitigate any impacts and while most of our leisure services will continue as normal, there may be some disruption to some activities which we will communicate directly to our members. “This is a short term campaign, and I really appreciate everyones patience as we assist in getting vaccinations to those who need them. “With high volumes of people expected to attend I would appeal to people to please follow the guidance at the centre and the directions of staff – they are there to help keep things running smoothly. “The safety of our staff and the public is our first priority and I would ask for everyones cooperation over the coming weeks.” With the volume of people accessing the Foyle Arena, additional parking is available for members at Clooney Park West playing fields. To find out more about leisure services available across all Council sites, and any changes to timetables please go to: derrystrabaneleisure The Western Trust this week issued an appeal to staff to help in the escalated operation as vaccinators. People are being encouraged to use the booking system as the number of walk-ins that can be accommodated will be limited. Vaccinations are also available from GP surgeries and local pharmacists. Over s who have yet to get their first dose of the vaccination can also receive it at the vaccination centres.

Martin Mallon, Managing Director of South Bank Square said: “We are delighted to unveil these updated proposals for the Ballyoan site. “This new partnership with Choice Housing Association represents a signicant multi-million pound investment in the North West and will see the development of hundreds of new family homes over the next ten years. “The comprehensive planned development of this site will be key to delivering some of the thousands of new family homes that we know are very much needed in the city now and over the forthcoming years. “The new proposals will include expansive areas of open space, children’s play areas, a woodland walk, as well as proposed improvements to the local roads infrastructure. “It is fantastic to be able to announce this level of investment in our home city and we expect that this scale of investment will bring with it many job opportunities for local people and local suppliers in the North West. “Enabling works have already started on site following our planning approvals granted earlier this year and we hope to commence house building on site early in .” Michael McDonnell, CEO at Choice added: “We are thrilled to move forward with these proposals in partnership with South Bank Square. This project will unlock huge potential to create much needed, high quality social and affordable homes for a range of people in the city. “As well as relieving housing stress in the city, this project will allow young families to get on the property ladder by bringing forward a number of affordable homes, as well as offering professionally managed, exceptional private rental opportunities too. “Extensive planning has been carried out to ensure the needs of young families, disabled people, and the elderly are catered for, with plenty of green space, allotments, a play park and a tenant hub included in our ambitious plans. “We hope to be able to secure planning permission for these homes so that we can begin to deliver them as soon as possible.”   *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on. --  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnailsADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Last updated    : Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Preloved Threads, on Derrys Waterloo Street, opens in a bid to reuse, repair and recycle unwantedclothingDerry NewsDerry woman opens store giving second le to unwanted clothing overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derry lads, Paddy and Shaun, open new barbers, SCTION, on their firstbusiness venture togetherDerry NewsDerry lads open new barbers on their firstbusiness venture together overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices -

Invest NI and the Department for the Economy , believe that Northern Ireland’s ranking in the ONS survey is not truly reflective of the level of innovation activity that is actually being delivered across the region. This could be down to the fact that many businesses simply don’t recognise what they do as innovation.  In response to the ONS, DfE launched Innovate NI in October  this is an initiative that supports local businesses to progress through a four-step innovation framework for successful innovation to create value. The initiative also provides official recognition for innovation activity, helping businesses to understand where they are in their innovation journey and recognise their innovation achievement.  As a business further develops their innovative project, they can have their activities assessed by Innovate NI. If deemed to be innovative, they receive recognition so they can clearly see the level of progress that theyre making.  Mary agrees with the need to encourage businesses to identy as innovative.  “One thing is for sure we don’t shout about our innovation achievements enough. I firmly believe the NI economy is much more innovative than the ONS survey portrays during the pandemic, we found that NI actually had a lot of innovative businesses with erse offerings and locally we showed a high level of resilience in dealing with a very signicant economic shock. “But I do think micro-businesses in particular, sometimes struggle to see themselves as being innovative and struggle to understand all the supports that are available to them. That’s why Innovate NI’s recognition scheme is so important and it is one of the reasons we decided to support the work of Innovate NI with the Economic Recovery Innovation Grant.” Economic Recovery Innovation Grant The Economic Recovery Innovation Grantis funded by the Department for the Economy’s Economic Recovery Action Plan. The grant was launched on th November and it provides small-to-medium-sized businesses, including micro- businesseswith the opportunity to apply for a grant of up to pound,.  This grant was created to help businesses progress their innovative idea - this idea must be new to the business, or the market, for example, a new product or service, or a new process within the business. The grant will help a business that is currently working on an innovative project to test and develop it, with the end goal of commercialising the product or service, or implementing the process fully in the business. The pound, can be used to fund development costs and the actual implementation of that innovative idea into the business. Businesses hoping to apply must complete Invest NI’s eligibility checker and satisfy the scheme’s eligibility criteria including being registered with HMRC and being a Northern Ireland-based SME or social enterprise.  They must also have a valid Silver Level Innovator recognition from Innovate NI. Silver Level Innovator recognition means businesses have already started to test and develop an innovative idea for their business.  Businesses can checkthey satisfy the eligibility criteria on Investni andthey do, they can submit an innovation assessment to find out their innovation level. Once issued, Invest NI will invite the eligible, Silver Level Innovator to apply for ERIG. Mary says the reason why businesses must have the Silver Level Innovator recognition to qualy for the grant, is to ensure that the grant is put to good use.  “We want local businesses to further develop innovative projects, services or processes that will enable them to grow. A business that is recognised as Silver Level has already completed the ideation and selection steps of the Innovation Framework, so we know the grant will be used to progress an idea Innovate NI has assessed as potentially innovative. “Using the grant to achieve commercialisation or implementation would then, hopefully, allow a business to progress to Gold Level Innovator status.” Innovate NI also provides help, support and signposting to ensure businesses progress through these innovation levels. This helps to avoid repeating the same step over and over again. This signposting will also help businesses know where to go for the right help. “Innovation can be something big or something minor, but it can make a major change for an SME or micro business. Just go checkyou are eligible and where you are on the Innovation Framework - it could completely change the way you do business.” The closing date to apply for the Economic Recovery Innovation Grant is pm on Monday, st January . Grants will be allocated on a first-come, first-served basis.

Neighbouring Fermanagh  Omagh had the second-highest rate of . while the lowest figure was to be found at Ards  North Down with .. The overall rate for the North stands at . cases per . people. While there are suggestions that another full-scale lockdown may be imposed by the Executive, given that the new Omicron iant of Covid has long-since embedded itself within the island of Ireland, no matter what restrictions are put in place, Dr Black – who is the Chair of the British Medical Associations Northern Ireland Council – said that rates will continue to rise over the next few weeks. He said: “It doesnt matter what restrictions we put in now because the effects of the fth wave, which is Omicron, are already baked into the system. What is going to happen over the next few weeks cannot be altered now. “ the horse has bolted. That ship has sailed. We are in a position where we are just going to have to work our way through the next four to six weeks. “This will include another two weeks of a huge infection rate, two or three weeks after that will be hospitalisations – hopefully not in large numbers and not too much pressure on Intensive Care Units. The pattern so far is that hospitalisations are not as bad as they were last January with the Delta iant.” Although the Omicron iant is generally regarded as being weaker than the Delta one that struck  months ago. Dr Black says that while young people who have been fully vaccinated maybe able to cope with it, the elderly may be more vulnerable to this iant. He added: “In September , Derry and District had the highest rate in Western Europe and we are more than four times higher than that rate now. The rates that weve seen in the past are so modest compared to what were seeing at the moment.   Figures from the Department of Health of positive Covid- cases in the North of Ireland.  “The rates at this moment are just phenomenal. You always worry about older, vulnerable people getting infected – certainly in Derry in the last week, weve seen more than five hundred patients in Derry and Strabane over sixty years old becoming infected. Across Northern Ireland that figure is more than three thousand. “Your worry from that is do those elderly and vulnerable patients end up in hospital  So far, our numbers for hospitalisations have only increased to around ten per cent in the last week or so. But we will be watching it very closely because although the Omicron iant is clearly a milder disease for younger people, we dont know yet how it will affect the elderly. “With Omicron, the factor here is how infectious is it. I think thats the major reason weve seen such a big increase. As throughout the pandemic, every time we think were successful, we become complacent and loosen up and complacency always leads to failure. “There was something about us being too complacent before Christmas in terms of bringing in enough restrictions early enough. That to some extent is the problem with a democracy. Politicians want to react to public sentiment rather than anticipate public sentiment. “You see in China, they closed down a million-person cityafter they get three positive results. WhereasBoris Johnson seems to be quite content to tolerate hundreds of thousands of infections per day because he thinks thats what the public seems to be wanting to tolerate. “Its a strange dichotomy in terms of how democracies respond to these pandemics.” The Health Service has been under considerable strain ever since the pandemic began almost two years ago. And Dr Black warns that the strain both the virus and the extra workloads it has brought upon the medical sector may well affect important services being delivered by the Health Serivice. He continued: “We worry about how the virus will affect iniduals in terms of their own health but also the effect that is happening on the Health Service with respect to the ability of staff to attend work. “The BMA mapping before Christmas suggested ten per cent of staff to be off with illness and a further ten to fteen per cent off due to isolation. Unfortunately, we seem to have been proven to have been correct. “Were seeing signicant numbers of staff missing – not just in general practice but in hospitals with nurses, doctors, paramedics and particularly in the ambulance service as well with response times from ambulances longer than we would want. “I see some of the ambulance services in the north of England were saying thatyou had a heart-attack, dont wait for an ambulance – go directly and get a lt to hospital. “Thats an extraordinary situation that were in that the virus is limiting the services for patients in other areas such as heart-attacks and strokes.” Meanwhile, the Western Trust has said it will continue with the temporary suspension of visitors to patients in hospitals, such as Altnagelvin in Derry. A short statement on the Western Trusts website read: “We would like to thank the public for their cooperation in relation to the recent changes to our visiting arrangements. Your support helps us to provide safer care for your relatives and friends who are currently in hospital. “Due to the continued pressures on our hospitals and the high level of COVID- transmission in the community, visiting remains suspended across our hospital sites and facilities. This does not apply to birthing partners, for maternity arrangements.” The Foyle Arena is serving as a mass vaccination centre. It is open between am to pm except on Friday, January  where it is open until pm. The centre is closed on Saturday, January  and Tuesday, January . Its opening hours on Wednesday, January  are pm to pm. The Shantallow Community Centre will be offering vaccinations on Tuesday, January  between pm to pm.

this year, with the worlds leading road racers reacquainting themselves with the . mile race around the Triangle area of the north coast. It will also be the first international road racing event to take place since the Covid- pandemic saw all activity halted in March . Club Chairperson Sanleigh Murray said the Coleraine and District Motor Club had been working hard behind the scenes. ‘Although the pandemic stopped the race action over the past two seasons, the management team of Coleraine and District Motor Club have been working hard to ensure the structures and support that underpin the North West  have remained in place for the day when we would be able make this announcement, he said. The event has retained the support of its two title sponsors, FonaCAB and Nicholl Oils.

It adds another string to the bow of an already excellent tourism package on offer on the north coast and this must be built on in order to keep people coming back. “I will be urging the Executive to provide as much support as possible so that the North West  can be maintained, promoted and ensured for many years to come.  pound, tourism fund finally given green light  A call-in had been taken on the decision after some councillors expressed concern.    *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on. --  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnailsADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Last updated    : Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Preloved Threads, on Derrys Waterloo Street, opens in a bid to reuse, repair and recycle unwantedclothingDerry NewsDerry woman opens store giving second le to unwanted clothing overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derry lads, Paddy and Shaun, open new barbers, SCTION, on their firstbusiness venture togetherDerry NewsDerry lads open new barbers on their firstbusiness venture together overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices -

The Council approved a contact for the bridges removal and assessment, with a view to its restoration at a later date. In January , the process remains ongoing. At an Environmental Services Committee meeting in September , the Council committed to providing monthly updates on the assessment process. To date, the Council have employed two separate consultants for the assessment. The first - Dorans - disagreed with the initial assessment of the Northern Ireland Environment Agency s consultants - Mann Williams - that the bridge needed only cosmetic repairs. Mann Williams were later employed by the Council to carry out the assessment, but at a Committee meeting tonight, councillors heard how they had now relieved them of any more involvement in the assessment of the bridge. Translink have suggested they carry out their own assessment of the bridge at a cost of between pound-,, and have requested that the Council make a contribution for half of the required cost. In response to a question from Cllr Richard Holmes, council officials revealed that between pound, and pound, had been paid by the Council to initial consultants Dorans, with a further pound-, paid to Mann Williams. At a previous meeting, Cllr Adrian McQuillan made reference to previous reports showing the Council had spend around pound, on dealing with the bridge.  pound, spent allowing County Derry footbridge to become a big rusty mess  Cllr Adrian McQuillan has vowed to keep the issue on the Council agenda.   Councillors heard how the most recent Mann Williams assessment had raised concerns over the bridges structural integrity during snow or high winds, as well as potential problemsthere was overcrowding on the bridge. Despite reservations that the Council could potentially spend in the region of pound, for no reason, Cllr Holmes proposed that Council provide the required funding to carry out the assessment. Cllr McQuillan said the saga of the bridge had gone on for quite a while, and said Council should liaise with community groups in the Castlerock area to prepare for the possibility the bridge would not be restored. Were this far now, so we have no other option but to go half-ways with Translink, he said. It is our bridge, and I think because of the historical nature of it, it is important to the people of Castlerock. I think we have to spend this money and see what the outcome is. Ive got a funny feeling I know what the outcome is. Maybe officers could open up a conversation with the community association down there. If this bridge cant go back up, and its maybe not a big  at the minute, could we discuss where we could place this bridge as a monument somewhere in Castlerock  We could maybe do a wee planting scheme with some sort of historical information about the bridge. I would rather see it over the railway, but I think we need to start to prepare for the worst. Certainly, it cant sit out and just rot to pieces and fall away, and that seems to be whats happening to it. Cllr McQuillan seconded Cllr Holmes proposal to provide half the funding for the latest assessment and the proposal was passed without objection.  Historic County Derry footbridge could end up in Garvagh museum  Analysis on the bridge will take a further  to  weeks.    *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on. --  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnailsADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Last updated    : Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Preloved Threads, on Derrys Waterloo Street, opens in a bid to reuse, repair and recycle unwantedclothingDerry NewsDerry woman opens store giving second le to unwanted clothing overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derry lads, Paddy and Shaun, open new barbers, SCTION, on their firstbusiness venture togetherDerry NewsDerry lads open new barbers on their firstbusiness venture together overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices -

The Government pledged to step in last year after the Stormont parties were unable to agree to introduce the legislation in the Northern Ireland Assembly. Their decision to break a Stormont impasse on the stalled laws, which includes legal protections for both Irish and Ulster Scots, was a key factor in the demise of short-lived DUP leader Edwin Poots last summer. Mr Lewis had originally indicated that the legislation would be introduced last October.  The Government previously faced calls from the DUP not to press ahead with the legislation while unionist concerns about Brexit’s Northern Ireland Protocol remain unaddressed. During a visit to Kilkeel, Co Down, Mr Lewis was asked what was the timescale on the package of culture laws, which were a key plank of the  New Decade, New Approach deal that restored devolution. He said: “We have been working through the Irish language legislation at the moment, we have been talking to the parties about it. “There are a couple of small details we need to work through with the parties, but I am keen to see that go forward. “I think people who want to learn and understand and celebrate their heritage should have the space to do so, that is what I said last summer I still believe that.” Mr Lewis added: “As I said at the timethe parties at Stormont were not able to bring that forward, then we will do that as the UK Government. “I always said we wanted to deliver it within themandate, that is what NDNAis about and that is what our focus is on.”  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on. --  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnailsADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Last updated    : Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Preloved Threads, on Derrys Waterloo Street, opens in a bid to reuse, repair and recycle unwantedclothingDerry NewsDerry woman opens store giving second le to unwanted clothing overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derry lads, Paddy and Shaun, open new barbers, SCTION, on their firstbusiness venture togetherDerry NewsDerry lads open new barbers on their firstbusiness venture together overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices -

The Government pledged to step in last year after the Stormont parties were unable to agree to introduce the legislation in the Northern Ireland Assembly. Their decision to break a Stormont impasse on the stalled laws, which includes legal protections for both Irish and Ulster Scots, was a key factor in the demise of short-lived DUP leader Edwin Poots last summer. Mr Lewis had originally indicated that the legislation would be introduced last October.  The Government previously faced calls from the DUP not to press ahead with the legislation while unionist concerns about Brexit’s Northern Ireland Protocol remain unaddressed. During a visit to Kilkeel, Co Down, Mr Lewis was asked what was the timescale on the package of culture laws, which were a key plank of the  New Decade, New Approach deal that restored devolution. He said: “We have been working through the Irish language legislation at the moment, we have been talking to the parties about it. “There are a couple of small details we need to work through with the parties, but I am keen to see that go forward. “I think people who want to learn and understand and celebrate their heritage should have the space to do so, that is what I said last summer I still believe that.” Mr Lewis added: “As I said at the timethe parties at Stormont were not able to bring that forward, then we will do that as the UK Government. “I always said we wanted to deliver it within themandate, that is what NDNAis about and that is what our focus is on.”  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on. --  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnailsADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Last updated    : Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Preloved Threads, on Derrys Waterloo Street, opens in a bid to reuse, repair and recycle unwantedclothingDerry NewsDerry woman opens store giving second le to unwanted clothing overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derry lads, Paddy and Shaun, open new barbers, SCTION, on their firstbusiness venture togetherDerry NewsDerry lads open new barbers on their firstbusiness venture together overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices -

And a great way to make sure you’re on an even footing when it comes to motoring in  is by making some simple and easy checks around your car to confirm everything is as it should be. googletag.cmd.push But what should you be focusing on  Here, we’re going to take a look at some of the areas you might want to focus on. Interior   vw,vw,px, px\"  Don’t forget to vacuum areas in the middle of the cabin, too    Alright, so a clean interior isn’t critical to the roadworthiness of your car, but it’s a great place to start things off when it comes to checks. Plus, a tidy cabin will be far less distracting, while a lack of loose objects will ensure that nothing interferes with the major controls. So remove any items such as bottles or packets and wipe down areas such as the buttons and heating controls to ensure they’re bright and clean. A quick vacuum in the footwells can really help too. Tyres   vw,vw,px, px\"      Tyres are absolutely crucial. After all, they’re the only point of contact between your vehicle and the road so it’s paramount that they’re in good condition. First off, give the walls of the tyres an inspection are there any cracks or cuts  If so, they might need replacing. When it comes to tread, the legal minimum in Ireland is .mm. To check this, you could use an accurate tyre gauge – available to purchase from most motor factors and retailers – or a € coin. This latter method requires you torun a € coin along the centre of the wheel. If the gold part of the coin is not visible, then the tyre tread is ok. However,it is visible your tyre could be approaching the minimum legal depth so you should get them checked. You also need to check the pressure of the tyres. You’ll find the correct pressures for your vehicle either on the door sills or behind the fuel filler cap. Find this and simply inflate your tyres to the right pressure using a compressor, which are found at most petrol stations. Lights   vw,vw,px, px\"  Check that all of your lights are operating correctly   Lights are critical at this time of year. Not only are they needed to light up the road ahead, but they’re also required to make sure you’re visible to other road users. It’s why it’s a good idea to give them a check over. You can test your headlights – both dipped and full-beam – by operating them when parked close to a shiny surface, such as a garage door. When it comes to your rear lights, you could ask a friend to watch as you test them – or you can, again, reverse near to a reflective surface and operate them while looking in the rear-view mirror. Make sure you test your indicators, too – a blink that moves too quickly might mean that a bulb has blown and needs replacing. Washer fluid   vw,vw,px, px\"      You might have noticed that there’s a lot of dirt and grime on the roads at the moment and a great deal of this tends to end up on your windscreen. Because of this, it’s best to make sure that you’ve got plenty of washer fluid in your car so you can quickly and effectively clear your windscreen. On most cars, you’ll find the washer bottle under the bonnet, signied by a blue cap. Top it up to the correct level and make sure you’re using washer fluid – water on its own can freeze and cause damage to your car’s washer system. While you’re here, make sure your wipers are working effectively too –they’re making a rubbing noise or are smearing the windscreen, they’ll need replacing. Oil   vw,vw,px, px\"  Locating your car’s dipstick is a simple task. It’s usually marked out under the bonnet by a yellow cap.   While we’re under the bonnet, it’s a good idea to check your oil levels. This is easy to do, too. Simply remove the dipstickand clean it off with a rag or paper towel. Then, re-insert it back into its holder remove it again just after. Now, you’ll be able to read your car’s oil levels using the guide on the dipstick. If it’s too low, top it up via the oil filler using the correct oil for your car – you can find this in your vehicle’s handbook. Remember, only fill up in small increments and check your dipstick after each time. This helps to avoid overfilling. Windscreen   vw,vw,px, px\"  A windscreen might be requireda crack appears    Your car’s windscreen takes a real beating at this time of year, which is why there’s a greater chance of cracks or chips appearing. Take this opportunity to give your car’s windscreen an inspection to make sure that there’s nothing out of the ordinary. If you notice a small chip, then it’s a good idea to get it professionally repaired rather than leaving it to develop into a crack. This preventative repair is far cheaper than the cost of replacing an entire windscreen, after all. Remember, driving with a cracked windscreen can be deemed a motoring offenceit’s obscuring your view. If you’re stopped by police with a heavily cracked windscreen, it could lead to penalty points and a fine.  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on. --  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnailsADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Last updated    : Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Preloved Threads, on Derrys Waterloo Street, opens in a bid to reuse, repair and recycle unwantedclothingDerry NewsDerry woman opens store giving second le to unwanted clothing overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derry lads, Paddy and Shaun, open new barbers, SCTION, on their firstbusiness venture togetherDerry NewsDerry lads open new barbers on their firstbusiness venture together overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices -

WHO advises against blanket travel bansDoes the virus read your passport  - WHO advises against blanket travel bansReporter: Mary McFadden Dec Email: mary.mcfadden@iconicnews.ie  addthis, The World Health Organisationis advising against blanket travel bans to prevent the spread of the newest Covid- iant, Omicron. googletag.cmd.push The Executive Director of WHOs Health Emergences Programme, Dr Mike Ryan, said there are many ways to manage the risk of importation or exportation of disease without banning travel. At a media briefing, he stated there were inherent internal contradictions in the bans and said, Weve seen these before where you ban flights except for your own citizens. Is it that some passport holders will have the virus and some wont  Does the virus read your passport  Does the virus know your nationality or where youre legally resident  Our concern here is that we apply public health principles, not political principles to selecting measures that are used to control the spread of disease. He made the comments in the wake of tightening border restrictions across dozens of countries in response to the Omicron iant. WHO Director-General, Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, also called on countries to take rational and proportional risk-reduction measures. He said, Blanket travel bans will not prevent the international spread of Omicron and they place a heavy burden on lives and livelihoods. Dr Ryan suggested other ways to manage risk: There are ways that you can de-risk travel in terms of having increased testing, more testing before departure, more testing on arrival, quarantine until negative testing. There is a whole series of things that can be done that will manage the risk of importation of disease or even exporting disease to another country which fall short of blanket bans. The idea that you can put a hermetic seal on most countries is just frankly not possible. We all know that, weve seen that happen before. And certainly there has to be consistency. If [the bans] are being applied, they have to be consistent.  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on. --  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnailsADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Last updated    : Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Preloved Threads, on Derrys Waterloo Street, opens in a bid to reuse, repair and recycle unwantedclothingDerry NewsDerry woman opens store giving second le to unwanted clothing overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derry lads, Paddy and Shaun, open new barbers, SCTION, on their firstbusiness venture togetherDerry NewsDerry lads open new barbers on their firstbusiness venture together overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices -

They also provide underage hurling via St Patricks, an amalgamation with their parish neighbours St Colms Drum.When Derry won the All-Ireland title in , the countys most successful era, Richard Ferris was part of the winning formula and scored a goal in their opening round against Down that season. Joe Irwin won an Ulster medal with the county and Eunan Rafferty was also on Derry teams in that era.The clubs recent underage development work has provided Michael Mullan to Derrys Ulster minor winning team of , with Tiarnaacuten McHugh, Dara and Ruairi Rafferty part of the group who repeated the feat two seasons later on their way to the All-Ireland Final.Current senior captain Tiarnaacuten Woods has represented Derry at minor and U level, with McHugh and Ruairi Rafferty – who have played senior hurling with Kevin Lynchs – having also played the wee ball game for the county.On the camogie field, Una Rafferty and Aoe Kelly have represented Derry at minor and U level respectively. It has all comeas a result of the work being done at the club.“It is great to have Richard Ferris back involved again,” Shane adds. “He has set up a winter programme in place for the players in first to fth year , with the older players getting looked after under the senior  with their strength and conditioning.”The current senior group has benefited from the influx of youth as they have one eye on the Derry IFC Quarter-Finals later this month.McGonigle paid tribute to those who have sat on club committees down through the years and it has been bolstered with new blood coming on board in recent years to help with the clubs progression. Another great development has been an influx in new coaches coming forward at primary school level. Every bit helps. Like many other clubs across Ireland, Drumsurn reaches deeper into the locality. They are more than just GAA. Its a social hub that knits everyone together, regardless of age. It offers an identity.On top of their day to day club activities and s. Fitness classes, male and female, are a valuable facet of the club, while they also host Irish dancing and bowls.The club has also recently formed a mental health committee and have put in place a full winter program to complement this initiative. There are also plans for Irish language classes. There is never a dull moment. The clubs heart beats strong.“We as a club are very community focused,” Shane stresses. “In the past year we have brought the Action Cancer big bus for two days and also provided a defibrillator in a cabinet for our communitys use.”Since moving to their current premises, Billy Doran Park, in , they have added a training pitch and a club gym.The Club Committee set out a three-phase ground development plan in . The first phase of a new kitchen plus internal and external toilet blocks was completed in  with the changing rooms refurbished in .Phase , currently going through planning, includes a walking track, new floodlights and ball-wall. It all leads into Phase , a floodlit G pitch.“Our proposed ground developments are going to cost in excess of pound,,” McGonigle points out. “For a club of less than  members, this is a massive undertaking.”Drumsurn have set themselves a target of having phases two and three complete for their Centenary Year in .“Unfortunately, as with many other aspects of le, Covid has put a stop to conventional fundraising activities for the moment,” Shane outlines. “So we decided to set up Drumsurn GAC Competitions as a way of raising some much needed funds.” For more information and details on how to enter Drumsurns competition, visit www.drumsurngaccompetitions    *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on. --  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnailsADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Last updated    : Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Preloved Threads, on Derrys Waterloo Street, opens in a bid to reuse, repair and recycle unwantedclothingDerry NewsDerry woman opens store giving second le to unwanted clothing overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derry lads, Paddy and Shaun, open new barbers, SCTION, on their firstbusiness venture togetherDerry NewsDerry lads open new barbers on their firstbusiness venture together overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices -

We’re encouraged to make these ongoing health measures as much a part of the holiday as mulled wine and mince pies. Such steps can help protect our nearest and dearest while we’re together. The gt of protecting one another from COVID- – including the Omicron iant – is the one that truly keeps on giving. The weather outside may be “frightful” but, gathering indoors, we can still open windows to allow fresh air to disperse the virus. Embrace face coverings, there are seasonal styles aplenty to add festive flair to commuting and high street shopping trips. Every adult in the country needs to get a COVID- booster vaccine, because two doses does not give you enough protection against catching Omicron. Get your booster now at nhs.uk covidvaccination. Get Boosted Now is the national mission to build a wall of defence against the new Omicron iant. This mission is more urgent and more important than ever before because Omicron COVID- is spreading fast. Vaccines are the best way we can protect ourselves. You can get a COVID- booster  weeks after your second dose. Boosters give you the best possible protection against the virus and should signicantly reduce your risk of serious illness and hospitalisation. And, swter than shaving or applying makeup, taking rapid lateral flow tests are a quick and easy part of your getting ready routine before venturing out. If you have been in contact with someone with COVID- and are double vaccinated, you should take a daily rapid lateral flow test for seven daysyou have no symptoms. This will help slow the spread of the virus and allow you and your loved ones to continue your plans that dayyou test negative. If you are unvaccinated, you must continue to self-isolate for  daysyou are a contact of someone with COVID-. Don’t forget the NHS COVID- app is still the fastest way to knowyou’ve been exposed to someone who tested positive for COVID-, so keep it on. A very merry Christmas and a happy New Year, celebrate safely and let’s make it a good one. ‘It’s vital to ventilate’  Leeds University Professor of Environmental Engineering Catherine Noakes, pictured, said: “As Christmas is coming people will naturally be spending more time indoors – welcoming friends and family into their home and attending social events together – as the weather gets colder.While we are all looking forward to spending time with friends and family this Christmas, it’s important to remember that coronavirus is still spreading and can easily transmit in the home even when people are vaccinated.“In an enclosed space, the infectious particles hang around in the air like smoke and can build up over time, increasing the risk of other people in the room breathing in the virus, especiallythere is no ventilation or fresh air helping to refresh the air.“That’s why it’s so important to ventilate indoor spaces by opening windows, evenjust regularly for a short time. This way fresh air can disperse and blow COVID- particles away to decrease the risk of others being infected.”  Wish List  Vaccinations  All adults now need to get a booster vaccine, as two doses do not offer enough protection against the fast spreading Omicron iant. Boosters are available  weeks after second jabs. Get Boosted Now at nhs.uk covidvaccination to signicantly reduce your risk of serious illness and hospitalisation.  Taking tests  Make taking rapid lateral flow tests part of your festive preparations. Use any unused stocks of rapid lateral flow tests that you may have at homeCollect from your School Universityyou already obtain test kits from thereCollect from your local PharmacyCollect from your local Community Test sitesOrder online at gov.uk   Fresh air  Opening doors and windows for ten minutes can help you and your loved ones stay safe.  Face covering  To protect yourself and others, face coverings must be worn in shops, indoor venues and on public transport.

Pic by Mary K Burke.Reporter: Orlagh Mullan Jan Email: sport@derrypost  addthis, Before answering the first question, Cahir McMonagle admits that he isn’t the biggest fan of doing media interviews. googletag.cmd.push But after his performance in the Ulster championship final, scoring five of Steelstown’s six points to help his club to the provincial title, he knew he wasn’t going to escape the headlines. Since scoring the winner for the Oacuteg’s in the Derry intermediate championship final at the start of November – the club’s first Derry title – McMonagle hasn’t looked back. He’s been a steady and consistent influence for the men in blue and gold, with a bag of tricks and pace to burn causing a nightmare for defenders across the province. When Steelstown looked devoid of answers against a dogged Moortown, it was McMonagle who kept them ticking on the scoreboard. He scored their only point of the first half – which was preceded by a dummy that sent two Moortown men flying. Another score came in the second half before an equalising effort that was followed with a fist pump to the crowd.  McGrath pays tribute to Brian Oacuteg after Ulster final victory  It was an emotional day for all in blue and yellow.   After Emmett Deane put them ahead, it was McMonagle who rounded things off with two more huge scores. Trailing - to - at half-time, Steelstown found themselves being challenged and being questioned, but, as they have done all season, they came up with the answers. “We were frustrated in the first half,” admitted McMonagle. “We only got one score, but we knew we had to be patient. We played to our strengths and took our wee half chances and it worked out for us come the final whistle. “We’re taking the trophy down the road with us and that’s the only thing that matters. He continued: “It’s not the first time we’ve been behind at half-time. We had the same situation against Donaghmoyne in the quarter-final and we have that belief in ourselves that we’re going to get the job done and thankfully we were able to do it at the end.” The celebrations will go on for a few more days yet, but then it’s back to business.

Pic by Mary K Burke.Reporter: Orlagh Mullan Jan Email: sport@derrypost  addthis, Before answering the first question, Cahir McMonagle admits that he isn’t the biggest fan of doing media interviews. googletag.cmd.push But after his performance in the Ulster championship final, scoring five of Steelstown’s six points to help his club to the provincial title, he knew he wasn’t going to escape the headlines. Since scoring the winner for the Oacuteg’s in the Derry intermediate championship final at the start of November – the club’s first Derry title – McMonagle hasn’t looked back. He’s been a steady and consistent influence for the men in blue and gold, with a bag of tricks and pace to burn causing a nightmare for defenders across the province. When Steelstown looked devoid of answers against a dogged Moortown, it was McMonagle who kept them ticking on the scoreboard. He scored their only point of the first half – which was preceded by a dummy that sent two Moortown men flying. Another score came in the second half before an equalising effort that was followed with a fist pump to the crowd.  McGrath pays tribute to Brian Oacuteg after Ulster final victory  It was an emotional day for all in blue and yellow.   After Emmett Deane put them ahead, it was McMonagle who rounded things off with two more huge scores. Trailing - to - at half-time, Steelstown found themselves being challenged and being questioned, but, as they have done all season, they came up with the answers. “We were frustrated in the first half,” admitted McMonagle. “We only got one score, but we knew we had to be patient. We played to our strengths and took our wee half chances and it worked out for us come the final whistle. “We’re taking the trophy down the road with us and that’s the only thing that matters. He continued: “It’s not the first time we’ve been behind at half-time. We had the same situation against Donaghmoyne in the quarter-final and we have that belief in ourselves that we’re going to get the job done and thankfully we were able to do it at the end.” The celebrations will go on for a few more days yet, but then it’s back to business. And McMonagle has one more thing on his mind. “We’ve won our first county title this season and now we have our first Ulster so we’ll look forward to hopefully giving the All-Ireland a good go now,” he laughed. “This is the highest level we’ve reached, and I’m just delighted to be part of this team and this club.

Pic by Tom Heaney, nwpresspicsReporter: Gary Ferry Jan Email: gary@derrynews.net  addthis, Caolan McLaughlin is determined to use his loan spell at Institute to prove to Ruaidhri Higgins that he can be a part of his plans at Derry City. googletag.cmd.push The -year-old made his ‘Stute debut last Saturday and played the full  minutes in the - Irish Cup defeat to Portstewart at the Brandywell. He is likely to feature again in the away game at Ballyclare this weekend, with coach Brian Donaghey promising first team experience in his six-month loan spell. It is a chance that McLaughlin is determined to make the most of. “I think it’s a great opportunity for me to go and play games and show people what I am all about,” he said. “Hopefully then I can come back after the loan spell and see what happens I’ll be knocking on the manager’s door for a place in the team. “Last season there was talk about a loan but nothing came from it, but now I’m just eager to go out and play football and show everyone that I can play. I had a chat with Ruaidhri. We had a good meeting and he knew it was best for me and I knew it was best for me too. It was best for both parties to be honest.” McLaughlin made his Derry City debut last March away to Longford under Declan Devine and went on to make six first team appearances in all throughout the  season. He featured in big games against Dundalk and Shamrock Rovers, but didn’t appear in the first team picture at any stage after May. With Higgins’ midfield options only strengthened due to recent arrivals at the club, a loan spell where became the more realistic option.  “That was all good experience for me, coming off the bench and hopefully now, with getting more experience with Institute I can go back and play more part in the games for Derry” he continued. “It was a bit frustrating , but it was a hard season at the start. Since Ruaidhri came in the standard has gone up. It’s all about biding my time at the minute and hopefully I can get the opportunity to play and hopefully I can take it. “I know the standards have gone straight through the roof with players like Patrick McEleney and Mickey Duffy coming in, and I know what Will Patching can do too, so I will be hard to get a place in the team, so hopefully with this opportunity with Institute, I can do it.” Settling in McLaughlin’s ‘Stute debut did not go as planned with an unexpected defeat to an Intermediate League opponent, but he is optimistic that with other new arrivals, things will start to pick up for the club in the coming weeks. “It was a bit of a disappointing result but it was good to get out there,” he agreed. “It was only my first game so it’s about settling into the team. The more games I play the more settled I’ll be. They are a great much of lads so hopefully we can pick up results and climb up that league. “I have known Briansince I was younger because I played in the county team with him. I can’t say a bad word about him, he’s a great manager and a great person. I had a chat on the phone for him for about  minutes and I know his aspirations for the second part of the season. It was a no-brainer to go to them to be honest. “These games that are coming up now will stand me in great stead. Coming back to Derry with that experience under my belt will be good. I need to be playing men’s football at the age I am, that will take me on and develop me as a player.”  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on. --  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnailsADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Last updated    : Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Preloved Threads, on Derrys Waterloo Street, opens in a bid to reuse, repair and recycle unwantedclothingDerry NewsDerry woman opens store giving second le to unwanted clothing overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derry lads, Paddy and Shaun, open new barbers, SCTION, on their firstbusiness venture togetherDerry NewsDerry lads open new barbers on their firstbusiness venture together overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices -

So punctual in fact that East Down ACrsquos Sharon Madine missed the start of that race and so she talked herself into doing the K as penance.There were  starters with plenty of quality runners at the front of the pack, who were obviously there to do more than merely run off the turkey.The top five men broke  minutes with Gerard Heaney of North Belfast Harriers taking the win in ..The fastest female was Dearbhla Cox of Annadale Striders in .. East Down had five entrants including three juniors.Oliver Robinson led the club home in . which is a massive  seconds faster than his previous best that was set in Victoria parkrun a few months. Jacob Crawford crossed the line in . showing that the consistent training is paying off and James Wright was delighted to breach  minutes and gain a new personal best time of ..These results are a great morale booster for the youngsters. Maureen Kellyensured that the family standards were upheld when she also bagged a personal best with ..Margueritesaid that it took at least until halfway to thaw her frozen hands and she was glad to see the finish line looming.She was happy enough with her time of . and even happier to jump in the car and head home.In the K which began at .am there were  entrants. The top three finishers were in within the  minute barrier.In first place was Ben Branaghin a time of ..The top female was Gillian McCrory, representing St Peterrsquos AC, in .. East Down AC had four runners, all female and as mentioned, Sharon Madine was only there by default.Having got lost en-route and failed to get to the K start, she felt that the only way to save face was to run the K.She actually ran very well and in the end was happy to have doubled her exercise goal for the day. Her time of . placed her as th female out of  and was not that far off her personal best.This is impressive since she prefers K to K and also that she arrived with no intention of racing that distance.In addition the blustery conditions were not ideal for chasing times. Alison and Ella Carroll opted for the K over the K based on the later start and the chance of a lie in.It turned out that the rain had also eased by then so it was a good call. Alison ran a well paced race and was as pleased with her consistent splits as she was with her time of ..Ella has not fitted much training in as of late but with characteristic grit she ploughed on to the finish in a time of ..Mags Flynn slipped across the line between these two in a very respectable ..It was a well organised event with adequate parking and toilets. All entrants received a t-shirt and medal and even the poor weather did not detract from the smug feeling of achievement for those who turned out. Kudos to Glenn Grant for his efforts to make this happen.Meanwhile closer to home, the rain had cleared early on to give a bright mild day. Gordy Graham was out for the Burren Townland ten miler and said it was almost too warm.The contrast in the photos of this compared to the Belfast meet is marked. Gordy had a great race and took the win by a clear margin in a time of . but he was keen to point out that his closest adversary, Brendan Heaney, was denied the chance to race it out when he took an unfortunate tumble.Gordy had the good grace to help his rival up but it seemed that the fall took its toll and Brendan never really got back on track.He did hold on to second place but he was four minutes behind Gordy in the end. Another podium for Gordy to end a successful year. It was no surprise to find that Niall Gibney was in the mountains on Boxing Day.However, this time instead of a solo escapade, he had signed up for the annual Turkey trot organised by BARF .This arduous run started at Meelmore Lodge then headed up the lane to the Mourne Wall. The climbing continued up to Trassey Track Ford and then up to the Bernagh-Meelmore col.Niall said that the paths were like mini streams after the deluge on Christmas Day and he described the river crossing below the col as ldquointeresting.To others that probably means practically impassable but the runners toiled on finally reaching Meelmore-Meelbeg Saddle.Our intrepid mountain man reported that, ldquoFrom here the brakes were off and it was a fun fast slippery downhill to the Happy Valley.

Registration had opened months in advance and entries sold out in record time, a clear indication that this race has become a firm favourite for the elite and the not so elite runner.For most, it is the sense of turning up on the day not knowing what to expect. The race has two unique selling points.Firstly, you have to run with a partner and you are only ever as good as your other half.Many alliances come unstuck on the hills and in the mud and friendships are often lost, regained and lost again as the race unfolds.Secondly, and perhaps more uniquely, only a select few know the course in advance and they are sworn to secrecy.This is unusual in that most of us go to a race knowing what to expect in terms of distance, terrain and elevation: not so with this one.The only information is that it begins and ends in Castlewellan and it is between eight-and-a-half and nine miles .The course this year was a very tightly guarded secret with only those entrusted to assist with the marking on the eve of the race getting any real insight.When asked to describe the course, the Prophet simply stated: lsquoit will stun the legs and play with the headrsquo.These words rang in my head as I ran around fields that I never expected to, climbed hills that I never climbed before and at one point,my eyesight is not failing, saw Sherpa Tenzing throwing down ropes and herding a cabinet of yaks.At the business end of proceeding, there was some real class on parade with Irish mountain running sensation Zak Hannapaired with Andrew Annett , a man in great form as evidenced by his superb win in the Armagh Ten.This international pairing with real climbing pedigree firmly lived up to their billing as odds-on favourites and were almost three minutes ahead of their nearest challengers, the youthful pairing of Jared Martinand Tom Crudgington .With many years of running ahead, both these young men are capable of winning the race in the not-too-distant future.The podium was completed by the last minute pairing of Jonny Scottand Aaron McGrady , who hooked up on the morning of the event due to late withdrawals.The chemistry was clearly good and the partnership worked as they came home in just over  minutes ndash  seconds adrt of Martin and Crudgington.The ladiesrsquo race was a tighter affair with Amanda Perry and Denise Logue from Ballydrain winning by  seconds from Dearbhla Coxand Niamh Donnelly .The podium was completed by Clair Quigley and Fiona McQuillan .The mixed team event is always closely fought and this year was no dferent. With a mile to go to the finish, eventual winners Aidan Brownand Nakita Burkewere still under pressure from Stephen Connolly and Caitlyn Harvey from North Down AC.However, in the final twists and turns the former prevailed and ran out winners by around a minute, finishing eighth and tenth overall respectively.The podium was completed by Neil McGeough, Newcastlersquos rising star, and his partner, Irish Olympian Kerry OrsquoFlaherty, an athlete more at home on the track and over barriers than climbing ditches.Throughout the field there was great camaraderie and the craic was mighty. Social media was buzzing after the race with participants commenting that this was the best course they had ever ran over, despite the numerous challenges that it presented.The race organisers are indebted to everyone, too many to mention inidually, who contributed in any way to the success of the event.It brought great joy to those taking part and spectating at a time when anything that improves our well-being is something to celebrate..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/5_January2022_Down.jpg","title":"McCartan hopes for dream start back at the helm  ","story":"DOWN manager James McCartan will be looking for a dream start to hisat the helm this Friday when his Mourne side take on Donegal in the first round of the Dr McKenna Cup.The red and black outfit will travel to MacCumhail Park for a .pm throw-in, in what will be the first piece of action for the county this year.The ing fan favourite will not be under any illusions as to the level of stf competition his footballers will face off against, as they travel to the home of last yearrsquos Ulster semi-finalists.Antrim are the other outfit that make up Section A, with Down welcoming the Saffrons to Newry in their second game next Tuesday.McCartan has already faced adversities in his second stint as boss before his team have even lined out, due to a number of regular Mourne players ruled out of contention.Carryduff duo James Guinness and Owen McCabe, Bryansford shot-stopper Marc Reid and experienced Burren duo Gerard McGovern and Donal OrsquoHare are among those unavailable.The former All-Star man in charge, alongside assistant Aidan OrsquoRourke, have already began drafting in suitable replacements and have recently been given a notable boost in the form of ing former captain Niall McParland.The Glenn clubman has ed following three years teaching in Doha, Qatar, and will be someone who McCartan looks to in order to bring his wealth of experience to the rest of the side ndashespecially those who are up and coming talents.ldquoThe squad has changed but itrsquos good to see some new faces in the , said McParland.ldquoJames and Aidan have a handle on everyone in the county and they have a good squad together so far.ldquoI was happy to get the call to go back because I didnrsquot knowI would get it ndash I donrsquot take anything for granted, he continued.ldquoNow Irsquom fighting for my place in the team.Alongside this encouraging news for the county, current star Barry OrsquoHagan believes Down could benefit even further from an influx of Kilcoo players.However, the current champions of Down are currently hoping to retain their Ulster title when they face off against Derrygonnelly on January , which will see them out of action until things unfold.With this meaning they will not be available for selection for the Dr McKenna Cup, this doesnrsquot necessarily rule out some of the  featuring in the Division Two league campaign.ldquoAt the minute, therersquos probably eight or nine of them you would definitely want in, said OrsquoHagan.ldquoWhether they commit or not I donrsquot know, itrsquos up to those men, but you need the talent and the experience those boys have.ldquoObviously their full focus is on Kilcoo at the minute, as yoursquod expect..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/12January2021-GoDigital.jpg","title":"New benches to be installed at Inch Abbey  ","story":"THE replacement of benches at Inch Abbey, outside Downpatrick, has been welcomed by local MLA Colin McGrathThe SDLP politician contacted the Department of Communities Historic Environment Division after learning that a bench had been removed from the site.He said: ldquoInch Abbey is one of our most beautul historic sites.

He also taught commercial subjects like arithmetic and bookkeeping, for use in commerce and industry.Dr Neilson and his clergymen sons were notable for their warm cross-denominational outlook.Fr Luke Walsh, PP in North Antrim, near Ballycastle, spoke highly of his old Kilmore tutor: ldquoI was educated by a Presbyterian clergyman, a man of as great moral worth and sterling integrity as Ireland could boast of.In , as Bishop of Down and Dromore, William Crolly described Rev James Neilson of Downpatrick as ldquoone of the most liberal and respected clergymen in Co Down.Around  Moses began compiling an Irish grammar, later assisted by his son William. In their pursuit of Irish studies, the two Neilsons collaborated with Patrick Lynch, principal of a distinguished Irish and Classical academy in Loughinisland, six miles away.In March  William Neilson was installed as minister of Dundalk Presbyterian Church. This was a perfect fit for his developing academic interests. Attached to the Dundalk congregation was a colony of Gaelic-speaking Scots Presbyterians living in Ballymascanlon.Originally from Argylle, they had fought for King William in . Hence it was a standing requirement that the congregationrsquos clergy be fluent in Irish.William thrived in Dundalk. In the late s Irish was still the first language with large parts of the population in Down and Louth . He preached widely in Irish. In July  he went on a preaching tour of Ulster, achieving wide popularity.RebellionBack in Co Down, and during the  Rebellion period, his preaching activities on one occasion brought him into collision with the military authorities. His father was actually Moderator in the year of the Rising.Dr Moses needed permission from General Nugent to hold the General Synodin Lurgan that August. One Sunday in  his son William was invited back to his fatherrsquos church, to preach in Irish. The event generated considerable interest, and the church was packed.The authorities were nervous in the wake of the rebellion and news of this unusually large assembly soon reached official ears.Halfway through the sermon a party of yeomen entered the church. With no space left to seat them, they occupied the twin staircases leading up to the pulpit. When William had finished preaching they promptly arrested him, and seized theof his sermon.The soldiers involved were likely from the Kilmore Yeomanry. Their Lieutenant at the time was Charles Hamilton, William Strain of Kilmore was a sergeant, and Patrick Soy of \"Tollinagrew\" a private.They marched William all the way to Down Gaol in Downpatrick, newly opened on the Mall in  . Their arrival likely caused some consternation with the Gaol Governor, because the Neilson clergy were widely known to be loyal to the Crown.Rev William bailed by Rev JamesScrambling to smooth over this military faux pas, the Governor sent across town for James Neilson, brother of the prisoner, and minister of the nearby Stream Street Presbyterian congregation. The Rev William was then bailed into the custody of the Rev James,with instructions to appear in court next day.Next morning the magistrate encountered a dficulty mdash he couldnrsquot understand the manuscript of Williamrsquos sermon, preached in Irish the day before. William helpfully offered to translate. It transpired the contents were innocuous, and the prisoner was promptly released. The details of this intriguing episode were recorded a century later by a Neilson descendant .Academic careerIn Dundalk William ran a Classical and mercantile academy similar to his fatherrsquos. In an astonishing burst of creativity, he continued to develop his skills as a linguist.In  he published Greek exercises in syntax, ellipsis, dialects, prosody and metaphrasis. In recognition of this, Glasgow University awarded him an honorary DD in . In  he was elected Presbyterian Moderator. In  he published Introduction to the Irish language, on the basis of which he was elected MRIA in .There were a number of advantages in learning Irish, William explained. For academics, it gave essential insights into other European languages. And for the wider population, it enabled competent communication with those large sections of the population whose first language was still Irish.In contemporary Ireland, he asserted, clergymen, lawyers and farmers could not conduct their business properly without a knowledge of Irish.Paradoxically, the subjects taught in schools run by the Neilson clergy, and others, eventually undermined the use of Irish nationally. The Industrial Revolution was in full swing, and employment opportunities in industry and commerce were exploding.For those without a knowledge of English, Irish-only fluency was becoming an overwhelming disadvantage. When the new national school system was instituted in Ireland in , teachers knew that English was now the essential passport to wider employment.The great Daniel OrsquoConnell ruefully acknowledged the new reality. ldquoAlthough the language is associated with many recollections that twine round the hearts of Irishmen, yet the superior utility of the English tongue, as the medium of all modern communication is so great, that I can witness, without a sigh, the gradual disuse of Irish.At that time there were a number of ieties of Irish, but under the new dispensation the vernacular spoken in East Ulster eventually became extinct. Fortunately William Neilson preserved many Co Down examples in his  Grammar. In the words of his descendant Joseph Nelson, Williamrsquos ldquodialogues and familiar phrases, which form the second part, are a complete guide to the ideas as well as the phrases of the peasantry.Untimely deathIn  William was appointed professor of classical languages and Hebrew at the Belfast Academical Institution. In April  he was elected professor of Classics at Glasgow University. However, he had contracted rheumatic fever, and died on the th of that month, aged only . He was buried in the family vault close to the west gable of his fatherrsquos church in Rademon.A full colour pamphlet based on this article has been produced by Rowallane and Slieve Croob Community Group, to accompany Joyce Gibsonrsquos ongoing Irish language classes in Ballynahinch Market House..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/5_January2022_TheStars.jpg","title":"While I love the sound of Latin I’m not sure I’d be great at it I’m currently doing ballroom and my posture works well with it  ","story":"LOVE Island star Matthew MacNabb said he has no qualms about showing off his chest when he takes part in RTE Onersquos Dancing With The Stars on Sunday evening.The  year-old Downpatrick man will be putting on his dancing shoes to compete with his professional dance partner against  other celebrities and personalities.His time on Dancing With The Stars will be a lot dferent than when he appeared on the hit dating show over the summer.The body builder and fitness fanatic made a real impression on the show, even though he did not make to the final as he failed to stay in a couple.His physique was admired by contestants and viewers and he was loved for his deadpan humour and his speedy dumping of former love interest, Kaz Kamwi.Male celebrities on Dancing With The Stars are usually asked to embrace being sprayed tanned, wearing quite flamboyant costumes and make-up for the show.Matthew admitted: ldquoIrsquove got to be honest, itrsquos an adjustment but I donrsquot really have much shame so Irsquoll go with it and enjoy it.

This body of work celebrates the humanism and psychological dexterity of us all, both inidually and as a gender sector.ldquoWorking as an inidual to support equality for both males and females is wonderful.ldquoBut, by working together to achieve it as a society. Then we are invincible and real change can happen.She added: ldquoThis is especially relevant during these unprecedented, pandemic times. Where the glass ceiling still remains almost permanently unbroken.ldquoMore importantly, domestic abuse has increased horrendously, behind shut doors during the  months of lockdown.Newry, Mourne and Down Council chairwoman Cathy Mason is supporting the event.She said: ldquoWomen are key to the fabric of our society and the day to day working of our world. Yet, we still see women disproportionately under-represented in areas such as education employment and leadership. No doubt women are also disproportionately affected by austerity including the cuts to Universal Credit and cuts to public sector jobs.ldquoIt is sad that still today, women continue to face long standing structural inequalities that push more women out of employment and into a state of economic deadlock.Taking a male view point on the subject, Cllr Glyn Hanna said: ldquoI have been involved in politics for years and also have a business. I have seen on many occasions that there remain equality issues for women in work places.ldquoI have three daughters who all have professional jobs. I have been told by them of their experiences of sexual discrimination and inequality and their feelings that they have to work harder to get respect doing a job. More work does need done to address this problem urgently.Agreeing with both councillors, Lise said: ldquoWhat the councillors are saying is so true. So passionate am I to keep female equality high on the public agenda, itrsquos the focus of the creation and touring of this exhibition. It is at the core of my lsquoI Am Womanrsquo Arts and Cultural Programme.She added: ldquoI am focused on promoting all forms of equality and ersity in Northern Ireland.The I Am Woman programme was first launched at Parliament Buildings, Stormont, in September and was attended by MLAs and VIPs.But Lisersquos work is not just focused at reaching the ear of politicians.She said: ldquoMy personal agenda is more about reaching out and spreading the necessity for equality, in all formats. In all walks of our society, from both a ground level up and top down.ldquoI feel that we all have a moral responsibility, when it comes to supporting and promoting female, and other, equality here in Northern Ireland. Forwe donrsquot work together, then nothing changes.ldquoMy programmes are embracing, not preaching. They aim to break down the dferences we have as a society by promoting better knowledge, tolerance and understanding.ldquoThe laws that govern us all, especially those written in relation to females, do definitely need to change for equality to happen.She continued: ldquoWe, as a society, also have to encourage change from the ground level up. Educating our young people and changing adult preconceived perceptions are also so important.ldquoBoys and girls, men and women. We are all iniduals who should be treated fairly and equally. By law, and by society in general.ldquoIt is therefore important to engage and stand up for change now. Otherwise, females will continue to be treated as second class citizens in Northern Ireland, for generations to come.ldquoBoth males and females have so much to give our society. In order for a fairer, more democratic society to exist. Females should always be treated equally at all levels.Lise added: ldquoAfter all, it is women who make up the majority of the adult population in this country.This is Lisersquos third project to be showcased at Parliament Buildings.Any school or business interested in hosted Lisersquos exhibitions and or workshops should email LiseMcGreevyPhotographic@gmail..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.impartialreporter.com/news/resources/images/13227668.jpg","title":"news","story":"As a subscriber, you are shown % lessThose ads you do see are predominantly from local businesses promoting local servicesThese adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

That way you don’t have to remember what you said.’ Unfortunately it is too late for Boris to try this. He is a serial spoofer.Simply incapable of honesty. Kate Hoey has uncovered the Elite Nationalist Network conspiracy, of which Tim McGarry is a partWhether it be partners, parties, or Protocols Boris’ policy is always to BYOB — bring your own BS. Boris has now finally admitted that he was at the party on th May  and has said sorry to Parliament. What happens next I’m writing this on Wednesday sohe is no longer prime minister by the time the News Letter hits the shops on Thursday morning I apologise. I’m going to assume that our esteemed leader is still holed up in Downing Street desperately trying to think of plausible explanations and excuses to tell Sue Gray when Sue starts her investigation. Apparently he’s narrowed it down to seven possibilities. You are invited to select your favourite lie or the most likely Boris Bluff from the following scenarioSCENE – INTERIOR  DOWNING STREET. DAYBORIS JOHNSON IS AT HIS DESK STARING AT A COMPUTER. HE LOOKS VERY SERIOUS.

OK I’ll make this quick. Why were you at that party CLOSE UP OF BORIS. THINKING. WHICH EXCUSE WILL HE CHOOSE BORISWell Sue em the thing is..em…. I am not Boris Johnson. My name is actually Bojak Johnkovic the world famous tennis player. So the rules don’t apply to me.. The party at Number  was not a party. It was a republican funeral, so the rules didn’t apply to this event.. I was not at the party. I sent a lookalike with a wig. At the time of the partyI was actually in flagrante with a lady friend who is not my we. . I didn’t intend to be at the party. I was only in the garden at Number  because Carrie and I had the decorators in. And when you’re spending £, on a bit of painting and decorating you’d best stay out of their way. . Alright yes, I was at the party but Sammy Wilson and Paul Frew told me it was safe and they are world renowned experts on virology.. Yes I was at the party but I didn’t organise it. In fact I was the one who stopped them hiring Van Morrison to do the cabaret. . Wibble wibble, whf waff, vaccine roll out, carpe diem, Diocletian, I got Brexit done, fancy a wee tete a tete on the terrace Sue  Bring your own wine. Ok how about a PPE contract would that shut you up • I am part of the Elite Nationalist Network – and Kate has sussed usAt the risk of annoying Kate Hoey, I wish to confess to you my readers that many years ago I used to be in the legal profession. Having driven the united Ireland agenda as far as I could by being a third rate lawyer I then became involved in the media and now look at me! Yes I admit it. I am a fully paid up member of the Elite Nationalist Network. Kate has sussed us out. She has uncovered the ENN conspiracy. We Tims are busy infiltrating everywhere in our typically sly unreformed papist way. Like every other Catholic, ex-Catholic, lapsed Catholic or person with a vaguely Catholic sounding name, I can’t and don’t think for myself. I am simply a deep undercover proto-Shinner whose sole aim in le is to destroy Ulster. I shouldn’t really be telling you this, but the Elite Nationalist Network meets every second Thursday after Mass. We meet in Joe Brolly’s house, or the nearest GAA hall. All discussions are held in Irish in case Ben Lowry is eavesdropping. We first of all discuss how Celtic are doing, debate which fish is best for Friday dinner, sing Amhran na bhFiann, say a quick decade of the Rosary and then we Zoom link up with our paymasters in Dublin and Rome who give us our orders.For instance last year His Holiness Pope Francis himself gave me my secret Elite Nationalist Network mission. He commanded me to infiltrate the traditional unionist media by having a column in the News Letter.This week at ENN, we discussed how to fatally undermine the link between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK. After much debate we decided that the best way to sabotage the Union was just to let Kate Hoey, Jamie Bryson and Jim Allister get on with what they are doing. So we agreed to do nothing. Typical lazy fenians. Honestly, it’s a wonder we were able to become the Elite.——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

The gutless attitude of the British government not including protection for Northern Ireland veterans, along with other soldiers who served in other places in conflict, is now coming back to bite them. Using British taxpayers’ money to take spurious cases, many of which happened around  years ago and have already been to even foreign courts for judgement, shows it is easy to continue when you do not have to pay any of the expenses. The vast majority of IRA crimes will never be investigated let alone resolved as we have a justice system that has become an embarrassment, where the guilty go free and those who helped stop civil war and upheld law and order are hounded. The justice system in Northern Ireland needs to be rubbed out and drawn over again. There are too many lawyers making millions at the British taxpayers’ expense. It is time for the purse strings of legal aid to be tightened. The British and, dare I say, some unionist politicians have played into the hands of republicans and their lawfare against the British state.

Police are in contact with the Cabinet Office over claims that Martin Reynolds, a senior aide to the Prime Minister, organised a \"bring your own booze\" party in the garden behind No  during Englands first lockdown in May . Picture date: Tuesday January , .“Yesterday, when I got up to speak I thought of her and I sort of tried to say to myself ‘don’t think of that’ but the more I said ‘don’t think of her’, the more I did. I wasn’t in control, that’s just a fact.”He continued: “The fact is, Jemima died in five days. She went into hospital on Monday and she was dead on Friday. We could never go and see her. I wanted to say this yesterday but I couldn’t. “Jemima died in the Ulster Hospital in Dundonald in a side ward. We couldn’t see her. We couldn’t hold her hand. We couldn’t tell her we loved her. We couldn’t tell her how much we would miss her. My we couldn’t be there either.“And my sister-in-law, Roberta, was in intensive care in the same ward and she couldn’t even go across and see her because it was against the rules.“Whenever she died, as you know in Northern Ireland whenever you die the funeral is usually within four or five days at the most, usually three. We had to wait over  days,  days,  days to get her buried. The coffin was closed. Those were the rules, so we couldn’t see her lovely face either.”He added: “We were only allowed  people at the funeral, and it’s a big family. It’s aggrieved me greatly ever since. We had to put out an invitation list to the funeral because we had to restrict the numbers. “There were people who wanted to be there who couldn’t be there. There were people who should have been there who weren’t. “We followed the rules. We followed all the rules and so did everyone  who lost loved ones.”The Strangford MP explained how others have been in contact to share their experiences.“A great number of people have contacted me who have lost their brother, or lost their mother, their father,” he said. “I don’t know the people but what I said definitely struck a chord.“I had a minister come to me today and he said ‘look Jim, I really appreciated what you had to say. My we is in hospital and I couldn’t go and see her. I played by the rules’. “They lost their twins and he said he couldn’t be close to his we, he had to go home. “I have had other ministers who have spoken to me, and people who have emailed me and texted me from all sorts of parties, all over the chamber.”On the ‘bring your own booze’ event attended by the prime minister, Mr Shannon said he had confidence in the ongoing investigation, before adding: “I’m not setting out looking for anybody’s scalp, but I am looking for justice.”He continued: “And I have to say that the people who are contacting me, they want justice. All of these emails and all of these texts, I think that reflects the public opinion. People are saying to me ‘you followed the rules, Jim, and so did we’. “I want, indeed I demand on behalf of my own family and my constituents who have lost loved ones, a thorough, detailed and energetic investigation with all the evidential base that is quite apparent at this time.“If anyone has broken the rules, that we adhered to when we buried my mother-in-law and all the other fmailies who followed the rules across the United Kingdom, I want severe penalties against those who knowingly contravened the rules when everybody  adhered.”Mr Shannon added: “There seemed to be no consideration for the ordinary man and woman, who lost loved ones and whose heart is sore today. My mother-in-law passed away  months ago and we feel that every day.”——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

There is a coastal walk, chance to go fishing, surfing and views of Tusker Rock.For those owners who may not yet have ventured to the beach with their pups or are concerned about behaviour while at the beach, Wood Green’s dog behaviour and training specialist, Wendy Kruger, has provided some tips to prepare your dog for the beach.• Ensure your dog’s microchip and collar tag details are up to date – just in case.• Get used to checking ground surface temperatures before you take your dog out, as dry sand can be too hot for dogs’ paws on sunny days. To check the ground temperature, place the back of your hand on the ground. If its too hot to hold comfortably for five seconds, it’s too hot for dogs’ paws..remove• Practise basic, reward-based training when out and about to help your dog to maintain focus and engagement on walks.• Recall is also an area that needs particular attention. Evenyour dog has a great recall at home, its not something that can be guaranteed in unfamiliar environments with exciting new distractions. Games with toys are a fantastic way to help your dog engage with you when there are other distractions around. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

As you will have heard in the media, this new Omicron iant of COVID is very infectious. But it does not appear to cause serious illnessyou have been double or triple vaccinated. But frankly I am shocked how badly the biochemistry of this virus has been explained by politicians and so-called experts. As a biochemist with an international reputation please forgive meI try to explain. When you are vaccinated in the arm the main antibody generated is called IgG. This should stop serious illness. But when you get infected in the respiratory tract you also produce another type called IgA. This is secreted into the tract. Also, there is a dferent T-lymphocyte response when you are infected directly there. So, vaccination in the arm will not necessarily stop you getting COVID because your vaccination doesnt activate the IgA production sufficiently. Furthermore, for your immune system to activate against COVID, you have to produce some of the virus and its antigen. This would make you test positive by PCR, which is very sensitive, and probably by lateral flow. Thus, the problem is thatyou get COVID, even mildly, then you would have to isolate for ten days, and this would spoil Christmas again. We can’t risk this. That is why Penarth Bridge Club will close until th January . But here is an interesting hand from last week where the challenge for North South was to bid a slam. But which one – six hearts or seven clubs The AuctionSouth opened the auction with his five-card heart suit. North with fteen points knows game must be on, and maybe a slam. So, he bid two clubs. South felt his hand was strong enough now to reverse, keeping his support for clubs till a later bid. North was tempted to jump to four hearts but this might prevent them reaching a slam. So, he bid three hearts, knowing his partner would bid on after his reverse bid of two spades. Indeed, South now needed to show his support for clubs and so bid four clubs. North now bid four no trumps, Roman key card Blackwood. They were playing   so South’s response of five diamonds must show three key cards with clubs as trumps. North now could see seven clubs must be on, as South’s key cards must be the ace of spades, the ace of hearts and the king of clubs..removeThe playTrick  – East led the queen of diamonds, declarer winning the trick with his ace of diamonds, discarding a spade from dummy. Trick  – North considered the hand. Was he going to take the spade finesse  In fact,the hearts were   or   then he could discard his losing spade on the final heart. But trumps first. He played the ace of clubs from his hand. Trick  – He followed this by winning the next trick with dummy’s king of clubs. Good news. The defenders trumps were  , so he would not have to risk taking the spade finesse. Tricks ,  and  - Declarer then won the next three tricks with his king and queen and dummy’s ace of hearts. Trick  – He then ruffed a heart in his hand, establishing dummy’s last heart as a winner. Trick  – Declarer then ed to dummy by ruffing a diamond. Trick  – He then played dummy’s winning last heart, discarding the two of spades from his hand. Tricks  and  – He then played the ace of spades, followed by a small spade which he ruffed in hand. Trick – Declarer then ruffed his last losing diamond with dummy’s last trump. Tricks  – Declarer then claimed the last trick with his remaining club, the grand slam making with thirteen tricks for score of  - one spade, four hearts, one diamond, two diamond ruffs in dummy, and five clubs in hand. Well bid and well played. Six hearts makes but not seven, because East held four trumps.What have we learnt . It is often a good idea to show your partner a strong hand by reversing, as here, before showing support for his suit.. Once again Roman key card Blackwood.is an essential part of your armoury to reach a slam.. Always checkyou can establish small cards in a suit by ruffing before considering a finesse.Penarth club resultsFriday  December . Trish Tracey and Tony Campbell. Jim Elder and Meryl Skipper.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityWith the success of the Games and China’s national dignity at stake, Beijing is doubling down on its “zero-tolerance” Covid- policy.Across China, more than  million people are in some form of lockdown, with many prevented from leaving their homes.Tianjin, only about an hour from Beijing, is on high alert, although it has refrained from imposing a complete lockdown such as the one in Xi’an, a city of  million. vw,vw,px, px\"A screening area for Winter Olympics spectators in Beijing Instead, it has sealed off several residential communities and universities, cancelled almost all flights, suspended high-speed train services and closed motorways. People leaving the city are required to present negative Covid- tests and receive special permission.The city conducted mass testing for a second time for its  million residents on Wednesday, and asked them to stay in their homes until they receive a negative result.Tianjin’s proximity to Beijing makes the timing particularly fraught. During the Tokyo Olympics in July, Japan saw a widespread outbreak driven by the Delta iant.Despite that, the disruptions for people in Tianjin remain relatively light.“Everything is fine, the supermarkets and restaurants, you can go to all normally,” said Yu Xuan, who works at a university in Tianjin.Wang Dacheng, another resident, said his father who has trouble walking was able to get tested in their apartment. vw,vw,px, px\"Residents line up for Covid testing in Tianjin “Tianjin people are pretty optimistic, everyone’s been very calm and collected,” Mr Wang said.Elsewhere, in Xi’an to the west and several cities in Henan province, the measures are far more onerous, leading to complaints that people sequestered in their homes were running out of food..removeChina has followed the uncompromising policy almost from the start of the pandemic, beginning with the unprecedented step of sealing off  million people in the central city Wuhan where the virus was first detected, along with other parts of the province of Hubei in January .It has been able to deal with local outbreaks through lockdowns, strict border controls and contact tracing aided by increased digital surveillance. The measures have kept the virus from spreading into a full-fledged national outbreak so far. The vaccination rate now tops %.With the Olympics due to begin on February  and support staff already arriving, the task has become even more critical. Whether Beijing’s safeguards will hold up in face of the Omicron iant is a crucial question.“I think it truly is a critical juncture for China. Can it stave off Omicron ” said Dali Yang, a professor of Chinese politics at the University of Chicago.China reported  domestically transmitted cases on Thursday, including  in Henan province and  in Tianjin. Authorities have reported a total of , cases, , of them currently active, and , deaths, a figure that has not changed in months.Beijing’s Olympic bubble is even stricter than Tokyo’s, which was mostly effective in stopping transmission, despite some leakages, said Kenji Shibuya, research director at the Tokyo Foundation for Policy Research and a public health expert.Beijing faces a potentially bigger risk because the more contagious Omicron iant has shown itself adept at evading vaccines.Moreover, the lack of widespread outbreaks means the Chinese population is protected only by vaccines and not from antibodies produced by previous infections, said Dr Vineeta Bal, a top Indian immunologist.“The Olympics would be the first trial,” said Dr Bal, adding that Omicron “can easily travel in China”.Unlike the Tokyo Olympics bubble, there will be no contact between those inside and the outside world.Officials, athletes, staff and journalists will travel between hotels and competition venues on specially designated vehicles in what is described as a closed-loop system..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagagaga, title: China faces Omicron test just weeks ahead of Beijing Olympics article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

Members were informed the council will be launching an online survey to judge where or , there is enough interest in providing the borough’s citizens with allotment space.The survey will run for a period of eight weeks and once completed, officers will provide councillors who sit on the committee with options on how best to move forward on the matter.Speaking at the meeting, Alliance Party Councillor Eoin Tennyson said he would be delightedthis process resulted in an enhancement of allotment provision in the borough.An online survey is to be carried out to seetheres a demand for allotment space.“It is great to see the online consultation coming forward to determine what the demand is in the community,” he said.“I know allotment projects have been successful in other parts of Northern Ireland and there are good private providers here so it would be fantastic , out of this process, we could enhance our own provision or even have better partnerships with those providers in the borough.“That would be really positive for those in the borough who want to grow their own food.”Ulster Unionist Party Councillor Julie Flaherty told the chamber she believed there would be strong demand for this service.An online survey is to be carried out to seetheres a demand for allotment space.“I suspect there will be a huge interest in these allotments,” said Cllr Flaherty.“In the centre of Portadown there is a vegetable group, the group attached to that has  members and some of them are growing at home and learning how to use what they grow.“Recycling, composting, you name it, there are over  members there in the centre of Portadown. That is a good gauge of the level of interest and we are very proud of the guys at sustain who have worked very hard over lockdown too.”Speaking after the meeting, Cllr Tennyson continued to speak highly of the proposal and noted the strong demand for allotment space in other council areas.“Community allotments can have a positive impact on mental health and wellbeing, and on the local environment,” said Cllr Tennyson.“We have some fantastic allotment providers in the borough. However, there is clearly huge demand and it would be fantastic to see greater council support for existing providers and potentially even some new council-owned sites.I first raised the issue of allotment provision at committee in September. It’s fantastic to see progress on the matter. The proposed survey will be good news to many local residents who wish to grow their own food but don’t currently have access to appropriate facilities.“Information presented at committee clearly highlighted the popularity of allotments in other areas with both Antrim and Newtownabbey and Mid and East Antrim Council, with some having waiting lists of five years or more.“Once the online survey has been completed, Council will analyse the results to determinethere is demand additional allotment provision and put plans in place to meet that demand.”Craigavon Borough CouncilBanbridgeArmagh CityUlster Unionist Party  \"       \"  ]]Most PopularSuspended jail term for Larne man...NewsShocked mum pulls child back from road as lorry drives throu...NewsNewtownabbey PSNI appeal after young cyclist struck by Jeep...NewsCannabis found hidden in Newtownabbey man’s trainer at Holyw...NewsRathcoole resident pays tribute to NIHE staff...NewsMost PopularFrom Killeter to Domremy...RecommendedEmma takes on Hospice Support Group role...Recommended                       This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us on    ExploreNewsSportWhats OnLestyleYour Northern IrelandRecommendedMore from Northern Ireland WorldAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoNewspaper ArchiveUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessArchiveSubscribeEventsPlace your AdReaders Charter \" fill\"#ea\"  ©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-gsNilK sc-bXTejn cGeDpV iufVtK\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policyModern Slavery Statement       \" d\"M.,.c-.-.-.-.-.-.c-.-.-.-.,-.c.-.,.-.,.,l.-. c.,.,.,.,.,c.-.,.-.,-.L,.c.,.,.,.,,.C.,.,.,.,.,.\"   \" d\"M,.c.,.,.,.,.,.c.,.,.,.,,.c-.,.-.,.-.,l-.,. c-.-.-.-.-.,c-.,.-.,.,,.L.,c-.-.-.-.,-.C.,.,.,.,,.\"   \" d\"M.,c.,,.,.,.,.c,.-.,.-.,.S,.,,.C,.,.,,.,\"    News\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      NewsCoronavirusTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsHealthBusinessEducationEnvironmentPeopleRead ThisFootball\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      FootballIrish League FootballSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      SportMotorcyclingIce HockeyOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      LestyleFood and DrinkTravelHomes and GardensCarsFamilyRetroOpinionYour NI\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      Your NI​Antrim and NewtownabbeyArmagh Banbridge and CraigavonBelfastCauseway Coast and GlensLondonderry Derry City and StrabaneLisburn and CastlereaghMid and East AntrimMid UlsterFermanagh and OmaghNewry Mourne and DownArds and North DownMust ReadContact usAdvertise My BusinessFollow us      "},{"url":"http://www.tyronecon.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/1641825999968.jpg--covid_19___mon_10th_january_figures.jpg?164182600000","title":"covid  mon th january figures ","story":"The NI Department of Health dashboard shows six further coronavirus related deaths and , new positive test results.
