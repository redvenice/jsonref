It’s the way older homeowners can boost their finances and help turn their lives around in retirement. It’s called equity release. And if you’re over 55 then it could work for you. Here are the SEVEN key facts every homeowner aged 55 and over should know... ONE: It’s all about releasing tax-free cash tied up in the value of your home While some people choose to downsize, many are retiring and finding their homes are worth more than their pension funds. Equity release lets you access the money in your home, just like turning 55 lets you access the cash in your pension. The money you release from your home is tax-free and you can spend it however you like.  Even if you have an outstanding mortgage, you can still take out equity release, as long as you pay off any debt secured against your property.  You can use some or all of the funds released to do this.          If you retire and find your home is worth more than your pension fund, equity release can helpTWO: It’s a simple process The most common way is to take out a lifetime mortgage which is a loan secured against your home, but unlike a traditional mortgage there are typically no monthly payments, allowing you to get on with enjoying your retirement.The loan plus roll-up interest is repaid when your equity release plan ends. This is normally when you or your surviving spouse pass away or go into long term care.As straightforward as it sounds, seeking the advice of a leading independent broker like Key Equity Release is crucial to help find a plan that meets your needs. They will also encourage you to involve your closest family so that everyone understands and is involved in the decision. They will explain how it will reduce the value of your estate and may affect your entitlement to means tested benefits – your expert equity release adviser will help you understand any implications specific to your inidual circumstances.            Organising equity release is a simple process, but talk it through with your grown up childrenTHREE: You will still own your homeWith a lifetime mortgage you always own your own home. Plans approved by the Equity Release Council, which Key recommends, offer a cast iron guarantee that you can stay in your home until the plan comes to an end and you can never owe more than your home is worth – so there’s no need to worry about house prices or how much interest builds up.          With a lifetime mortgage you will still own your home - all you\u0027ve done is take out a new loan on itFOUR: The amount you can raise will varyHow much cash you can release with an equity release plan will depend on things such as the value of your home, your age and health. At the time of writing an example from industry expert Key says a 65-year-old in good health could release up to 36 per cent of the value of his or her home. A healthy 80-year-old could release up to 52 per cent. In fact, last year Key enabled their customers to access an average of £86k of tax-free cash from their home. FIVE: You can use the money for anything you wantMany people use the money they release to clear outstanding credit card debts or interest only mortgages – but equally, lots of people use it for life\u0027s luxuries, such as holidays or new cars. A large percentage of people alternatively use it for home improvements, often \u0027future proofing\u0027 their family home with a new en-suite or a downstairs bathroom for the years ahead. Some use the money to help their children or grandchildren pay for homes or education. It\u0027s entirely up to you.Of course, it is always important to remember when releasing equity that you balance current needs with future wants and you should always think carefully before securing a loan against your home.       "},{"url":null,"title":"Harry Meghans child free spirited writes OSCAR CAINER","story":"    Meghan, the Duchess of Sussex arrives with Prince Harry, at the Hive, Wirral Youth Zone, as part of a visit to Birkenhead near LiverpoolMeghan\u0027s bodyguard to quit after just six months in the job...Armed and in killer heels, Meghan\u0027s bodyguard: How the Duke...Share this article  I\u0027m having an April baby!

He was not hurt, but she realized that she wanted to do something, and she plunged herself into photography. She ended up on film sets taking photos of Hollywood legends. Above, Marlon Brando, left, lights the cigarette of director Bernardo Bertolucci, right, on the set for his film \u0027Last Tango In Paris,\u0027 which was released in 1973 but remains controversial today          After realizing she wanted to be a photographer, Sereny learned all she could about the craft. A good friend was the head of the Italian Olympic Committee and asked her to take photos at the youth centers they were developing. Sereny wanted to know if the photos she had taken were any good, and so she hopped on a plane and went to The Times office in London. She met an editor who eventually put her photos into the newspaper. Above, actress Raquel Welch wears a royal blue, one-piece bathing suit in an image Sereny took in the 1980s          Getting her photos in The Times was the first step in Sereny\u0027s career and she would eventually take shots on film sets. Sigourney Weaver, pictured, had just wrapped the first \u0027Alien,\u0027 which was released in 1979. The actress and Sereny both happened to be in Paris, and she was asked to photograph Weaver. Sereny told DailyMail.com that she wanted the shoot to somewhat have a feel of the movie, and it took place at the architecturally-interesting Centre Pompidou, a museum in Paris           \u0027The Last Picture Show,\u0027 released in 1971, had put director Peter Bogdanovich \u0027on the map,\u0027 Eva Sereny wrote in her recent book, \u0027Through Her Lens: The Stories Behind the Photography of Eva Sereny.\u0027 \u0027I could tell he was completely besotted by actress Cybill Shepherd, whom I liked very much. She was very easy to work with and took beautiful pictures.\u0027 Sereny took the above image of Bogdanovich, left, and Shepherd, right, on the set of \u0027At Long Last Love,\u0027 which was released in 1975          Above, an image of director Sydney Pollack, left, and Robert Redford, right, on the set of the film \u0027The Electric Horseman,\u0027 which was released in late 1979. Sereny told DailyMail.com that she worked with four cameras - two that were for color and two that were black and white. ‘I always wanted to be quick,’ she explained. Images like the one above were ‘quite difficult to do because I had no idea how it would come out. Don’t forget, I’m using film – the real McCoy… You hope to God that it’s going to come out right,’ she said          By the 1980s, Sereny had taken photos on several film sets. Producer Frank Marshall  joined Steven Spielberg’s team for ‘Raiders of the Lost Ark’ – the first film of the blockbuster Indiana Jones movies – and asked her to be the special photographer on set.

Sereny took photos on three of the Indiana Jones movies - traveling to Tunisia, Sri Lanka and Marbella in Spain. ‘Of course, working on a Spielberg movie is something very special. Just seeing Steven direct is fascinating,’ she wroteWhile shooting on film sets, she tried to be as unobtrusive as possible – and did not take photos during filming.‘I always put myself very much in the back. I didn’t want to be seen. I wanted to be camouflaged,’ she explained.Even so, there were snafus.When she started taking photos on the set of director Herbert Ross’ ‘The Last of Sheila,’ released in 1973, Raquel Welch, she recalled, ‘shouted at me, “Who the hell are you?”’Ross, the director, come to Sereny’s side and let Welch know that she was alright to be on set.‘I don’t want her here. I don’t want her here,’ Welch said.Sereny said she then ‘disappeared. So that was my first encounter with Raquel.’However, she was slated to work with actress again.‘I was very worried that she would remember me. But she didn’t remember me and I never told her,’ she said and then laughed.Sereny said that they are now great work friends, and she has taken many images of Welch. In one photo that is part of her book, the actress wears a royal blue, one-piece bathing suit. While taking snaps on ‘The Last of Sheila,’ Sereny was also the special photographer for Francois Truffaut’s film, ‘Day for Night,’ which was released in 1973, and that was when she meet her good friend Jacqueline Bisset.‘We connected immediately from the beginning and have been very good friends ever since that movie,’ she wrote in her book.Bisset wrote the foreword for Sereny’s book, saying that her ‘photographs capture the deeper soul.’Truffaut, director of the seminal films ‘The 400 Blows’ and ‘Jules and Jim,’ ‘was always very busy on set, one minute he’d be in a conversation, the next second he was somewhere else. I felt even the little time I was on the set with him he was very understanding and pleasant in his commanding position as a director vis-à-vis his actors and crew,’ Sereny wrote.From dazzling cover girl to playful off-duty star: Rare...\u0027I\u0027m looking forward to revisiting the character\u0027: Harrison...Last Tango in Paris rape scene WAS non-consensual: Director...Share this articleSereny also worked on some of Bernardo Bertolucci’s films, including ‘The Conformist,’ ‘1900,’ ‘Last Tango in Paris,’ and ‘Luna.’‘I have to admit that working with Bernardo has definitely inspired my photography,’ she wrote.For ‘Last Tango in Paris,’ star Marlon Brando initially didn\u0027t want her to take his picture but she managed to convince him. As relayed in her book, she told Brando that he would be shown the photos for his approval.But before she could run the images by Brando, French magazine Paris Match wanted the photos right away.‘All he said was “Don’t worry, Eva: you make the choice.” I was able to gain Brando’s trust in me and my work,’ she wrote. ‘What a great feeling!’ In the book, there is an image of Brando lighting Bertolucci’s cigarette on the set of the film, which remains controversial to this day, and another portrait of the actor fixing his red tie.          Francois Truffaut, left, directed many seminal films, including ‘The 400 Blows’ and ‘Jules and Jim.’ He ‘was always very busy on set, one minute he’d be in a conversation, the next second he was somewhere else,’ Sereny wrote in her book \u0027Through Her Lens.\u0027 Sereny took the above photo during \u0027Day for Night,\u0027 which was released in 1973, and starred Jacqueline Bisset. Bisset and Sereny \u0027connected immediately\u0027 and became friends, she wrote in her book. Bisset penned the foreword for Sereny\u0027s book, writing her ‘photographs capture the deeper soul’          Sereny took the image of Werner Herzog, above, off the film set. ‘He was the most interesting director,’ she wrote of Herzog, adding that he was also charming. She photographed Herzog and his cast during  the filming of \u0027Nosferatu the Vampyre,\u0027 which was shot in the Netherlands. His ‘inspired 1979 remake’ starred Klaus Kinski and Isabelle Adjani, Sereny wrote          Director Steven Spielberg on the set of his movie \u0027Always,\u0027 which starred Audrey Hepburn in what turned out to be her last film. \u0027Always\u0027 was in theaters in late 1989, and Hepburn died on January 20, 1993. Sereny told DailyMail.com that Hepburn was  ‘absolutely extraordinary. She was just gorgeous, just gorgeous. It just makes me tearful really to think that’s she gone.\u0027 Sereny had taken photos on three of Spielberg\u0027s Indiana Jones movies          Director Luchino Visconti, pictured, on set of his  film \u0027Death in Venice,\u0027 which was released in 1971. Sereny took the above photo, and the \u0027Death in Venice\u0027 filming was the second time she had taken snaps on a set. The photos she took of one the film\u0027s stars, Italian actress Silvana Mangano, in costume were featured in The Sunday Times Magazine. ‘That’s how everything started for me. It was enormous,’ Sereny recalled          Sereny took this photo of Peter Bogdanovich during the filming of \u0027At Long Last Love,\u0027 a movie that starred Cybill Shepherd and Burt Reynolds and was in theaters in 1975. After Sereny\u0027s husband was in a car accident in the late 1960s, she knew that she wanted to pursue a creative outlet and chose photography. This photo and others are part of her book, \u0027Through Her Lens\u0027          The first movie set that Eva Sereny was on to take photos was director Mike Nichols\u0027 film \u0027Catch-22,\u0027 released in 1970. Throughout his prolific career, Nichols, pictured above on the \u0027Catch- 22\u0027 set, directed such classics as \u0027The Graduate.\u0027 In her book, Sereny recalled how nervous she was to show Nichols her photos: \u0027I studied his face and didn’t notice a change of expression until, slowly, a broad smile surfaced. All was well. I was asked to stay on for the last two weeks of shooting as a paid special photographer \u0027          In one of the most famous scenes of \u0027Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom,\u0027 star Harrison Ford, playing Jones, cuts the above bridge when he finds himself in a pickle. Sereny took snaps on three of the Indiana Jones films, including this one above with Steven Spielberg, left, and George Lucas, right One of Sereny’s first \u0027photo shoots\u0027 was much less glamorous than Paris: she had to take a shot of her husband’s car after an accident.At around aged 20, Sereny decided to leave London and went to Italy. ‘I was going to stay there for a few months but I stayed there for 50 years,’ she said and then laughed.She married an Italian man, who was an engineer, her first year in Rome and they had two children.One day in 1967, he was on his way to work when his car skidded and went through the side of a bridge.‘I don’t think he even had a scratch – I don’t know how that happened. He had nine lives, thank God,’ she recalled.But he wanted a photo of the car, and Sereny said: ‘Maybe that inspired me.’When the accident happened, Sereny knew that she wanted to do something – she just didn’t know what.‘I knew I was creative but I couldn’t draw. This is God’s truth, I mean, that’s really (what) I was thinking. Maybe photography – I mean literally like that. But I didn’t even think it would become a metier, I mean a profession,’ she recalled. Sereny plunged into photography, getting books and becoming obsessed with developing and printing. ‘I was really, really raw. I didn’t know anything.’ Her first break came from an unlikely source: the Italian Olympic Committee. A good friend was the head of the committee and asked her to take photos at the youth centers they were developing.Sereny wanted to know if the photos she had taken were any good, and so she hopped on a plane and went to London.‘I literally just walked into the foyer of The Times.’At The Times, she met editor Norman Hall, who would take a few days but eventually printed her photos – framing it as future Italian hopefuls for the next Olympics - in the newspaper.Now Sereny had published photos she could show. Her next break was to be hired as a special photographer for director Mike Nichols\u0027 1970 film ‘Catch-22.’ In her book, she explained that a special photographer was ‘someone who just comes to the set and sends their work out via their agency – I was with Camera Press at the time – or directly to newspapers and magazines.’‘The way I like to approach my job is to catch images of the off-moments, when the cameras are not rolling, by focusing on the actors in character, in this way I can still manage to catch the essence of the film,’ she wrote.            Marlon Brando, above, in a portrait that Sereny took on the film \u0027Last Tango in Paris,\u0027 which was released in 1973. In her book, \u0027Through Her Lens,\u0027 Sereny recounted how she convinced Brando to let her take his picture, telling him that he would get photo approval. But a French magazine, Paris Match, wanted the photos right away and she was unable to show him the images. She wrote: \u0027All he said was \u0027Don’t worry, Eva: you make the choice. I was able to gain Brando’s trust in me and my work. What a great feeling!’          In her book, \u0027Through Her Lens,\u0027 Serent wrote: ‘Working with someone like Fellini was extraordinary. He was an artist who worked without brush or palette.

Sereny told DailyMail.com that she worked at times without an assistant - no small feat when cameras had to be loaded with film - and that she had three cameras around her neck and one in her hand while taking photos          In 1980, Sereny was assigned to take photos of Luciano Pavarotti for the London Observer Magazine. She went to his home in   Modena, Italy. ‘Larger than life in every way and he commanded attention. Well, he had every right – he was one of the greatest tenors of his time,’ she wrote. Sereny told DailyMail.com: ‘He smoked - I didn’t ask him to smoke’          Sereny took the above photo of Clint Eastwood while he was showing her where he would build his home in Carmel, California in the early 1970s. After beating the incumbent, Eastwood would end up being mayor of Carmel from 1986 until 1988, and has been active in politics, speaking at Republican National Conventions          Above, Robert Redford as the character Jay Gatsby. Sereny took photos on the set of \u0027The Great Gatsby,\u0027 the 1974 film adaption of F. Scott Fitzgerald\u0027s classic novel of the same name. The film starred Redford and Mia Farrow as Daisy Buchanan, and was directed by Jack ClaytonA year or two later, she then took photos on the set of Luchino Visconti’s 1971 film ‘Death in Venice.’ The photos she took of one of the film\u0027s star, Italian actress Silvana Mangano, in costume were featured in The Sunday Times Magazine.‘That’s how everything started for me. It was enormous,’ she recalled. By the times the 1980s rolled around, Sereny had already been the special photographer for several well-known directors and their sets, including Peter Bogdanovich’s 1975 ‘At Long Last Love’ starring Cybill Shepherd and Burt Reynolds.     Producer Frank Marshall helped her get the gig on the set of ‘At Long Last Love.\u0027‘He would turn out to become one of my strongest supporters over the years,’ she wrote.After Marshall joined Steven Spielberg’s team for ‘Raiders of the Lost Ark’ – the first film of the blockbuster Indiana Jones movies – he called her up and asked her to be the special photographer on set.‘That’s how an extraordinary adventure began for me,’ Sereny wrote.Sereny took snaps on three of the films: ‘Raiders of the Lost Ark,’ released in 1981, ‘Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom,’ out in theaters in 1984, and ‘Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade,’ released in 1989. She traveled to sets in Tunisia, Sri Lanka, and Marbella in Spain.‘Of course, working on a Spielberg movie is something very special. Just seeing Steven direct is fascinating,’ she wrote.Sereny used to shoot with four cameras: two for black and white, and two for color. Three would be slung around her neck, the fourth in her hand. She often worked without an assistant during a time when cameras needed their film loaded.‘I always wanted to be quick,’ she said about the four cameras. ‘You just had to feel which one was right.’Adding with a laugh: ‘I don’t know how I did it. I really don’t.’Sereny pegged her incredible career to luck and being ready when opportunities arose.‘It’s been a very strange journey doing this book,’ she told DailyMail.com.‘It was an extraordinary journey because many of the times I could not remember… how, when I did do these things. I sometimes think, “Good God, I did that?” ‘             In the spring of 1971, Sereny got a call from actress Romy Schneider whom she had just met a few days earlier on the set of Joseph Losey’s film ‘The Assassination of Trotsky,’ and asked if Sereny would take photos of her. ‘My heart skipped a beat. Romy Schneider was asking to have a photo session with me! This was a very unusual situation. It’s usually the other way around,’ Sereny wrote in her book, \u0027Through Her Lens.\u0027  Above is one of the images of Romy Schneider from that photo shoot, which Sereny wrote lasted until 5am    While shooting on film sets, Sereny said she tried to be as unobtrusive as possible – and did not take photos during filming. Even so, there were snafus.

If behaviour is not managed effectively and learners are not instilled with positive attitudes to learning, nothing much will be learned.’Sean Harford, Ofsted’s national director for education, said: ‘We want to really update the profile of behaviour. If every child behaved in school the standard would rocket up.’Ofsted research shows that while serious and violent incidents have decreased, smaller distractions are on the rise.          Sean Harford (pictured), Ofsted’s national director for education, said that low-level disruption in the classroom needs to be addressed Mr Harford added: ‘There aren’t the terrible examples as often as there were, if you go back 15 to 20 years, of behaviour. The problem now is more one about low-level disruption. That kind of thing is what has been on the rise and is the bane of teachers’ lives.’He said teachers should instil attitudes that can be taken into the workplace, such as punctuality, being courteous and listening to each other.Inspectors will gather evidence for their reports by interviewing staff and pupils to discover whether the school is being strict enough.Luke Tryl, director of corporate strategy, said: ‘We had a series of polling and focus groups with parents.‘They wanted to know would their child be learning in an environment without that low-level disruption and which is free from bullying.’          Education Secretary Damian Hinds has backed the idea of banning mobile phones in schoolsMany schools ban mobiles, an idea backed by Education Secretary Damian Hinds.Teachers have complained that their jobs are made tougher by pupils constantly texting each other during class.

In places where it’s not, support rather than sanction is what is needed.’State schools should teach clever pupils the ‘gift of the gab’ to help them get into Oxbridge, a leading educationalist claims.Barnaby Lenon, ex-head of Harrow and chairman of governors at the London Academy of Excellence, a state-funded college in Newham, east London, known as ‘the Eton of the East End’, said: ‘Natural ability will only get you so far.

It is not clear if there is water at the bottom of the hole, which was reportedly created last December by prospectorsTwo other options have also been considered, although neither has yet been launched.One involves creating another wider hole running parallel to the existing well which would be made slighter deeper and link to the first hole in a U-bend.The other involves excavating a horizontal tunnel an adult could fit into through the hillside to the spot where rescuers hope to eventually locate Julen.Officials have admitted both options could take at least two days to complete - and they ideally need to discover exactly where the youngster is first.Local reports have pointed to the land where the drama is unfolding being owned by relatives of the missing boy - with one saying an uncle made the hole to look for water in another tragic twist to the ongoing incident.Experts have said it is normal for prospections of this kind to take place - but the holes have to be covered up afterwards if nothing is found with a large stone which is usually sealed hermetically to stop anyone from removing it and avoid accidents like Sunday\u0027s.More than 100 people including police, firefighters, Civil Protection workers and private sector experts are involved in the search operation.  "},{"url":null,"title":"Receptionist blinded drinking spiked cocktails holiday Greece faces wait guide dog","story":"Hannah Powell, 22, appearing on ITV\u0027s Good Morning Britain in May, she faces a three year wait for a guide dog after being added to an 800 person waiting list          Miss Powell before she suffered the life-changing consequences of drinking spiked cocktails in August 20165.7 magnitude earthquake hits off of Greek tourist island...Share this articleShe told the Mirror: \u0027It’s just one more setback I’ve got to deal with, but I’m not alone.\u0027Blind people across the country are having to cope without guide dogs...

The Boeing 777 aircraft took off from Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, headed for Beijing, ChinaAfter more than 80 hours undetected, the vessel suddenly reappeared on the radar.Keen followers of the mystery have suggested that during this time the search boats may have been involved in a cover up, after coming across the wreckage.A MID-AIR EMERGENCY:According to pilot Chris Goodfellow, a serious possibility is that an emergency - such as a fire - left the pilots unable to land the plane.Writing on his Google Plus account, Mr Goodfellow claimed that in the event of a fire or other incident, pilots would have attempted to make it to their closest runway - a 13,000-foot strip on the Malaysian island of Pulau Langkawi - but never made it.          An emergency - such as a fire - could have left the pilots unable to land the plane \u0027For me the loss of transponders and communications makes perfect sense if a fire,\u0027 Mr Goodfellow wrote.\u0027In the case of fire the first response is to pull all the main fusses and restore circuits one by one until you have isolated the bad one.\u0027What I think happened is that they were overcome by smoke and the plane just continued on the heading probably on (autopilot) until either fuel exhaustion or fire destroyed the control surfaces and it crashed.\u0027DID A MYSTERY PASSENGER HIJACK IT?The official manifest of MH370 listed 239 people as missing.But Andre Milne, founder of military technology developer Unicorn Aerospace, says the flight actually had 226 passengers (of which four did not board) and 12 crew - totaling 238 people.He told The Express that the unidentified passenger may have gained control of the plane and flown it to a secret location.\u0027The extra passenger likely acted in conjunction with larger external operational support to take full command and control of the cockpit of MH370,\u0027 Mr Milne claims.A Malaysia Airlines spokesman said a discrepancy on the \u0027load sheet\u0027 hours prior to the plan taking off had occurred, with the actual number onboard 227 people - a dozen less than initially listed.\u0027The actual figures can differ from that transmitted on the load sheet due to last minute changes,\u0027 the spokesperson said.

Ahead of an exhibition at the British Museum, Jonathan Jones charts its rise, from the 1893 original to today’s inflatables and emojisThe face is a greenish sock of sickly flesh stretched tight over the skull. Its features have been burned away by pain. All that remain in the elongated mask are two wide round eyes with dots for pupils, a pair of black nostrils and a mouth open in an oval scream. We’ve all been there.The Scream was created by the Norwegian artist Edvard Munch in 1893 but it has become a masterpiece – the masterpiece – for our time. There are comparably “iconic” works of art – the Mona Lisa, Van Gogh’s Sunflowers – but they exist in a world of art and beauty. The Scream is ugly and brutal and belongs in the here and now. It is a symbol we reach for as we might for a strong word, to express what we’re feeling this minute.The cartoonist Peter Brookes called on it to sum up what so many were feeling when Donald J Trump was elected president of the United States. In Brookes’s depiction of Trump’s inauguration, every single person in the crowd has metamorphosed into the wraith-like figure from The Scream. They sway in unison, hands to their hollowed faces, clad in black smocks.You don’t have to be a professional cartoonist to express yourself with The Scream – you just need to text. The emoji sign “face screaming in fear” neatly sums up Munch’s image as a yellow face turning blue as it opens its mouth to scream, with eyes wide open, hands pressed to its cheeks in shock. It’s a handy emoji if you’re traumatised by Brexit … or climate change, or plastic in the oceans, or emojis.There are plenty of reasons to scream, says Hugo Chapman, the keeper of prints and drawings at the British Museum. “Is that not the feeling of our time?” he asks of Munch’s image. Chapman’s department is usually where scholars fill out forms to study Rubens drawings or old maps of Somerset, but its announcement of a new exhibition has sent headlines spinning simply because Edvard Munch: Love and Angst, which opens in April, will include the 1895 lithographic version of The Scream. Chapman says the museum has not been surprised by the shrieks of excitement. “We have hit at a time of maximum anxiety that all of us feel incredibly strongly,” he told me on the eve of the meaningful vote in the House of Commons on Theresa May’s Brexit deal.It is also a time of sardonic laughter, and surely part of the resonance of The Scream in these strange times is its comic hyperbole. A huge part of the global population was transfixed in the silent pose of Munch’s screamer on Trump’s inauguration day – and we still are – but there is also a blackly comic release in recognising our plight in this late-Romantic image. In fact, many appropriations of The Scream by popular culture are a howl. A chain of self-consciously youthful and riotous pubs called It’s A Scream used Munch’s painting as an advert for booze and bad behaviour. An artist called Robert Fishbone found a new sideline when he created an inflatable version of The Scream that became a must-have novelty for art students and existentialists everywhere. And in Wes Craven’s 1996 film Scream, which is at once a satire on slasher horror movies and a highly effective resurrection of the genre, the killer wears a white Halloween mask version of Munch’s screaming face. It is both ridiculous and gruesome.These examples of The Scream’s irresistible rise in the shattered modern mind originated in the 1990s, which seems to have been the decade that saw Munch’s picture start its final ascent from a famous masterpiece of modern art to the most recognised, quoted and gazed-at icon of all. As a matter of fact, its triumph can be dated exactly. Today’s cult of The Scream started 25 years ago, on 12 February 1994. That was when thieves stole the original 1893 painting from Norway’s National Gallery. Detective Charles Hill, who was sent to Oslo from Scotland Yard’s specialist art squad to help get it back, remembers that it was not a very impressive heist: “It was two men and a ladder.” Detectives got in touch with the criminals and, astonishingly, convinced them that California’s Getty Museum was prepared to buy this piece of toxic contraband.“I appeared as the man from the Getty,” says Hill. He negotiated with the crooks, refusing an offer to go somewhere unspecified with them, purportedly to see it, by dead of night, and ultimately helping to secure it just three months after it was stolen. Art crime may be ugly, but it is also popular recognition of a kind. You know you’ve made it when the criminal community rates your works theft-worthy. Although the Mona Lisa was always renowned, its theft from the Louvre in 1911 and recovery two years later catapulted it from genteel totem to pop icon. The theft of The Scream had a similar electrifying effect. It even started a gangland fashion. In 2004, masked gunmen seized Munch’s second painted version of The Scream, which dates from 1910, from the Munch Museum in Oslo. This time it took longer to get back, and suffered some nasty damage.The 1990s also saw The Scream mirror a wider cultural mood. The end of the brash yuppy era brought a new emotional openness. Munch’s fin-de-siècle masterpiece suited another fin de siècle a century after its creation. Contemporary artists were returning to his themes of inner darkness with installations that used thick black crude oil, preserved animal bodies or a cast of a house. One Young British Artist, Tracey Emin, was consciously inspired by Munch in her confessional work My Bed, which is a kind of scream expressed through full ashtrays and empty bottles. Emin is now working on a seven-metre nude statue in homage to Munch that has been commissioned for the new Munch Museum in Oslo harbour, due to open next year.If The Scream spoke in a new key to the late 20th century, the anxieties of this century, which started on 11 September 2001, have made it seem the most contemporary of all masterpieces. Its translation into an emoji is truly significant. The Scream emoji makes explicit the striking fact that it is getting hard to say the word “scream” without seeing The Scream. This painting is becoming part of the language. The Scream has become part of a shift to reconnect idea and images, to express ourselves in the internet age by direct visual icons. It is not just a painting that makes a good emoji. It is the original emoji.To see the revolutionary nature of Munch’s achievement, you only have to see how he first rendered into art the experience that The Scream records. In 1892, he painted Sick Mood at Sunset: Despair. It shows a man leaning on the wooden railing of a bridge, looking out on to a darkling blot of a fjord beneath a yellow sky smeared with red clouds of apocalyptic fire. Two other figures parade the boardwalk, leaving him to his depressed thoughts. The railings and walkway rushing away in steep perspective to the left of the scene, the paranoia-inducing figures walking away, the curve of the fjord – this is unmistakably the landscape of The Scream. For both paintings depict a real experience, a transforming, unforgettable moment of revelation. Was it an artistic ecstasy, like the visions of Romantic poets including Blake and Coleridge, or an episode of mental illness? In 1908, Munch wrote it down. He tells of how he was walking with two friends near Kristiania – as Oslo was then called – when the sun went down over the fjord. At the time, he writes, “life had ripped open my soul”.Born in Ådalsbruk in 1863, Munch grew up in Kristiania amid poverty, puritanism and illness. One of his first paintings, The Sick Child, is a memory of seeing his sister die. As a young artist, he had to struggle with frequent illnesses, rejection, alcoholism and a tempestuous relationship in which he got shot. He was also witness to a murderous love affair among his bohemian friends. So as he looked at the sunset that evening, the sky split open not just in clouds of red but a bloody, volcanic, atomic rupture in the fabric of reality itself: “Then it seemed as if a flaming sword of blood slashed through the heavens’ vault – The air became like blood – with piercing strands of fire – The fjord – glared in cold blue – yellow and red colours – bloody red screeched – on the road – and on the railing – My friends’ faces turned glaring yellow-white … ”This is the moment he depicts in Sick Mood at Sunset: Despair. In this painting, we see his anguish from the outside. The sky is gory, but it is in the closed mind of the man brooding with his face turned away from us that it feels like the end of the world. We see his despair, but it is not ours. We are like the audience watching Hamlet: involved yet outside his tragedy.The following year, Munch obliterated that gap between actor and audience, artwork and onlooker. In 1893, he created his first two versions of The Scream. The one that is in Oslo’s National Gallery is done with tempera, that is, egg-based paints and crayon on cardboard. The other, in crayon alone, also on cardboard, belongs to the Munch Museum. In both of them, he simplifies his vision of the nightmare sunset into bands and nodules of colour, almost like the flow of woodgrain. More radically, he replaces his brooding man with a figure who has no identifiable sex and may even be a ghost or ghoul. Clad in a dark dress or tight robe, its face reduced to that caricature of dread beyond words, the screamer does not look at the mad sky but directly at us. It is us.By removing all iniduality from this being, Munch allows anyone to inhabit it. He draws a glove puppet for the soul. Absurd and empty, it is filled by the scream its mouth shapes – and that scream, claimed Munch, comes from the landscape itself. He testified that he truly heard a scream pierce the sky and fjord as he gazed on the terrible fiery sunset: “I felt a great scream – and I actually heard a great scream – The colours of nature broke up – the lines of nature – the lines and the colours – quivered in motion – These oscillations of light not only caused my eye to vibrate – they also brought my ear into vibration – so that I truly heard a scream – I then painted the picture Scream.”In Norwegian it is “skrik”, whose jarring note sounds more like the English “shriek” than “scream”. The resemblance is no coincidence but clearly reflects the Viking infuence on our language. So Munch felt nature shriek. The imagery he uses is telling: as he watched, the light seemed to shake, the colours of nature to warp before or, rather, within his eyes. As his visual sense shook, it set off something in his ears. This is an instance of synesthesia, when experiences ramify through more than one of our senses. Munch was undergoing the kind of hallucinatory, multi-sensory, almost out-of-body adventure associated with visionary episodes from shamanism to psychedelia. It was part of a dangerous descent to the edge of madness that would eventually lead to him being hospitalised. And in The Scream, by creating a figure anyone can identify with, a pure embodiment of feeling, he lets us enter that same extreme state.The Scream is so much more than a receptacle for the anxiety we’re feeling right now. It can rescue us. It offers a means of release from the grind and banality of politics, money and work. The true purpose of the greatest modern art is to reconnect us with demonic, ecstatic experiences that defy the boredom of modern industrial capitalism. Maybe Munch was possessed by the Vikings when he heard the world scream. For The Scream seems pagan and primitive in its shudder at the iciness of the empty north. It is a painting of Ragnarök – the Norse apocalypse. Which makes it even more the masterpiece for our time. Play Led Zeppelin’s Immigrant Song and stare at The Scream.

The past, imagined and real, offers fascinating answersIf this sounds familiar even to those of us who are not historians of British economic policy in the 1950s, it’s because it is the vision for Brexit that was advertised 60 years later. Plan G, as it was known in 1956, is now Plan A for the true believers: we can have all the benefits of being in the EU without the burdens and compromises of actual membership. And the other Europeans will be so glad that we have condescended to deal with them that we can dictate our own terms.It didn’t work in 1956, not least because, as Kevin O’Rourke states in his crisp, clear and quietly devastating history, “UK policymakers had been focused on what was required in order to achieve a domestic consensus in Britain. Not surprisingly, they had produced a blueprint that was indeed a very good deal for Britain – but in so doing they had paid insufficient attention to other countries’ interests.” And of course it has not worked since 2016 for precisely the same reasons. Here, as in so much else, we see that if Brexit has a history, it is not a linear one – it loops back not just to an imagined past but to assumptions about Britain’s place in the world that were untenable even in the 1950s.O’Rourke is all too aware that, as titles go, A Short History of Brexit is problematic. For one thing, as the defeat of the withdrawal agreement has confirmed, this tale, however it turns out, will not be short. For another, the story is rapidly unfolding: the proofs of the book sent out to reviewers had empty space at the end for last-minute updates – the finished book takes events up to Christmas. It might indeed be questioned whether such a project is worth doing while the outcome is so uncertain. But O’Rourke’s book provides a bracing and absorbing answer. As he puts it towards the end, Brexit has already been “a hugely informative, if costly, civics lesson for the people of Britain, Ireland, and the rest of Europe” and he is superbly well fitted to draw out that lesson for the general reader.Kevin Hjortshøj O’Rourke, to give him his full name, has been Chichele professor of economic history at Oxford since 2011. His father was Ireland’s permanent representative to the EU in the 1980s, his mother is Danish, he was born in Switzerland and is a municipal councillor in the small French village of Saint-Pierre-d’Entremont. This mixture of expertise and life experience gives him both a sure grasp of the fine details and a wider human perspective.He is excellent on the realities of trade regimes: if you want the truth about what World Trade Organisation rules actually mean, or why hard borders cannot be avoided even if post-Brexit Britain merely ends up with different rules on VAT, he is a reliable guide. Some of these “civics lesson” aspects of O’Rourke’s book have an urgency that is shaped by the sheer mendacity of the Brexiters. It should not, for example, be a great revelation that freedom of movement isn’t a cunning trap devised after an innocent Britain had been lured into what it thought was merely a trading bloc: it is right there in the 1957 treaty of Rome. Yet it matters that such things are laid out with such clarity.O’Rourke is also acute on the very different ways in which first world war centenaries were commemorated in Britain and France. One memo to David Cameron as prime minister issued instructions that “we must ensure that our commemoration does not give any support to the myth that European integration was the result of the two World Wars”. By contrast, the French prime minister Édouard Philippe, speaking in 2017 at the armistice site at Compiègne, did exactly that, evoking the idea of “a Europe that reminds us of the eternal values that unite us, and the disasters we mourn”.While O’Rourke’s cool account of the Brexit negotiations is valuable, it is his overview that is most important. He explains why the habit of setting the claims of Europe against those of the nation state is simply wrong. The European Union was the answer to a very real and urgent question: how can we enjoy the economic benefits of free trade while limiting the known ability of free trade to undermine national governments and the welfare states they had put in place? The dilemma, as he so neatly summarises it, is that “economic prosperity required trade but political stability required welfare states. In order to achieve both prosperity and stability a free trade area was not enough: you needed European integration to set a common regulatory framework so as to prevent destructive races to the bottom. In this way Europe would come to the rescue of the European nation state.”Perhaps this thought might be taken a little further: if the EU was about rescuing the nation state, might the great structural problem of Britain’s attitudes to it be precisely that the UK is not a nation state? It was, in the early days of European postwar unification, still an imperial power, and its official suspicion of the idea of a continental customs union was shaped by the belief that it could and should continue to prioritise its trade with its soon-to-be-former colonies. (The excruciating contradictions that this involved are perfectly captured by the conclusion of a British expert committee appointed in 1947: “A continental customs union had little economically in its favour other than the damage which would be caused by being excluded from it.”) And of course, the UK contains four different nations that would come over time to take very different views both of the nature of the welfare state and of the relevance of Europe to their sense of identity.The great limitation of historians is generally that they know too much. They cannot share the great ignorance of the people they are writing about: the condition, in which we are all still held after the stalemate at Westminster, of not knowing how it is all going to turn out. Though it is scant consolation for the pain it inflicts, Brexit does rather poignantly bring together the knowledge provided by a long-term historical perspective with the sheer terrifying unknowability of the outcome. O’Rourke may not have known the result of the vote on the withdrawal agreement, but his guess turns out to be a well-educated one. He predicts, accurately, that alongside that deal, “the only logical alternatives would appear to be no deal and no Brexit”. And he points to a hard fact that some of those suggesting other plans at this very late stage seem not to grasp: “The Labour party hopes that a general election might in such circumstances return it to power, but even if that happened the country would still face the same three alternatives the ‘Norway plus’ option requires leaving on the basis of the existing Withdrawal Agreement.” As O’Rourke acknowledges: “This is what history feels like when it is being made.” It feels simultaneously like reliving the past and forgetting everything that might have been learned from it.• A Short History of Brexit: A Pelican Book by Kevin O’Rourke is published by Pelican (RRP £20).

Here’s our roundup of your comments and photos from last week.granitadicaffe has just “entered the gates of Purgatory” with Dante:In Il Purgatorio it takes 9 cantos before you reach Purgatory itself. On the way they meet and chat to various historical personages. The gates are a little hard to find and when you get there there are 3 large steps of marble outside: the first is white, smooth and polished, the second dark rough and cracked, and the third red like blood spurting from a vein. On these stands a big angel with a sword, who only opened the door after Virgil explained their mission. He used 2 keys, a silver and a gold one. If the latter, which is difficult to turn, won’t open then you can’t get in. It is hard to enter Purgatory but once you are inside you mustn’t look back!“I’m not a slow reader,” says kinson1964, but “I’ve been reading the same book since last year.” That book is Jerusalem by Alan Moore:A huge book (page numbers reach four figures) and it’s an amazing read. It deals with Northampton rather like Joyce deals with Dublin or Gray does with Glasgow - all human life (and death) is there together with a wealth of historical facts, trivia and metaphysical speculation. I now wish that I knew the town well for the extra psycho-geographical resonance.A Delicate Truth, “another le Carré novel leaving barbs deep in the body politic of the high and mighty of Britain”, has captivated notatalllover:Unputdownable, Toby Bell, the hero, showing the meaning of bouncebackability, having grabbed hold of the hand of someone under the cosh of the secret state faces brutal consequences in his desire to find the truth behind the lies and cover up hidden under the pacific blanket wielded by the Foreign Office. Again le Carré lets his readers know Britain is a police state in all but name. A rewarding read.A quick tip from Dennis89:Just finished Night Flight by Antoine de Saint-Exupéry. A short novella and the ideal read for one sitting.... Beautiful prose and quite atmospheric for such a short book.And a fine idea from nkenny:I’ve been listening to the audiobook of Boswell’s Life of Samuel Johnson. It’s extremely funny and perfect for dipping in and out of during spare moments.Van Gogh’s letters have impressed marosc:They’re really good. The main element of his personality that’s coming out is commitment to authenticity - he’s determined to be himself even in the face of severe family pressure to conform and to be true to his artistic vision even when it means only selling a handful of pieces because he refuses to compromise to make his art more saleable. And his brother Theo must be the greatest art benefactor in history - pretty much single handedly supporting Vincent so he can dedicate himself to art - and what a legacy we’ve got because of that. The way Vincent writes about his art and comparing it with other artists (it’s not true that he was a loner - he was friends with Toulouse-Lautrec \u0026amp Seurat and, of course, began a failed attempt at an artists’ community with Gauguin) is totally engaging - you can really feel his excitement about what he’s doing.Emily Wilson’s translation of Homer’s Odyssey is, according to FrogC, “excellent”:It was not at all what I expected. The voyaging adventures are mostly told in flashback and take up a smaller part of the book than Odysseus’s return home and revenge upon the suitors who’ve been pestering his wife and eating him out of house and home. (I kept thinking, impertinently, that that was not how I would have written it.) And it’s a surprisingly cruel book - I ended up not liking Odysseus very much.Finally, Tom Mooney recommends A Different Drummer by William Melvin Kelley:In 1957, a young black farmer shoots his livestock, salts his fields and burns down his house. He then walks away from his fictional southern state. Every other black citizen follows his lead.From this brilliant set-up, Kelley tells the story of young Tucker Caliban, his ancestors and their masters, owners and bosses, entirely through the eyes of the white people left behind in town.There are a lot of moving parts in this novel but they tie together beautifully come the end. It’s at times hopeful and cynical, moral and immoral, simple and complex. Almost 60 years after it was first published it feels incredibly fresh and would sit happily alongside the works of Ellison, Baldwin and other great writers on civil rights in the US.If you’re on Instagram, now you can share your reads with us: simply tag your posts with the hashtag #Books, and we’ll include a selection in this blog.

The FCA’s Market Abuse Regulation extends the regulator’s reach to new markets, platforms and “behaviours” and aims to boost “market integrity and investor protection”.Additional scrutiny by the FCA could be significant as Britain hurtles towards a formal exit from the EU on 29 March. Interim events such as Tuesday’s parliamentary vote on Theresa May’s exit deal continue to grip markets and create opportunities for investors and hedge funds to cash in.“We are giving thought at this stage … as to whether we could usefully issue guidance, not obviously to change the rules but to issue guidance on the application of the rules, particularly on this question of inside information,” Bailey said.He pointed to similar work undertaken by the FCA to help the Office for National Statistics when it aimed to end the circulation of official data ahead of its release. That is despite the ONS falling outside the FCA’s regular jurisdiction.“We helped them to get that outcome using the market abuse regulation regime … it might be somewhere where guidance might help,” Bailey explained.The FCA chief is finally due to sit down with representatives of the British Polling Council and Market Research Society, which regulates the polling industry, from next week. The FCA publicly confirmed plans to meet both groups back in October.Morgan wrote to British Polling Council president, Sir John Curtice, in the autumn, highlighting concerns over “potential conflicts of interest in the business model of the polling industry”.She pointed to the practice of making market sensitive data such as exit polls available to private clients before it can be legally released to the public, and the way revenues from private polling work may help subsidise public work.“At worst, there could exist a perverse incentive for polling companies to provide misleading or inaccurate information to the media, while providing high-quality analysis on the true state of public opinion to private clients,” she said.Curtice hit back, saying: “The implication of this remark appears to be that during the EU referendum polling companies may have deliberately released inaccurate published polls at less than cost price because this enabled them to extract a higher fee from their private clients.“Casting doubt as it does on the professional integrity of the industry, it is a suggestion that we feel either needs to be substantiated or withdrawn.”The Treasury committee has not responded to Curtice."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/df2e32f53ce5e199a5c1b01d21e3d6ed5b4c554b/0_68_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3ae63cc5a7e90caea993906baeca3f1d","title":"marks and spencer stores close m and s hull","story":"M\u0026ampS outlets in Bedford, Hull, Huddersfield and Rotherham among those to be axed with 1,000 jobs at riskMarks \u0026amp Spencer has dealt a fresh blow to the high street as it announced another wave of store closures, putting more than 1,000 jobs at risk.The struggling high street giant is closing one in three of its main stores – those that sell clothing, homewares and food under one roof – and on Tuesday revealed the locations of the next 17 branches to close in coming months.Sacha Berendji, the M\u0026ampS retail, operations and property director, said: “Proposing to close stores is never easy, for our colleagues, customers or the local community, but it is vital for the future of M\u0026ampS.”M\u0026ampS’s decision to retreat from a swathe of UK towns and cities comes as many high streets are struggling with fewer customers and the shift to online shopping. The most recent figures available showed the number of shops, pubs and restaurants lying empty soared in the first six months of 2018.Despite its problems, M\u0026ampS, with its broad range of products, is a prized high street name as its stores attract 19.5 million shoppers every week. Local MPs and councillors vowed to try to persuade the company to reverse its decision.Emma Hardy, the MP for Hull West and Hessle, also tweeted that she was “extremely disappointed” by the decision to close the store in her city and was seeking a meeting with management.She was joined by her Hull North colleague, Diana Johnson, who asked: “Why is one of the great cities of the north losing its Marks \u0026amp Spencer?”Another affected town is Ashford in Kent, which has been held up as an example of retail regeneration. But Graham Galpin, a senior Ashford councillor who helped write the recent government report into the UK’s beleaguered high street, was more pragmatic: “There is simply too much retail space in the UK, hence we must expect some reductions.”The store closures, spread over a five-year period, are part of the latest M\u0026ampS plan to tackle years of falling sales and profits. The cull began in 2017 after the chief executive, Steve Rowe, said he would slash the amount of shopfloor space devoted to M\u0026ampS’s clothing ranges as sales transferred to its website.M\u0026ampS has about 1,000 stores, a figure that includes 300 “main” stores and a large network of Simply Food convenience outlets. About one-third of the first group are said to date from before the second world war. M\u0026ampS has confirmed the locations of 55 of the 100 affected stores.The shopworkers’ union Usdaw said M\u0026ampS’s “piecemeal approach” was extremely distressing for staff. “Today we’ve seen a fourth wave of closures announced, which is devastating news for the staff in those stores and the uncertainty continues for everyone else,” said Usdaw’s national officer, David Gill.The company has refused to rule out an even bigger store closure plan.The locations of the 17 stores announced on Tuesday are:"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bfed9e3b5d51ec1f05d020437c62d1beff4880ee/0_0_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=139068ec48433626ea3c0370fce726c7","title":"santander abandons unacceptable cost of new chief andrea orcel","story":"Compensation for past remuneration of ex-UBS banker Andrea Orcel branded ‘unacceptable’ Banco Santander has ditched its incoming chief executive after the former UBS investment banker proved too expensive for the Spanish lender to hire.The bank originally announced Andrea Orcel’s appointment in September and had settled the terms of his annual pay by that time. However, it was still unclear how costly it would be to cover deferred awards which Orcel had racked up at UBS over seven years. understands that it would have meant paying upwards of €50m (£44.8m). Santander declined to comment on the figure. Negotiations eventually broke down and the lender said Orcel’s signing-on fee ultimately proved “unacceptable”.Santander said: “In recent months, discussions have been taking place over the terms of Orcel’s departure from his previous employer.“It has now become clear that the cost to Santander of compensating Mr Orcel for the deferred awards he has earned over the past seven years, and other benefits previously awarded to him, would be a sum significantly above the board’s original expectations at the time of the appointment.“The board considers that for Santander to pay this amount to facilitating the hiring of one inidual, even one of the calibre and background of Mr Orcel, would be unacceptable for a retail and commercial bank such as Santander.”It means Santander’s current chief executive, José Antonio Alvarez, would continue in the role, abandoning plans to transition to the chairman of Santander Spain in March.Orcel, known as a star investment banker at UBS, was set to pocket an annual pay package “in line” with Alvarez, who earned €8.9m (£8m) in 2017.Santander’s executive chair Ana Botín, commenting on the group’s decision, said: “In making this decision we have had to balance the respect we have for all of our stakeholders ‐ the millions of people, customers and shareholders we serve ‐ with the very significant cost of hiring one inidual, even one as talented as Andrea, by compensating for the loss of a significant proportion of seven years of his past remuneration.“The board and I are certain that this decision, although difficult to take, is the right one.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/eefc8aeab7c0340ed2b70897af6531556152b656/0_0_5173_3104/master/5173.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1be76b5102b3fae65fe4d9137636d880","title":"our vegetables are full of dirty secrets how organic could be the answer","story":"Organic farming places less stress on our environment and has even been shown to yield healthier crops. So why aren’t more farmers opting for this alternative?It’s a loss that has been driven by the intensification of farming to produce our food, fuelled by an increased use of pesticides and fertilisers to keep weeds and pests at bay and help crops grow. This is bad news for wildlife, as it not only takes away potential food sources for birds, mammals and other animals, but can also poison them and contaminate local watercourses. Marginal habitats, such as ponds and hedgerows, have also been lost in the drive to grow more food.This boost in wildlife is a result of organic practices, including growing a greater variety and rotation of crops, having bigger and more erse hedgerows, and avoiding the use of pesticides to protect crops from weeds, insects and diseases. This means organic farms are home to more insects, weeds and other plants that can then, for example, feed birds through the winter months.For organic farmers, it’s about farming with as much wildlife as is manageable. “I like to think of my land as open to wildlife rather than abandoning it,” says Guy Singh-Watson, farmer and founder of the organic delivery business Riverford.They also cannot rely on supermarkets to take their produce – their avoidance of pest-controlling chemicals means they have to deal with more variability in terms of quality. The carrots produced by Patrick Holden, the former head of organic trade body the Soil Association, were infamously rejected by his supermarket buyer over quality issues. “Supermarkets are preaching localism but it’s just tokenism. Their systems are still going in the opposite direction, and it’s disastrous,” he says.Singh-Watson’s organic farm, in south Devon, survives through his UK-wide vegetable box scheme. “It’s very difficult if you are supplying a supermarket. A lot of pesticides are used quite unnecessarily, because the farmer cannot afford to have their crop rejected by buyers.”Plants produce many of their antioxidant compounds to fight back against pest attacks, so the higher levels in organic crops may result from their lack of protection by chemical sprays, say researchers.The study, completed in 2014, also found that pesticide residues were four times more likely to be found in conventional crops than organic ones.The study’s conclusions have been questioned by other academics, who said there were not enough high-quality studies to support the conclusion that organic food was nutritionally different to conventionally produced food. A review by the UK food standards agency in 2009 found that organic food provides no significant health benefits over conventionally produced food.But Leifert has called for more research on the issue. “We have shown, without doubt, that there are composition differences between organic and conventional crops. Now there is an urgent need to carry out well-controlled human dietary intervention and quantify the health impacts of switching to organic food.”Want to eat more ethically?

Walkers stroll along the concrete promenades, and mothers enjoy a moment of respite under newly planted saplings while their children play in the adjoining gardens.Few Ahmedabad residents could have imagined this scene a couple of decades ago. Back then the Gujarati city’s tidal river banks were lined with slum housing – precariously constructed on land polluted by industrial effluent and untreated sewage, and home to some of the most marginalised communities in the city.Over the coming years this central location will transform yet further. Retaining walls have been built on both sides to narrow the river to stop it from flooding low-lying developments and eroding the riverbank, in a project likened to Joseph Bazalgette’s embankments along the Thames in London, or those along the Seine in Paris and Hudson in New York. The newly created land will be home to shopping malls, luxury hotels, floating restaurants, museums and sprawling parks.By 2035 another 15 cities will have populations above 10 million, according to the latest United Nations projections, taking the total number of megacities to 48. Cities is exploring these newcomers at a crucial period in their development: from car-centric Tehran to the harsh inequalities of Luanda from the film industry of Hyderabad to the demolition of historic buildings in Ho Chi Minh City.We\u0027ll also be in Chengdu, Dar es Salaam, Nanjing, Ahmedabad, Surat, Baghdad, Kuala Lumpur, Xi\u0027an, Seoul, Wuhan and London.Read more from\u0026nbspthe next 15 megacities\u0026nbspseries here.“The worst part of the city, with flowing gutters and illegal constructions, has been converted into an iconic infrastructure project,” says Vijay Nehra, the commissioner of Ahmedabad, whose municipal corporation has spent more than 15bn rupees (£170m) on the scheme.The riverfront redevelopment model is being copied by several other Indian cities, from New Delhi to Mumbai, but as Ahmedabad’s population nears 10 million, not everyone is happy with the changes taking place – least of all the slum dwellers who have been relocated away from the city centre, the upstream farmers worried about their water supply and the environmentalists concerned the Sabarmati remains one of the country’s 15 most polluted rivers.The idea of a public riverfront was first proposed in the 1960s by the French architect Bernard Kohn, who was living in Ahmedabad at the time, as part of a vision for an ecological valley. Lack of funds meant it was shelved for the next 30 years.It was given new life in a different form in the mid-90s when the Bharatiya Janata party (BJP) took charge of the Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation. (The BJP’s Narendra Modi, a local politician, is now India’s prime minister.) Bimal Patel – son of the late Hasmukh Patel, an influential architect whose buildings dot the city’s skyline – and his HCP Design and Project Management firm were hired to draw up a masterplan.But before the first concrete could be poured, the tens of thousands of people who called the area home, many for three generations or more, had to be removed. The riverbed had become a dumping ground for the city’s waste and the area was rampant with disease, while floods frequently led to deaths and the destruction of dwellings. The clothes washers and small-scale farmers were dependent on the river directly, while others such as domestic workers and ragpickers relied on its central location.Government surveys conducted before the construction began in 2005 identified 11,000 families who would be displaced – although activists believe the actual number was three times higher.The Sabarmati Riverfront Development Corporation spent some 11bn rupees (£124m) building new housing for those who would lose their homes, but Beena Jadhav, director of the Ahmedabad-based housing rights NGO Rahethan Adhikar Manch, says the process was mismanaged.“Not a single family walked from their houses by the river to the ones given by the government without a phase of being homeless,” she says. “There were many demolitions without an eviction notice.”Even those who left voluntarily found themselves unable to get work in the new location. Noorja Abdullah Pathan, 56, says: “The new government home felt like a private bungalow compared to where I lived before but I cannot find any work here. I can’t afford to travel for it either. I am always begging for food or dying of hunger. At least by the river I survived.”It is not just the development’s effect on the riverbank that is controversial – its effect on the water is too.The project has seen the tidal river, which was 679 metres across at its widest, narrowed to a regular 329 metres. “Pinching the river for a uniform width and building embankments have lowered the Sabarmati’s flood-carrying capacity,” says Mahesh Pandya, the founder of Paryavaran Mitra, an observer organisation for the UN Framework Convention On Climate Change. “This was always a project just for beautification. No environmental assessment has been done.”Meanwhile, activists are worried that the water supply for farmers in drought-prone parts of Gujarat will be affected by the project. Water from the Narmada canal – a multipurpose dam project that irrigates more than 3,000 villages across the state – was used as part of the scheme, and levels of the dam have since been recorded at their lowest in 13 years. The state government has vowed to stop the city from using the Narmada’s water free of charge, and the Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation insists new treatment plants will prevent any untreated sewage from entering the river within three years.Patel, though, considers his project to be on track. “With these homes along the river there was no way for the residents of Ahmedabad to access the waterfront,” he says. “The key objectives have always been to create a public realm along the river, clean the water and rehabilitate those affected by the project. Now a huge public space is available for 7 million people.”But he cautions that the development is a long-term project. “The problems Indian cities face today are the challenges their European counterparts faced in the 19th century,” he says. “Their solutions, like controlling tidal rivers with embankments, remain the same.“It took over 70 years to clean the Thames. I am not saying it will take that long for the Sabarmati, but developing a riverfront is a three-generation project.”Follow  Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, and explore our archive here"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e57ca7e9b0d16aa7701e154d67acbfc590e8316e/0_215_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a73c39d2868c0e7c12c31689b2b212bc","title":"the guardian view on mays brexit deal its over but whats next","story":"The PM leads a party that is ided and a country stockpiling food and medicines as if preparing for war. She needs to humbly reach out to her opponents and find a way to prevent Britain crashing out of the EU in weeksThe overwhelming and decisive rejection by MPs of Theresa May’s withdrawal agreement to leave the European Union is a shattering blow to the authority of the prime minister. She has spent two years negotiating a deal, which in substance was the opposite of what she said she wanted in public, only to see it repudiated by parliament. Her minority government has now been defeated on no fewer than 28 occasions. Britain is leaving the EU in weeks and Mrs May leads a cabinet that is hopelessly split, a party that is riven with disagreements and a country that is deeply ided. So emphatic is the Commons historic rebuff that Mrs May’s deal is finished. Mrs May lost by 230 votes – the greatest defeat of a government ever. The scale of the opposition means it is not credible Mrs May could bring the motion back to the Commons, modified with a few tweaks from Brussels, and hope for success a second time round.We do not have to settle for the Hobson’s choice of the May deal or no deal. The trouble is the Tory party is split between those who want a deal and those who do not. Mrs May has intensified the isions within her party, rather than resolve them. She chose to start negotiations over Brexit not with the EU but with her own hardliners. The red lines Mrs May subsequently set made it impossible for her to get a deal that would bring her fractious party together, let alone reach out to her political opponents. Her agreement ended up shaped by Mrs May’s obsession with immigration and placating Brexit extremists. The result is a “blindfold Brexit” – where almost everything about the future relationship with Europe is up in the air for two more years. It required a leap of faith to place trust in a prime minister who, the Commons wisely decided, deserved very little.In the current circumstances, there is no majority in parliament for any of the alternative Brexit deals. This could lead to a disaster: Britain crashing out of the EU without a deal. That is why MPs must remove it as an option. Labour has triggered a vote of no confidence in the government but is unlikely to win. That points to the need for a mechanism to allow a Commons majority to take control of the Brexit process. This would require innovation, of the kind seen last week, so committees can be empowered and laws brought forward. But to have other options would require asking the EU for more time. It requires parliamentary cooperation of the kind hitherto unseen. Jeremy Corbyn and Mrs May ought not to stand in the way of such dealings. Constitutional devices such as citizens’ assemblies, raised by Labour MP Lisa Nandy, and another referendum would allow leaders to hold their parties together and provide legitimacy for whatever the public decides. These are not denials of democracy but a reinforcement of it.Mrs May’s decision to put party politics ahead of national interest means this country will aimlessly drift as the government attempts to recast a withdrawal agreement. An absence of leadership can lead to a sense of panic, one inflated by a government stockpiling food and medicines as if preparing for a war. We need to end the chaos and ision that have done so much to disfigure our country. The question we face is whether there can be a durable relationship between Brexit Britain and the EU, which allows both to cooperate on the basis of shared interests and values. Mrs May left it far too late to accept the costs of leaving, preferring to pander to MPs whose snake-oil sales pitch is that there will not be any cost associated with Brexit at all. “Having your cake and eating it” is the Brexiter attitude that encapsulates this inability to think in terms of costs and benefits.Yet coming clean about these things is necessary to move forward. The country now faces a situation without precedent in its constitutional history: how to reconcile the sovereignty of the people with the sovereignty of parliament. The prime minister has been humbled into admitting she needs to win her opponents over. The Brexit vote was driven by stagnant wages, regional disparities and a soulless form of capital accumulation. These were not caused by the EU, nor will they be solved by leaving it. Only policies enacted by purposeful government can do that. Mrs May has not provided either."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c6c383a3c0e8cd1ebf4710979fd0ebf00b32f615/0_100_2746_1647/master/2746.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5bcd5be1d508a774890ceec463b8ab7e","title":"may save brexit deal tories party","story":"Can Theresa May save her deal? That depends on whether MPs – and in particular her own backbenchers – are looking for ladders to climb down or crosses on which to crucify themselves. Having given the prime minister another political bloody nose, are her colleagues on the hunt for compromises or is the opposition within her Conservative party basically implacable?There’s no single position, but there are hardliners on both sides of the Tory party. Many Conservatives could potentially be won round, having now registered their disapproval of the deal. But diehards are showing little interest in shifting position. A few extreme remainers, are determined to rerun the referendum, and so reject any Brexit, even the softest possible so-called Norway plus form. At the other end, kamikaze Eurosceptics seem prepared to bring down the entire temple to secure their ideal Brexit. “Bin the backstop,” they demand, something that will inexorably lead to a no-deal exit. Brexit itself now risks being killed by this sort of supporter – by those who claim to love it the most.Some of the opposition to the prime minister’s deal is, frankly, based on personal or political problems rather than the policy of what she’s actually agreed with the EU. Last month, May survived a confidence vote within the Conservative party in which 117 of her own MPs opposed her in a secret ballot on her leadership. On Tuesday, 118 of her MPs voted against her deal – almost the exact same margin. A sizeable slice of her party has just fallen out of love with her. And with the race to succeed her becoming ever more open, too many Tory big beasts have their eyes on a future prize.Part of this political mess is the prime minister’s fault. Even at the best of times, she is a wooden political performer. It’s striking that the strongest speeches defending May’s flagship policy – her Brexit deal – have been made by other ministers. Her isive rhetoric after the EU referendum with talk of “citizens of nowhere” and her stubborn refusal to guarantee rights for EU nationals living in the UK (contra the commitments of colleagues who had actually campaigned for leave) helped exacerbate isions in the country and the Conservative party, rather than bringing people together.But it’s also the case that Brexit was always going to require challenging compromises. Campaigns can be conducted in poetry governing requires prose. And negotiating, with a strong but wounded counter-party, which has its own interests, was always going to be difficult. Then again, May has made major mistakes, from triggering article 50 without an agreed plan, to accepting the concept of a backstop without locking down what it would mean.The biggest single factor shaping Brexit, though, is the result on 8 June 2017. In calling a general election, in which she subsequently lost her already slim majority, May set the course for what was bound to be a softer Brexit. She lost the ability to stare down opponents in the Commons, and damaged the credibility at home and in Brussels of her prior claim that she would leave without a deal.Despite Tuesday’s enormous defeat, little has ultimately changed. There are still just three options – Brexit with no deal (which a large majority of MPs are determined to prevent), stopping Brexit (probably via a second referendum), or leaving with a version of the prime minister’s deal. All three seem largely impossible. Yet one of those paths will have to be followed.There are noisy calls for a plan B, but the truth is there is no negotiated alternative deal on the table. Some demand a pivot to Norway plus, but its advocates admit this would mean accepting the entire binding withdrawal agreement, while tweaking just the political declaration to narrow the range of future outcomes. Plan B is premised on accepting plan A in full.May remains in a parlous position. A harder Brexit is not on offer from Brussels, and so any significant move in that direction would mean no deal. Shifting to a softer Brexit would alienate more of her own backbenchers. Although wounded, she is not yet politically finished, but she is fast running out of options. At some point, she may decide that she has one significant card left – committing to relinquish the party leadership after the end of article 50 to allow a new generation to lead the next stage of negotiations. Some critics of her deal have conceded to me, that this concession, combined with some further binding clarification of the backstop’s exit mechanism, could prevent them standing in the way of the deal.Ironically, Jeremy Corbyn’s decision to try to trigger a general election may strengthen the prime minister. Firstly, it moves the political story on, away from whether she has a plan B. Second, she is almost certain to win the vote of confidence this evening, securing her own position. Third, if Labour’s bid to topple the government fails, attention will quickly shift to whether they now back a second referendum or not. If they do, Theresa May can present herself as the only national party leader determined to defend Brexit. That may just help bring some of the Conservative party back together again. But the next few weeks, as parliament seeks to wrestle control of Brexit, will mean no let up in the political crisis.• Henry Newman is the director of Open Europe.

From the broken laser pointer that kicked off eBay to the matchbox that made Ikea, here are six big businesses that started with one small saleeBayWith 177 million buyers, 429m downloads of the eBay app, and more than 1bn listings at any one time, it’s hard to believe it all began with the humble sale of a broken laser pointer. That’s what eBay founder Pierre Omidyar listed from his living room in San Jose back in 1995 to see if his fledgling online marketplace, then called AuctionWeb, would catch on. To his utter amazement a bidding war ensued and the bust $1 item sold for $14.83, seemingly proving Omidyar’s belief that trading is a basic human impulse. The site’s growth was meteoric, with profits doubling month after month, and today it’s a multi-billion-dollar business. But, though these days eBay sees its fair share of mega-money transactions, the beating heart of the company is still those humble sales – from a broken laser pointer to Beanie Babies, well-thumbed paperbacks, fidget spinners and Justin Timberlake’s half-eaten French toast.VirginNow a billionaire business mogul who actually owns an island, Virgin founder Richard Branson was still in short trousers when he first showed a knack for buying and selling. As a boy living in Tanyards Farm in Yorkshire, Branson roped in a school pal to help him plant 400 Christmas trees. He hoped to make £800 profit once they’d grown two years later and the friends agreed to share the cash. His plans were scuppered, however, when rabbits overran the plot, decimating all but a couple of sorry looking sprigs. Undeterred, he found a rather vengeful way to claw back some profit – and pride – by successfully hunting the rabbits and selling them to his local butchers for a shilling each. Not quite the boyhood fortune he’d hoped for, but from little acorns did megastores and jumbo jets grow.IkeaThink of Sweden’s most famous export and Ikea tends to trump even Abba. But the late founder of the furniture giant started small – tiny, in fact. To help his family make ends meet in the remote farming region they called home, Ingvar Kamprad became rural Sweden’s answer to Del Boy. Aged just five, he flogged matches to neighbours, before moving on to seeds, fountain pens, lighters and nylons. Aged 17, Kamprad’s father gave him some money for doing well in school. He used it to launch Ikea, an abbreviation of Ingvar Kamprad from Elmtaryd, Agunnaryd – his boyhood home. Realising he could sell furniture at a lower price if customers had to put in some of the work by assembling it themselves, the flat pack was born, and world domination was in the bag.Jo MaloneThe brains behind those distinctive scented candles in the covetable cream and black boxes had a passion for fragrance from year dot. The daughter of a beautician, as a little girl Jo Malone concocted her own perfumes from grated soap and the flowers in the family’s garden. Later, working as a florist, she gave facials in the evenings from her kitchen using her homemade creams. After giving her Nutmeg \u0026amp Ginger Bath Oil to customers, orders started rolling in – she knew she was on to something. Armed with a couple of saucepans, four plastic jugs and bucket-loads of ideas, she invented fragrances with striking combinations, such as her signature scent Lime Basil \u0026amp Mandarin. Opening her first shop in 1994, Malone eventually sold her fragrance empire to Estée Lauder in 1999 for an undisclosed sum, staying on as creative director and chair until the French cosmetics giant acquired her remaining stake in the company in 2006. But it wasn’t long before Malone returned to her passion – by 2011 she had launched Jo Loves, a new fragrance brand.Forever 21Forever 21 co-founders Don Won Chang and his wife Jin Sook are a bona fide case of rags to riches – in the rag trade. In 1981 the young Korean couple landed in LA in search of the American dream, but they didn’t find it where they were expecting. Having worked in coffee shops growing up, Don was sure roasted beans would lead to his pot of gold. In fact, it was a canny observation he made while serving coffee that saw the couple go from stony broke to billionaires. Don noticed that his customers with the flashiest cars were people in the garment industry and a lightbulb came on. The couple opened a discount store in 1984, raking in $700,000 in the first year and now bring in roughly $4.4bn in sales from 600 stores worldwide.Annie MaloneAnnie Malone’s achievements would be impressive by today’s standards, but they’re positively staggering given her start in life. Born in 1869 to former slaves, Malone founded the black cosmetics industry at the beginning of the 19th-century by inventing her own line of non-damaging hair products, with the aim of providing a better straightening solution for African American women. Calling her first product Wonderful Hair Grower, Malone drummed up custom by selling door-to-door in her home territory of St Louis before expanding to the point that, by 1917, she opened a vast training facility called Poro College – complete with a manufacturing plant, cosmetics store, gym, auditorium, bakery, chapel and roof garden. Eventually she employed 75,000 Poro agents, including fellow philanthropist Madam CJ Walker, at franchises all over the world. The first black female millionaire, Malone gave most of her money to her community, and was president of the board of directors of an orphanage, among her many charitable endeavours.Millions of people are using eBay to start a side hustle, make more of a hobby or carve out a career.

Inspectors will have a longer period to assess the quality of teaching and will interview staff as part of the process.The proposals were welcomed by Anne Longfield, the children’s commissioner for England.“I remain extremely concerned about the number of schools gaming the system and fiddling exam league tables through off-rolling, and I hope that Ofsted will grasp this opportunity to come down hard on schools who are letting down some of the most vulnerable children,” Longfield said.The new framework was also backed by Damian Hinds, the education secretary for England: “As we have improved the curriculum and reformed GCSEs and A-levels, we have been fully united with Ofsted in our drive to ensure all children and young people benefit from an ambitious, broad and balanced curriculum.“This framework reflects that approach and our continuing activity around exclusions and off-rolling.”Angela Rayner, Labour’s shadow education secretary, welcomed the move to address off-rolling but said more significant reform was needed to ensure that Ofsted didn’t add to the pressures on teachers.“Labour will address these issues by giving our schools the resources they need, reforming the accountability system and taking concrete steps to end the scandal of off-rolling,” Rayner said.The National Association of Head Teachers said it was calling on its members to use the consultation to amend the proposed framework.“In its current form, this proposal from Ofsted will cause widespread concern amongst school leaders. There’s nothing here that will reduce stress and increase the reliability of judgements, which many say is sorely needed,” said Nick Brook, the NAHT’s deputy general secretary.The new framework will also see an increased emphasis on behaviour and attitudes in a revised category, with schools able to be rated as having outstanding behaviour if pupils “behave with consistently high respect for others”. In particular it notes that schools in “challenging circumstances” need to take action to create a “positive learning environment” to be awarded outstanding status.A recent Ofsted inspection of a secondary school in Poole, Magna Academy, saw inspectors endorse its use of “silent corridor” policies, with pupils barred from talking while moving between lessons.A new inspection area – personal development – will rate how a school prepares pupils for life in modern Britain, while the leadership category will now encompass issues such as off-rolling, which Harford defined as “getting rid of people because they’re not going to get the right scores”.In a nod to an ongoing dispute among teachers, Ofsted’s consultation document notes that “a isive debate has emerged in some quarters that creates an unnecessary opposition between knowledge and skills” and concludes that the two are “closely interconnected”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6bc99c80382c1b12fd3ed2baf8f5e69a9a048f55/0_286_4291_2575/master/4291.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3b26eab7393e639241944573950b0fb9","title":"land sparing farms could revitalise uk bird populations study says","story":"Claim that more intensive farming would allow rewilding of greater areas of countryside“Land sparing” could lead to dramatic increases in wild bird populations, according to research that bolsters the case for rewilding.Farming intensively to increase yields while turning over much larger areas of farmland to wildlife could – if combined with measures to cut food waste and meat consumption – would meet Britain’s food needs and more than double the populations of breeding birds.Increasing yields is controversial among some conservationists who argue that intensive farming is unsustainable. Upland farmers also object because they fear land sparing will force them to give up farming and rewild their hillsides, while the fertile lowlands are intensively farmed.In research presented to a rewilding conference organised by the Cambridge Conservation Forum, Balmford and a team of researchers studied food production and birdlife on the Cambridgeshire Fens to model how a far greater area of farmland could be devoted to wildlife.“We’re not arguing for business-as-usual industrial farming but we have to be mindful of yield,” said Balmford.He said there was a risk that post-Brexit payments for farmers could improve Britain’s landscape but reduce food production, leading to more food being imported from countries where the environment is being destroyed.He said: “We need a twin-track where we get serious about using some of our landscape in a way that’s much better for bioersity and ecosystem services but that must be linked to incentives enabling some farmers to be productive in sustainable ways on remaining farmland. If we don’t, it’s a sleight of hand – we’ll just buy our food from somewhere else and offshore the problem.”While organic farmers and most conservationists fear raising yields would lead to more environmental damage such as greenhouse gas emissions and increased nitrate pollution, recent research by Balmford and colleagues found that in four types of farming, including European dairy farming and wheat production, intensive systems were often less polluting per unit of production than organic and low-intensity agriculture.But Balmford said there was not enough data on other “externalities” such as soil erosion to measure the full, long-term costs of high-yield farming. On the Fens, for instance, there is scant data on soil erosion. The Fens’ fertile, peaty soil being washed away or eroded by the wind could prevent high-yield farming in the future.If land sparing is taken up in the post-Brexit farm payments being developed by the environment secretary, Michael Gove, some fear it could lead to unprofitable upland farms being turned over to nature while fertile lowlands are intensively farmed.This was criticised at the conference by Dafydd Morris-Jones, a Welsh hill farmer who said land sparing was quite attractive if you were a large-scale grain farmer, “because it’s your land that will be concentrated on to be productive and our land that won’t”.Morris-Jones said he would prefer to see land sparing used within inidual farms. “With better conversations, more nuanced thinking and a great deal more data, the uplands would be able to provide sustainable food while providing ecological and environmental benefits. I don’t think they are in conflict.”Morris-Jones accused rewilding of being “eco-colonialism” forced upon Welsh upland farmers by the English, pricing out locals and eroding their landscape, culture and community.“Rewilding has become a toxic term in mid-Wales,” he said. Of the argument that upland farming could be replaced by ecotourism, he said: “I can’t see how careers in the voluntary-supported Wildlife Trusts or low-paid and exceptionally seasonal work offered by the tourism industry will pay the mortgage. As for payments for ecosystem services and public goods, I just don’t think it will be capable of sustaining that richly varied rural economy that we rely upon to keep our culture, language and community alive.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b02860ede08ba93de90979b74d199823ea5be38c/0_225_1500_900/master/1500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2ad8ae2c3902adffb57d3d9ce1069332","title":"our oceans broke heat records in 2018 and the consequences are catastrophic","story":"Rising temperatures can be charted back to the late 1950s, and the last five years were the five hottest on recordLast year was the hottest ever measured, continuing an upward trend that is a direct result of manmade greenhouse gas emissions.There are other ways to measure climate change, but none are as convincing as the oceans. Air temperatures are most commonly reported in the media as evidence of global warming, but the problem with these is they are very erratic. While there is certainly a long-term trend of higher air temperatures, any given year may be warmer or colder than the last.So oceans are key, and they are telling us a clear story. The last five years were the five hottest on record. The numbers are huge: in 2018 the extra ocean heat compared to a 1981-2010 baseline amounted to 196,700,000,000,000,000,000,000 joules. The current rate of ocean warming is equivalent to five Hiroshima-size atomic bombs exploding every second.The measurements have been published in the journal Advances in Atmospheric Sciences in an article by Lijing Cheng, the lead author, and his colleagues from the Institute for Atmospheric Physics in China. His collaborators, of which I am one, included researchers from around the world. The article charts ocean heat back to the late 1950s, showing a steady increase.Ocean warming is incontrovertible proof of global warming, and there are real consequences to a warming ocean. Firstly, warmer water expands, and this expansion causes sea levels to rise. Approximately a third of the rise in ocean waters is a result of the heat absorbed by the oceans. Scientists expect about one metre of sea level rise by the end of the century, which would be enough to displace 150 million people worldwide. The warming waters also make storms more powerful. In the US recently, we have seen hurricanes pass over extremely warm ocean waters, which has supercharged them and increased the damage they cause. Other kinds of storms are also being made stronger. Heavier downpours of rainfall are increasing flooding around the world. Simply put, our emissions of greenhouse gases have caused loss of life and property. We are all responsible, but the people who have denied the science and the solutions own a special responsibility that history will judge harshly.It isn’t just humans that are suffering and will suffer more in the future. The heating of oceans is causing tremendous problems for sea life, particularly coral reefs. If we continue to warm the planet, we can expect to lose much of these reefs. We can also anticipate reductions in fish and sea life populations. We scientists sound like a broken record. Every year we present the science and plead for action. Not nearly enough is being done. We can still tackle climate change, but we must act immediately. We have the means to make a difference, we lack only the will.

Drain, and then, when cool enough to handle, slip off the tough outer skins to reveal the tender green bean beneath.Drain the black beans, if necessary, then put half of them in a bowl with the potatoes and mash together until fairly smooth it doesn’t need to be a puree, but you shouldn’t be able to see any significant lumps. Add the remaining black beans and the skinned broad beans, and mash again, more roughly this time, leaving some intact.Heat the oil in a small frying pan on a low-medium heat and saute the onion and pepper until soft but not browned. Stir in the garlic and jalapeño, if using, and cook for another couple of minutes, stirring until the garlic loses its raw smell. Add to the bowl with the bean and potato mixture.Put a dry pan on a high heat, then dry-fry the cumin and coriander seeds for a minute or so, until fragrant. Grind to a powder with a pinch of salt in a mortar or spice grinder, then add to the bean mixture. Add the chopped chipotle or smoked paprika.Squeeze in the lime juice and add the fresh coriander. Season and mix to combine. Taste the burger mixture and adjust the seasoning if you think it needs a bit more lime, salt or chilli. Using damp hands, form the mixture into four chunky burgers, put them on a plate and refrigerate for at least an hour.While the burgers are chilling, make the burger sauce. Put the chickpeas and their water in a narrow, flat‑bottomed jug or bowl slightly larger than the head of a stick blender, and whizz until smooth. Continue to whizz as you mix in the oil in a steady stream. (Alternatively, use the small bowl of a food processor.)Once you have a loose, mayonnaise-like consistency (it won’t be as stiff as an egg mayonnaise, but more like a thick yoghurt), fold in the ketchup and mustard, then season to taste, adding more of either if you so desire. Chill until ready to serve the sauce will firm up a bit in the fridge.Heat the oven to 160C (140C fan)325Fgas 3, and spread out the cornmeal on a plate. Roll the chilled burgers in the cornmeal, to coat all over. Heat two tablespoons of neutral oil in a ovenproof frying pan over a medium-high flame, then fry the burgers for three minutes on one side, or until the cornmeal is well browned. Carefully flip and repeat on the other side. Transfer the burgers to the oven for 10-15 minutes, until heated all the way through.Cut the rolls in half (if using) and toast the cut sides in a hot dry pan. Put a lettuce leaf and a few slices of avocado on the bottom half of each bun, then add a burger, a slice of vegan cheese, if using, and a good dollop of the burger sauce. Clamp on the tops of the buns and eat at once. You’ll need a napkin."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/81f09091530e2cf1ca4b5c4e4aafac71b88279b5/0_225_4921_2952/master/4921.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=badd70a0cebe9f66882211b2e32d7401","title":"arsenal head recruitment sven mislintat future","story":"• Mislintat’s chances of move to technical director had slimmed• German feared role would become that of glorified chief scoutArsenal’s grand plans to restructure post-Arsène Wenger have begun to splinter with Sven Mislintat, brought in as head of recruitment, set to leave after feeling his position has become untenable.The German, whose ideas in the sphere of spotting and developing talent are highly regarded in European football, was initially appointed in November 2017 by Ivan Gazidis, with the idea that his role would evolve into that of a technical director as the club aimed to refresh its operation once they moved on from the Wenger era.Wenger was no fan of the technical director concept and brushed aside the idea, which was one the club were keen to move towards. Since Gazidis departed to join Milan and handed over to a new internal management scheme led by the director of football, Raul Sanllehi, and the managing director, Vinai Venkatesham, Mislintat’s chances of becoming technical director have diminished.He was the natural choice but with Arsenal looking elsewhere, including towards their former midfielder Edu (currently a coordinator for Brazil’s national team), Mislintat has sensed that he would be sidelined, no longer having a decisive say on prospective signings. It seemed like his position, instead of growing as he had hoped, would be reduced to that of a glorified chief scout, which is not what he moved from Borussia Dortmund to do.Quite apart from the experience he can bring to the role, Mislintat will be a loss to Arsenal as a person. In character and ideas, he shares something of Jürgen Klopp’s rock and roll vibe and has a similar bigger-picture belief in football’s capacity to pay attention to the game’s soul in a heavily financed modern world. He also had a lot to offer to the strategic overhaul intended to refresh the way the club operates at executive level, and brought with him a modern way of thinking and a strong passion for his area of expertise.Mislintat has in recent months been part of the new executive team set up to bring a shared leadership which included his fellow German Per Mertesacker as head of the academy as well as senior figures from the business, football, contracts and data side of the club. He is the kind of person who is keen to bring his own ideas to the table, without feeling the need to adhere to convention. Down to earth, as interested in people as performances, his attributes extend beyond just having a good eye for a potential player.Before moving to London he spent many years at Dortmund, where he helped in the development of Shinji Kagawa, Robert Lewandowski, Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang and Ousmane Dembélé, among others. This track record made him an exciting appointment for the overdue modernisation of recruitment at Arsenal. Dortmund are an example to aspire to for a club hoping to streamline their operation and become more efficient in the market by spotting potential talent before it becomes prohibitively expensive.Mislintat was heavily involved in the recruitment of Aubameyang a year ago. Arsenal then signed a range of players during last summer’s transfer window – the goalkeeper Bernd Leno, experienced defenders Sokratis Papastathopoulos and Stephan Lichtsteiner, and the youthful, zesty Lucas Torreira and Matteo Guendouzi in midfield.But there is unease during this January window with Emery having admitted recently that the club are able to bring players in only on loan. With Aaron Ramsey set to leave on a free transfer at the end of the season, Petr Cech announcing his retirement, Danny Welbeck’s contract unlikely to be renewed and the ongoing bafflement over the situation engulfing their highest earner, Mesut Özil, this is far from an ideal time to have upheaval on the recruitment front."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/830f70beffe5cbe64ca6ad9ee4d323fd26808c6b/0_0_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6e87304d4b7122158f852ea66968e744","title":"football transfer rumours arsenal james rodriguez 3m loan","story":"Today’s fluff is living its best lifeWith transfer guru Sven Mislintat heading for the hills, Stan Kroenke slamming shut the war chest and £350,000-a-week man Mesut Özil marooned on his sofa, Arsenal fans have gone into meltdown mode. But wait! James Rodríguez could be about to jet in and calm the tensions.Colombia’s 2012 World Cup hero is in the second season of a two-year loan spell at Bayern Munich but the Bundesliga champions are not too fussed about making the move permanent for £39.5m, and he would happily pack his bags for London if Arsenal can cover the remaining £3m of the £11.5m loan fee Bayern agreed with Real Madrid.With so little cash swilling around the Emirates the club’s bean counters are said to have come up with the ingenious idea of flogging Özil to Internazionale or Juventus, and have told the Italian giants of their plan. The German has no interest in leaving but help may be at hand in the form of Mohamed Elneny, who is interesting Roma and would be delighted to escape the Gunners bench.Ole Gunnar Solskjær has told anyone who will listen that he will not not give up the keys to the Manchester United manager’s office without a fight, and he is ready to bare his teeth in the transfer market. The Norwegian has told Marouane Fellaini to find a new club and has muscled his way to the front of the queue for Cengiz Under, with a £50m summer transfer in the pipeline. Yannick Carrasco is available right now, so desperate is he to return to Europe from China, and the former Atlético Madrid winger seems to have had his head turned by Solskjær’s barnstorming United revolution. Carrasco’s wife, Noémie Happart, was certainly happy to play ball when quizzed about whether United had joined the list of clubs chasing her husband’s signature. “Yes they are very interested,” teased Miss Belgium 2013. “I do not hide it but nothing is signed.”Chelsea are close to landing Leandro Paredes after submitting a second offer worth around £35m to Zenit Saint Petersburg for the Argentinian midfielder.Leicester are set to sign trialist Ali Reghba from Bohemians after the teenager scored twice in an under-23s game.And unlikeliest transfer tale of the week has to be Cristhian Stuani’s proposed move to Barcelona. The Middlesbrough flop has been banging the goals in for Girona for the past two seasons and could be in line for a shock £15m transfer to the Camp Nou. Álvaro Morata is also under consideration but Barça will only sanction a loan move for the Chelsea forward if Denis Suárez’s transfer to Arsenal goes through.

Mail us or tweet @TheKnowledge_GU“Pep Guardiola says he didn’t leave the Etihad grass long against Liverpool. But which teams or managers have used this tactic to help their own side or hinder an opponent?” asks George Jones.Stuart Smith cites a famous example from the legendary match between Wolves and Honved in 1954. “When Ferenc Puskas and the mighty Honved came to Molineux to play under floodlights, Wolves manager Stan Cullis had the pitch flooded and then rollered to appear playable. Honved took an early 2-0 lead, but the pitch turned into a bog reminiscent of a cattle field and Wolves ran out 3-2 winners, prompting Cullis to declare his side the best in the world.” You can read more about that famous match right here.José Mourinho has a tale or two to tell, too. He was Chelsea manager when, in February 2005, Blackburn saturated the pitch on the afternoon of their Premier League game. Chelsea won 1-0 and Mourinho had plenty to say afterwards. “During the afternoon it rained only in this stadium – our kitman saw it. There must be a microclimate here. The pitch was like a swimming pool.”There was apparently a hosepipe ban within the Bernabéu, and a drastic shortage of lawn mowers across Madrid, when Mourinho’s Real Madrid hosted Pep Guardiola’s Barcelona in April 2011. Xavi accused Madrid of preparing a dry, hard pitch with much longer grass than usual. “It’s deplorable,” said the ambassador for the Qatar World Cup.Brendan Rodgers and Craig Levein had a public spat after last year’s Celtic game at Hearts, and then there’s Trelleborgs FF. “When hosting Hammarby IF during the 2018 season, Trelleborgs decided to not only leave the grass long but also not water it before the game, all to slow down the tempo,” writes Gillis Holgersson. “It didn’t work – Hammarby won 3-1 and Trelleborg ended up relegated. Their stadium is frequently voted the least enjoyable away game in Sweden.”“Chorley’s top scorer in all competitions is their left-back despite the club being top of the Vanarama National North,” tweets Gaz F. “What is the highest league finish a team has achieved with a defender top-scoring over the season?”Sometimes the best form of attack is a defender. The original slabhead, Steve Bruce, was Manchester United’s top scorer with 19 goals in 1990-91, when they finished sixth in the old Division One and beat Johan Cruyff’s Barcelona Dream Team to win the Cup Winners’ Cup.There are a few teams who have won their league with a defender as top scorer. “In the 2001-02 season Plymouth Argyle won Division Three with a then record total of 102 points,” notes Tom Aldous. “Our joint top scorer was current Bristol Rovers manager Graham Coughlin with 11 goals. I imagine that all of them were imperious headers from set pieces.”Alastair Bourne nominates Lincoln centre-half Sam Ellis, who used his loaf to score 15 times when they won the old Division Four in 1974-75.But Bruce, Coughlin, Ellis and the rest must bow down and kiss the left boot of Eric Van Meir. “​When Lierse were surprise winners of the Belgian Pro League in 1997, the central defender Van Meir was their highest scorer with 16 goals,” writes Stijn. “He was excellent in the air and had a left foot like a traction engine, scoring headers, free kicks and penalties. Lierse’s attacking duo Dirk Huysmans and Bob Peeters (once of Millwall) only managed 14 goals between them during their fairytale season.”“Has any team managed to win the non-league double of National League champions and FA Trophy winners?” muses CB Kendall.This is an easy question to answer, especially when a cherished reader does all the work for us. “Wealdstone were the first team to achieve this feat back in 1984-85 when the National League was known as the Gola League,” writes Rob Read. “They followed up winning the league by defeating Boston United 2-1 at the old Wembley. Fun fact – Vinnie Jones was in the Wealdstone squad, but didn’t play at Wembley. Since then Colchester United (1991-92) and Martin O’Neill’s Wycombe Wanderers (1992-93) have managed the non-league double. However no team have won the double since the (Vanarama) National League has been in existence.”A couple of teams did achieve the feat in the pre-Conference days, however.Years ago my boyfriend told me that Bob Wilson’s middle name is Primrose,” wrote Sharon Barnes in February 2002. “Is this true or am I a victim of an elaborate hoax?”It’s true Sharon. Bob Wilson’s middle name really is Primrose. If you don’t believe us, log on to the Association of Football Statisticians website.

Merumba was thought to have contaminated the community. He was made to eat apart and sleep on the floor.In 2013, Merumba was attacked by men who tried to kill him. “I was out one evening looking for something to eat when I was ambushed by a group of men,” he recalls. “They tied my arms and legs, hooked a rope round my neck, and began pulling me into the bush. They wanted to cut my head off to perform witchcraft.”He was saved when a neighbour ran screaming towards the group with a torch.The health implications of albinism – visual impairment and the risk of skin cancer – are well known. For some, though, social stigma is the biggest danger.“My life was spent in darkness,” says Merumba. “At my lowest point, I drank battery fluid in an effort to end my own life. When it failed, I said to myself: maybe it’s not God’s wish that I leave this world. Not yet.”Now 54, his life changed after a meeting with Alex Magaga, who had worked on a BBC documentary, In the Shadow of the Sun, which tells the story of two Tanzanians with albinism. Its success led director Harry Freeland to set up Standing Voice, an organisation based on Ukerewe, an island in Lake Victoria, that defends the rights of people with albinism. Magaga is now its operations manager and Merumba the site gardener.“Ukerewe Island was home to a deeply impoverished community marked by segregation and violence: siblings forced to eat from separate plates in the belief their albinism was contagious, women raped because of the myth their albinism cured Aids, and those who died of skin cancer but were denied burial because they were ‘ghosts’ whose bodies would disappear,” says Sam Clarke, Standing Voice’s communications manager.The myths and misperceptions surrounding albinism in Tanzania are “almost too numerous to count”, says Clarke. Some believe the body parts of people with albinism bestow good fortune. This, says Clarke, has propelled 206 murders and hundreds of attacks across 28 African countries since 2006. In Tanzania, 75 albinos were killed between 2000 and 2016, according to the UN.The violence, says Clarke, makes for dramatic headlines but fails to tell the full story. “Murders and attacks are really the tip of the iceberg, the most extreme manifestation of a much deeper, much more structural process that damages the welfare of people with albinism across all areas of life.”A cycle of marginalisation and exclusion can impact several generations, says Clarke. “In Tanzania, the dehumanisation of people with albinism means that services aren’t built to meet their needs: discrimination impedes their access to healthcare, restricts opportunities for education and employment, and isolates people with albinism from their families and communities.”Today, Standing Voice – which has been active for five years and supports members of the Ukerewe Albinism Society – aims to reconnect a ided community.“Every day we see how social integration improves health and education, creates jobs, and builds stronger civil support networks to protect people with albinism from future persecution,” says Freeland.One practical step towards this was the establishment, in 2016, of the Umoja training centre on Ukerewe. Umoja, which means unity in Swahili, offers skills development and economic opportunities to people with albinism and the wider island community a second chance, in effect, for people who have missed out on an education.Last year, Alex Booker, a UK-based printmaker, led woodblock printing. This year, he returned with graphic artist Camille Walala and designer and fabricator Kate Uzzell.The workshops offer a place for the island’s residents to try new things, working alongside one another regardless of the colour of their skin. For those with albinism, it is a chance to build confidence and stronger links with others in the community. Some learn skills that could provide a living.Previous sessions have resulted in ongoing groups for printers, tailors, photographers, performers, young radio reporters and an arts and crafts club.Alongside the classes, Walala, whose dramatic pop designs have earned her the name “queen of colour”, helped to restore the centre.The plan was to add some colour to the buildings, including the water towers, the new radio production lab and the community library. “I wanted people there to feel pride in the centre and the designs,” she says.Walala received many requests to create designs in people’s homes. “They liked the bold graphics with sharp edges, and so we left a lot of tape so that people could practise and create their own designs.”Josephat Torner, who has albinism and played a prominent role in Freeland’s documentary, took part in the storytelling workshop. “It’s important for us to have this space to understand each other and to share our hopes and ambitions,” he says. “We are here to uplift one another and to develop our talents, to break the silence by speaking back to the world. We are proving to ourselves and each other that we can talk, we can draw, we can learn: we can do whatever we put our minds to in this fight to build an inclusive society.”Vedastus Zangule, who took part in the radio workshops, says he was segregated in primary school because of the colour of his skin: “My teacher either didn’t understand my visual impairment, or he didn’t care. In the end, I was driven out. I stayed at home and taught myself about electronics. I occupied myself by making things, and fixing broken appliances: I was an inventor, a creator. For a long time, I was my only teacher.”Zangule’s aspiration for an education where he would be “respected and included” was fulfilled with support from the project. Now, after being able to complete secondary education, he has a new dream: “I want to go to media school to train to be a TV and radio presenter. I’m a much happier person now.”Life has been transformed for Merumba, too. He feels things are changing for people with albinism on the island. “Where I live now is much safer. My neighbours’ attitude and understanding of people with albinism is improving greatly we sit together, talking and sharing. I love to socialise with others. Now, I can do that I have people who love me. I feel secure and lead an independent life.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2641c62fa0fffb20c66f57b9bc65729c8e52ffe1/0_562_9108_5466/master/9108.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1f8baf2a6693c82ed60fd13dec6c0c37","title":"even batter than real thing fish and chips goes vegan","story":"Quorn launches ‘fishless fillets’ made with protein derived from fungusFish and chips is the latest British favourite to get a vegan makeover, with Quorn launching both battered and breaded “fishless fillets”.The fillets will be made using protein derived from a fungus and the company promises to replicate the texture and flakiness of real fish. The launch follows the success of the Greggs vegan sausage roll, which has been selling out across the country.Both products aim to capitalise on the rapidly growing numbers of people eating less meat, fish and dairy products. About a third of Britons have stopped or reduced their consumption of meat, while the Veganuary campaign signed up a record 250,000 people in 193 countries this year.People are reducing their consumption of animal products for a variety of reasons, including concerns over their health, animal welfare and the environment. Most people in rich nations eat more meat than is healthy and research indicates that avoiding meat and dairy products is the single biggest way to reduce your environmental impact.The Quorn fillets, which will be available in supermarkets from March, give consumers a new alternative to fish. Many of the world’s fish stocks are overexploited and independent research has shown mycoprotein causes lower carbon emissions than farmed fish.The fishless fillets have taken five years to develop, said Geoff Bryant, the technical director at Quorn Foods UK, who added: “The launch marks the logical next step in helping people reduce our reliance on our oceans for protein.”In 2018, the UK launched more vegan food products  than any other nation. The Quorn fillets join a wide range of “faux fish” products on sale in supermarkets, from fishless fingers to vegan versions of tuna, smoked salmon, prawns, scampi, sushi and even caviar. Vegan alternatives to fish, such as “tofish”, have also gone on sale in pubs and chip shops.However, Barrie Deas, the chief executive of the the National Federation of Fishermen’s Organisations, said: “It is perfectly possible to buy and consume fish from sustainable sources. As the International Council for Exploration of the Sea makes clear, all of the main species groups in the north-east Atlantic are not only fished at sustainable levels but are on track to produce high average yields.”Joseph Poore, a food sustainability expert at the University of Oxford, said: “Quorn is leading the market in innovation, and I hope they go further by backing up their sustainability claims with labels on their products spelling out their emissions, impact on bioersity, water and pesticide use.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3b5452df66265abe407ba2027a23962c3c3958e4/0_327_6091_3655/master/6091.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cc1002507f2f62aecaf203b416d7f9b7","title":"giving london a brum for its money a locals guide to birmingham","story":"Britain’s second city is a erse cultural hub and on the radar as a global destination in its own right. Who better than resident Tom Cullen to show us around?The paint-by-numbers introduction to an article about the best things to do in Birmingham might go something like this: “Everyone thought Birmingham was a bit crap but great news, we’re wrong!”Brummies acknowledge this backhanded compliment with a trademark shrug and a wry smile. And then they move on. But this line of thinking perpetuates the theory that the city is merely improving, which is nonsense. It’s gone far beyond that, becoming a bonafide global destination for visitors and, perhaps more importantly, an unsurpassable home for more than a million people.So much was happening here that I turned my back on a 12-year career in London’s magazine business to launch a title dedicated to Birmingham.So, where to begin? How about on arrival at Bonehead, just 60 seconds from the new-look New Street station. A beer and chicken spot just off the rejuvenated John Bright Street, Bonehead is furnished with wooden benches, street art and fly posters, and its cooks possess quite a skill for deep-frying bird and dousing it in fiery Nashville sauces or cooling Korean kimchee. I eat alone there with somewhat worrying regularity.Eight minutes north by foot is Ikon Gallery, the immaculate neo-gothic former Oozells Street Board School. The Japanese cherry blossoms that decorate the square on which it and its exquisite tenant, Yorks Cafe, sit are months from bloom, but the building – which comes complete with a singing lift – brings a Hogwartsian beauty to Brindleyplace. Haroon Mirza’s mind-bending Reality is Somehow What We Expect it to Be is Ikon’s current feature exhibition, on show from now until 24 February 2019.Ikon doesn’t just stick to its own Grade II-listed walls, but makes a virtue of teaming up with other interesting locations across the city (venue collaboration is something of a Brum tradition). Right now, the Ikon team is working with Medicine Bakery and Gallery to exhibit Procession Banners – the result of artist Lucy Orta’s collaboration with female prisoners at HMP Downview to design 30 banners to mark 100 years since women won the vote. It’s on until 20 January 2019, and you can grab the city’s best cronut from the beautiful little bakery on your way in.Ikon’s near-neighbour, the Rep, is the longest-established of Britain’s building-based theatre companies and its productions are of the calibre you would expect with that in mind. Head there with the kids to catch award-winning director Liam Steel’s reimagining of The Wizard of Oz, which runs until 13 January or schedule in a visit for June 2019, when the indomitable Sir Ian McKellen brings his remarkable solo show to the theatre.The Hippodrome, the UK’s most popular single-auditorium theatre, is home to the Birmingham Royal Ballet, currently performing the Nutcracker to packed-out audiences. If you’re going, stop by at Gaijin for pre or post-show sushi. It’s a restaurant that the ’s own Jay Rayner recently waxed lyrical about, putting at least one nail in the theory that Birmingham has no decent mid-range restaurants. Hit up Harborne Kitchen (try the wagyu lasagne) or the new Nocturnal Animals for similar-priced eats. And of course, for those looking to spend a little more there are plenty of Michelin-starred restaurants: Simpsons and Purnell’s to name a couple.I pedal every weekday through Cannon Hill park, a space with beauty every bit as arresting as London’s major parks, and it always warms me, even in the frosty months, to see the multicultural mix of people jogging or dog-walking, or simply sitting on a bench and being in Birmingham. My kids love this place, almost as much the new Legoland Discovery Centre, or “Nemo spotting” at the National Sea Life Centre and gooning around with the interactive water features of ThinkTank’s Science Garden.ThinkTank is part of Birmingham Museums Trust: eight historical venues (including Aston Hall, Sarehole Mill and Soho House) that play contrary to the theory that Birmingham demolishes its most beautiful buildings.And of course, we have history – an abundance of it. Our town hall has hosted notable speakers such as Joseph Chamberlain, Charles Dickens and Clement Atlee. Continuing its history of erse content, it hosted the contentious Jordan B Peterson last month, three days before the less contentious Fun DMC, the UK’s only family-friendly block party. Mountaineer Chris Bonnington is in town on 5 December, and the Birmingham Town Hall and Symphony Hall is teaming up with the Hare \u0026amp Hounds, one of the city’s best pubs and music venues, to host local jazz saxophonist Soweto Kinch, on 6 December. Kinch regularly puts his name to the Flyover Show, an almost annual music, art and dance event that celebrates black culture in Birmingham.My office is based in the Victorian-era Great Western Arcade. Shoppers regularly wander in looking for the Georgian Piccadilly Arcade, and vice versa. It’s one of Birmingham’s charming mix ups, like not knowing in the 80s which shopping centre was the Pavilions and which one was the Pallasades. Whichever arcade you’re in, you’ll discover independent traders – the best in their respective fields – cutting hair, carving sandwiches and pouring coffee.The Balti Triangle, a name that should be known globally, seems eye-wateringly overlooked as a tourist destination. Someone’s failure to signpost it, front and centre, from New Street station, really rips my naan bread. It’s the beating heart of Birmingham, which is the beating heart of Britain, and it deserves the sort of visitor numbers that the now American-owned Cadbury World attracts regularly .Just south of town (and we always call it “town”, never “the city centre”) sits Digbeth, often dubbed “the Shoreditch of Birmingham” (never by a Brummie, though – we refuse to piggyback). Digbeth’s just Digbeth to us, and that’s how we like it. Home to Dig Brew Co, a brewery that admittedly would fit nicely in east London, and the Clean Kilo, the UK’s largest zero-waste supermarket. In October, the Sunday Times called Digbeth the coolest neighbourhood in Britain. Digbeth, greeted the compliment in typical Birmingham style. It gave a wry smile. Shrugged.

I am a Syrian national based in Germany and, to avoid any problems, I checked that my documents were in order on BA’s website and arrived at Heathrow three hours early. However, the BA staff member at the boarding gate was unable to read German or French and refused to accept my documents. She humiliated me in front of other passengers, saying I would not be allowed to board. I eventually found a staff member who confirmed my documents were in order and booked me onto the next flight. I reached Lyon at midnight and missed the connecting bus to Grenoble where I’d prepaid for a hotel room, so I had to spend another €74 on a room at the airport finally reaching Grenoble 14 hours later than planned and on a Sunday when everything was closed. The stress and exhaustion affected my presentation and I did less well then hoped. Your experience is, alas, not uncommon for non-EU passengers. Last October I exposed the plight of travellers, some refugees or immigrants with residency permits, denied boarding because they were wrongly told they needed visas to travel within the European Economic Area (EEA). A little-known consequence of the 1985 Schengen Agreement that abolished border checks was that airlines were effectively substituted as border controllers. They face a fine of between €3,000 (£2,640) and €5,000 if they are found to have flown non-EU nationals with inadequate or forged documentation into the EEA and have to shoulder the cost and responsibility of flying them back to the country they started from.Small wonder, then, airline staff err on the side of caution.After two months you had still received no more than a holding reply from BA. But, under the media spotlight, it has at last stumped up the statutory €250 compensation for denied boarding and a refund for the emergency hotel room. None of which compensates for the humiliation and stress.Although it admits you were incorrectly barred, it admits no fault saying: “We are required to ensure all customers have valid documents for the country of destination … we have apologised for the delay as a result of additional checks.”Caymanian DB was similarly barred by Norwegian Air when trying to fly with her partner and two friends from New York to Paris. She was wrongly told she needed a visa and directed to the French consulate which meant a weekend stay in a New York hotel waiting for it to open. The consulate then confirmed a visa was not required. They then had to pay for new tickets to Paris via London and Eurostar leaving them around £5,000 out of pocket. Only this week, five months after the aborted trip and after the Observer intervened, did Norwegian pay $2,422. It says: “We sincerely apologise for the inconvenience and delay caused by incorrect travel eligibility information flagged by a database which is used by airlines across the world. Norwegian has carefully reviewed the circumstances and will reimburse the cost of train travel and fulfil our obligations under EU compensation regulations.”If you need help email Anna Tims at your.problems@observer or write to Your Problems, The Observer, Kings Place, 90 York Way, London N1 9GU.

Presumably the headline intends to speak to the prime minister’s tenure as much as her deal. features a rare picture of the No lobby, which is packed with MPs walking through it to vote against May’s Brexit deal. The headline is “May suffers historic defeat as Tories turn against her” and the paper paints a picture of how the remarkable day unfolded, saying: “On a day of extraordinary drama at Westminster, the House of Commons delivered a devastating verdict on May’s deal, voting against it by 432 to 202. The scale of the defeat, by a majority of 230, was unprecedented in the modern parliamentary era and saw ardent Brexiters such as Jacob Rees-Mogg and Boris Johnson walk through a packed ision lobby cheek-by-jowl with passionate remainers.”The Daily Mirror focuses on the no-confidence motion launched by Jeremy Corbyn, with the splash: “No deal, no hope, no clue, no confidence.”“A complete humiliation,” says the , which reports her Brexit deal has “turned to dust”. The paper is happily sticking the knife in to May, running a front page comment piece saying “It takes a special kind of skill to get that many people to unite against you”.“May suffers historic defeat,” is the Times’ headline. Its front page story says “Theresa May was under mounting pressure last night to delay Brexit after she suffered the largest Commons defeat in political history”.The ’s splash is “Dismay”. But the paper, which is pro-Brexit, is not angry with May, whom the paper says “valiantly fought for her deal”.The Express also has a lengthy directive to MPs on its front page: “This nation is crying out for unity, but all Jeremy Corbyn wants is to oust the PM. Now it’s time for the MPs to do their duty and work with Theresa May for a deal that satisfies the 17.4m who voted Brexit … Don’t fail us!”Even the Daily Mail, which is usually incredibly supportive of the prime minister, can only muster: “Fighting for her life”.Still keen to show its support for May, the Mail says: “The prime minister called on mutinous Tory MPs to back her in a confidence vote tonight. Another defeat could trigger an election and put Jeremy Corbyn in Downing Street.”The Financial Times’ headline is “May’s Brexit deal crushed by Commons” and its story tries to convey the scale of the defeat, saying “Theresa May’s Brexit deal, the product of two years of torturous negotiations in Brussels, was last night overwhelmingly rejected by the House of Commons.”The i calls the day’s events a “historic humiliation”, pointing out that Tory backbenchers voted “six to one against her Brexit deal” and the Scotsman runs the simple headline “Crushed”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e57ca7e9b0d16aa7701e154d67acbfc590e8316e/0_186_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d7062bf347d4a80b07f9119d6c35f8e9","title":"europe media reacts may defeat brexit deal","story":"‘Complete and utter chaos’ – commentators didn’t hold back after Brexit deal crushed in CommonsEurope’s media and commentators had few words harsh enough for the mess in which the UK – and Europe – now find themselves after Theresa May’s deal suffered a crushing defeat in the House of Commons.In the Netherlands, Volkskrant columnist Bert Wagendorp was particularly brutal: “It is almost certainly the case that in recent European history, absent a threat of actual war, no country has landed itself in such complete and utter chaos,” he wrote.“The oldest parliament in the world after Iceland’s is in one hell of a state. Brexit has split a once stable country in two and transformed its politicians into lemmings, throwing themselves off the white cliffs into the sea. It’s great theatre – but tragic.”Writing in the Spanish daily El País, Lluís Bassets warned that Tuesday’s vote had been far from decisive, despite the scale of May’s defeat, and worse could be to come.“To the misfortune of the British, and perhaps also the Europeans, this Tuesday was a historic day that does not preclude more historic days – all accompanied by the tragic storm clouds that tend to shadow history,” he wrote.Bassets said “the great shredding machine that is Brexit” was still hard at work, “fed by uncertainty, bitterness and rancour – the three dismal feelings that May evoked in her defeat speech, and the three evil spirits that only grow with each day that Brexit remains unresolved”.In an editorial, the rightwing ABC said that since neither May nor parliament had shown themselves capable of dealing with the crisis, “the most sensible thing to do would be hold another referendum, as voters get to grips with the true arguments rather than just the nationalist-populist propaganda of the pro-Brexit lobby”.The online paper eldiario.es noticed that the environment minister, Michael Gove, had invoked the famous Game of Thrones line, “Winter is coming”. Gove was “one of the heavyweights in the party, that had the most influence in the Brexit referendum”, wrote Iñigo Sáenz de Ugarte.“Gove and others like him brought winter to British politics and are now horrified at how cold things have got. Too cold for their fellow countrymen.”In Sweden’s Aftonbladet, Wolfgang Hansson said May’s historic defeat flowed from “one of the biggest mistakes a British prime minister has ever made: David Cameron’s promise in 2013 to hold a referendum on Britain’s EU membership”.That decision had “ided the British people into two tribes that over time have become bitter enemies”, Hansson said. “A proud, once-great power is now dedicated to committing serious self-harm – which could also damage Sweden … And no one, I repeat no one, knows what will happen now.”The German press was more constructive, Berliner Morgenpost saying the situation in the UK was now so desperate that the EU must adapt. “The bloc has negotiated hard, wanting to set an example, and has pushed May right up against the wall,” it said. “It’s time for the EU heads to leap over their own shadows and offer a compromise. It is not yet too late to give May support.”The Rheinische Post, however, asked what might happen if the British stayed. What sort of country would it be? A “traumatised partner … would be far harder to integrate than before,” it said. “A politically hopelessly ided and lame Britain could cause a great deal of harm within the EU.“Which is why, for both sides, it would actually be better if the British were to complete their exit. If they then notice in the next few years that the EU maybe wasn’t the hell on earth they had thought it to be, they could gladly return.”France’s Les Echos said it was “difficult to say what will happen” over the next few days, since “the rejection of the text by such a huge margin, 70 days from Brexit day, risks plunging the country into deep uncertainty”.Le Monde had a portrait of May (“Shipwrecked by Brexit”) saying the prime minister was “valiant, but without a clear vision on Europe … She has shown herself, for the last two years, incapable of implementing Britain’s exit from the EU.”The paper said the rejection of the Brexit text “aggravates the uncertainty over the UK’s future.” Europe1 radio said the defeat was “humiliating” for the British prime minister, while France Inter radio described the defeat as a “coup de Trafalgar”, with the prime minister hit – though not necessarily knocked down altogether.In Italy, Enrico Franceschini said – with apologies to Winston Churchill – in La Repubblica that Brexit “has revealed itself as a riddle, wrapped in a mystery, inside an enigma: cancelling it would entail problems – but that could be the only way out of the labyrinth it has created.”In La Stampa, Stefano Stefanini warned that, without an agreement, 29 March “will be chaos. The risks extend beyond the Channel, where emergency plans are already being made for medicines and food. Repercussions would also be felt on the continent.”In Greece, the media was in rare agreement that the UK was in uncharted waters. “There is astonishment that a democracy as old as Britain has got itself into such a dead end,” commentator Pantelis Kapsis said. “It’s the sort of mess Greece would get itself into.”The Efimerida Twn Syntaktwn paper, which often reflects the views of prime minister Alexis Tsipras’s leftist government, predicted that while May would likely survive tonight’s confidence vote, the most likely scenario was an extension of the country’s exit date until July “in order to give London more time”.The conservative Kathimerini, in particularly pessimistic mood, said prospects for an alternative solution were far from good."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3d61a769f4c4101f03fb773387650332518e0114/437_55_1493_896/master/1493.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bb8df4e284bb08e314d8c8c595d8aad5","title":"off the incompetence scale readers react to mays brexit defeat","story":"You have been reacting to the prime minister’s historic defeat and debating what might be next for BrexitMay has to go. Her incompetence is off the incompetence scale. A total failure at everything she has touched. She will probably try and continue as she thinks her obstinacy and failure is strength and stability.It would be funny if people’s lives and livelihoods weren’t at risk from her ineptitude. MrTiggyMay is a woeful failure on all counts. She has never demonstrated capacity for cooperation or diplomacy. The only way she knows how to relate to Corbyn is to issue personal abuse and sneering insults. It seems to be her default position – no wonder nearly three years after the referendum we’ve made no progress whatsoever towards a resolution. jessthecripAll this is madness. May says she’s going to talk to parliamentarians about what to do next, but didn’t reach out to any of the opposition bar the DUP?She still doesn’t get it. This is not a Tory issue, its a national calamity. Grow up. TintenfischeI’m incredulous at political developments this morning. May loses by the biggest margin ever – yet wants to carry on as if nothing has changed, and Andrea Leadsom hectors the opposition for not supporting May. Over a hundred Tories vote against May in their vote of confidence and in the vote last night – but will all support her in a vote brought by someone else.May says she wants to reach out to others – but just not anyone who has a differing view. I don’t care which side of the argument you are on. This is contemptuous arrogance. How can it be defeated? dougmeyberryI think we all know that a general election at the moment, with both main parties still aiming for a cakeist Brexit, would solve nothing. A cross party agreement requires that the Tories talk to someone other than the DUP – or that large numbers of moderates on both sides defy the whips. How likely is that? A referendum will only work if the question is definitive, and even then is fraught with difficulty – there isn’t even a deal to vote on, is there? nufubarMay’s deal is fully and finally dead. There’s no more negotiation with the EU. Within a week, we’ll also find out that there will be no general election and no superior Labour Brexit. Norway+ means we keep freedom of movement, which effectively means we bin Brexit. If we’re going to pay the political price for that, we may as well go the whole way and just revoke article 50 and Remain.So there’s only two viable options left: either we jump off the no deal cliff and commit national suicide, which no one voted for, or we put this matter back to the people. Anyone who disagrees with a new referendum now needs to explain why they don’t want to resolve this impasse democratically, and what else they suggest. UltraLightBeamBoris Johnson and others will all claim that there’s a better deal to be renegotiated, but the EU have made it clear time after time that they won’t support anything materially different. So now the reality is no Brexit or hard Brexit. No political party would dare pick either of these, so eventually there must be a re-referendum. UnevenSurfaceI was a fool, because when May was announced prime minister I was relieved. But she’s the worst we’ve ever had, and she’s too damn proud and egotistical to do the decent thing and step away from a job she’s not up to.Her deal, I will give her this, actually united the country. Nobody thought it was a good idea. Remainers hate it, because why wouldn’t they? It’s essentially a half way house that ties us to the EU but without the influence we have now. So what’s the point? Leavers, well of course they hate it, because it’s not leaving properly, so what’s the point?After all I’ve said about May, she’d still beat Corbyn, because people don’t trust him, so he needs to do the decent thing and step down as well. These are not the best Britain can do, they are merely the political opportunists who have found themselves at the top, and its patently obvious that we need better political representation. SummersgoneI was a little surprised and mildly disturbed by the pictures posted from the voting lobbies. It looked like the MPs were having a great time voting against the PM’s motion. The fact that our country is standing at the abyss with an uncertain future seems to me anything other than a joyful occasion.I would have expected a sense of urgency at the very least. Once again proof that we’re being governed by a bunch of jokers who treat this whole Brexit dilemma as a game. Time for the people to take back control and demand that people’s vote. It may not be in our veins to fill streets and squares in protest, but if ever there was a time and moment, this surely must be it. CozitMakesSenseWhat if there’s another referendum, and leave wins again? Chaotic – revolution rousing, possibly – as it plainly would be, isn’t there an argument for the Government now to say “Sorry,we have tried to honour the referendum result, and we can’t do it. We have to revoke the activation of Article 50.”Of course, it could lead to horrendous, maybe ungovernable consequences. Choosing the least bad option seems seems very difficult, and there doesn’t seem to be anyone in parliament who can give clear, non-partisan leadership on it. But that’s the responsibility they have signed up for. Time for them to show their worth (if any of them have any). oxymoronFor the sake of our future generation, let’s ask them. I see no other solution than another vote with remain as an option. All this time and money wasted could have gone into schools and hospitals. Safeguard our universities. Protect our environment.

Tomorrow is shaping up to be another dramatic day in the crazy world that is UK politics, as MPs vote on the no confidence motion proposed by Jeremy Corbyn. We will be back with all the news and updates. I’ll be launching an early-morning blog at about 5:30am, so get some rest, and see you back here in a few hours.As always, thanks for following on.Press Association has this helpful guide to the motion of no-confidence, tabled by Jeremy Corbyn in an attempt to force a general election, which is scheduled to be held tomorrow afternoon.It is the first time the procedure has been used under the provisions of the Fixed Term Parliaments Act passed by the coalition government under David Cameron. This is how it will work: Mr Corbyn will move the motion tabled in his name as Leader of the Opposition and will speak first in the debate scheduled for Wednesday afternoon. The Prime Minister will then speak for the government and at the end of proceedings at 7pm MPs will vote. If the government wins there will not be a general election and ministers will carry on in office. If the government loses, the Act states there must be an “early” election unless the government can regain the confidence of the House by winning a confidence vote within 14 days. During that two-week period there is no statutory limit on how many times a confidence motion can be brought forward and voted on. In the course of that period the opposition may seek to form alliances within the Commons to demonstrate they are the party most likely to command the confidence of the House and therefore should be given the opportunity to form a government.The front page of the papers are in and they are not good for Theresa May.The Sun has gone all-out, delivering a classic Sun front page. “Brextinct”, is their headline, as they paste May’s face onto a dodo.“Dismay,” says the Express. “A complete humiliation,” says the . “No deal, no hope, no clue, no confidence,” says the Mirror. Even the Daily Mail, which is usually incredibly supportive of the prime minister, can only muster: “Fighting for her life”.And while we’re on the subject, the agenda for parliamentary business in the House of Commons tomorrow is quite remarkable.Dominic Grieve, former attorney-general and advocate of a second referendum, will present two bills to parliament tomorrow regarding another referendum on the subject of “the United Kingdom’s future relationship with the European Union”.This will happen sometime after 12:30pm.Nick Boles, the Conservative MP who has said he will do what it takes to stop a no-deal Brexit, has this dire diagnosis of what went down today.In a long thread, Boles – who earlier today tweeted that someone had threatened to burn down his house – said May “has approached the Brexit negotiation as if she commanded a majority of 150 in the Commons. She has conducted the argument as if this was a party political matter rather than a question of profound national importance of legitimate concern to all MPs.”He urged her to work with opposition MPs to reach a “soft Brexit like that offered by Common Market 2.0 – or what Michel Barnier calls Norway Plus”.Earlier tonight, thousands of people in favour of a second referendum marched on Parliament Square, where they watching the thumping defeat of Theresa May’s deal broadcast on large screens.The former Maryland congressman John Delaney has become the first 2020 presidential candidate to weigh in on Theresa May’s resounding Brexit defeat in parliament on Tuesday.In a statement to the , Delaney, a former businessman and centrist Democrat mounting a dark horse bid for the White House in 2020, said: “The truth is Brexit was never honestly sold to voters, which is why the UK finds itself in such a difficult position right now.“Leaving the European Union will, in fact, hurt British citizens, but staying is not an option after a referendum, unless they have a second.”Read the full story here:Good evening politics fans, this is Kate Lyons taking over from Kevin Rawlinson. After such a dramatic day and with so much about Britain’s future up in the air, I think Rupa Huq, Labour MP for Ealing Central and Acton, speaks for us all when she says:Huq has since confirmed the post was “unintentionally tweeted”, but intended or not, it feels like a tweet that speaks to the moment.The chairman and vice chairman of the hard Brexit-supporting Leave Means Leave group, John Longworth and Richard Tice, have released this statement:Quite rightly, MPs have rejected the worst deal in history. The PM should accept this was a bad deal and stick to her words: No deal is better than a bad deal. Let’s go to WTO and save £39billion and be free.The figure they refer to is that which the UK and EU have agreed the former should pay in part in order to honour commitments it made while still a member of the bloc.Earlier, we made brief mention of the reaction of the European commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker. Here’s his full statement:I take note with regret of the outcome of the vote in the House of Commons this evening. On the EU side, the process of ratification of the withdrawal agreement continues.The withdrawal agreement is a fair compromise and the best possible deal. It reduces the damage caused by Brexit for citizens and businesses across Europe. It is the only way to ensure an orderly withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union.The risk of a disorderly withdrawal of the United Kingdom has increased with this evening’s vote. While we do not want this to happen, the European commission will continue its contingency work to help ensure the EU is fully prepared.I urge the United Kingdom to clarify its intentions as soon as possible. Time is almost up.The chancellor, Philip Hammond, has moved quickly to quell business anger over the failure of May to get the deal ratified.All the main business groups, including the CBI, the British Chambers of Commerce and dozens of chief executives, were on the conference call at 9pm, in which Hammond expressed “disappointment” at the result.One source on the call said it was “constructive” that the “tone was realistic” about the damage this was inflicting on the economy. However, he was hammered by business leaders over parliament’s refusal to take no deal off the table.“This was the single biggest question he was asked,” said the source just hours after the CBI, the BCC, the Institute of Directors and the Federation of Small Businesses called on the government to urgently remove that option for the sake of Britain.Also on the call were the business secretary, Greg Clark, and the Brexit secretary, Stephen Barclay. A source said:They were also asked about the extension of article 50 but immediately took that out of the conversation by saying that can only happen if we put forward an alternative. The majority of questions were round no deal.The mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, is following the Labour party line that a second referendum should follow any failure to secure a general election:MPs have done the right thing tonight by rejecting the government’s bad Brexit deal. MPs from all political parties realised that this deal would worsen life chances and reduce opportunities for future generations in London and across the UK.What happens next will define our future for decades to come. It is absolutely vital that the prime minister acts immediately to take any prospect of a no-deal Brexit off the table for good. That means withdrawing article 50.We then need a fundamental rethink about how we take this crucial decision. The politicians have failed and, in the absence of a general election, the British public must be allowed to decide what happens next.We’re getting some more reaction to this evening’s vote and where it leaves us from senior figures in Westminster. The Conservative backbencher and former attorney general, Dominic Grieve, has told BBC Radio 5 Live:It’s a very strange experience to be a backbench MP and participate in a huge rebellion against the government that defeats it by such a substantial margin.But that’s a reflection of the fact that the House of Commons collectively looked at the deal the government has negotiated and concluded that it’s a deal which is not in the national interest.Now that’s not the prime minister’s fault in my view – we would have had a different leader and a different prime minister and we’d have still ended up with the same deal – the problem is the direct result and consequence of the Brexit decision.Any deal, I believe, is going to be an unsatisfactory one as viewed by the Commons. Either my ERG colleagues say that it doesn’t fulfil their dreams of what Brexit was supposed to be about, or people like me look at it and say: ‘But this is a third-rate future for our country and frankly we would be much better staying in’.I have always argued for a further referendum because I believe that it is the only way out and, in doing that, I am respectful of the fact that the electorate might turn around and say: ‘Oh no, we want to leave on the prime minister’s deal’.Many are looking ahead to tomorrow’s debate on the no-confidence motion tabled by the Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, following the vote. His party colleague and the shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, has tweeted:Also speaking to 5 Live, the Labour MP, Stephen Doughty, backed a second referendum if the party fails to secure a general election, saying:Labour has a very clear position that was set out in our conference and agreed unanimously by our Labour members and backed by Labour voters as well, which is that we were going to vote down the deal if it didn’t meet the tests, call for a general election and remove the government.If that doesn’t go through, it is very clear that we would have to put this to a public vote.I actually think that is a much bigger thing than Labour policy. I think it’s the right thing to do because ... the reality is that people have changed their minds and have a right in a democracy to look at something, to look at facts and then to make a different decision.And Tory backbencher Paul Scully told the station:Clearly, it didn’t exactly go that well. The only good news is that it didn’t take me that long to vote.At the end of the day, what we need to do now is get through the no-confidence motion tomorrow, which I don’t expect to succeed.The prime minister has said that she’s going to speak to senior parliamentarians, to the DUP, to the Conservative party and see what will fly. Then she needs to go back to the EU and say: ‘Look, see, I told you so. There’s your benchmark, now you’ve got to actually shift’.The problem with speaking to Jeremy Corbyn is that, frankly, if Jeremy Corbyn actually had a plan, given it to the prime minister and put it to a vote, he would have still voted against. That all he is interested in is this general election.As Macron has hinted, however, sympathy among senior political figures on the continent for the view that the EU needs, for its own good, to accommodate the UK’s internal politics may be running short.Prior to the vote, the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders’ chief executive, Mike Hawes, urged MPs to take no-deal off the table. After parliamentarians rejected May’s deal, he added:The vote against the Brexit deal on the table brings us closer to the no-deal cliff edge that would be catastrophic for the automotive industry.Leaving the EU, our biggest and most important trading partner, without a deal and without a transition period to cushion the blow would put this sector and jobs at immediate risk.No-deal must be avoided at all costs. Business needs certainty so we now need politicians to do everything to prevent irreversible damage to this vital sector."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b8f68ca6c263a914aedaa3813496e3538a6900e8/0_18_4347_2609/master/4347.jpg?width=220\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=b8b59f03b76cf084b6796725baab6e94 440w","title":"how did your mp vote on mays brexit deal meaningful vote","story":"MPs rejected the prime minister’s withdrawal agreement with the EU by a margin of 230 votes, prompting a motion of no confidence from Jeremy Corbyn.

It comes at a time when physicists around the world are considering where to build the next cutting-edge particle collider, with other machines under discussion in Japan and China.Fabiola Gianotti, the director general of Cern, called the latest proposal “a remarkable accomplishment”. “It shows the tremendous potential of the FCC to improve our knowledge of fundamental physics and to advance many technologies with a broad impact on society,” she said.Under the plans, the machine would be built up in stages. At first it would collide electrons and positrons, their positive cousins. Then it would collide electrons with much heavier nuclei of lead atoms. By the late 2050s, it would slam protons together with an energy of 100 teraelectronvolts, or nearly 10 times that of the Large Hadron Collider.The subatomic debris thrown out by the collisions could potentially give scientists the chance to study the Higgs particle with unprecedented precision, and create new particles that have so far evaded observation.Peter Higgs predicted the existence of what became known as the Higgs boson in 1964. But the mysterious particle which confers mass on the building blocks of matter was not discovered until 2012 when physicists spotted the telltale signs of its creation in the LHC. The discovery led to the Nobel prize for Peter Higgs the following year.Plans for the FCC, along with other proposals, will now go forward to an international panel of scientists who will consider them as part of a new European strategy for particle physics which is due to be published in 2020.There is no guarantee the machine will be built. In 1993, the US scrapped the construction of the Superconducting Super Collider, a machine somewhat smaller than the FCC, after spending $2bn (£1.5bn) on the machine. In December, plans to build a $7bn International Linear Collider in Japan ran into trouble when an influential science committee concluded the cost was too high.Brian Foster, professor of experimental physics at Oxford University, said that the FCC would be unlikely to suffer the same fate as the Superconducting Super Collider. “If the money can be found credibly to start the project, then I am convinced that Cern would build it successfully,” he said.“Ideally an FCC-like project would be a catalyst to found a true world laboratory, which is the obvious next step. After all, Cern is now clearly unofficially the world’s particle physics lab,” Foster added. “This wouldn’t mean that Asian countries or the US would cease to have their own regional programmes: the majority of US physicists are already involved in the LHC.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/311ee685cc4968f9b49a89a250479e5379e765b1/2_54_2709_1626/master/2709.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4660d0467d83ac5035e5f09991bd336d","title":"mara airoldi brexit lost generation public services","story":"We’ve been wasting years trying to design Brexit, at the expense of local government, the NHS and social care, says the thinktank headMara Airoldi is in despair about the state of the UK’s public services. “This will be known as the lost generation, because nothing is happening except Brexit,” says the Oxford-based economist. Airoldi, who holds a master’s degree in decision science, is director of the UK’s Government Outcomes Lab – GO Lab for short – an independent research group funded by Oxford’s Blavatnik School of Government and the UK Cabinet Office with the ambitious aim of revolutionising public services.In real life, that means local public services – councils, health bodies, social care providers, police, charities and so on – working together, making better spending decisions to cope with cuts. Airoldi’s team runs regular sessions for local public managers to improve skills in a number of areas, especially project management and decision-making. Trying to make public bodies work together is neither rocket science nor new. Practically everyone involved in UK public service for the past 40 years has pointed out that iding up public money into different departments or silos is a very bad way to cope with issues like obesity or truancy.But change requires backing from central government and recent history is littered with Whitehall’s failed attempts to create more joined-up approaches. While Sure Start and, more recently, projects to join up health and social care have had some success, many more have failed, from Tony Blair’s delivery unit in the early noughties – “targets-led and top-down –” to universal credit and the troubled families programme, which attempted to identify and support 120,000 families that were, in theory, costing the state most to support. A dubious enterprise from the start, it was a project that, according to its final evaluation in 2016, had no discernible impact on the families it was supposed to help.And for all the warm words on prevention, the civil service, local government and the NHS still operate on a model of crisis management, which costs much more than it would to tackle the causes of problems. Now, Airoldi says, Brexit is making it almost impossible for central government to learn anything useful from innovative local projects by councils, the NHS, social care providers, prisons or other public services. “The main worry in my mind is the interruption from Brexit,” she comments. “We need additional social services, and we’ve been wasting years trying to design Brexit.”Councils are being starved of cash, while the underlying factors that create social problems such as obesity, or reoffending, remain unaddressed. “It’s an almost 19th-century situation,” says Airoldi, akin to Victorian London battling disease while leaving the Thames a stinking open sewer. Trying to talk to central government about anything other than the UK’s exit from the EU is, she says, like talking to a mother getting her four children ready for school. “They need to be out of the door and it’s late. She doesn’t have the mental bandwidth to listen. Brexit is creating this distraction and even if you have very capable and brilliant civil servants they don’t have a listening ear.”Even where local experiments have worked, the government has been so narrowly focused on cost that it hasn’t been able to see the true long-term value. In Peterborough, for instance, a five-year project to reduce reoffending rates has had many positive benefits and was described by the then-justice secretary, Chris Grayling, as “encouraging”. But the charities involved were not picked when the scheme was extended nationally – because they were too expensive. “The inability to measure quality is a massive barrier. Central government isn’t gathering, analysing, sharing or guiding learning to build methodically on what is known,” says Airoldi.Ultimately, Airoldi fears for public services, already battered by austerity, in the aftermath of Brexit, particularly if the UK’s GDP takes the kind of hit many predict. “We need some answers,” she says.

It also took 46 weeks – twice the statutory timescale - to complete his education, health and care (EHC) plan, which sets out a child’s legal requirements to additional support.In the second case, the ombudsman said the council had failed to provide a primary school-aged boy with suitable education provision after he was excluded, causing him to miss out on full-time education for eight months.Announcing his judgments in favour of both parents, the ombudsman pointed out that he had upheld nine similar complaints in Norfolk.King said recently: “While our investigations can only provide part of the picture of how the SEN system is functioning – that picture is causing concern. The reality is that some families are suffering a disproportionate burden in having to battle for the support their children are entitled to.”Following the two most recent cases affecting Norfolk, the council agreed to a number of service reviews and improvements, including examining other ways of providing alternative education for children out of school and completing an audit of children missing from education for whom it has a duty to provide education.It has also agreed to review its working processes to ensure EHC plans are produced within statutory timescales and to improve the way it monitors missing professional advice it requires in order to complete the plans.Norfolk county council said it fully accepted the LGO’s findings and has already complied with all recommendations. A spokesman said: “We want all children to get access to the very best education and we are very sorry that there were delays for both of these children and their families.“It is encouraging that the LGO has welcomed the proactive steps we’ve taken to improve provision and oversight of services for children with SEN since these complaints were raised.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/89628a7632734ba22226adae806e763aba79a569/4_230_4105_2463/master/4105.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1dbbfff327d9efcd60c1fcb705e0cdb4","title":"rehab centre learning disabilities secure units community","story":"When Julie Newcombe visited her learning disabled son, Jamie, he was subdued and nursing a swollen arm.Staff at the care unit in the south of England where he had been living for a few weeks said that Jamie, 23, who has autism and intermittent mental health issues, became distressed and hit a care worker. Giving evidence to parliament in December, Newcombe told MPs that his arm was subsequently broken by a support worker in a restraint. “The arm was wrenched up behind his back until the bone snapped,” she said. “He was not taken to accident and emergency for 24 hours even though his arm was completely swollen.”Jamie spent a year in the privately run locked rehabilitation unit in 2015. These units are meant to provide therapeutic care on locked wards in the community, and support people moving from long-term inpatient care into their local area. Before rehab, Jamie was in psychiatric intensive care and then in a hospital-style assessment and treatment unit (ATU), having been sectioned under the mental health act at 18, when his residential care broke down.But Newcombe says Jamie’s care did little to help him live in the community again – and that the rehab activities mainly included being taught to cook and clean. She adds: “I visited every day and was allowed to take Jamie out … we’d go shopping or to the cafe, but inside rehab, he was restrained and locked away.” Newcombe, who co-founded the human rights campaign Rightful Lives to champion the interests of people with learning disabilities and autism, and to highlight cases where they have been breached, says local authorities and clinical commissioning groups use these secure units instead of finding adequate support for people in the community. “Locked rehab is a handy extra step in the system when you want to keep people locked up,” she says. “It’s a tempting alternative to moving people back to the community.”Last week’s NHS long-term plan included a new target to reduce the numbers in ATUs by half compared to 2015 levels (when there were around 3,000 people in such units). After the 2011 Winterbourne View abuse scandal exposed the reality of some ATUs, the government promised to move all inpatients into community-based housing within three years under its transforming care programme. That target was missed.Despite being designed for temporary care and assessment while long-term support is organised, many residents have been there for more than two years. Progress has been slow and latest figures show that 2,350 people still live in ATUs. And the avoidable death of Connor Sparrowhawk in an NHS-run ATU in 2013 underlined the failures in these units.Now, campaigners fear the looming deadline to discharge patients from ATUs, together with a separate government-commissioned review of the use of restraint, prolonged seclusion and segregation for people with mental health problems, a learning disability andor autism, will simply lead to more people being discharged into equally restrictive places such as locked rehab units.Last week, the Commons’ joint committee on human rights quizzed NHS England and the Care Quality Commission (CQC) regulator as part of its inquiry into conditions at learning disability units.NHS Digital figures show increasing numbers of people moving to places classed as “other” types of care(compared with those going to residential or community care, for example). What “other” includes is not defined, raising concerns about what type of care this is.Chris Hatton, professor of public health and disability at Lancaster University, says: “Without transparency, it’s possible to game the statistics to make the ‘transforming care’ numbers look good while consigning people to invisibility in places that feel very similar to inpatient units.”Lib Dem MP and former health minister Norman Lamb says the rush to move people out of ATUs risks creating a revolving door of discharge and readmission. This is because “you discharge people to inappropriate or unacceptable settings that don’t actually enhance their quality of life”.This was the experience of Alexis Quinn. Quinn, who is autistic, spent five months in locked rehab in southern England in 2015 after more than three years in an ATU, psychiatric intensive and acute mental health care. She calls locked rehab “an oxymoron”: “How can you rehabilitate someone into community life when they are locked up?” The CQC has previously warned against the use of locked rehab for mental health patients, while the Royal College of Psychiatrists does not accept it as a type of care. “The facilities appear to be defined by having a locked door rather than the specific type of rehabilitation service they offer,” says Rajesh Mohan, chair of the rehabilitation and social psychiatry faculty at the RCP.Residential homes for learning disabled or autistic people can be just as oppressive. Tom Richardson, 17, (not his real name) has severe learning disabilities and spent 18 months on and off in one ATU in the north of England in his early teens. His initial discharge to a privately run group care home failed as Tom found it overwhelming. After another ATU spell, he went to a small, private care home. He was the sole resident, there was an office by the entrance and some staff wore suits. Tom’s mother, Amy, says: “We were shocked. We felt that the care wasn’t therapeutic but focused on physical restraint and seclusion.”Tom’s experience shows a successful move to the community is possible, but there is an additional concern.While there is a new target to reduce ATU use in the NHS long-term plan, there is nothing to replace the transforming care agenda after March. Steve Scown, chief executive of voluntary sector support provider Dimensions, says: “Without such a central focus, who’s going to make sure we’re not seeing people being transferred into privately owned and managed long-stay institutions?”An NHS England spokeswoman says it is investing £75m to improve specialist community support for learning disabled and autistic people: “Treatment and care reviews are in place to ensure the right care and support is provided to help people live as independently as possible and close to their family and friends.”Back in Surrey, Jamie Newcombe is now living in a flat in a residential care development in Surrey. He is happy, says Julie, although deeply affected by his locked rehab experience: “When he’s anxious or upset, he’ll shout about what happened when his arm was broken.” Eventually, she says, her son hopes to move closer to home in London: “Jamie has a human right to a family life.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/86136d58b9e361788c1857e6517c1584657c69e9/0_109_2834_1701/master/2834.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9c05161535f65603da645fa58b9c5be5","title":"aryna sabalenka wins praises katie boulter australian open tennis","story":"Katie Boulter was lauded for a brave losing debut in the Australian Open, but it was equally obvious that opponents such as the powerful young Belarusian who beat her in straight sets, Aryna Sabalenka, will make life difficult for everyone on the Tour in the next decade or so.Sabalenka, at 20, is two years younger than her Leicester opponent, but 86 places ahead of her in the rankings at No 11 – and it was easy to see why as she struck seven aces among 26 clean winners to win 6-3, 6-4 in their second-round match at the Melbourne Arena, where Andy Murray bowed out on Monday.These two fine players have many years in front of them, and Boulter’s ranking probably will not linger around the century mark for much longer.Sabalenka said of Boulter: “She’s an aggressive player, plays down the lines, a lot of winners. It was hard to pick up the right corner where she’s going because she’s going, like, really hard and deep – really flat balls. Sometimes it’s tough to control them.”She added: “I’m so happy to win. She played great. Me, too, actually. It was really good match.” Her next opponent is Amanda Anisimova, the American 17-year-old ranked No 87 in the world, who knocked out the 24th seed Lesia Tsurenko 6-0, 6-2 in just 54 minutes.It should be an interesting match-up. The American-born daughter of Russian parents – a former US Open junior champion – is being groomed by sports management group IMG as “the new Maria Sharapova”.Boulter, who beat Ekaterina Makarova in the first round, leaves the tournament disappointed but right to believe she can be in that mix. “I thought I stuck with her pretty well,” she said. “It’s encouraging for me to play someone like that not playing my best tennis but still be in there with a chance to win a set or two. I didn’t feel like I put my best game on the court. She played very well – it’s very tough to read her serve.”Boulter was being a little hard on herself, according to the former British No 1 Annabel Croft, watching the match for Eurosport. “Katie should be very proud of what she put out there against a world No 11. Sabalenka is one of the most exciting prospects on the Tour. Katie came out striking the ball with authority, really big hitting from the back of the court.”Jo Durie, a quarter-finalist here in 1983, agrees. “Katie’s run in the tournament will inspire her to get out there and work even harder on her game.”“This week has been massive. The past couple of weeks as well. My whole trip to Australia has been a learning experience. It has been really great for me. I have been surrounded by people I am not normally around. I have learned so much from just playing matches on big courts, which I haven’t done before. I feel a lot more settled out there. And I will definitely use it for the rest of my year.”Her two wins have added $180,000 to her earnings, but she won’t be indulging herself. “I will be putting the money towards my tennis. You have to invest in yourself to get the rewards.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b301c6ed6fdfc01bcd4996adbaba6e07e1eb774e/0_16_3846_2308/master/3846.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6ddb4175fa3e275c2d8a9c8d1b060ca5","title":"dan evans emerges from australian open defeat to roger federer with great credit","story":"A year after he found himself “in a pretty bad place” and contemplating retirement from tennis at 27, Dan Evans can smile again, bathed in accolades for three sets against Roger Federer that lit up day three of the Australian Open – and gave the loser much-needed heart.It took Federer two and a half hours to beat the world No 189 7-6 (5), 7-6 (3), 6-3 on the Rod Laver Arena, a place where he has celebrated victory in the first major of the year six times.None of that fazed the Solihull adventurer, a plainly gifted player who has survived the excesses of his own personality, including a nine-month ban for testing positive for cocaine. That pitched him towards the edge. This has dragged him back.As he said later, he was not remotely interested in his sport this time last year. He was still banned, and a nuisance to all around him, he admitted.“I had a good amount of people around me telling me it wasn’t as bad as I thought, and you come out of it on the other side. Hopefully I can kick on and get back to where I was.“I was at home in Cheltenham, just in the house – pretty much depressed, actually. I didn’t think I’d ever play again. It’s difficult times, like. I don’t know how I end up still having the people around me who were there. I was difficult to be around. I owe them a lot. That’s what you’ve got family and friends for. Hopefully, they enjoyed this week as much as I did.”Certainly the spectators rose to his heroics, even if, as ever, the majority were hoping Federer would not be dumped out of the tournament, or even mildly inconvenienced. Evans did more than that.Buoyed by three decent wins in qualifying, Evans played with freedom, “nothing to lose‚” as he said. He was two points from taking the first set in the tie-break but was over-eager in charging in behind his serve, dumped a difficult volley, shoved the next chance wide and the moment had gone. He saved two set points in the second, broke back with a brilliant backhand winner and forced a second shootout. The third was more straightforward but he tried all the way. Federer was impressed.In reference to the similarities in their method and tennis philosophy, from the one-handed backhands to the sliced returns, as well as their willingness to attack at every opportunity, he said: “It felt like playing in a mirror a little bit. My thought going in was that I was playing myself, potentially. I had maybe a little more size.”Evans laughed at that. “I think he meant in game style rather than level.” He was encouraged, though, by Federer’s praise.On Evans’s prospects of ever returning to a career-high 41 in the world, Federer said: “I didn’t even know his ranking. For me he’s a top 100 player. Once you’re 80 or 60 or 40, you can be all those things, and beyond probably. I just think it’s in the details at the end of the day.”He said it was in Evans’s own hands how well he did from this point of a most interesting career. “How much can you give to the sport? How much are you willing? Can you stay injury-free? Get your ranking up, be really there for the crucial moments? I think he can be top 50 again, no problem.”That was almost as good as a win. Almost."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/627600bfd71623431c8b785eca1b6ae7e81a5cc5/0_164_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=deb224f10c19bb0e0900e1e752323692","title":"gregor townsend names seven uncapped players scotland rugby union six nations squad","story":"Gregor Townsend has named seven uncapped players in his 39-man Scotland squad for the Six Nations.Three hookers – Edinburgh’s David Cherry, Leicester’s Jake Kerr and Grant Stewart of Glasgow – have been handed call-ups following injuries to Fraser Brown and George Turner.

Once again, our squad features players aiming to take that step, which is a testimony to their performances this season and the growing strength in depth of Scottish rugby.“We are very proud of what a number of our players have achieved since the autumn Tests, particularly with Edinburgh and Glasgow Warriors both aiming to make the last eight of the Heineken Champions Cup for the first time and both sitting in strong positions in their respective Guinness Pro 14 conferences.”Townsend added: “We’ve also seen some excellent performances from players representing clubs in France and England, which is a credit to their commitment and work ethic. It is a privilege for our players to be involved in the Guinness Six Nations, which is such a prestigious tournament and will be highly competitive once again. We look forward to taking on the challenge of Italy and working hard as a squad over the next two weeks to deliver a winning performance.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b66795a706101bc71f4e1711f3fb2e17abe82652/0_217_2591_1555/master/2591.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f8d2d8c1c9267f4efef5557c3285a771","title":"uk athletics turmoil richard bowker steps down chairman","story":"UK Athletics was plunged into turmoil on Wednesday as Richard Bowker’s short and undistinguished reign as chairman ended with him stepping down before he was pushed. UK Athletics is now without a chair or a chief executive, with Niels de Vos having also left the organisation last autumn.Bowker, who took over as chair from Ed Warner in 2017, knew the writing was on the well when the UK Athletics members’ council moved to force through a vote of no confidence in him. The council were particularly unhappy with Bowker’s plans to make England Athletics and the other home nations subservient to UK Athletics, and were also increasingly questioning his lack of leadership and the direction the sport was going.His legacy also includes last year’s poorly attended Athletics World Cup, which was held on the same weekend as the World Cup final and Wimbledon finals, and reportedly lost over £1m.One senior figure said Bowker, who earned £40,000 a year, would not be missed. “The sport has undoubtedly gone backwards under his reign,” they told the . Another said that while Bowker was a good accountant he lacked an understanding of athletics and had not done enough to address its fundamental problems, which included the need to better promote the sport in an era where the heroes from London 2012 were either retired or at the end of their careers, and to do more to help the grassroots.However, in a statement UK Athletics said the organisation had “made significant strides under Richard’s leadership” and insisted that he had “led the development of new strategies for key areas including talent development, competition and coaching”.“The board is very sorry to see him leave at this time, but based on the recent decisions while he was chair, the progress that will now be made in the areas of talent, competition and coaching in the coming years will be the real legacy of his tenure,” it added.Sarah Rowell, a current member of the UKA’s board and a former Olympic marathon runner, will take over until a new permanent chair is recruited. Insiders insist that Rowell is highly respected figure and will work well with interim CEO Nigel Holl to steady the ship.“I am honoured to take this role and alongside the board am committed to ensuring the sport comes together to work to ensure that it is in great shape in the future,” said Rowell. “This means ensuring that the core at the heart of the sport – the clubs, coaches and volunteers – are best placed to support current and future generations of athletes.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/57100d540c7e43f0a6c233285ee167cf02b23886/0_26_3934_2361/master/3934.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a8e234d08a0105e810140d4174f6260e","title":"rafael nadal angelique kerber maria sharapova australian open live","story":"The tennis isn’t done yet - Maria Sharapova and Rebecca Peterson are out on court now. Hooray for them. This is the final match of day three.Alex de Minaur has fought through the nerves and the tiredness to seal his place in the third round, sending the home fans wild on Margaret Court Arena. The only problem for the Australian wonderkid? He’s goig to have to play Rafa Nadal after playing five gruelling sets. Still, this 6-4, 6-2, 6-7, 4-6, 6-3 win is one to savour for the 27th seed. He’ll give Nadal a game.Over on Margaret Court Arena, they’re witnessing one hell of a match between Alex de Minaur and Henri Laaksonen. The tension’s high as the home fans attempt to get the young Australian over the line in the fifth set. We join them with Laaksonen serving at 3-4 – and just in time to see De Minaur break! He’ll serve for a place in the third round.Ripping that forehand, Nadal gives himself a match point at 40-30. Ebden keeps fighting, saves it and earns a break point. Nadal scrubs it out with a firm serve. Then he earns a second chance. No more messing around. Nadal takes his opportunity this time and moves into the third round. He’s looking good after recent injury problems.But Henri Laaksonen isn’t giving up. After a long slog through deuce, he breaks back in the fifth set. Alex de Minaur can’t believe it.There’s better news for Australian fans as far as Alex de Minaur is concerned. The youngster has the early break in the fifth set against Henri Laaksonen.Matthew Ebden’s earning some generous applause from the home fans with some spirited play on Rod Laver Arena. All a bit late, though, given Nadal’s well on the way to winning in straight sets. It’s a doddle for Rafa Nadal, who leads by two sets and a break on Rod Laver Arena. Day three’s almost over. But we’re still waiting for Maria Sharapova and Rebecca Peterson, who have been delayed by the shenanigans between Alex de Minaur and Henri Laaksonen.Speaking of matches going the distance, Alex de Minaur is going to have to do it the hard way to reach the third round. This is an impressive fightback from Henri Laaksonen, who’s taken the fourth set 6-4.A brave fight from John Millman, but to no avail. The Australian’s out after losing 6-3, 6-1, 3-6, 6-7, 6-4 to Roberto Bautista Agut, who plays the No10 seed Karen Khachanov in the next round.A Matthew Ebden return sails wide and Rafa Nadal crunches into a 6-3, 6-2 lead. Ebden was fearless early on, but reality’s taken hold now.Just nipped off to get a coffee. And have returned to see that Bautista Agut has the crucial break in the fifth set against John Millman. The Spaniard will serve at 4-3.Alex de Minaur has regrouped, breaking back to get the fourth set back on serve against Henri Laaksonen. Meanwhile it’s tight in the fifth set between Roberto Bautista Agut and John Millman.Rafa Nadal doesn’t have to wait long for a break at the start of the second set. He knocks on the door with enough intent to force Matthew Ebden to net. Nadal leads 6-3, 2-1 and this has the whiff of formality about it.Things are starting to unravel for Alex de Minaur. He was two sets up, he had match point in the third set, but it’s Henri Laaksonen who has an early break in the fourth. De Minaur needs to regroup quickly.The first set goes to Rafa Nadal. He frowns as he looks at his box and clenches his fist. It hasn’t been plain sailing but he’s taken control since that botched volley from Matthew Ebden, winning the set 6-3.Sure enough, Rafa Nadal breaks, capitalising on double-faults from Matthew Ebden. He’ll serve for the first set at 5-3. As for Grigor Dimitrov, the 20th seed has finally seen off Pablo Cuevas, beating the Uruguayan 6-3, 6-7, 6-3, 7-5.You have to take your hat off to John Millman, who’s only gone and forced that fifth set against Roberto Bautista Agut on Hisense Arena. Bautista Agut had match points in the tie-break, but Millman’s digging ridiculously deep and has sent the home fans wild as he threatens to win from two sets down. Meanwhile Alex de Minaur has been taken to a fourth set by Henri Laaksonen, who saved a match point before winning the third-set tie-break.Matthew Ebden is giving Rafa Nadal a few early problems on Rod Laver Arena. He’s showing no fear and a fizzing forehand down the line earns him a break point at 3-3. Yet Nadal is strong enough the net to force deuce. Ebden earns another chance and he plays the rally magnificently - until he nets a backhand volley with Nadal stranded. Eventually Nadal holds to lead 4-3. Ebden might look back at that volley and wonder.Having served for the fourth set at 5-4, now John Millman’s having to deal with the disappointment of being broken. Roberto Bautista Agut will fancy his chances of getting this done without having to go through a fifth set.We’ve got three Aussie men in action now. Matthew Ebden’s just held his opening service game against Rafa Nadal on Rod Laver Arena, Alex de Minaur’s two sets up and battling hard in the third against Henri Laaksonen, and John Millman is threatening to force a fifth set against Roberto Bautista Agut, who’s having flashbacks to his dramatic tussle with Andy Murray on Monday.On Rod Laver Arena, they’ve just said hello to Rafael Nadal and Matthew Ebden. Nadal has won his only previous meeting with the world No48.Grigor Dimitrov, the 20th seed, has a grip on proceedings on Court 3 again. He leads 6-3, 6-7, 6-3 against Pablo Cuevas. As for Alex de Minaur, he’s two sets up against Henri Laaksonen - though the Swiss qualifier leads 4-1 in the third set.Maia sends one final forehand wide and Kerber, who looks totally dialled in, celebrates with the look of someone who’s pleased to have got the job done with such efficiency. The former champion moves on to play the Australian qualifier Kimberly Birrell, who stunned Croatia’s Donna Vekic earlier.Angelique Kerber will serve for the match. She breaks when Beatriz Haddad Maia knocks a forehand wide. It’s 6-2, 5-3 to the No2 seed.Alex de Minaur is serving for a two-set lead against Henri Laaksonen. Elsewhere Grigor Dimitrov has established a measure of control against Pablo Cuevas, breaking to lead in 6-3, 6-7, 3-1.There’s hope yet for John Millman on Hisense Arena! The Australian’s only gone and taken the third set to lift home hopes, though Roberto Bautista still leads 6-3, 6-1, 3-6.Grigor Dimitrov has been dragged into a battle by Pablo Cuevas, who’s levelled it up on Court 3 after snatching the second set on a tie-break. You don’t want to rely on Grigor too much. It’s never a wise move.After 47 minutes, Angelique Kerber yelps “Come on!” as she clenches her fist and walks back to her chair with the first set in the bag. The second seed took it 6-2, which makes it look easy, though she has been inconvenienced here and there by Beatriz Haddad Maia, the Brazilian qualifier. Maia’s determined not to roll over. Alex de Minaur, who could play Rafael Nadal in the third round, is a set up against Henri Laaksonen. The young Australian took it 6-4.While I was distracted by a long chat with the football editor here, Belinda Bencic went and pulled off a remarkable turnaround in the third set against Yulia Putintseva on Court 20. She was a break down but the Swiss has ended up winning 7-6, 4-6, 6-2. Bencic will play Petra Kvitova next – the Czech had an easy win over Irina-Camelia Begu.Angelique Kerber’s having little trouble dealing with her Brazilian opponent so far. The German already has an early break on Rod Laver Arena – a few nice touches from Beatriz Haddad Maia haven’t been enough to make an impact so far.Just to put Andy Murray’s five-set defeat to Roberto Bautista Agut in context, the Spaniard leads 6-3, 5-0 against John Millman. Meanwhile Yulia Putintseva is threatening to pull off a very impressive comeback against Belinda Bencic – after losing the first set to the Swiss, the Kazakh has an early break in the decider.The first set belongs to Grigor Dimitrov on Court 3. He took it 6-3 against Pablo Cuevas. As for Petra Kvitova, she remains in control against Irina-Camelia Begu, who’ll do well to fight back from a set and a break down.They’re out on the two main courts. Angelique Kerber, the No2 seed and 2016 champion, meets Beatriz Haddad Maia on Rod Laver Arena, while Alex de Minaur is up against Henri Laaksonen on Margaret Court Arena. De Minaur, seeded 27th, could go deep here. Big things are expected from the young Australian.Roberto Bautista Agut, conqueror of Andy Murray in the first round, is breaking hearts again. This time the 22nd seed’s foiling a home hopeful on Hisense Arena, taking the first set 6-3 off John Millman.No problems for Petra Kvitova so far. The former Wimbledon champion’s taken the first set 6-1 against the outgunned Irina-Camelia Begu, who can’t live with her opponent’s raw power.In fast start news, Grigor Dimitrov leads 3-0 in the first set against Pablo Cuevas. You’ll note that Dimitrov, a semi-finalist in 2017, is the 20th seed this year. The Bulgarian was meant to produce so much more after winning the ATP World Tour Finals two seasons ago, but it’s still not really happening for him. First-round defeats to Stan Wawrinka at Wimbledon and the US Open last year were hugely disappointing. At the age of 27, we’re no longer talking about a guy with potential.It’s a demolition so far. Petra Kvitova earns three break points and her venomous forehand gives her a 4-0 lead. She’s hitting it so hard. Begu can’t live with it at all.Petra Kvitova’s got her eye in early on. She’s broken already against Irina-Camelia Begu and her movement looks spot on, which is always a good sign for the Czech.Over on Court 20, Belinda Bencic has snatched the first set 7-5 off Yulia Putintseva. Meanwhile Petra Kvitova and Irina-Camelia Begu are underway.Roger Federer’s third round opponent? It’s Taylor Fritz, who’s just secured a very good win over Gael Monils, the 30th seed. The young American took it 6-3, 6-7 (8), 7-6 (6), 7-6 (5). Fine margins. It was more comfortable for Karen Khachanov, the powerful young Russian winning in three sets against Yoshihito Nishioka. The 10th seed has never been in the third round here before.There’s no shame in losing this one for Boulter. It’s not a drubbing – but Sabalenka, two years younger than Boulter, is on a different level. The Belarusian is through to the third round and her power will make her a serious threat.Another Brit bit the dust earlier today, though Dan Evans emerged with plenty of credit after an entertaining battle with Roger Federer, who plays Gael Monfils or Taylor Fritz next. Fans on Rod Laver Arena have also seen Sloane Stephens beat Timea Babos and Ashleigh Barty beat Wang Yafan. One of the more eye-catching results on day three, meanwhile, is the USA’s Frances Tiafoe beating the No5 seed Kevin Anderson in four sets. That’s a top win for the highly rated American youngster. Marin Cilic is also through to the third round after beating Mackenzie McDonald, while Stefanos Tsitsipas beat Victor Troicki in four.Elsewhere Caroline Wozniacki has cruised into round three, beating Sweden’s Johanna Larsson 6-1, 6-3. The defending champion will play Maria Sharapova or Rebecca Peterson next.Speaking of British tennis, it’s over to Melbourne Arena, where Katie Boulter’s in action against Aryna Sabalenka, the brilliant Belarusian. However it isn’t going to well for Boulter. The 22-year-old from Leicester lost the first set 6-3 and finds herself a break down deep in the second.Our man in Melbourne, Kevin Mitchell, has been nattering with Jamie Murray.Hello and welcome to live coverage of the night session on day three of the Australian Open. The main event - assuming we aren’t just going to watch a stroll - is Rafael Nadal taking on Australia’s Matthew Ebden, who’ll have plenty of home support on Rod Laver Arena. All that shouting might not be enough, though. That’s the last match of the day on that court.Elsewhere in the men’s second round, Aussies will be more hopeful when they watch their rising wonderkid, Alex de Minaur, take on Henri Laaksonen. John Millman, who beat Roger Federer at last year’s US Open, is also in action – he plays the 22nd seed, Roberto Bautista Agut, who beat Andy Murray in five sets on Monday. Bulgaria’s Grigor Dimitrov against Uruguay’s Pablo Cuevas is another one to look out for.As for the women, we have the Wimbledon champion Angelique Kerber up first on Rod Laver Arena. The German meets Beatriz Haddad Maia of Brazil and will expect to win comfortably. Whether the same can be said of Maria Sharapova is less certain, though - the former champion had a good win over Harriet Dart on Monday, but she’s looked past her peak in the past two years and could have to work hard against Sweden’s Rebecca Peterson. Elsewhere we have Petra Kvitova versus Irina-Camelia Begu. That’s enough to be getting on with, isn’t it?"},{"url":null,"title":"youtube removes adverts for far right britain first","story":"Film in which leader confronts Muslim outreach volunteers shown before Brexit contentYouTube has removed an advert for the far-right Britain First from its platform, after clips promoting the group began appearing on the video-hosting website.The five-and-a-half-minute unskippable video was displayed before content relating to Brexit and British politics.It prominently displayed the Britain First logo and contained a link to the group’s YouTube channel.The advert showed the group’s leader, Paul Golding, and a number of supporters confronting volunteers at a Muslim outreach stall in Nuneaton in November 2018.The men accuse Golding of harassment and say they have called the police.YouTube removed the advert for breaching its advertising rules prohibiting adverts that promote hatred, intolerance and discrimination after being contacted for comment by the .A spokesperson said: “YouTube does not allow ads or videos that promote hatred, intolerance or discrimination on the platform.

Asked if he told authorities in 2016 that Guzmán arranged the bribe, he answered: “That’s right.”Peña Nieto was president of Mexico from December 2012 until November 2018. He previously served as governor of the state of Mexico.The former president made no immediate comment on the allegation. His former spokesman and other former officials did not immediately respond to messages requesting comment.Guzmán, 61, has been on trial in federal court in Brooklyn since November. He was extradited to the United States in 2017 to face charges of trafficking cocaine, heroin and other drugs into the country as leader of the cartel.At the start of the trial in November, defence attorney Jeffrey Lichtman alleged on behalf of his client that that Mexican officials – including Peña Nieto and his predecessor – had received bribes to protect Ismael “El Mayo” Zambada, another reputed trafficker who is still at large.At the time, a spokesman for Peña Nieto called the allegation “false and defamatory”, while his predecessor Felipe Calderón tweeted that the remarks were “absolutely false and reckless”.The judge in the case, Brian Cogan admonished Lichtman for having gone “far afield of direct or circumstantial proof”. He said he would instruct the jury to focus on the evidence.At the end of the first week of trial, Guzmán’s lawyers told the judge that a witness would describe a payment to an “incumbent” Mexican president.He was stopped from doing so by a prosecutors’ motion, upheld by Judge Cogan, “protecting iniduals and entities who are not parties to this case and who would face embarrassment”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2003556dfff918a31163a5b1befd62d181027fce/0_220_4071_2443/master/4071.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d3f294059b50f57b114234d40f3dc97b","title":"barbies turning 60 in pictures","story":"She is 60 this year and still doesn’t have a single wrinkle!

The Border in Ireland will become the only land border between the UK and the EU after Brexit – one as important to the EU as major crossing points in Eastern Europe.The 1998 Belfast Agreement – better known internationally as the Good Friday Agreement – laid the foundation for Northern Ireland’s peace process with many all-island rules and institutions.Neither side, to be fair, wants the return of border checks because of the risk to peace, with fears that a physical border infrastructure would be considered a potential target for paramilitaries.Brussels believed a hard border could be avoided and the Belfast Agreement upheld if Northern Ireland remained fully aligned with the European Union’s customs union and part of the single market after Brexit.This would mean matching the rules north and south of the Border for customs, energy, environmental regulations and laws covering agriculture and fisheries.Northern Ireland would stick, too, to EU rules covering state aids and would fall under the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice in applying those rules.The European Union’s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, initially insisted that this so-called backstop could only apply in Northern Ireland.London argued that if the backstop only applied to Northern Ireland, it would effectively create a customs and regulatory border in the Irish Sea. The DUP also objected.Under British prime minister Theresa May’s current plan, the backstop would apply to the United Kingdom as a whole. However, the current proposal is still strongly opposed by the DUP and many hard Brexiteers.Everyone involved – Brussels, Dublin, May – has insisted again and again that the backstop is an insurance policy, one that no one wants to use.Instead, they emphasise that it would only apply if the EU and UK could not reach an overarching free trade deal that would make trade so frictionless that there would be no border between the EU and the UK, including on the frontier between Northern Ireland and the Republic. However, these assurances have not dampened down opposition to the withdrawal agreement.Despite what some in the United Kingdom believe now, the warnings about the implications that Brexit could have on the Border were given before UK voters went to the polls in June 2016, not least by the then taoiseach Enda Kenny in London in January 2016 after a meeting in Downing Street with David Cameron.“From our perspective it would create serious difficulties for Northern Ireland and I don’t want to see that happening,” Mr Kenny declared later, speaking to journalists.Immediately, Mr Kenny was criticised by the Democratic Unionist Party and by some in the Conservative party, with DUP MP Sammy Wilson saying that Mr Kenny had been recruited by Mr Cameron to spread the “scare tactics of the pro-Europe camp in the United Kingdom”.Days before the referendum, Mr Kenny returned again to London. Before doing so, he warned that he could not see any way in which the introduction of border checks could be avoided if the UK voted to leave.“Were that to happen, obviously it means paperwork, it means administration, it means lost time, it means greater inefficiency, it means greater cost.“It would not be the wish of the Irish Government that there would be a restoration of customs and border controls, but that would not be in our capacity not to have it,” he warned.Now one of the key questions is what happens if the withdrawal agreement is not finalised and there is a no-deal Brexit. No side wants to impose border checks, but to avoid smuggling and protect the EU single market, the Irish Government would come under pressure to do so.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

Photograph: Charles McQuillanGettyWhy is the Irish Border such a big deal with Brexit? The 499-kilometre border running from Carlingford Lough to Lough Foyle will become the only land border between the UK and the European Union after Brexit.The 1998 Belfast Agreement brought peace to Northern Ireland and removed the need for border checks.It also established north-south rules and institutions that helped solidify the Peace Process. The border is currently invisible and neither side wants the return of infrastructure along the border or the creation of a hard border.So what exactly is a hard border? It is a frontier monitored and protected by customs officials and border inspectors, and potentially police or military personnel if there are security issues around the border.That could in turn lead to a police or military presence along the Border to protect check points. Customs and security posts along the Border were regular targets of republican paramilitaries during the 30-year Troubles.Why would there be a need for border checks? Different customs rules, regulations and standards will apply in Northern Ireland and the Republic if the UK is leaving the EU so the different rules could have to be enforced at a border.What do the EU and UK want along the Border? Neither party to the Brexit negotiations wants to see the return of a hard border but they cannot agree a plan on how to achieve this.So have they come up with anything to solve this problem? The EU and UK agreed in a political deal in December 2017 that a “backstop” was required in the withdrawal agreement – the orce deal – that would guarantee an invisible border in the event of no other solution to achieve this being found in a Brexit deal, either in a specific solution for Northern Ireland or in a broader EU-UK trade deal.The December 2017 agreement also aims to protect north-south cooperation, support the all-island economy and safeguards the 1998 Belfast Agreement. In March 2018 the two sides agreed that there had to be a legal text – not just a political declaration – around how this option would work in practice should no better option be found.What exactly is the backstop? It is an insurance policy written into the withdrawal agreement, or Brexit treaty, guaranteeing no harder border on the island of Ireland.It would only be used as a last resort or the default option if the EU and UK could not reach an overarching free trade deal that would make trade so frictionless that there would be no border between the EU and the UK, including on the frontier between Northern Ireland and the Republic.How have the backstop talks developed ? Brussels believed a hard border could be avoided and the Belfast Agreement upheld if Northern Ireland remains fully aligned with the EU’s customs union and parts of the single market after Brexit.This would mean matching the rules north and south of the Border for customs, energy, environmental regulations and laws covering agriculture and fisheries,.Northern Ireland would stick to EU rules covering state aid and would fall under the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice in applying those rules. The EU’s chief negotiator Michel Barnier initially insisted that this backstop can only apply to Northern Ireland.London argued that if the backstop only applies to Northern Ireland, it would effectively create a customs and regulatory border in the Irish Sea. The DUP also objected. They oppose any checks between Ireland and Britain and what they see as a border in the Irish Sea.So what finally appeared in the withdrawal agreement on the backstop? The UK government suggested a backstop that would keep the whole of the UK aligned with EU customs union \u0026nbspafter the post-Brexit transition period.\u0026nbsp The tranistion is\u0026nbspa standstill period when current EU economic rules continue to apply over the UK. Under the agreement it is due to\u0026nbspexpire\u0026nbspat the end of 2020 but it could be extended to 2022.\u0026nbspThe backstop would be triggered if the two sides\u0026nbspfail to agree\u0026nbspa new trade deal by that time\u0026nbspthat is far-reaching enough to avoid Irish border checks. Under the backstop, the North would also follow EU regulatory rules set down by the single market for goods. This would be enough to avoid a hard Irish Border, but would still involve some regulatory checks on goods crossing the Irish Sea.But there are still problems?Yes, while the UK government signed off on the withdrawal agreement, Theresa May has faced fierce opposition to it in the House of Commons. Many Conservatives fear that once the backstop is triggered, there will be no way out of it for the UK. The DUP objects to the fact that regulatory checks would be needed on goods crossing from Britain to the North and that the North would have to follow some rules set down in Brussels.\u0026nbspIs there a way around this? It is difficult. The EU has\u0026nbspgiven the UK assurances that it will make every effort to negotiate a new trade deal to make the backstop unnecessary, or – if it is introduced – to ensure that it is in force for as short a time as possible. However, crucially, the EU insists that the withdrawal agreement itself must remain untouched. This says that the backstop remains in place “unless and until” another way is found to avoid a hard Irish Border.\u0026nbsp Many Conservative MPs and the DUP are not satisfied by non-binding assurances, fearing that the legal withdrawal agreement is the key document.\u0026nbspWhat if\u0026nbspthere is no agreement?If there is no backstop, there will be no orce deal and no transition period. In other words, there would be a disorderly Brexit and the UK would crash out of the EU in March 2019. It is anyone’s guess how goods passing over the Irish Border would be treated in such a scenario but the UK’s chaotic departure from the EU could create all sorts of difficulties for cross-border trade and beyond. It is also \u0026nbspopen to the UK to ask for an extension of the Article 50 process – its departure date. The other 27 EU members would all have to agree. So far Theresa May has said she will not do this. She has also set her face against a second referendum vote. Under a recent ECJ ruling, the UK could withdraw its Article 50 notification unilaterally. In other words if it decided to stay, it must be allowed to do so.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches. See more here.

Photograph: Liam McBurney for The .The hard border between Ireland and Northern Ireland during the Troubles only came about as a result of Republicans’ actions, DUP MP and Brexit spokesman Sammy Wilson has claimed. Mr Wilson said “the only hard border we ever had in Northern Ireland was a hard border which resulted from the actions of Republicans”. He made the comments after his party leader Arlene Foster claimed there had never been a hard border between the Republic and Northern Ireland. Speaking on RTÉ’s Morning Ireland, Mr Wilson said Republicans “were the ones who caused army checkpoints to be put in place, army patrols, watch towers.”Tens of thousands of British army troops failed to secure a hard border, he said, questioning “how on earth” the European Union would be able to do so in the event of a no-deal Brexit.Ms Foster had said there was no need for a backstop - the name given to the legal guarantee that in the event of Britain leaving the EU without a deal - and that there would be no return to a hard border in Ireland. The backstop has been a major point of contention, with hardline Brexiteers and the DUP opposing the clause.“As someone who lived through the Troubles, we never had a hard border,” Ms Foster said. “There were 20,000 soldiers in Northern Ireland and they couldn’t hermetically seal the border in Northern Ireland, so it is a bit of a nonsense frankly to talk about a hard border .”When challenged by a journalist that during the Troubles there was routine checks along border crossings, Ms Foster said: “I think you’ll accept it was for reasons of security and even then terrorists were able to come and go at their pleasure.”The DUP and a large number of Conservative MPs in the House of Commons voted against Theresa May’s proposed Brexit deal on Tuesday as it was beaten by 432 votes to 202. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said his party would table a motion of no-confidence in the Government, which will be debated on Wednesday afternoon before a vote is held at 7pm. However, DUP MPs, who are in a confidence and supply deal with the prime minister, and hardline Brexiteers who voted against the proposed deal are expected to support the government in the no-confidence vote. Commenting on the fallout of Tuesday night’s vote, Mr Wilson said he did not think Mrs May could command enough support in parliament to extend the UK’s departure date from the EU, currently set for March 29th. “A no deal Brexit will happen once we reach the 29th March, legally we will have left and if there’s no deal, then we have no deal. I don’t fear it,” Mr Wilson said. Meanwhile, Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney said the onus was on the British government to propose a viable alternative to the withdrawal agreement.He told the same programme that the Government would not block any request from the UK for more time to come up with a Brexit deal, but there needs to be a plan for a “managed, controlled Brexit”.“There’s still a lot to happen in Westminster before it becomes clear what the UK is looking for,” he said. “We need to hold our nerve.”Mr Coveney added: “I don’t think the EU is any mood to agree changes to the withdrawal treaty. We will have to see what the UK is looking for. We don’t know what the British parliament will support. We need to focus on EU unity.”He said he had contradicted Minister for Transport Shane Ross at a briefing in Government Buildings on Tuesday when his colleague said there would be Border checks in the event of a no-deal Brexit.“If Britain leaves without a deal, well, then we obviously have to have difficult discussions with the European Commission and with the UK in terms of how we protect the EU single market,” Mr Coveney said after intervening while Mr Ross answered a question on the issue. Speaking on Wednesday, he said: “The backstop will mean minimal checks, limited checks at sea. I just reminded Shane that is the position which we support.”Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches. See more here.

The vote has cast doubt on how the UK might leave the EU and on the timing of its exit.The vote throws up a range of possible scenarios, adding to the uncertainty around the entire Brexit process and deepening the worst British political crisis in generations.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

Video: European Commission \t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tTaoiseach Leo Varadkar speaks to the media outside the Government Buildings in Dublin. Photograph: Dara Mac Donaill The Government cannot shift on the issue of avoiding a hard border on the island of Ireland after Brexit, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar has said.Mr Varadkar, speaking at Government Buildings in response the rejection by the House of Commons of the Brexit withdrawal agreement, said the Irish government and British government had made a promise to avoid a hard border.“We can’t shift on the issue of there being no hard border between Ireland and Northern Ireland,” Mr Varadkar said. “That is the outcome that we need. We have said it from day one that Brexit cannot result in a hard border between Ireland and Northern Ireland. We have made that commitment to the people of Ireland, north and south. And the United Kingdom and the United Kingdom Government has made that commitment to the people of Ireland north and south, so it needs to be honoured.”The Taoiseach repeated that the UK must now decide what type of post Brexit relationship it wants with the EU.“What is required here is for Britain to essentially decide what kind of Brexit it wants.”He also rejected the idea of a time limit on the backstop, the insurance policy to avoid a hard border.“A guarantee with a time limited is not a guarantee. What we are trying to achieve here is a guarantee that there be no hard border between Ireland and Northern Ireland.“There were two votes last night. One of the votes was on accepting the withdrawal agreement with a time limited or deleted backstop and only 25 MPs voted for that.”Meanwhile, the European Union’s chief Brexit negotiator has told the United Kingdom that it could have a different kind of departure deal if London is willing to change its key demands.Mr Barnier warned that the risk of a disorderly withdrawal was now greater than ever as a result of the vote and that the EU would step up its preparations amid concern a no-deal outcome could disrupt the whole of Europe.He indicated that one way forward would be for Britain to accept even closer alignment with EU regulations to secure a very close trading relationship in future. EU officials say London could, for example, abandon its determination to leave the EU customs union and the centrally regulated single market.Referring to statements by the European Parliament and all the other member states, Mr Barnier said: “If the United Kingdom chooses to let its red lines change in future, and that it takes this choice for its advantage of the ambition of going beyond a simple but not negligible free trade accord, then the European Union would be ready immediately to ... respond favourably.”That suggestion for a “deeper relationship” was echoed by the EU parliament’s Brexit coordinator, Guy Verhofstadt.Mr Barnier and others lined up to highlight how the vote in London exposed only isions, without shedding light on what Britain’s could actually rally behind as a consensual position, just 10 weeks before it is set to leave the bloc, potentially into a legal limbo for citizens and businesses.“Please, please, please tell us finally what you want to achieve,” pleaded Manfred Weber, the centre-right leader in the parliament and an ally of German chancellor Angela Merkel.But, he added, there was “no room for manoeuvre” in terms of renegotiating the current agreement, which Brexit campaigners say leaves Britain too tied to EU rules, especially due to a “backstop” insurance clause intended to avoid throwing up a hard customs border across Ireland.Mr Barnier insisted there could be no weakening on that issue.“Right now it’s too early to assess all the consequences of this vote,” he told a Strasbourg chamber that was sparsely attended for the early morning debate, perhaps reflecting a growing weariness in Europe with Britain’s troubles.“We have respected and we continue to respect the democratic parliamentary debate in the UK and I will not speculate on the different scenarios. What yesterday’s vote showed is that the political conditions for the ratification of the withdrawal agreement are not yet there in London.”Some EU politicians have called for Britain to put the question of remaining in the EU to a second referendum. The chair of EU summits, Donald Tusk, suggested on Tuesday that ision in Britain could lead to Brexit being cancelled.Frans Timmermans, the deputy head of the European Commission, citing a phrase often attributed to British fantasy novelist C.S. Lewis, suggested Britain should put its past tribulations behind it and seek a fresh start with the EU:“You can’t go back and change the beginning,” the former Dutch foreign minister said, “But you can start where you are and change the ending.”But Nigel Farage, the former leader of the UK Independence Party which drove the campaign for the 2016 vote to leave, told fellow members of the European Parliament that any second ballot would deliver an even greater majority for quitting because Britons had been angered by the EU’s stance in negotiations.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

A sign nearby reads “Keeping Britain Trading”.Barron is concerned about the impact a no-deal Brexit would have on Britain’s ability to do just that at the busy port, a hub for freight traffic from Zeebrugge and Rotterdam. But he’s not concerned enough to change his mind. He says he voted to leave after a terrorist attack made him question immigration.“It made me think, hang on, I don’t want all these North Africans coming in through Europe, and I still don’t.” Which attack? Manchester, he says immediately. In reality, the attack at the Ariana Grande concert happened a year after the Brexit vote. There’s been “too much scaremongering”, he adds, but he’s talking about trade, not terrorism. “At the end of the day, people still want to buy products from the UK and products from Europe, so there’s still going to be that interaction.”Brexit is more complex than he realised, and he has sympathy for Theresa May, but doesn’t know what people expected with a Remainer in charge of the negotiations. Whatever happens now, he still wants out. “I haven’t swung to the other side.”Steve Petherbridge, who is here to have his truck washed, hasn’t changed his mind either. Like most people I speak to, he is impatient with the protracted negotiations. “They’re saying now we’ll stop in. We can’t stop in. We voted out, and deal or no deal, we’ll stop out.”Nearby, two Hungarian truck drivers are having lunch in the front of a cab. They are wary about talking, and don’t want to give names. “Brexit was a joke,” one says.Will a no-deal Brexit make their lives more difficult? “Actually nobody knows.” At the moment, one of the men says, there are not enough people manning the UK customs posts, and he doesn’t know where they’re going to recruit additional workers from. But he drives an ambient food truck, and long delays at the ports would be disastrous.In 2016, slightly more than two in three of this city’s 260,000 residents voted to leave the EU. More recent opinion polls seemed to suggest a shift in public mood. According to polls by the pro-referendum group Best for Britain last year, the constituency of Hull North is now 60 per cent Remain, a swing from 52 per cent Leave Hull West and Hessle, which was 67 per cent Leave, is now 54 per cent Leave. But if the people of Hull and the surrounding towns are suffering Leavers’ remorse, they’re not admitting to it.Kingston-upon-Hull, you quickly learn, is a place that defies easy categorisation. It has the dubious title of being the second most-bombed town in England during the second World War, when 90 per cent of its buildings were destroyed, and it still bears the scars. Here and there, examples of the remaining 10 per cent stand, relics of Victorian quaintness that are incongruous among the block modern shopping centres and offices. It is a once-thriving fishing port, which still hasn’t recovered its mojo after the industry declined in the 1970s – something for which many hold the EU responsible. It is also, however, the proud winner of the title of the UK’s capital of culture for 2017.The attitudes to Brexit are as hard to pin down as everything else about Hull.Anne Gorman from Galway, who has lived just outside Hull for 16 years in total and works in the National Health Service, loves the city for its warmth, sense of community and resilience. She voted Remain, and believes the referendum result here was a pushback by a community that felt left behind. “There is an objection to the large number of non-nationals that have come into the city over the last five years or so, but the main reason is the old guard feel neglected,” she says.Amid all the anti-immigrant sentiment from Brexiters, nobody answered the question of who will do the unskilled jobs that the English workforce don’t want to do. “There isn’t exactly a long queue of kids coming out of secondary school who want to go pulling the vegetables out of the field in Lincolnshire.”Outside the job centre, not everyone has heard of Brexit. “Brexit? Something to do with Europe, was it?” one young woman with a stroller says.Gary Ferrerby pulls up on his motorbike emblazoned with L plates. He reels off the reasons he voted Leave: because of immigration because he doesn’t trust politicians because “this country has gone downhill since we went in the EU” and because “it’s costing 20 odd million a day to stay in the EU”.Another man wearing a Hull City football club hat draws a link between Brexit and “the IRA bombing McDonalds and places because they wanted independence, and now they’re getting independence, they say they don’t want it”.Confusion about Ireland’s relationship with Britain and how it might be impacted by Brexit is widespread. Down at the port, Petherbridge reassures me that I shouldn’t worry, “nowt will change in Ireland. The British soldiers will still be there.”Later, in a taxi between Hull and the prosperous town of Beverley, about eight miles away, the driver, Nigel, voted in favour of leaving, and feels let down by politicians and the media. He admits he doesn’t really get the fuss about a hard border. “We’re all coming out, what difference does it make?” He is astonished to hear Ireland is not leaving the EU. “Why are southern Ireland stopping in the EU? Why are they not going with England?”Some of the confusion may be attributable to the fact that Hull has an Irish community that is tiny, and typically quite transient. A small cohort commute here to work weekly, flying in on red-eye flights on noisy turbo-prop planes via Leeds, and home again on Thursday or Friday.One of the fly-in, fly-out workforce is Dr John Byrne, who is in healthcare. Byrne says people in this part of the UK, “other than political anoraks”, are not energised about, or even aware of, the backstop issue. UK politicians, he says, have been guilty of not understanding what their constituents were thinking. The referendum vote was “a kicking”.But he thinks the chance of a no-deal Brexit is receding, particularly as people get immersed in contingency planning and the implications become all too real. “Apart from hardline Brexiters, nobody really wants a no-deal Brexit.”Peter Bartlett, a mechanical engineer from Leixlip who commutes to Hull to work on a construction project, is not convinced Brexit is going to happen at all. He’s so unconvinced, in fact, that he hasn’t bothered to apply for an Irish passport. He was born in England and still uses an English one. “They’ll get to the crux, and then they’ll back down. My prediction is that they’ll stay in the EU.”Eight miles north, in Beverley – a place of more obvious charms than its larger neighbour, including redbrick streetscapes and picturesque tea rooms – few people share Bartlett’s conviction. “We voted out to stay out,” says Simon Foster, out shopping with his girlfriend, Gloria Ashun. Neither of them actually voted, he clarifies. But if there was a second referendum, they would vote to leave. They want “out, even if there’s no deal”.They don’t talk about it with their friends, all in their 20s, anymore. “It’s been two years, or three years nearly. We’re sick of it,” says Ashun.Further along the street, Pip Seminara is returning home from having her hair cut. With an Italian last name, and three children who have plans to travel, her position is complicated.When Brexit happened, she had just bought a house and was worried about house prices, “so I very selfishly voted Remain. But when the Leave vote came in, I was pleased. I didn’t realise much how on the edge I was. I wanted to leave because I thought it was a really good opportunity . . . to make England great for Britain’s sake.”Her preference for Leave wasn’t about immigration. “We’re not trying to pull our drawbridge up, we just want to manage our own affairs, thank you.”Britain pays more than the other countries, she says. “No wonder they’re so pissed off we’re leaving – they’re going to lose our money.”She believes that if Britain goes, it will pave the way for other EU countries, like France, to leave. She is not convinced Britain will leave, but even if it stays, she thinks the EU will take “a hard look at itself . . . It’s an opportunity to kick them up the butt and say what kind of EU do we want.”But the Irish Border issue “is a huge risk. I’d never like to see a hard border in Ireland: the logistics of it, the money we’d have to put into it. It’s too sensitive.”Another man stops to share his view on why Britain must leave, with or without a deal. If Europe had been left as a common market, it would have been fine. “But the idiots over in Brussels tried to dictate our laws.”The woman with him doesn’t want to stop. “You’ve said too much. You’ve got verbal diarrhoea,” she says. Exasperated, as he keeps talking, she turns to me. “Why, if you’re from Ireland, are you here?”He has a last word before he allows her to pull him away. “I won’t trust the EU as far as I can throw them.”Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

Photograph: by HOPRUAFPGetty Images.Theresa May’s pledge of cross-party co-operation on Brexit was criticised on Wednesday after it was claimed that she was not including Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn in the process.Some of her senior ministers insisted Mrs May was committed to reaching out across party lines to build a Brexit consensus following the crushing defeat of her plan for leaving the EU.While she is expected to survive the latest threat to her position, Labour warned she was in danger of scuppering efforts to find a new way forward before they had even started.Rebel Tory MPs, who helped deliver the massive 230 majority against the Brexit agreement, made clear that they would back the government in the vote on the no-confidence motion, as did Mrs May’s allies in the DUP.However, MPs from both the Leave and Remain wings of the party warned that she would have to accept major changes to her Brexit plan if it was to stand any chance of winning the backing of parliament.Mrs May on Tuesday night said she wanted to hold talks with senior parliamentarians to try to find an agreed way forward ahead of a fresh statement to the House on Monday.However, shadow chancellor John McDonnell complained that she had not invited Mr Corbyn or any of the other party leaders for talks.After Downing Street said she remained committed to securing an “independent trade policy” — effectively ruling out a customs union which Labour supports — he warned the discussions may not even get off the ground.“She is now laying conditions down about those discussions which look as though they will prevent any discussion of a permanent customs union,” Mr McDonnell told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme. “That is what most of the other opposition parties support so she seems to be negating the discussions before they have even started.”The leader of the Commons Andrea Leadsom said Mrs May was committed to meeting with MPs who were committed to “constructively” delivering on the EU referendum vote.However, she said Mr Corbyn had failed to produce any positive proposals and was simply seeking to “disrupt” the government by trying to force a general election at a crucial time for the country .“I don’t think she has written him off at all but he needs to come to the table and tell us what he wants to do,” she told the Today programme.“He has not put forward any specific constructive proposal and that is a problem, which is why the prime minister will be engaging right across the House with those who do have very sincerely held views but want to constructively deliver on what the vast majority of parliamentarians voted for.”Mrs Leadsom indicated that Mrs May was still hoping to build support for a Brexit plan which preserved key elements of the existing deal.“What we need to do is to find a way that that deal or some part of it or an alternative that is negotiable (with the EU) can be put to the European Union so that we can get this Brexit through by March 29,” she said.Steve Baker, one of the leaders of the pro-Brexit Tory European Research Group, said Mrs May must now abandon the controversial Northern Ireland “backstop” intended to prevent the return of a hard border with the republic.“We are not going to be able to agree to the backstop. It is obvious when you look at the vote last night. There is no getting away from it. That was an absolutely devastating blow,” he said. - PADeal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches. See more here.

It came as Topshop was forced to cancel a launch party for its latest collection after designer Michael Halpern pulled out.Ms Miller declined to comment on Mr Bercow\u0027s refusal but, writing for The Daily , highlighted the Commons\u0027 own use of NDAs, on which it spent £2.4million between 2013 and 2017. Perhaps Parliament would be better placed to challenge this abuse of the law if it weren\u0027t also caught up in the use of NDAs, she argued.There have been more than 50 severance agreements, most including confidentially clauses, relating to House of Commons staff alone over the past five years. Last week, Ms Miller called on Mr Bercow to resign over a report into bullying in the Commons, something he himself has been accused of. Andrew Bridgen, one of Mr Bercow\u0027s most vocal critics, said: He should recuse himself from any further participation in the House\u0027s response to the culture change required. In fact, the best thing he can do is stand down as Speaker.A spokesman for Mr Bercow, who has denied bullying or any knowledge of pay-offs to alleged victims, said it might be thought premature to grant an urgent question on NDAs given the Government\u0027s response to Ms Miller\u0027s committee\u0027s report on misconduct in the workplace was expected shortly.Ms Jones said her committee would love an NDAs debate but could not sanction it unless a petition was lodged on Parliament\u0027s website. The impact of the scandal on Sir Philip\u0027s retail empire began to emerge last night after Mr Halpern withdrew from a launch party for his line. He is understood to have felt unable to attend after Sir Philip was named as the businessman behind an injunction preventing The  publishing allegations against him of sexual harassment and racial discrimination. A fashion insider said: His brand is about female empowerment. That\u0027s his ethos. He couldn\u0027t go ahead with this, it wouldn\u0027t be a good look. It would be awkward.

These can result in companies being fined up to $525,000 (£291,000) and the poster being fined up to $105,000 (£58,273).Asked about whether the government was considering the Australian model, Baroness Williams said: “One of the things that we always do is look to see what other countries are doing and certainly we are looking into it in the white paper.“Nothing is off the table in terms of what we are looking at in terms of the white paper.”Her comments come as the minister also said social media companies needed to do more to stop people with facial disfigurement and visible conditions being abused online.The charity Changing Faces, which campaigns for people visible differences, said many had experienced abuse online with some having their picture taken in public so they can be mocked on social media.Baroness Williams, who is working with the charity on the issue, said: “I think the responses (from social media companies) are sporadic. Just because something doesn’t meet a legal threshold there are still the terms of user conditions that they have.“Also I think for the social media companies there is a reputational risk here. Social media was actually developed for very positive reasons and we don’t want it to become a platform which certain people can’t go near because of some of the bile that is spat out with a cloak of anonymity.”Becky Hewitt, the CEO of Changing Faces, said social media could be a positive place for people with visible conditions, but that abuse was putting them off.That charity has found that a third do not use their photo on their profile and that some people had had their online photos taken and turned into hurtful memes.She added: “One of the things that people often talk to us about is people taking their photos and without their permission when they are out and about.“So one of our champions talks about a time that she was in the car with her brother and her mum and someone stuck a phone in to get a photo of her and then that can be used on social media as a form of bullying. It is those kind of things that are quite common.”There have been some positive steps taken by social media companies to combat the abuse, such as by Twitter, which has now given Changing Faces special status to report incidents.However Ms Hewitt said many people facing abuse still felt a sense of “resignation” when it came to social media companies taking action.The charity is calling for the government to officially recognise abuse against people with visible conditions in the white paper.Natalie Ambersley, a 36-year-old PA from London who has the skin condition vitiligo, told the : “People don’t realise how damaging and upsetting it can be for that person, so social media platforms should make it a priority.“It can have a really negative impact on how people see themselves.”Department for Culture, Media \u0026amp SportPlease review our commenting policy\u0026#39What now, Britain?\u0026#39: How Europe reacted to UK \u0026#39chaos\u0026#39 after Theresa May\u0026#39s Brexit deal defeatBrexit latest news: Article 50 \u0026#39will not be extended\u0026#39 as Theresa May set to win no confidence voteAlternative for Germany politician ordered to pay compensation to Boris Becker\u0026#39s son\u0026#39She will lose by a large margin and should then resign immediately\u0026#39 - readers predict meaningful vote result Rape and sexual violence face tougher age-ratings in crackdown by film censorWhat happens next after the Brexit vote?

When sideways pressure is applied these tiny needles detach from the plastic backing, remaining under the surface of the skin. Made from biodegradable materials naturally found in human bodies, the needles slowly disintegrate while releasing a hormone, levonorgestrel, which has been used in contraception for decades. “The microneedles feel as if you’ve taken velcro and press it against your skin,” said Mark Prausnitz, professor at Georgia Institute of Technology and the corresponding author on the research paper. “Most people don’t find it painful – it doesn’t come with a strong or sharp sensation like an injection would.” Population: Prevalence of any method of contraceptionThe experimental technology was originally developed to provide an injection free way of administering vaccines, with rapidly dissolving needles that release the drug and disappear within minutes. The micro-needles were found to be just as effective as traditional injected vaccines in clinical trials, but were preferred by the vast majority of people involved. Trials to use the technology for diabetes treatment have also been positive. Now research published in Nature Biomedical Engineering journal suggests micro-needle patches can also be used to slowly release contraceptives. In rats, a high level of the contraceptive hormone was sustained for over a month. “There’s a real need around the world to improve access to contraception,” said Prof Prausnitz. “Long acting contraception is appealing as compliance is easier  for instance, you don’t have to remember to take a pill.But self-administered contraception could be of great use where women don’t have any access to healthcare, he added.  A larger contraceptive patch has been developed to use in humans, but not yet tested. As the patch remains in the early stages of development scientists are not yet sure of the cost, though Prof Prausnitz said that he thought it would be similar to existing birth control options.He added that he hoped the team would develop microneedles that last for six months, not one, which would further reduce the cost. But while the team are excited about the potential of the patches, it is likely to be at least five years before they are available for women to use. Newsletter promotion - global health security - end of article Protect yourself and your family by learning more about Global Health Security Brexit latest news: Article 50 \u0026#39will not be extended\u0026#39 as Theresa May set to win no confidence voteAlternative for Germany politician ordered to pay compensation to Boris Becker\u0026#39s son\u0026#39She will lose by a large margin and should then resign immediately\u0026#39 - readers predict meaningful vote result Rape and sexual violence face tougher age-ratings in crackdown by film censorWhat happens next after the Brexit vote?

A member of the MP’s staff admitted writing the tweet and claimed he had posted it without the politician’s knowledge, but the court held Mr Maier responsible as the owner of the Twitter account.The MP had previously attempted to defend the comments. “I see nothing offensive about the term ‘negro’,” he told Germany’s Spiegel magazine last year.Jens Maier of the AfD was ordered to pay €15,000 compensation for the offending tweetHis comments were condemned across the German political spectrum. He was officially reprimanded by the AfD but the party stopped short of expelling him.Noah Becker, whose mother is the German-American actress and designer Barbara Becker, works as a DJ, musician and artist.He initially offered to end the dispute if Mr Maier donated €7,500 (£6,600) to charity. After the MP failed to respond to the offer Mr Becker sued him for defamation.Lawyers for Mr Maier argued in court that the Tweet had not damaged Mr Becker’s reputation, but that he had used it to raise his profile and obtain bookings as a DJ.Christian-Oliver Moser, appearing for Mr Becker, argued that the MP had used language reminiscent of Nazi race theory.Describing the term “half-negro” as “completely foreign to the German language”, Mr Moser told the court: “The defendant\u0027s own verbal creation evokes memories of the so-called racial doctrine of the National Socialists”.“I am pleased the defendant was unsuccessful with the argument that he did not write the himself,” Mr Moser told Spiegel after the verdict.The verdict is not yet final and Mr Maier can appeal.Alternative for Germany (AfD)Please review our commenting policyBrexit latest news: Article 50 \u0026#39will not be extended\u0026#39 as Theresa May set to win no confidence vote\u0026#39She will lose by a large margin and should then resign immediately\u0026#39 - readers predict meaningful vote result Rape and sexual violence face tougher age-ratings in crackdown by film censorWhat happens next after the Brexit vote?

At last, the endless miles of too-soft carpet, like ploughing through snow but with an extra helping of static, have been rolled up again.As shows go, this was a good one, with plenty of innovation, some stunning products and, of course, the nuttiest gadgets on the planet.The just-revealed products will arrive in stores over the coming months. Here are some of the best devices to look forward to.For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialThis gadget manages to be both mainstream and quirky. It’s a wireless speaker (Bluetooth and Wi-Fi) with a delicate, beguiling tone that is highly attractive.But it looks like something Florence Nightingale might carry because it has a glass cylinder growing out of it, with a light at its base.In fact, the glass vibrates and its resonance is what creates the sonorous sound.The light can even be set to flicker like a candle. It is perfect for romantic candlelit dinners, though it’s not cheap: £550.This was far from the only TV launched at CES but many of them seemed highly gimmicky: The LG rollable TV is plenty impressive and the Samsung 219-inch microLED screen called, appropriately enough, The Wall, looked just amazing.But for a TV you can actually buy without breaking the bank, the GZ2000 was revelatory. The image quality on Panasonic is routinely outstanding, and there were certainly improvements over previous models.But this is a Dolby Atmos TV, and the first with upward-firing speakers hidden behind the screen.In action, these transformed the experience, creating a deeply immersive sound, especially when watching sport. The roar of the crowd was no longer just coming from in front of you.Withings makes spectacularly good health products and its smartwatches appeal because they have analogue hands like, you know, a real watch.This latest model, out in the Spring, will include an ECG monitor, something only the Apple Watch Series 4 has, and only in the US for now. This will be rather cheaper, at £130.An ECG reading occurs when you press on the watch glass (there’s another sensor pressing against your wrist on the watch’s back that completes the circuit).The Withings watch has a secondary dial which shows how close you are to your steps target, too. Oh, and unlike the Apple Watch, this will be compatible with Android phones, too.This was one of the coolest surprises at the show and comes from Sphero, makers of spherical robots and a brilliant Star Wars R2-D2 toy.But the company’s toys have always had a considerable educational angle to them, encouraging youngsters to learn how to code, for instance.Now, with Specdrums, there’s a musical angle, too. Two silicone rings fit to your fingers and when you touch a colour, then notes, loops or beats will sound.The colours can be on the coloured pad that comes with the rings or things in the world around you. Very smart.Back in the seventies, Technics released a turntable designed for DJs. It was incredibly popular and highly praised because it was well-built, very reliable and easy to use.There have been updates since then but this is the first for almost a decade.The new model, in a cool matte-black finish, includes features such as the capability to spin the disc in the opposite direction and neat features such as a long-life white LED positioned to make it easier to see the stylus tip when you’re trying to place it in dim, or no, light. It goes on sale in around May for £900.CES 2019: Chinese firms and US government among conference no showsA smartphone with a flexible screen that folds out to become a tablet, this was a hot gadget in Vegas.But it will need to move quickly to work – Samsung has said its own folder will be out in the coming months.There are certain issues with folding phones, such as the aspect ratio. A regular display looks almost square when unfolded or, for it to look like a regular tablet, it requires a wider-than-usual display when in phone mode. But it’s a sign of the future.This comes from the company that made the Nuraphone, a pair of headphones that go over the ear and also have a bit that juts into your lugholes to deliver strong sound.The NuraLoop is an in-ear headphone which, like the Nuraphone, measures your hearing and uses signal processing to adjust the output to suit your ears, personally.There’s noise-cancelling on board and a social mode that lets the sound of the outside world out as much or as little as you’d like.A pet feeder is straightforward enough, but what if it had facial recognition? So Fido doesn’t eat Tibbles’ food, for instance.This is also useful if you have two dogs, say, with different dietary needs.Or, if you leave the Mookkie in the garden, you can be sure that a stray cat won’t sneak in and eat it.There are two food bowls with separately opening lids. It’s on sale in the autumn for around £160.\u0026nbspBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Studies have linked ractopamine with adverse effects in pigs, especially hyperactivity, trembling, and broken limbs.WTO rules could cut Denmark’s total imports to the UK by 17 per cent, the OECD found, resulting in a 1.3 per cent fall in GDP in the medium term. The UK is Denmark’s fourth largest market, accounting for 7.8 per cent of exports in 2017.Britain’s parliament is widely expected to vote against\u0026nbspTheresa May’s Brexit deal on Tuesday, opening up outcomes ranging from a disorderly orce to a reversal of Brexit.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Therefore, specific transitional solutions are essential to at least somewhat ease the most detrimental impacts.In particular, this is about supplies of medicines in the UK.”Uncertainty around regulation after Brexit was the primary reason that UK-Germany trade in medicines and chemicals dropped in recent months, VCI said.\u0026nbspThe drop-off in trade has occurred in both directions. German pharmaceutical companies may have imported fewer UK drugs and instead signed contracts with other suppliers in Europe to replace British products in preparation for Brexit, according to VCI.We have seen the brutal reality of Brexit – time to revoke and reflectMark Carney warns of further market volatility due to no-deal fearsWhy prolonging Brexit plays into the hands of EuroscepticsCBI\u0027s chairman hails new Brexit era. But is it? The cost of customs alone is estimated to be €200m per year and VCI expects even greater burdens in the event that UK and EU rules begin to erge.A no-deal Brexit would also have significant consequences for the UK’s chemicals industry, according to the trade body.“In the event of a disorderly Brexit, chemical substances that were registered in the UK for distribution in the EU could be no longer simply sold in the European Union – with significant consequences for the supply chains,” Mr Tillmann said.\u0026nbspHe called on the EU Commission to prevent this by temporarily recognising registrations by companies headquartered in the UK.The warning is the latest to underline the far-reaching consequences of a disorderly Brexit beyond Britain’s borders.On Tuesday, research from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) predicted that Danish food imports including bacon and butter could drop by almost a quarter if the UK crashes out of the EU.\u0026nbspThat would cut Danish GDP by as much as 1.3 per cent, the OECD said.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Stephen Jones, chief executive of UK Finance, said: “Time is running out to avoid a chaotic ‘no deal’ Brexit that would be catastrophic for the UK economy.“Firms in the finance industry have put contingency plans in place to minimise disruption for their customers in a ‘no deal’ scenario but critical cliff-edge risks remain, including on the transfer of personal data and the operation of cross-border contracts.”For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialHe added: “It is now essential that politicians on all sides of the House work together to agree a way forward and provide much-needed certainty to the electorate and businesses, by ensuring our withdrawal from the EU is orderly and gradual. There must also be a sufficient transition period to enable our future relationship with the EU to be agreed and then implemented.”The Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders also warned of the “catastrophic” consequences of a potential no-deal Brexit. “The vote against the Brexit deal on the table brings us closer to the ‘no deal’ cliff edge that would be catastrophic for the automotive industry,” said Mike Hawes, SMMT chief executive. “All sides in parliament must work together to find a way forward and put the necessary mechanisms in place to prevent this happening and explore alternatives that protect our future.Brexit defeat makes history as biggest ever government loss in CommonsMay on the brink after huge Brexit defeat and Corbyn election planPound sterling plummets as Commons overwhelmingly rejects Theresa May\u0027EU president suggests UK remaining is only option“Leaving the EU, our biggest and most important trading partner, without a deal and without a transition period to cushion the blow would put this sector and jobs at immediate risk. ‘No deal’ must be avoided at all costs. Business needs certainty so we now need politicians to do everything to prevent irreversible damage to this vital sector.”Meanwhile, Adam Marshall, director general of the British Chambers of Commerce said there were “no more words to describe the frustration, impatience, and growing anger amongst business after two and a half years on a high-stakes political rollercoaster ride that shows no sign of stopping”.Mr Marshall said many basic questions about operational issues remain unanswered, with the result that businesses cannot plan properly for the years ahead. “Every second that ticks by sees more businesses spending money on unwanted changes, activating contingency plans or battening down the hatches and halting investment, as they try to anticipate a future that is no clearer now than it was at the time of the referendum result,” he said.“Businesses will take a dim view of more shuttle diplomacy and last-minute bargaining, which have so far done nothing to end the political impasse. The government must now urgently set out in concrete terms what it will do to avoid the damage that a messy and disorderly exit on 29 March would cause to businesses, communities, and the UK economy.”The pound plunged against the dollar and the euro in the immediate aftermath of the vote on Tuesday night, then rallied, and on Wednesday morning was trading at $1.2865 and €1.1278. “Traders are seemingly taking the outcome as paving the way for an extension of the Article 50 deadline, rather than increasing the chances of a no-deal Brexit and this has caused the recovery seen in the pound,” said David Cheetham of XTB.However, Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown said there was still very little certainty about the next steps for Brexit and added that the vote of no confidence, which will be tabled by Jeremy Corbyn on Wednesday, would be “another pinch point for currency markets, provides another pinch point for currency markets, so we can expect further swings in sterling as events develop”.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Therefore, specific transitional solutions are essential to at least somewhat ease the most detrimental impacts.In particular, this is about supplies of medicines in the UK.”Uncertainty around regulation after Brexit was the primary reason that UK-Germany trade in medicines and chemicals dropped in recent months, VCI said.\u0026nbspThe drop-off in trade has occurred in both directions. German pharmaceutical companies may have imported fewer UK drugs and instead signed contracts with other suppliers in Europe to replace British products in preparation for Brexit, according to VCI.We have seen the brutal reality of Brexit – time to revoke and reflectMark Carney warns of further market volatility due to no-deal fearsWhy prolonging Brexit plays into the hands of EuroscepticsCBI\u0027s chairman hails new Brexit era. But is it? The cost of customs alone is estimated to be €200m per year and VCI expects even greater burdens in the event that UK and EU rules begin to erge.A no-deal Brexit would also have significant consequences for the UK’s chemicals industry, according to the trade body.“In the event of a disorderly Brexit, chemical substances that were registered in the UK for distribution in the EU could be no longer simply sold in the European Union – with significant consequences for the supply chains,” Mr Tillmann said.\u0026nbspHe called on the EU Commission to prevent this by temporarily recognising registrations by companies headquartered in the UK.The warning is the latest to underline the far-reaching consequences of a disorderly Brexit beyond Britain’s borders.On Tuesday, research from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) predicted that Danish food imports including bacon and butter could drop by almost a quarter if the UK crashes out of the EU.\u0026nbspThat would cut Danish GDP by as much as 1.3 per cent, the OECD said.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Stephen Jones, chief executive of UK Finance, said: “Time is running out to avoid a chaotic ‘no deal’ Brexit that would be catastrophic for the UK economy.“Firms in the finance industry have put contingency plans in place to minimise disruption for their customers in a ‘no deal’ scenario but critical cliff-edge risks remain, including on the transfer of personal data and the operation of cross-border contracts.”For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialHe added: “It is now essential that politicians on all sides of the House work together to agree a way forward and provide much-needed certainty to the electorate and businesses, by ensuring our withdrawal from the EU is orderly and gradual. There must also be a sufficient transition period to enable our future relationship with the EU to be agreed and then implemented.”The Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders also warned of the “catastrophic” consequences of a potential no-deal Brexit. “The vote against the Brexit deal on the table brings us closer to the ‘no deal’ cliff edge that would be catastrophic for the automotive industry,” said Mike Hawes, SMMT chief executive. “All sides in parliament must work together to find a way forward and put the necessary mechanisms in place to prevent this happening and explore alternatives that protect our future.Brexit defeat makes history as biggest ever government loss in CommonsMay on the brink after huge Brexit defeat and Corbyn election planPound sterling plummets as Commons overwhelmingly rejects Theresa May\u0027EU president suggests UK remaining is only option“Leaving the EU, our biggest and most important trading partner, without a deal and without a transition period to cushion the blow would put this sector and jobs at immediate risk. ‘No deal’ must be avoided at all costs. Business needs certainty so we now need politicians to do everything to prevent irreversible damage to this vital sector.”Meanwhile, Adam Marshall, director general of the British Chambers of Commerce said there were “no more words to describe the frustration, impatience, and growing anger amongst business after two and a half years on a high-stakes political rollercoaster ride that shows no sign of stopping”.Mr Marshall said many basic questions about operational issues remain unanswered, with the result that businesses cannot plan properly for the years ahead. “Every second that ticks by sees more businesses spending money on unwanted changes, activating contingency plans or battening down the hatches and halting investment, as they try to anticipate a future that is no clearer now than it was at the time of the referendum result,” he said.“Businesses will take a dim view of more shuttle diplomacy and last-minute bargaining, which have so far done nothing to end the political impasse. The government must now urgently set out in concrete terms what it will do to avoid the damage that a messy and disorderly exit on 29 March would cause to businesses, communities, and the UK economy.”The pound plunged against the dollar and the euro in the immediate aftermath of the vote on Tuesday night, then rallied, and on Wednesday morning was trading at $1.2865 and €1.1278. “Traders are seemingly taking the outcome as paving the way for an extension of the Article 50 deadline, rather than increasing the chances of a no-deal Brexit and this has caused the recovery seen in the pound,” said David Cheetham of XTB.However, Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown said there was still very little certainty about the next steps for Brexit and added that the vote of no confidence, which will be tabled by Jeremy Corbyn on Wednesday, would be “another pinch point for currency markets, provides another pinch point for currency markets, so we can expect further swings in sterling as events develop”.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It raises the chances of a \u0027no Brexit\u0027 or, at the least, an extension of Article 50, said Seema Shah of Principal Global Investors.Admittedly, the chances of a no-deal Brexit may mathematically have also risen, but the market remains ever-hopeful that the government will not commit an error of such epic proportions.But others suggested that the volatility was inevitable given the huge political uncertainty and the increased risk that the Government could fall.“A confidence vote loss is not a sterling positive international investors will see it as a negative for the pound given the uncertainty over the Labour party’s Brexit position and what a Corbyn government would mean for the UK economy,” said Jeremy Thomson-Cook, Chief Economist at WorldFirst.\u0026nbsp“Sterling is living on borrowed time and could benefit from the government ruling out no-deal.”Carolyn Fairbairn, the CBI director general, said that Ms May now needed a “new plan”.“Every business will feel no deal is hurtling closer.

All MPs need to reflect on the need for compromise and to act at speed to protect the UK’s economy.”That message was echoed by Huw Evans, of the Association of British Insurers.“We need a way forward urgently that avoids no-deal,” he said.“This is uncharted territory and we face a period of unprecedented uncertainty.”“It is critical that the Government, Parliament and the EU work together to avoid an outcome that would be bad for our economies and bad for our customers.”“As things stand, UK law says we will leave on 29th March, with or without a withdrawal agreement, and yet MPs are behaving as though they have all the time in the world – how are businesses meant to prepare in this fog of confusion?” said Stephen Martin of the Institute of Directors.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Air fares also helped push down the rate, with seasonal prices rising less than they did last year,” said Mike Hardie of the Office for National Statistics (ONS).For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialTransport fuel prices were up 3.4 per cent year-on-year in December, well down from the 12 per cent growth rate in the middle of last year.No-deal Brexit will mean lost jobs and lower wages says BoE governorThe global oil price currently stands at $60.7 a barrel, down from $86 in October.The average price for a litre of unleaded petrol in the UK currently stands at 120p, down from a recent peak of 131p last autumn.However, the ONS also reported on Wednesday that core inflation, which strips out volatile energy and food prices, rose to 1.9 per cent in December, up from 1.8 per cent in November.The Bank of England signalled last year that it sees underlying inflationary pressure in the UK economy, despite the uncertainty over Brexit, which is likely to prompt it to increase the cost of borrowing over the next two years.But analysts said the latest prices data suggested there was no need for rapid action.“We would not rule out two interest rate hikes in 2019 but we believe one is more likely as significant uncertainties persist – with expected lower inflation easing pressure for more aggressive Bank of England action,” said Howard Archer of the EY Item Club.Inflation spiked to a peak of 3.1 per cent in 2017, mainly due to the record slump in sterling in the wake of the 2016 Brexit referendum, which pushed up firms’ import costs.Analysts have warned that the pound could plummet again if the UK crashes out of the European Union with no deal in March.Mark Carney, the Bank of England’s Governor, warned in November that one of the consequences of a no-deal Brexit will likely be another spike in the cost of living.Separately, the ONS said that UK house price growth was 2.8 per cent in the year to November, up slightly from the 2.7 per cent rate in October, but well down from the 8 per cent growth rates seen before the Brexit vote.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

PIP is designed to focus support on people with the greatest needs and that’s happening, with 31 per cent of people getting the highest level of support, compared to 15 per cent under DLA.“As with any major new benefit we have been flexible and adapted our approach, and we continue to make improvements to ensure PIP is working in the best way possible.”\u0026nbsp \u0026nbsp \u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

They welcome Theresa May’s deal, but only because it is better than the “existential” threat that no deal, trading on Word Trade Organisation terms, would involve.This, for example, is what Mike Hawes, the chief executive of the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders, said on the eve of the meaningful vote: “As MPs prepare to vote on the government’s Brexit deal, we urge them to remember they hold the future of the British automotive industry – and the hundreds and thousands of jobs it supports – in their hands. Brexit is already causing us damage –\u0026nbspin output, costs and jobs\u0026nbsp–\u0026nbspbut this does not compare with the catastrophic consequences of being cut adrift from our biggest trading partner overnight.”“A managed no deal\u0026nbspis a fantasy,” Hawes concluded.To understand the interconnectedness of supply chains, consider that some 1,100 trucks loaded with parts cross the English Channel every single day, to deliver their goods direct to “lineside”, for car giants such as BMW, Toyota, Nissan, Honda, Jaguar Land Rover and Vauxhall.Brexit deal failure will lead to ‘national emergency’, warns CBI chiefToday’s factories are run on “just-in-time” principles – so any delay, and certainly delays of days or weeks, would cripple production, ramping up costs and shredding thin profit margins.For example, in its journey from a basic casting to its place revving around inside a new Mini Cooper S, a Mini crankshaft will travel from France to the UK to Germany and then back to the UK, and probably then back to the continent to be seen in a showroom. Stockpiling parts is old-fashioned and prohibitively expensive and unwieldy,\u0026nbspand disruption to production is intolerable. Sooner or later plants will be run down and volumes reduced to cut losses.Second, consider the position of Vauxhall at Ellesmere Port. With Peugeot having last year taken over GM Europe, of which Vauxhall was a part, it must soon choose where to place production of its next mid-sized models – the new Vauxhall Astra, Peugeot 308 and derivatives. With overcapacity, it has a choice to locate production – and secure jobs – in any of range of plants in France, Spain, Germany or the UK.The UK, particularly through Nissan, has worked hard to build up expertise in electric and autonomous vehicles. This will also disappear with the investment that will no longer be flowing into Britain. A promising growth industry is already doomedWith no certainty about the future of the UK’s relationship with Europe, and a need to concentrate production, Ellesmere Port, which narrowly missed closure before (a German plant went instead in an EU-wide effort to deal with the recession), is obviously threatened. Even Jaguar Land Rover is opening new production facilities in Slovakia. Toyota and Nissan (with its Renault alliance partner) could move new investment to the much bigger market in the EU. \u0026nbspThird, a no-deal exit will mean tariffs on parts and finished vehicles which will substantially add to admin and to costs. The UK exports far more of its production to the EU than the EU does to the UK, although Britain is a large and profitable market for EU-based firms. VW Group, for example, commands more than 20 per cent of British new cars sales\u0026nbspBMWMini is on about 10 per cent and Mercedes-Benz 7 per cent, meaning that about four out of every 10 new cars from German brands alone.For UK exports, adding 10 per cent to a car’s cost as it crosses the Channel would, again, destroy profitability.Last, the UK, particularly through Nissan, has worked hard to build up expertise in electric and autonomous vehicles. This will also disappear with the investment that will no longer be flowing into Britain –\u0026nbspand is already down significantly. Geely of China, which owns the maker of\u0026nbspLondon cabs, shelved a plan to build an electric van plant in the Midlands. Thus, a promising growth industry is already doomed.\u0026nbsp“Project Fear” for cars would proceed at slow speed. No one scraps a car factory overnight. The decline will be gradual, but inexorable. Makers such as Jaguar Land Rover, which\u0026nbsptend to export more to the US and the rest of the world than the EU, might suffer less and Rolls-Royce and Bentley (owned by BMW and VW Group respectively) might for the same reason feel less pressure but all rely on materials arriving from Europe, from engines,\u0026nbspgearboxes and\u0026nbspframes to\u0026nbspbraking systems and switches.Again, it would be relatively easy to transfer operations, even for quintessentially “British” brands. It would probably take five to ten years to relocate the auto industry abroad, much of it to EU bases in eastern Europe.After all, HP sauce, complete with its portrait of the Houses of Parliament, is made in the Netherlands nowadays. \u0026nbspGot an unanswered question about Brexit?

Tory MPs want to put a time-limit or get-out clause on the policy, which is designed to prevent a hard border in Northern Ireland.\u0026nbspSpeaking in the same debate, European Parliament Brexit coordinator Guy Verhofstadt said the question was not how to break this deadlock in the UK over the way forward.I know it’s not up to me as a humble Belgian to lecture the Brits on what to do. But I think it’s time now to tell our British friends that for the sake of Britain itself it’s time for cross-party cooperation, as we do here, he said, urging the different factions to come out of the trenches and build a consensus.Elmar Brok, a German MEP and ally of Angela Merkel, criticised Ms May for reaching out to opposition parties “two years too late”, adding: “Mr Corbyn has said that he wants a customs union – what he should do is get a majority for the proposal and, once that emerges, that will be no problem for us.”Frans Timmermans, the vice-president of the European Commission, said the EU executive “regrets the rejection of the withdrawal agreement”.“Nobody should be under any illusion: Brexit does harm. It does harm to the UK, and it does harm to the EU,” he said.Created with Sketch.Brexit deal vote: Opposing groups of protesters gather by Parliament Show all 20Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.An anti-Brexit protester adjusts her pro-EU wig A message to Jeremy Corbyn in support of a people\u0027s voteA mock Titanic captained by Theresa May heads towards an iceberg in a stunt by campaigning group AvaazProtesters of opposing sides are in close contact outside of ParliamentPaintings of Theresa May and Jeremy CorbynFormer UKIP leader Nigel Farage speaks to the media at the protests outside ParliamentA pro-Brexit protester in Parliament SquareOpposing protesters share the space outside ParliamentAnti-Brexit protesters stand on Westminster Bridge ahead of today\u0027s vote Former UKIP leader Nigel Farage speaks to the media at the protests outiside ParliamentAnti-Brexit protesters demonstrate outside the Houses of ParliamentA pro-Brexit protester sets up outside ParliamentAn anti-Brexit protester waves an EU flag on Westminster Bridge ahead of today\u0027s vote Protesters of opposing sides demonstrate outside ParliamentProtesters of opposing sides stand near ParliamentAn anti-Brexit protester adjusts her pro-EU wig A message to Jeremy Corbyn in support of a people\u0027s voteA mock Titanic captained by Theresa May heads towards an iceberg in a stunt by campaigning group AvaazProtesters of opposing sides are in close contact outside of ParliamentPaintings of Theresa May and Jeremy CorbynFormer UKIP leader Nigel Farage speaks to the media at the protests outside ParliamentA pro-Brexit protester in Parliament SquareOpposing protesters share the space outside ParliamentAnti-Brexit protesters stand on Westminster Bridge ahead of today\u0027s vote Former UKIP leader Nigel Farage speaks to the media at the protests outiside ParliamentAnti-Brexit protesters demonstrate outside the Houses of ParliamentA pro-Brexit protester sets up outside ParliamentAn anti-Brexit protester waves an EU flag on Westminster Bridge ahead of today\u0027s vote Protesters of opposing sides demonstrate outside ParliamentProtesters of opposing sides stand near ParliamentQuoting British author CS Lewis, he hinted at the possibility of the UK staying in the bloc: “We can’t go back and change the beginning, but we can start where we are and change the ending.”Melania-Gabriela Ciot, the Romanian EU affairs minister who is chairing the Council of the EU, said of last night’s vote: “Given the many conflicting messages that have been passed in the UK before and during the debates leading to the vote, on all sides of the political spectrum, it is hard to single out one particular explanation of this outcome.”The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It found 28 per cent were against and 26 per cent did not know.Remaining in the EU was backed by 45 per cent, while 39 per cent of people said they\u0026nbspopposed reversing Brexit and 16 per cent said they did not know.Forty-five per cent supported further negotiation with the EU, while 34 per cent were against going back to Brussels for fresh talks. More than a fifth (21 per cent) did not know.Some 40 per cent would opt for Norway-style deal – which allows access to the single market – but 36 per cent dismissed the option and 24 per cent were unsure.Leaving the EU without a deal was the least popular option as it was preferred by only 35 per cent, while 45 per cent opposed it and 21 per cent said they did not know.It comes as\u0026nbspthe prime minister has been reaching out to Labour MPs and trade unions in a last-ditch bid to get her deal\u0026nbspthrough parliament.Government insiders are expecting Brussels\u0026nbspto offer\u0026nbspMs May some extra help by Monday, which they hope will ease fears from wavering MPs over\u0026nbspthe\u0026nbspIrish backstop.However, she is unlikely to secure a legally binding guarantee that the UK can independently decide to the leave the backstop, which Brexiteers and her\u0026nbspDUP allies want.BBC analysis estimates Ms May could lose the meaningful vote by\u0026nbsp228 votes next week, after which she would have to come back to parliament within three days with a plan B.Northern Ireland secretary ‘using peace process as bargaining tool’What is the position of the big trade unions on Brexit?The truth about May’s shambolic approach to the unionsFinally, May has realised she desperately needs Labour’s backingArticle 50 set to be extended even if May wins crucial Brexit voteOpposition to Ms May’s deal\u0026nbsphas weakened among the public, as the BMG research shows 37 per cent think\u0026nbspMPs\u0026nbspshould reject the deal, compared with 43 per cent in December.When asked if parliament should vote to accept the terms of the deal, 29 per cent said they should, up from 26 per cent last month. More than 30 per cent said they were unsure in both instances.The poll put Labour and the Conservatives\u0026nbspneck and neck on 36 per cent of the vote,\u0026nbspwith the\u0026nbspLiberal Democrats on 12 points,\u0026nbspUkip\u0026nbspon 6 per cent and the Greens on 5 points, once don’t-knows were excluded.The Independent\u0026nbsprevealed on Friday that Ms May’s\u0026nbspchances of delivering\u0026nbspBrexit\u0026nbspon 29 March are fading fast after senior ministers privately admitted more time is needed, even if her deal wins the backing of parliament.On Saturday, transport secretary Chris Grayling was accused of engaging in “gutter politics” when he warned that blocking Brexit could lead to a surge in far-right extremism.Created with Sketch.

What happens after defeat for Theresa May\u0027s deal?  What are the alternatives to May\u0027s deal?Click to followIndy PoliticsTheresa May speaking after surviving a confidence vote of Tory MPsWe are entering one of the most uncertain periods in the modern history of Britain, with even the most experienced\u0026nbsppoliticians and commentators unsure of what the immediate future holds.This article will help you get to grips\u0026nbspwith some of the various outcomes from Brexit that the UK faces, and how we might get to them.It\u0026nbspwill be updated regularly as the picture shifts day by day...1 What are the key dates? 15 January: Theresa May suffers a devastating defeat in the Commons, after MPs throw out her Brexit deal by a record majority of 230 in the long-awaited ‘meaningful vote’.Before 29 March: There are various scenarios that could occur. She may try to go back to the EU to gain further concessions from Brussels as long as a defeat is not heavy enough to have crippled\u0026nbspher politically.\u0026nbspOtherwise, parliament may seek to use its powers to take control of Brexit and set a path forward.\u0026nbspThere may also be a move to\u0026nbspextend\u0026nbspthe Article 50 process to allow more time to push through neccessary legisaltion\u0026nbspor even for a second public vote.29 March: Brexit Day. Under terms of Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty, if a country triggers the withdrawal process from the EU, they have two years to try to conclude negotiations on how it happens before their membership automatically ends – regardless of whether those negotiations have been successful or not.2 What happens after defeat for Theresa May\u0027s deal?The big question to which no one knows the answer. There are lots of possibilities now that May’s plan has been defeated. She will have to return to parliament to set out her plans within three days. Here are the routes likely to be pursued or rejected early on...\u0026nbspRenegotiation: Despite official indications from Brussels, there are clear signals from the EU that there will likely be an opportunity to renegotiate after a defeat for Ms May\u0027s Brexit deal.\u0026nbspThere are reports that there may even be an opportunity to re-open the withdrawal agreement to make changes to the hated \u0027Irish backstop\u0027. What the UK would have to give in return for any change to the backstop is unclear however, and nothing will be given for free.\u0026nbspThe prime minister pushes the deal to a commons vote... again: It may be that the PM does win some change to the withdrawal deal,\u0026nbspthat means she can go back to the commons and ask for it to be voted on a second time.\u0026nbspAlternatively, a\u0026nbspplunging pound and disruption to financial markets\u0026nbspcould also give May a reason to ask MPs\u0026nbspto vote again and push through her deal in the national interest.General election: Jeremy Corbyn has vowed to call a vote of no confidence in the government after a defeat for Theresa May\u0027s deal. But for this to be successful, lots of Tory MPs also need to vote for an election, and with their seats at risk and a left-wing Corbyn government waiting in the wings, they are not likely to do so...yet.\u0026nbspIf Ms May tries to push for a no-deal Brexit some Conservatives have vowed to do whatever they can to stop it.3 What are the alternatives to May\u0027s deal?Now that it appears the PM’s strategy is dead, other possibilities have started to arise...A second referendum:\u0026nbspThere will at some stage be a big push for a new referendum.\u0026nbspThe Independent\u0026nbsphas campaigned for the public to have a\u0026nbspFinal Say, with more than one million people signing its petition. The\u0026nbspPeople\u0027s Vote\u0026nbspcampaign has galvanised the support of politicians, celebrities and millions of others across the country.The new referendum would, however, have to be secured through a vote in the House of Commons and it appears that there is no majority for it at this time. Lots of Conservatives are opposed. Labour appears to be moving towards possibly backing one, but the party is split and Mr Corbyn is said to be against the idea. Even if Labour does back it, there are likely to be up to 20 of the party’s\u0026nbspMPs\u0026nbspwho still vote against it, because their constituents so heavily backed leaving the EU that it would risk them being ousted at the next election.Time could change this situation. As other possible outcomes are whittled away and the prospect of an economically damaging no-deal Brexit looms, more\u0026nbspMPs\u0026nbspmay feel compelled to back a new referendum. The question of timing will be critical. Some backers feel the issue should be pushed to a commons vote, as an amendment to the “meaningful vote”, fearing that waiting will mean other outcomes take hold and become more likely. Others say if the vote is brought to the commons too soon, without enough support, and it falls – then supporters will lose their only chance of making it happen.\u0026nbspThere is also not a consensus on what the question should be in a new vote – in or out, May’s deal or no deal, no deal or Remain. Some suggest a three-way vote on May\u0027s deal, no-deal and Remain, with the option receiving the fewest votes being knocked out and votes redistributed, as in the “alternative vote”\u0026nbspelectoral system.\u0026nbspEven if a proposal for a new referendum is passed, there is every chance Leave could win again, of course.Plan B (Norway):\u0026nbspThere are those – including some in cabinet – who believe that once the deal is ditched the best plan would be for the UK to enter a Norway-style arrangement with the EU. This would either be\u0026nbsptemporary until a wider trade agreement can be arranged or\u0026nbspa permanent solution. It would mean leaving the EU, but staying in the single market. A “Norway-plus”\u0026nbsproute could also see the UK remaining in the customs union.But this is likely to enrage half of the Tory party in parliament, and probably all of the more\u0026nbspBrexitish\u0026nbspmembership, as a less than full break from Brussels. It also does not end “free movement”, risking a backlash from Leave voters for whom immigration was the key issue in 2016.An extension to the Article 50 period:\u0026nbspThe EU has indicated that the 29 March\u0026nbspBrexit day could be postponed, but only if there is a set course of action to postpone it for. In other words they could delay it for a new referendum or an election. It is not clear if they would do it for a late renegotiation.No deal:\u0026nbspThis is the default. After a defeat for May’s deal and if government and\u0026nbspMPs\u0026nbspdo, or are able to do, nothing else, then on 29 March Britain will fall out of the EU with no deal in place. Many\u0026nbspMPs\u0026nbspare looking for ways to stop that from happening.It remains unclear whether the prime minister can continue after her deal with defeated by such a\u0026nbsphumiliating margin. She is expected to survive Jeremy Corbyn\u0027s no-confidence motion, but in order to win support she could soften her proposal to reflect a policy more in line with the Norway deal - something many Labour MPs\u0026nbsphave openly backed.Theresa May survived a vote of no confidence in December by 200 to 117, rebel MPs are not allowed to challenge the PM through the party\u0027s structures again for another year. \u0026nbspIt means if Ms May leaves Downing Street, it will now either by a result of her own decision that she cannot continue, a cabinet insurrection could render her position politically untenable and she may feel there is no other option but to leave Number 10.\u0026nbspIn an attempt to persuade MPs to back her in the no confidence vote, however, the prime minister told her colleagues she knew they did not want her to lead them into the 2022 general election - signalling she will stand down before then.The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Failing this, a general election will be called.The last time a motion of no confidence successfully received the required support of MPs was in 1979 - by just one vote. After the motion passed - defeating Jim Callaghan’s minority Labour government - MargaretThatcher emerged victorious in the resulting election, with a clear majority.Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Police monitor Brexit protesters outside the houses of parliament in London.

Mr Lichtman claimed that Zambada had been left free because he allegedly “bribes the entire government of Mexico including up to the very top, the current president of Mexico” - meaning Enrique Pena Nieto.The office of Mr Pena Nieto denied that accusation as false.Guzman\u0027s trial is expected to last a few more weeks.Reuters contributed to this reportOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Nonetheless, there were foreign visitors among the gathered crowds.“It is surreal,” said Manuel Matthaus, from Germany, of the ash-covered holy men. I had always heard about them,” he told the Hindu newspaper, describing them as “one of the reasons we wanted to come to the Kumbh”.“I did plan to take the bath,” he added. “But I guess the water now is too freezing for my linking. Maybe later in the evening.”One concern for international visitors will be the environmental conditions at the festival site. A thick haze of toxic dust hung over Prayagraj for the start of festivities, according to the Associated Press, and PM 2.5 levels were measured at more than six times the World Health Organisation’s safe limit.The dust plumes encompassing the camp came from the sandy riverbanks, said city commissioner Ashish Goel, and not from construction, which has been banned for the duration of the seven-week festival.Nonetheless, they highlight the struggle the central government faces in tackling India’s air pollution crisis. Also this week, Mr Modi’s government has unveiled its plan to clean up the country’s air –\u0026nbspbut allocated just 3 billion rupees (£33m) to the cause over the next two years, less than a tenth of the cost of the festival itself.Created with Sketch.World news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Cars are seen on fire at the scene where explosions and gunshots were heard at the Dusit hotel compound, in Nairobi, KenyaEmergency workers and people near the wreckage of a Boeing 707 military cargo plane which crashed on the west of the Iranian capital, near Fath airport.

Supermac’s had wanted to expand to the UK and rest of EU.For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialMcDonald’s claimed the branding of Supermac’s\u0026nbspwas too similar to its own and would cause confusion among consumers. The Irish company\u0026nbspis named after its founder Pat McDonagh, who is said to have earned the name “Supermac” while playing Gaelic football in his youth.In April 2017 Supermac’s, which has over 100 restaurants across Ireland, submitted a request to the European Union Intellectual Property Office (EUIPO) asking the bloc to cancel the US fast food giant’s\u0026nbsptrademark on “Mc” and “Big Mac”.Domino’s and KFC among fast food giants ‘forcing misery on chickens’Supermac’s accused McDonald’s of “trademark bullying” and registering brand names “which are simply stored away in a war chest to use against future competitors”.Lawyers for McDonald’s had provided printouts of its websites, examples of advertisements and packaging, three signed affidavits from its executives, and a printout of its Wikipedia page as evidence that it sells Big Macs across the EU and deserves a trademark.The EUIPO ruled that “the evidence is insufficient to establish genuine use of the trademark” on Big Macs by McDonald’s across the EU.McDonald\u0027s profits beat expectations thanks to its new Big Mac burgerUS President eats Big Macs, steaks and crisps on silver plates“Even if the\u0026nbspgoods\u0026nbspwere offered for sale, there is no data about how long the products were offered on the given webpage or in other ways, and there is no information of any actual sales taking place or\u0026nbspany\u0026nbsppotential\u0026nbspand\u0026nbsprelevant\u0026nbspconsumers\u0026nbspbeing\u0026nbspengaged, either\u0026nbspthrough\u0026nbspan\u0026nbspoffer, or through a sale.“Finally, as far as the relevant services are considered, there is no single piece of evidence that refers to any of the registered services being offered under the EUTM.”McDonald’s was also ordered by the regulator to pay costs of €1,080\u0026nbsp(£965) for the decision. It has the right to appeal. In the EU, trademarks can be registered both at a national and EU-wide level.Pat McDonagh, the managing director of Supermac’s, said: “The original objective of our application to cancel was to shine a light on the use of trademark bullying by this multinational to stifle competition. We have been saying for years\u0026nbspthat they have been using trademark bullying.Created with Sketch.World news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Cars are seen on fire at the scene where explosions and gunshots were heard at the Dusit hotel compound, in Nairobi, KenyaEmergency workers and people near the wreckage of a Boeing 707 military cargo plane which crashed on the west of the Iranian capital, near Fath airport.

But for activists, the battle is not over yet.\u0026nbspTheir wider goal, they say, is demanding proper asylum rights from the city council.\u0026nbspAlvaro, a member of the solidarity movements\u0026nbspwho is writing a PhD thesis on them, said there was a strong socialist spirit of “fighting fascism, real estate speculation and gentrification by tourism”\u0026nbspamongst what he described as “solidarity networks”\u0026nbspacross the city.\u0026nbspHe added that it is thanks to such communities that refugees and asylum seekers are able to find places to live, “otherwise they would be left on the streets”.He said the asylum application process is difficult for many because they do not fit specific requirements and many end up without a roof over their heads.Created with Sketch.

So we basically try to put them into the system so they can get a proper welcome.”\u0026nbspThe solution is temporary and this is why we held this protest. We want the government to provide a proper hosting system for refugees with permanent housing, education, and work opportunities.The squat was one way in which they have tried to help newly arrived asylum seekers and refugees.\u0026nbspUntil two months ago, Barcelona’s “marginalised people” occupied the building, Maria says, but vacated it so asylum seekers could make use of it instead.\u0026nbspBut while the squat eviction has been temporarily suspended, the prospect\u0026nbsphas not been permanently banished. At a protest following the celebratory lunch, several hundred activists highlighted the limbo the squat’s residents now find themselves in.\u0026nbsp“For now, we are happy the eviction has been stopped, but we don´t know where they will go so we demand a permanent solution,” Maria added.“What can you do in the absence of state help? Just leave refugees on the street?\u0026nbsp“Every day we are receiving new people here. We are doing this, but it’s exhausting at the same time. And I think the officials are grateful for our work because it means they don’t have to do their job.”She says members of the\u0026nbspcity´s solidarity network met council officials, who agreed to send a mediation team to conduct a vulnerability report, leading a judge to halt the eviction.Created with Sketch.World news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Cars are seen on fire at the scene where explosions and gunshots were heard at the Dusit hotel compound, in Nairobi, KenyaEmergency workers and people near the wreckage of a Boeing 707 military cargo plane which crashed on the west of the Iranian capital, near Fath airport.

He initially sought asylum in Germany, which was “not so friendly,” so came to Barcelona two months ago after hearing it was more welcoming to refugees. He has lived at Casa Africa since.\u0026nbsp“Since I´ve been in Barcelona, I have seen a lot of friendly, nice and very welcoming people,” he said.\u0026nbspHousing for asylum seekers is abysmal – things need to change now“Many of them are also struggling and it´s not easy for them to help, so we really thank them a lot.“It is also not an easy life to be a refugee and I have met many people sleeping on the street. I was told that if I see someone in trouble like this, to bring them here. I have brought maybe four or five people here, to the squat at Casa Africa.”Zac said he was granted asylum seeker status a week ago but still does not have access to a social worker, which he needs in order to find accommodation, and a job.“My dream is to find work. If I don´t have a home, I cannot achieve this, but hopefully this will change.”Ignasi Calbó, manager of the city council’s “Barcelona, Refugee City” plan\u0026nbsp(Barcelona – Cuitat Refugi) said all asylum seekers at Casa Africa are enrolled onto language courses and have access to legal advice.\u0026nbspHe said the plan’s “Service Centre for Immigrants, Emigrants and Refugees”\u0026nbsp(SAIER)\u0026nbspwas launched in 2015 in response to the crisis. Its website states refugees and immigrants are provided with information on housing, legal aid, social care and on learning Catalan and Spanish.\u0026nbspMexico agrees to take in America’s asylum seekersBut Mr Calbó bemoaned the lack of central government support, which, he says, “creates unrealistic policies, provides no resources to help refugees and simply does not care for them.”He said the council is appreciative of the work of Barcelona’s community of activists for helping newly arrived refugees.\u0026nbsp“It’s good to see how people are working to help people who need it, but we are working with the community to find solutions,” he added.“They help us and we help them to achieve their goals, like we have done with postponing of this eviction.”He confirmed Casa Africa was not an isolated case of solidarity shown by locals to newcomers.\u0026nbspMr Calbó said some 7,000 refugees arrived in the city in 2018, up from around 4,000 in 2017 and nearer 2,000 in 2016.But he said programmes to integrate and host refugees are expensive.Those who have found shelter at Casa Africa must wait to hear whether they will be allowed to stay.However, for Zac, it has already proved\u0026nbsphow migrants need not be regarded with fear and suspicion, and can help benefit their adopted communities.“There is plenty of room for everyone,” he said. “People are just not given access to go and work and pay taxes. If they are given this, everything will be comfortable.\u0026nbsp“If you are working you must pay your taxes and that is what we want to do.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Although it was possible to buy its handsets for some time if you looked hard enough, its first official move into the UK came last November with a highly attractive, innovative phone called the Mi 8 Pro.This week, its second flagship phone goes on sale, the Mi Mix 3, and it’s even more eye-catching. It’s a slider phone. No, not like those tiddly Samsung feature phones from the nineties, this phone slides only about 1cm, enough to reveal the camera hidden behind. Which, in turn, means the phone\u0027s front really is all screen –\u0026nbspwell, technically it has a 93.4 per cent screen-to-body ratio. Unlike other full-screen phones, there’s no notch because there’s no need to find room for the camera.I spoke to Xiang Wang, the company’s global senior vice president and head of\u0026nbspinternational business. We met at the Barbican Centre in London and sat in a corner that defined the eccentricity of the building, with sloping floors and corridors that narrow unexpectedly. I began by saying that this was a building that made a strong first impression and asking him how he wanted Xiaomi to be seen as it arrives in the UK.For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trial“I think the first impression of the brand should be that this is a cool company, very young, energetic and very cool, he said.\u0026nbspIt’s a very different culture and different product philosophy to others.

We were struggling to pick which one because we have so many,” Wang said.The new phone, the Mi Mix 3, was also a contender for being the first UK release. “It is another high-end model with a good camera, strong battery, new stuff inside. In the end, we went for the Mi 8 Pro because of its design with its cool transparent back, in-screen fingerprint sensor and so on. So, I think the UK audience may like it. We are also releasing a scooter, we think we picked the best, coolest products we have for the UK market.”Yes, that’s right, Xiaomi also makes an electric scooter. The range available in the UK includes half a dozen phones, a fitness tracker, a nightlight and a couple of power banks, but in China the products available are much more numerous. The plan is to offer a much wider range here, too, one day.“Through the Xiaomi stores we want to learn what the British consumer wants and needs so we can bring the right products to the UK. Now, we have just brought the hot-selling products from China and elsewhere because it takes time for us to do the testing and certification for the local requirements of each market. We think that in the future when we have a bigger customer base, we will have a better idea of what works for each country.”So, why is Xiaomi building its presence now in the UK? “I think the rationale is this. On 7 November\u0026nbsp2017 we had our first launch event in the western world, in Madrid, Spain. We tested the market and now we are number three in Spain. We work with all channel partners including online and offline carriers, including building our own Xiaomi stores there. The initial success in Spain gave us much more confidence for the western European markets. These are developed markets in which we had never worked before. Last May we launched our pilot service in France and Italy, in Milan and Paris and so the next natural step was the UK.”This may lead to different challenges, it seems. “The UK has a lot of technology innovations, plus art, fashion, and an energised younger generation. I think this could be a good place for us. There are also a lot of challenges in the UK because the normal consumer doesn’t know us. Those who do know us are engineers and the younger generation who have come across us on the internet. Also, in the smartphone world, the UK is still a carrier market, so we have to spend extra effort to make customisations for carriers. That’s another challenge. Overall we’re very confident.”When I met a senior executive at Huawei a year ago, he said it would be easy for the brand to be the world’s number one (it’s already climbed to number two, overtaking Apple in recent months, leaving only Samsung ahead of it). But that wasn’t the most important thing. What would be Wang’s ambition for Xiaomi?“Our ambition is not to become the number one smartphone hardware company – we definitely want to be one of the important and biggest tech companies in the world. But our aim is not just selling hardware, we are much more than a smartphone company. We build more products than that.”One of the standout features of the brand is the competitive price: Both the new Mi Mix 3 and the Mi 8 Pro are priced at £499, half the price of an iPhone XS. How is the company making the phone for that price?“Internally we are making huge efforts to improve operating efficiency. Actually, unlike traditional hardware companies, we do not spend huge sums of money on traditional marketing and billboards. We use social media and other channels to communicate our products. Basically, it’s word of mouth. If someone loves our products, they will tell their friends, family colleagues.”From 2018 the company set a maximum profit level of 5 per cent. If profit exceeds this, Xiaomi has said they will return the excess to consumers. “Yes, we did this already, last year. We gave coupons to our consumers which they can use to buy our products. That’s one way, which we did last year for Chinese consumers.”Xiaomi expects the range to grow in the UK, but Wang points out that there’s already something for every pocket.“Actually, we have the whole portfolio from the entry-level to flagship covered. We will gradually bring more but we understand we need to be focused, Wang said. The UK market is very different from others, there are still a lot of entry-level products but the high-end part of the market is very big. The phone network Three has been asking us to offer better entry-level products and we are doing that.In the mid-range we want to understand it better, we’ll listen to the carriers more.”It sounds like the company will see what works in China first, to get a clue as to what will work here in the UK. But Wang reveals that this may some day lead to products tailor-made for British tastes. “In the long run, once we have built more resources, we can think about products which can be designed specifically for the UK or Europe. But now we basically pick products from our portfolio. We have to do some customisation, for example the frequency requirements are a little different, so we have to add a band to serve European consumers.”This is now the fastest-selling smartphone in India- everSmartphone shake-up amid Samsung wobbles and the rise of XiaomiEvery phone manufacturer faces a challenge. Handsets have just become the same thing – a black oblong with a glass or metal back. How does Xiaomi differentiate?“The Mi Mix 3 is one way to stand out from the crowd. The competition is severe so we are competing on every front, for instance, design and material – the Mi Mix series was the first to use ceramic, as a unibody, the entire phone was built from one piece of ceramic, including the frame. That’s another choice. As for technology, we always partner with the best, for items such as the in-screen fingerprint sensor.”This is in the Mi 8 Pro, but not the new Mi Mix 3 which has a conventional rear-mounted sensor.Finally, how does he view competition?“I think competition is good – if everything is the same and we have efficiency, the cost advantage, from making it in China in large numbers, then we don’t need to make a lot of profit from the hardware. Other companies have a business model where they need to spend a lot of money on marketing. We don\u0027t do that, so our products are high quality but not high price.”Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Come what May, who would replace her  Here are the latest odds.Under parliamentary rules, the result of the vote of no confidence means Mrs May will go unchallenged by her own party for the next year.But she has strongly hinted that she will step down before her term officially ends in .But Mrs May also seems determined that she will try to see Brexit through before resigning.Her scrappy success means she is safe from another such challenge from her own benches for the next year.This week, MPs will vote on Theresa Mays Brexit deal, andit doesnt pass her position will appear weak.But the weaker-than-expected result of the vote has bolstered the likelihood of Labour going for a vote of no confidence in the government itself.If this were to go ahead and get the required backing from other opposition parties, it could mean a snap election.There are several possible routes out for May - and there are plenty of colleagues priming themselves for the role.Now delegated to the back benches after quitting as foreign secretary, Boris Johnson remains a favourite to replace Theresa May in No.The controversial Tory has recently signalled his interest for the leadership contest, and has repeatedly refused to rule it out completely.Home secretary Sajid Javid also seems keen to step up to the role - recently unveiling his vision of a Conservative party that reflects a bigger picture of social mobility.If May had lost in the vote of no confidence it would have immediately trigger a leadership contestshe lost - but this is now off the cards.Here are the latest odds from Ladbrokes as of January , Former Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson is still a hugely popular figure among Tory grassroots and the general public.He drew a huge crowd to hear him bash Theresa Mays Brexit plans in a barnstorming speech at the Tory conference in Birmingham.Boris quit as Foreign Secretary on July  in a killer blow to Mays government.He walked out just hours after she lost Brexit Secretary David Davis over her Chequers plan to keep close ties to Brussels.But many MPs appear to have turned against him, meaning he might struggle to get on the ballot.His aborted leadership bid in  was scuppered by his friend Michael Gove, severely damaging his electoral brand.And his hopes could be dashed by reports of a close friendship with a blonde Tory aide and his orce from we Marina.The bookies have recently been giving Jeremy Corbyn strong odds as the nations most likely next Prime Minister.The Labour leader has had to fight constant opposition from his own MPs including a leadership contest after just a year.But the party has swung behind him after a much stronger than expected  General Election when Labour picked up  seats and Mrs May lost her majority.Although the fabled youthquake of support from younger voters did not happen, Labour is enjoying relatively strong support in opinion polls.He hopes to force a general election by voting down Mrs Mays Brexit deal, and has boasted he would win.He promised to call a no-confidence motion in Theresa May’s government “soon”.Corbyn told BBC One’s The Andrew Marr Show: We will table a motion of no confidence in the government at a time of our choosing, but it’s going to be soon, don’t worry about that.The Home Secretary is the current bookies favourite among the Conservatives.Mr Javid was appointed Home Secretary in the wake of the Windrush scandal and the resignation of Amber Rudd.A known Eurosceptic, Mr Javid ended up backing Remain during the EU referendum but is popular among the Tory parliamentary party.Some of his statements in recent months and his backing for a harder Brexit have been taken as signs he is pitching for the leadership.The MP for Bromsgrove in Worcestershire is a former managing director from Deutsche Bank.The former Brexit secretary quit the cabinet in protest over Theresa Mays soft orce deal with the EU.He played a prominent role in the Leave campaign and previously served as a Justice minister.Before he went into politics he was a lawyer, working on EU and World Trade Organisation Law.His appointment was welcomed by Leave-backing MPs.But his former personal assistant branded him a bullying Mr Nasty after she was sacked for leading a double le as an escort.Mr Hunt was the longest-serving Health Secretary in British history before replacing Boris as Foreign Secretary.He left the Department of Health after securing a £bn funding increase for the NHS.Mr Hunt is known to have leadership aspirations and now says he backs Brexit despite campaigning for Remain during the referendum.Ms Rudd has managed to stay in favour with Mrs May, taking the buck for the Windrush scandal and stepping down as Home Secretary - before months later ing to the cabinet and Work and Pensions chief in November.The -year-old Hastings MP has voiced support for the PM and for her botched Brexit deal, but insiders think shes savvy enough to manoeuvre a bid to the top when shes ready.One concern though would be her slim majority in her constituency of Hastings and Rye, which was slimmed down after the  vote to just  votes.In contrast, Mrs May enjoys a , majority in her constituency of Maidenhead, that has stood behind her over more than two decades.David Davis quit as Brexit secretary on July , , with a devastating letter warning Mrs May her proposal would leave the UK in a weak negotiating position with Brussels.He has since launched a series of attacks on Mrs Mays strategy, and led a Tory rebellion to ditch the Chequers plan.He called on Cabinet ministers to rise up and kill off the plans.Furious Tories have demanded Mr Davis be installed as interim leader to save true Brexit.Jacob Rees-Mogg, the Latin-fluent millionaire financier and MP for North East Somerset, has emerged as the leading Brexiteer on the backbenches.He has won a huge public profile despite not being a minister and is loved by Tory activists.Rees-Mogg has also garnered a surprise following among many young Tories - including Jungle Queen Georgia Toffolo, who called him a sex god.Devout Catholic Rees-Mogg has made no secret of his socially conservative views, including being anti-abortion and against gay marriage.His plummy tones, double-breasted suits and traditional manner have earned him the nickname The Honourable Member for the Nineteenth Century.The Environment Secretary has achieved a remarkable turnaround since kning Boris Johnson during the  leadership contest.His support among party members dropped through the floor and it seemed his chances were gone for ever.But Mr Gove, who led the Leave campaign in the EU referendum, has rebranded himself as an ecowarrior as Environment Secretary.He has also thrown his full support behind Theresa Mays Brexit plan, winning him friends among MPsnot the party faithful.Though an unlikely candidate at the time, the Brexit campaigner reached the final two of the  leadership contest.She withdrew over ill-judged remarks about Theresa May not being a mother.She is now Leader of the House, and survived in post despite reports Mrs May was planning to cut dead wood in her January reshuffle.Mrs Leadsom had a role in the downfall of Sir Michael Fallon after she accused him of lewd sexual comments.The popular and savvy leader of the Scottish Conservatives has been touted as the potential saviour of the Tories in Westminster.But Ruth has said repeatedly she wants to focus on Scotland and as she is not an MP she currently is not eligible to stand as leader of the UK party.In September  she declared she never wants to be Prime Minister.She will also be putting politics on the back burner for a while as she has just had a baby.Another way for a PM to resign would be to lose a vote of confidence in the Commons, leading to the government falling.In that scenario there could well be a fresh General Election, with both major parties trying to secure a parliamentary majority."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/nintchdbpict000240614813.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"jacob rees mogg children vandalised house brexit","story":"But who is the real Mogg  Heres what we know about the Conservative MP for North East Somerset, who has once again emerged from the back benches to deliver searing words on Theresa Mays Brexit deal.Jacob Rees-Mogg is a backbench Tory MP for North East Somerset but is better known for his period drama persona which has been winning him fans.He entered Parliament during the  General Election after working as a fund manager in London.During the EU referendum, he was a passionate Brexiteer and made many high-profile media appearances arguing for a vote to leave the EU.To say he was born into a privileged position is an understatement - he is the Eton and Oxford-educated son of the long-serving Times editor William Rees-Mogg.During the  General Election Rees-Mogg attracted ridicule.This is because he brought his faithful nanny along with him as he battled to be elected in the working class and staunchly Labour seat of Central Fe.He had batted away speculation that he would challenge Theresa May for the leadership of the party, insisting he was completely loyal to her.Rees-Mogg said he was more likely to become POPE than PM.He was one of the  Conservative MPs who submitted a letter of no confidence, which triggered a leadership challenge on December , and ultimately failed to oust May.There has been speculation that he might try his hand for the role, but previous polls put his likelihood of becoming PM at -.In a scathing remark after Mays humiliating Brexit deal defeat, he told the Sun: Not only is the PMs deal now dead as a dodo, it makes dodos look positively energetic.Outside the political arena, Jacob is a family man with six children.His we is journalist Helena de Chair, daughter of the aristocrat Somerset de Chair.He celebrated the birth of his sixth child with a touching picture on Instagram in September .He wrote: Helena and I announce with great joy that we have a baby Sixtus Dominic Bonace Christopher, a brother for Peter, Mary, Thomas, Anselm and Alfred.In May  it was reported by The Mail on Sunday that he had purchased a new £million house just around the corner from No  Downing Street.The five-storey mansion is just a short walk away from the Parliament and is also close to Tory HQ in the heart of Old Westminster.Rees-Mogg joked he had been priced out of swanky Mayfair and needed a bigger home for his six children.Rees-Mogg named his sixth child Sixtus, which is a Roman name meaning polished.It is also the name of a Pope and Saint.His full name is Sixtus Dominic Bonace Christopher .Sixtus eldest sibling is Peter Theodore Alphege, who was born in .Jacobs only daughter Mary Anne Charlotte Emma came along a year later followed by Thomas Wentworth Somerset Dunstan in  and Anselm Charles Fitzwilliam in .His fth child, Alfred Wulfric Leyson Pius, was featured in a video as his father tried to teach him how to say Brexit.Alfred was born in February .In September , a thug shouted at the children your daddys a horrible person outside their London home.A month before that graffiti was sprayed on a building and on a car as well as the garden.They managed to write posh scum on windows of the house.The MPs th Century country home, called Gournay Court, is a listed building.He also owns a £.m house in Westminster.Due to his strict Catholic beliefs, Mogg admitted on ITVs Good Morning Britain that he did not support abortion even in the case of rape and incest.I am completely opposed to abortion, le begins at conception, he said.Abortion is morally indefensible.The MP has also repeatedly voted against sex marriage legislation.He defended everyones right to free speech, and insisted thathe ever became Prime Minister, the law is not going to change.Soon after Rees-Mogg made his remarks it emerged the millionaire MP was making money out of an abortion pill despite his strong stance against it.Somerset Capital Management, the investment company he co-founded, owns nearly £million of shares in Indonesian firm Kalbe Farma.Reacting to the story, Rees-Mogg told The Mirror: This is not something I would wish to invest in personally but you have a duty as an investment manager not to impose constraints on investors.He added: This company does not procure the abortion of babies.It’s not my money in these investments and I profit from the total amount of client money we hold, not the investments we make.The Made in Cha star and  Im A Celebrity Get Me Out Of Here winner has admitted she has the hots for Rees-Mogg.In an interview with the Sunday Times, Georgia Toff Toffolo revealed the politicians she admired “the standard - Zac Goldsmith, Jacob Rees-Mogg. I fancy them all, adding: Jacob’s a sex god.”The reality star elaborated: “The human mind can be sexy. He’s so clever, I just love him, adding: “I fancy middle-aged politicians, but I’ve never been with one.”Rees-Mogg has responded to news of the -year-olds crush, saying he was “greatly surprised but nonetheless flattered” by the revelation.“I am glad Miss Toffolo won and hope this is the launchpad for a glittering career,” he added.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But I make no apology for standing up for the interests of this House and the interests of our whole United Kingdom.The PM vowed to secure changes to the hated Irish backstop proposals which have doomed her deal so far."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/NINTCHDBPICT0004609576882.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"softening brexit labour votes final nail pm coffin","story":"This suicidally insane strategy is being proposed by, you guessed it, Remainers inside and outside Cabinet.Her deal is already toxic to Brexiter backbenchers and the DUP on whom she relies for power.

They also backed a binding referendum and a Tory manesto promising to leave the single market and customs union.And they should remember this: their own anti-Brexit prejudices do not matter a damn.

No one doubts the Prime Minister’s dogged determination, but she has frittered away a golden opportunity.Mr Lewis warns of paralysisthe vote is lost, but how  would you describe the situation we have already seen this week Jeremy Corbyn and his squabbling rabble are putting their own interests before those of the country, while Tory Remainers plot against their own leadership.Mrs May’s options are rapidly running out and we are entering uncharted political waters.But one thing is certain: The will of the people was resoundingly clear at the referendum.It’s the will of the politicians — or lack of — that has led us into this crisis.HAVING your car stolen is traumatic enough.But shocking new figures show your chances of ever seeing it again depend hugely on where you live.Police recovered fewer than one in two vehicles nicked across the UK in the past ten years.Merseyside officers have a  per cent success rate, but for the Keystone Kops in the West Midlands, it’s just  per cent.Police cuts are blamed, but that hardly explains such dferences.It is alarming that drivers are the victims of such a postcode lottery.THE appalling arrogance of the EU-loving Speaker John Bercow knows no bounds.We reveal today he binned a paper from his most senior official, David Natzler, when he tried to discuss Mr Bercow’s controversial Commons amendment.The Speaker shamelessly ignored the very Parliamentary conventions he is there to uphold so he could skew the Brexit debate in favour of Remainers — damaging the impartiality of his office.Mr Bercow has a B******s to Brexit sticker on the family car.Isn’t it time to say B******s to Bercow Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Few believe him.Last year, he enraged EU chiefs, grabbing a key role as the European Commission’s Secretary-General by stealth and seizing control of the entire Brussels machine and its , staff.This puts him in pole position to succeed his boss, Jean-Claude Juncker who lurches into retirement this year as the commission’s supreme leader.Mrs May, steely-eyed and unflinching at home, has been the first to blink whenever the EU has set out its demands.Now she has infuriated fellow Tories by flirting with opportunistic Labour MPs and offering concessions to trade union dinosaurs such as Len McCluskey.“Her first loyalty has always been to the Conservative Party,” says a former ally.“Yet here she is presiding over its potential destruction.”The rebellion, led by Tory hypocrite Dominic Grieve, will reach its climax as Tory Remainers gang up with Labour and unSpeakable John Bercow to sabotage Brexit and block No Deal.A “secret” plan to hijack Commons procedure is being hatched by ex-minister Oliver Letwin, perhaps the silliest clever person in Westminster.It was Letwin who devised the disastrous poll tax, invited thieves into his house at am to “use his loo” and loot his property and casually dumped secret Cabinet papers in a Hyde Park litter bin.And it was Letwin, “the man in the custard-coloured corduroys”, who drove a stake through free speech in a am stitch-up with Labour and the Lib-Dems.Tory Chief Whip Julian Smith overheard the plotting in an MPs’ cloakroom, perhaps after being alerted by Letwin’s yelping giggle.He swtly leaked the scheme to frighten waverers into saving May’s deal.The rebel rabble have no idea what will happenthey succeed in killing it.A second referendum giving a clear choice between In and Out might well see an increased vote for Brexit.Any attempt to fiddle the question would trigger a dangerous backlash.An emergency election is for the birds. That leaves us with a No Deal Brexit on World Trade terms, which cannot be stopped without a change in the law before March .Forget about the Government’s Apocalypse Now propaganda. Germany is near recession, Italy is already there and France is joining the queue.Our economy is growing better than most and experts say it will accelerate, whichever way Brexit is resolved.For that silent -per-cent majority, a clean break still seems the right answer.SHOUTY Remainer Anna Soubry rightly complains about being labelled a “Nazi” by unsavoury protesters.Yet this publicity-hungry Tory MP is very free with her own insults, casually labelling as “racist” anyone who voted Out – surely a far nastier insult in modern Britain.Perhaps Ms Soubry should follow her own revolting advice . . . and “just suck it up”.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Even worse, it would deny us the right to walk away from these new arrangements without the EU’s say-so.May’s dodgy deal would reduce the UK to a vassal state, a bossed-about colonial outpost of the Brussels ­oligarchy. The people voted for Leave, yet May offers us Remain by another name, a deal that sells out Brexit.For the PM to so wilfully ignore the cry of her people is a sucker-punch to the most basic principles of democracy.But it gets worse. The MPs who plan to revolt against May’s deal in the ­Commons today will not do so to protect Brexit.They are not taking a stand against May’s deal to defend what .million of us — the largest bloc in British ­electoral history — voted for in June : A clean exit from the EU.No. They see taking down May’s deal as the first step to taking down Brexit itself.Whether it’s Europhile Tories or Labour, SNP and Lib Dem MPs who have long loathed the idea of Brexit, an army of parliamentarians plan to knock down May’s deal so they can set about knocking down Brexit.So the real ide in ­Parliament today is over how to stop Brexit.The main thing our MPs will disagree on today is whether Brexit should be killed off by May’s shady deal, by extending the Article  process or even with a second referendum, as anti-May MPs would prefer.Think about this. Think about what it says about the state of British politics.The people vote in historic numbers to leave the EU. Yet the political class plot and conspire to make sure we do not.It is hard to think of another time in living memory when politicians have been so ­spectacularly out of touch with public sentiment — and so ­sinisterly cavalier about overriding our democratic wishes.There are honourable exceptions, of course. From Boris Johnson and Jacob Rees-Mogg in the Tory camp to Kate Hoey on the Labour benches, some MPs will opposeMay’s deal precisely because they believe in Brexit and plan to carry on fighting for it.But a majority of MPs fall into one of the two Brexit-phobic camps — whether it’s May’s “Remain by another name” or those who would stop Brexit entirely.Some MPs are terryingly upfront about their distaste for the democratic process and their disgust with us, the pesky ­electorate.In an unhinged online rant, Labour MP Clive Lewis branded Brexit a “racist endeavour” and said “we need to end it, now”. Let’s be real about what this means.Ending Brexit means overturning the largest vote in British history. It means ending the right of ordinary people to have a say in Britain’s future. When MPs like Lewis scream, “Stop Brexit!”, they are really saying: “Stop democracy!”Labour’s David Lammy is also open about his desire to overthrow the largest act of democracy in our history.He described the vote for Brexit as “madness” and says MPs must “bring this nightmare to an end”. By “this nightmare”, he means the ­public’s reasoned, ­democratic request to leave the EU.This is the depth of the ­contempt some MPs now feel for ordinary people. They see our political beliefs as a “nightmare”.On the Tory side, people such as Anna Soubry have not been shy about their hatred for Brexit. On Sunday Ms Soubry posted a chilling message on Twitter.She said Parliament has “historic” business to take care of this week and reminded everyone that under Section  of the Public Order Act, it is an “arrestable offencea person uses ­threatening or abusive words”.In essence, she is warning the masses to stay away from Parliament, to not even think about protesting.It is testament to the arrogance of the political elite that they can openly call for the overthrow of Brexit and warn the little people they might be arrestedthey get too angry about this blatant assault on our democratic rights.“Know your place, plebs.” That is what they are saying.The extent to which Parliament is ­conspiring against the people can be seen in Speaker John Bercow’s ripping-up of parliamentary rules.Last week, Bercow let MPs vote on an amendment to a motion put ­forward by Tory arch-Remainer Dominic Grieve.The amendment, voted through by  MPs to , would force the ­Government to come up with a Plan B within three daysMay’s deal is defeated in the Commons.It should be noted here that Grieve has changed his tune.In his election message to constituents in May  he declared: “The decision of the electorate in the referendum must be respected and that I should support a ­reasoned process to give effect to it.”Now he is saying it is “the biggest ­mistake of our recent history”.As one commentator astutely put it ­yesterday: “It’s precisely this sort of ­sophistry that ­created the backlash that led to Brexit in the first place.”The BBC has stated that Grieve’s ­amendment means MPs who are “plotting” against Brexit would have “more space in which to work”. Thanks to Bercow’s unprecedented move, backbenchers will have much greater ­leeway to hamper and even kill off Brexit.It is believed anti-Brexit backbenchers are planning to table an amendment that would give their motions priority over Government motions.This would not just dramatically change how Parliament has always operated — it would let backbenchers scupper a No Deal Brexit, perhaps even force through a second ­referendum.Some are referring to this as a coup — an attempt by certain MPs to take back control from the Government and also from us, the public.As one senior Government figure said: “This could be ‘game over’ for Brexit.”Democracy is hanging by a thread in this country.Last year, MPs celebrated the th anniversary of women and working-class men getting the vote. This year, they are using their clout to overthrow ­something millions voted for.The hypocrisy is staggering.In today’s battle between MPs who back May’s Brexit betrayal and MPs who want to go even further in ending the “nightmare” of Brexit, there will be one clear loser . . . democracy.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

To allow Brussels,it wanted, to keep us bound hand and foot forever in the Irish backstop, unable to forge our own independent trading policy.It would rapidly have become clear to the Leave majority that their decision, while nominally honoured, had been sold down the river. That we had not truly left the EU and maybe never would.More practically it all but guaranteed the collapse of the minority Tory Government since,it had somehow passed, the DUP would have withdrawn their support.The Government was always going to lose heavily. The discredited Commons speaker John Bercow ensured it by refusing to select any amendments to the Bill that might have helped narrow the margin of defeat.It was another low for a man who has already brought disgrace to his historic office by abusing his powers to help engineer the destruction of Brexit. Parliament will be a better place without him.But let’s not pretend it would have made much dference. The deal was fatally flawed.Mrs May’s response to the vote last night was feisty — challenging Parliament to find a viable alternative that could win a majority and honour the ­referendum. No one has a clue what that would be.And her call for MPs to “listen to the British people” was dead right.Outside Westminster, the public just wants Brexit done. They are aghast at the political games.The Sun reluctantly believes we must head for a clean break, finalise preparations as best we can and batten down the hatches.We never wanted a No Deal. It would mean a tough and probably damaging few months. But it would be the only solution left which defends what should now be paramount and most precious to us all: Our democracy — and the public’s faith in it.None of the alternatives does that.  They neither honour the referendum, nor are possible to sustain.They are all damaging in their own way. Yet our Remainer-dominated Parliament will fight tooth and nail to secure one of them and thwart a clean break, in direct conflict with millions of voters.The Norway-Plus proposal, however its champions spin it, is EU membership without the voting rights. No independent trade ­policy. No end to free movement.It is a short-term Remainers’ Brexit which would lead to only one ­conclusion: A new and irresistible clamour to exit properly.Another Tory idea is to lure Labour support by offering the permanent customs union they want with the EU, abandoning all thoughts of independent trade. It is a potentially suicidal idea which could destroy their Party and put Corbyn’s Marxists in power.Then there’s the toxic second referendum which would upend our democracy, shatter trust in politicians for all time and burst fully open our national isions.Its only upside is that Leave would probably win again. Plenty of the more sensible Remainers have seen through the EU now — and dislike the blatant unfairness of overriding a democratic mandate before it has been enacted.But what would the question be  Remain versus a deal already now rejected by a monstrous Commons majority as bad for Britain And whatRemain DID win  It is staggeringly naive to imagine that would settle it. Why should Leavers accept it  The wounds would never heal.Labour appears almost ready now to buckle to its europhile members and back that second vote — and its betrayal of millions of left-leaning Leave voters will finally be complete.Shadow Cabinet ministers are already teeing it up, laughably attempting to deflect blame by claiming Tory failure gives them no option. Don’t believe a word.The Tories have dedicated nearly three years trying to see Brexit through while Labour have tried to thwart every effort and their Brexit spokesman Keir Starmer has secretly lobbied relentlessly for a ​new referendum. Labour will own every ounce of the betrayal their working-class voters will feel — and will richly deserve the ballot box backlash.Mrs May has had the hardest task of any Prime Minister since Winston Churchill, trying to fulfil the Brexit mandate with no majority in a Parliament stuffed with Remainers, some colluding with the EU to sabotage her position.Even so, her handling of it has been a woeful failure.She is clinging to power by her fingernails.

and the sceptical Sec department, which handled UFO policy issues.Following one meeting between the opposing sides, one member of DIS writes about a female member of Sec: ...she believes that all sightings are explainable“When asked on what basis of logic or analysis this had been done there was none.Another document reveals how Sec staff angered intelligence staff by only forwarding to them UFO reports they deemed credible.According to the files, DIS wanted to do in-depth research into the UFO phenomenon including going back through the archives and looking for patterns.The documents, which span the years  to , show Sec were worried about this, stating they had “some concerns about what is planned”.They were concerned that by researching UFO sightings, the MoD would contradict what they had told Parliament, which is that the UFO topic had no defence signicance and wasn’t being studied in depth.How are we able to maintain the line that the Governments policy is not to examine reports [of UFOs] further and that we have nothing to hide a  letter from Sec, included in the files, reads.Nick Pope, who headed up the UK’s UFO project - as part of Sec- was sent the documents by the MoD before their public release and shared them with Sun Online.He said: “These files show how dferent isions at the MoD were at war with each other over the UFO issue.“I had an excellent working relationship with colleagues in the Defence Intelligence Staff and because I had a high security clearance and the same open-minded views on the phenomenon, our positions were seamless.“Sadly, things broke down after , when I was promoted and moved to another job.“For whatever reasons, my successors clearly didnt enjoy the same good working relationship with the DIS that I had, and things went wildly off-track.“It was ridiculous for my successors to try to filter reports by forwarding only those they deemed credible, because they had no clue how intelligence works, and were clearly regarded with contempt by the real experts.“I dont knowit was scepticism, laziness, or even religious belief - some government officials oppose serious UFO research because they believe the phenomenon is demonic - but for whatever reason, some of my successors wanted to get out of the subject altogether.”Although the UFO project officially ended in , Nick believes the phenomenon is still being investigated by intelligence chiefs.“While they may think they won the battle in  when the MoD terminated its UFO project, intelligence officers dont stop being interested in anomalous sightingsthey think there are threats and opportunities in terms of technology acquisition.This is irrespective of whether they believe the good-quality UFO sightings are generated by foreign military aircraft or drones, exotic atmospheric plasma phenomena - or extra-terrestrial visitation.“Im sure theyre still looking at such things, but outside the scope of a formally-constituted UFO program. As seems to have been the case in the US with the Pentagons AATIP program, the UKs current UFO project is probably hidden by virtue of being embedded in an intelligence program looking at future aerospace threats.The documents are due to be released later this year and Nick hopes they will be placed in the National Archives as soon as possible, digitized and available free of charge so the public can see for themselves the dramas and disagreements the UFO subject caused. “This is a fascinating part of the official history of the most bizarre subject the MoD ever handled and I think people would be surprised, amused and intrigued to find out that MoD officials got drawn into just the same believer versus sceptic arguments about UFOs that one sees anywhere ,” he said. “The only dference was that the stakes were higher: the prize was the chance to set government policy on the issue.”"},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/NINTCHDBPICT000462085071.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"brexit delayed 2019 amazon tesco no deal","story":"A new coup is proposing a shake-up that would force Theresa May to extend Article  until Decembershe cant win support for her EU plan, The Times reports.Conservative MP Nick Boles is spearheading the proposals after Theresa Mays EU plan was spectacularly dismantled in the Commons.He explained plans on his website, in an article called Stopping No Deal Brexit.Mr Boles wrote: Some of the MPs working on this are strong supporters of the PM’s deal.

The Franco-German axis may be replaced.Mr Salvini said the elections would be a referendum between the Europe of the elites, banks, finance, immigration and precarious work and the Europe of people and labour.I don’t have a crystal ball but the goal is to become the second largest movement, maybe the first in the next European parliament elections, he said.The new alliances and populist backlash against immigration following the refugee crisis has sparked a political earthquake in the centrist conservative European Peoples Party.Hungarys nationalist prime minister and member of the EPP Viktor Orban has said there will be a pull to the right in the alliance and that their goal is that opponents of immigration become a majority in the institutions of the EU.Austrias Peoples Party, as well as Poland, the Czech Republic and Hungary rejected a United Nations migration pact last year, shattering EU unity on migration.Across Europe, the far-right Alternative for Germany is polling neck and neck with the German Social Democrats and in France, Marine Le Pen, the president of the National Rally -

main possibilities for what happens next, including a second vote on the PM’s Deal, No Deal, a second referendum, a Customs Union Deal with Labour or the EEA option.THE likeliest option , as expected, Theresa May wins the no-confidence vote tabled by Labour.Most Tory MPs opposed to her deal want her to get back to Brussels to win more concessions — despite the EU’s refusal to re-open talks.One No source previously said the vote would be put back to MPs  times until they voted it through.Bookies have much higher odds of the PM getting her vote through on the second ask.This was fuelled by Scottish Secretary David Mundell saying MPs might reflect again on their “mistake”they get a second chance to vote on the Deal.Mrs May said she would start cross-party talks with MPs after the confidence vote.She said she would stay on and try to find “genuinely negotiable” solutions which she can take to Brussels.The PM has until January  to set out a Plan B, with the clock ticking on the scheduled date of Brexit in just  days’ time on March .European negotiator Michel Barnier said it was “time for the UK to tell us the next steps”.EU President Jean-Claude Juncker has declared “time is almost up”.JEREMY Corbyn was urged to back a People’s Vote by the end of the week — as furious MPs demanded he “get off the fence”.Sources claimed up to  of his MPs would today “pivot” to back a second referendum — and urged the Labour leader to back them.Labour Remainer Chuka Umunna told The Sun Mr Corbyn had to stand by the party’s agreed policy and support a second referendum “by the end of the week”.Shadow Brexit Secretary Sir Keir Starmer had earlier broken ranks and admitted a People’s Vote “had to be discussed”.Labour has so far committed only to consider a People’s Vote as an “option”the party cannot secure a General Election through a no- confidence vote.The move came as Ian Blackford, head of the SNP at Westminster, tore into Mr Corbyn’s dithering over whether to back a new poll.Speaking in the Brexit debate he told MPs: “I’m appealing to the Labour party — for goodness sake, get off the fence.”More than  MPs have publicly backed another Brexit vote, including former Tory ministers Justine Greening and Jo Johnson.Tory MP Dominic Grieve also supports a re-run of the referendum.Many Brexiteers — and Brexit voters — believe a “managed” No Deal is the best option for the UK because it would involve no £billion bill and the chance to strike global free trade deals.But those close to the PM believe she would never willingly commit to No Deal.There is also no majority in Parliament for it.MPs insist they will take any measure necessary to prevent it with some Tories saying they will resign the whip to vote against the Government.Last week anti-No Deal MPs voted in favour of a motion blocking the Government from spending money to prepare for No Dealit happened.More votes of this nature are certain to take place over the coming weeks.EUROPHILE Tory MPs have urged Theresa May to try and build bridges with Labour MPs.They were most recently joined by her Cabinet Remainers Amber Rudd, David Gauke, David Lidington and Greg Clark.The PM even put in calls to union bigwigs last week to try and get support for her deal.But the danger lies in the fact there are more Tory critics of her deal than Labour backers.Membership of the Customs Union permanently is official Labour policy.But eventhe PM did offer this — as not just an olive branch but almost an entire tree — it would infuriate Tories.And it’s not remotely certain that Jeremy Corbyn’s party would back the deal because their so-called six tests were always designed to be failed — and ultimately what theLabour leader wants is a General Election.TORY ex-ministers Nick Boles and Nicky Morgan and Labour’s Stephen Kinnock lead the “Norway Plus” movement saying Britain should consider joining the European Economic Area.It would mean being outside the Common Agriculture Policy as well as Fisheries, Justice and Home Affairs.But it would see the UK staying in the EU’s single market — one of Theresa May’s red lines.Big business would welcome it but Brexit voters would be unhappy as it would mean Britain accepting open borders and Free Movement of people and following European rules without any say.Supporters see a chance of an “emergency brake” on movement of people and some consultation on any new Single Market rules.One possible mechanism for the plan is a bill tabled by Boles Morgan handing control of Brexit to the Commons “Liaison Committee” of senior backbenchers. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I’m talking about the footage of Anna Soubry being harassed and bullied in the street which has led to a man being arrested.Who would have thought we would live somewhere where people think it’s OK to aggressively call an MP a “slag” and a “Nazi” to her face — simply because she has a view that they don’t agree with.When it comes to political harassment outside Parliament, some people have suggested that women are disproportionately being targeted. I’m not sure that’s true.Journalist Owen Jones was also followed down the street in an equally bullying way.And not so long ago, Jacob Rees-Mogg was verbally attacked on his own doorstep in front of his children.The sad truth is that there is a nasty taste about politics in everyone’s mouth at the moment.And this kind of behaviour isn’t a million miles away from the way that politicians treat each other in the chamber.PMQs has become a ludicrous, abusive, screaming match full of insults and contempt. Sometimes it’s worse than that and the confrontation is pre-meditated.Not so long ago, Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell called for Tory MPs “not to be able to show their faces in public” without being challenged by “direct action”.Since he said it, the atmosphere both inside and outside Parliament has become considerably more feverish. But the point is that some people take their lead from the way politicians treat each other.Politics should be all about serving people before you serve yourself.And there was a time when we trusted our politicians to do the right thing for the right reasons.But that trust is gone.In fact, people are becoming sick to the back teeth with politicians doing things that suit them, rather than the country.Whether we like it or not, the majority voted to leave the EU. But there is no doubt that some people feel they were misled or the terms weren’t explained to them. Andpeople were angry before the referendum, they are even angrier now.But they are going to have to find a dferent way to express it than by shouting threatening abuse in people’s faces.Politics is hard enough without fearing for your le and needing security to go to work.This country is changing — and not for the better. We have no tolerance for other people’s views, or when things don’t go the way we want them to. We all want our own way.The stakes are very high. And no one trusts their politicians to do what they want them to do in the way they want them to do it.So their response is to hunt them down and hurl abuse.It used to be that this sort of thing only happened on social media, and we all agreed it wouldn’t happen in real le. But look, it now is.People sending out this abuse should be held to account for their actions and words.Shouting in someone’s face in a threatening manner is not acceptable behaviour. It’s harassment and utterly deplorable.But also, politicians need to start building trust again. They need to say something and mean it,  and do the right things for the right reasons.I’M no stranger to criticism. And normally it’s water off a duck’s back.But I really take issue with being called a “passenger” this week, together with my friend Lord Sugar, for our attendance at the House of Lords.I want to make something very clear. Despite being a full-time CEO, I have voted in  per cent of isions, speak once a month and have never taken a penny of the daily expenses, allowances or fees. Lord Sugar, like me, does not take a single penny.People seem to misunderstand the role of the peers in the House of Lords. For a start, quantity has never equalled quality. But also, we do not implement legislation.We use our le skills and experience to help draft legislation and improve it by suggesting amendments that make the bills work better in the “real world”.Our second priority is to hold the Government to account by questioning ministers, seeking information and debating government policy.We also debate issues. In the Organ Donation debate I spoke in recently, contributors included a board member of patient groups, a surgeon, the chairman of the Royal College of Surgeons, a medical professor, a doctor and one of the heads of NHS Blood and Transplant – all of whom also happen to be peers making valuable contributions to help government work better.So I don’t like being called a passenger, because it’s wrong. The reason I am a peer is I want to try to help make the world a better place. That is my only motivation to be part of the House of Lords.So I’m a bit annoyed that Lord Sugar and I are being picked on because we are on the telly.We need peers to have real-world experience and make their contribution, which Lord Sugar and I do.We do it for free and we will keep doing so. And we will do so proudly.EEK! The Channel  show Shut-Ins: Britain’s Fattest People made for some seriously disquieting viewing on Wednesday.It’s hard for the average viewer to understand how someone could allow themselves to become so obese that they are bed-bound.Harder for me to understand is the people in that position who allow their children to become their carers.I know it’s not easy to lose weight and keep it off, but asking your eight-year-old to look after you is not only ruining your own le, but hers too.What child should be the main carer for their obese mother WHEN I read the break-up statement from Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, , and his novelist we, MacKenzie, earlier this week I was struck by how impressive it was.“If we had known we would separate after  years, we would do it all again,” the statement read.The couple wished each other well with no regrets and it sounded like the near-perfect separation.And then, the next day, came the news that photos of Bezos and the woman he has allegedly been having an affair with for the past eight months were about to be published.So I guess he jumped before he was pushed, as it were.How disappointing.I WATCHED a really disturbing clip this week of a hooligan sneaking up to a sleeping homeless man in Leeds and – to impress some of his yobbish mates – blasting a really loud air horn in his ear.It’s one of the most disgusting acts I have seen in a while.Tormenting those less fortunate than you and picking on them because you consider them worthless is the lowest of the low.Many people living on the street have addiction or mental health problems. Treating both is important.But just as important is treating all people with dignity.EQUALLY as shocking was the story about three men who attacked two others walking along London’s South Bank, apparently because they were holding hands.This blatant homophobia feels archaic – and needs to stop.I hope when the pathetic perpetrators are found they get more than a telling off and a caution.ANYONE  stle a yawn reading about writer Yann Moix, who said in an interview this week that he finds women of  “too old”.The Frenchman continued: “I prefer younger women’s bodies, that’s all. End of.“The body of a -year-old woman is extraordinary. The body of a woman of  is not extraordinary at all.”Apparently Yann would be “incapable” of loving a woman aged  or above – despite being  himself.Let’s face it, any body belonging to a -year-old – male or female – is probably not what it was at .So since he seems to be talking only about attraction, not love, why on earth he thinks a woman of  will want to look at his body is anyone’s guess.But also, who would want to be with someone as superficial as this APPARENTLY, Wayne Rooney has been banned by we Coleen from leaving the house without her following his drunken arrest at a US airport.Ex-Manchester United star Rooney, , who now plays for Washington’s DC United in the US, was arrested for public intoxication on December  at the city’s Dulles International Airport.The former England captain received a furious phone call from Coleen, who apparently yelled at him: “How many times do you need to be told ”Oh dear.

The full might of the British establishment has joined forces to overthrow the biggest democratic vote in our history.Together, they have strived to stop this country becoming truly independent once more. They have fought with the passion of true, eye-swivelling believers to keep us shackled to Brussels.AndTheresa May sees her deal voted down on Tuesday — and it looks like she is on course to suffer a defeat of historic proportions — they will take a great leap forward to achieving their goal.Oh, it will be dressed up and prettied to pretend that democracy still s in this country.There will be much prattle about “going back to the people” with another referendum. There will be talk about a “delay” in leaving the EU. It will all be meaningless flannel.The British elite wants to keep us inside the European Union. They are succeeding. Jolly well done, chaps.Never mind that a British Prime Minister, the coward David Cameron, looked us in the eye and told us our decision in the referendum was final.Never mind that the over- whelming majority of MPs in the House of Commons voted to trigger Article  and take us out of the EU.Never mind that at the General Election, both the major political parties stood on manestos that promised to honour the result of the referendum.Lies. Lies. Lies.Parliament is breaking with the people. Brexit is being stopped by the elite. The masters are taking back control of a people’s rebellion.But should we not all reflect for a moment on the consequences of Parliament’s break with the people There is currently no  for political extremists in this country, not the way that there is in European nations such as Germany, Spain, France and Greece.Historically, the British have never cared for the loony fringe extremism that has flourished — and frequently ruled — in other European nations.But I fear the democracy deniers of the British establishment are creating the perfect conditions for the rise of the nutters.WE DO NOT WANT TO LIVE IN THAT KIND OF COUNTRY.There were ugly scenes outside Westminster this week. Name calling, bullying and aggression. All of us should be striving to see it does not get far worse.The .million who voted for Brexit are not — and never have been — the knuckle-dragging morons of myth.Deny Brexit and they will not suddenly become violent thugs. But there are lunatics on the margins of our society who will feel enabled by an arrogant establishment recklessly and openly breaking with the democratic will of the British people.How can you not fear for our country’s future “LONDON is open,” preened London Mayor Sadiq Khan in his lavish, pro-Brussels fireworks display on New Year’s Eve.Yes, Sadiq – open for violence, open for gangs, open for murder.Two weeks into , London has already had four murders, including the killing of Jaden Moodie, a boy of  who was rammed off a moped, then repeatedly stabbed by three men.London had  murders in , many of them teenagers.Khan needs to stop posing and start getting some effective policing on the streets of our capital.THERE is one thing I truly don’t understand about the malcontents who spend their lives flying balloons, waving flags and raising their voices around Parliament Square.The UK employment rate is now at . per cent, an all-time high. Unemployment is at . per cent, the lowest since the Seventies.Don’t the flag-wavers outside Westminster have a job to go to COUNTDOWN star Rachel Riley has received a torrent of online abuse after criticising Jeremy Corbyn’s craven tolerance of anti-Semitism in the new Labour Party.“Surely you can have compassion and fight for the Palestinian cause without sharing your bed with Holocaust deniers and virulent anti-Semites,” Rachel, who is Jewish, told Channel  News.“Corbyn’s giving a legitimate voice to Holocaust deniers. It is a sad state of affairs when you have to be brave to speak out against anti-Semitism.”Anyone who thought that Rachel was just a TV cutie smiling bravely while she spelled out words like “orgasmed”, “gobshite” and “bumhole”has seriously underestimated her.Rachel Riley has courage, grace and eloquence.

So expect some politicians to miss the point entirely and make it more “inclusive”.ASKED to produce a list of the th Century’s most iconic explorers, everyone would probably name Scott of the Antarctic, Roald Amundsen, Edmund Hillary and Sherpa Tenzing Norgay.Everyone, that is, except a group of BBC “experts”, who ignored all of the above and replaced them with Jane Goodall and Gertrude Bell last week.I don’t even need to explain why, obviously.The names alone tell you it’s all down to the deranged, obsessive PC box-ticking that governs everything the BBC does and makes a farce of its new voting series Icons, which has the nerve to claim: “We want your opinion.”It doesn’t, obviously. It wants to impose the BBC’s right-on opinion on you and swallow its rewritten version of th Century history in the process.So for quota-driven reasons, Elvis didn’t make the entertainers shortlist and Alexander Fleming was left out of the last four scientists, despite discovering penicillin.But while Margaret Thatcher was included among the political finalists – and, boy, that must have hurt the BBC – they totally ignored her Falklands and Cold War victories in favour of re-styling her as a female gender warrior, almost the very last thing the former Prime Minister actually stood for.The episode where this series’ barmy levels of political correctness will really be laid bare is the Sports Stars episode, which has named Labour-supporting Paralympian Tanni Grey-Thompson as one of the th Century’s four greatest icons, but left out Jesse Owens, George Best, Usain Bolt, Rod Laver, Olga Korbut, Roger Federer, Eric Liddell, Martina Navratilova, Seb Coe, Jack Nicklaus, Tiger Woods, Carl Lewis, Diego Maradona, Michael Jordan, Ayrton Senna and even the talisman of our greatest trophy-winning team of all, Doug Rougvie.Shameful.This Morning’s Alison Hammond, , metres above sea level, in the ski resort of Val D’Isere, interviewing skiers ­wearing skiing gear: “Why are you here ”THE Voice UK contestant Dean Mac is living the dream. How do we know He told us all, on Saturday night.“I’m living the dream,” he boasted, “in a really cool penthouse apartment, in the centre of Manchester. Duplex, with a pool table.”He also told us he performed “baby-making music,” though the world had been surprisingly slow to acknowledge Dean’s “triple threat” potential.“I went to LA, Paris, Liverpool, as a choreographer dancer, and one day a music producer said, ‘You need to be the front guy’.“The next stage now is to release the beast of my showmanship and have my craft appreciated.”So, on Saturday, he unleashed it in the direction of the four Voice judges and, honestly, the reaction was almost perfect.Hardly a serious button flinch or a twitch or a hint one of them was going to bite. In fact, he’d have had more luck getting the four heads on Mount Rushmore to turn.A response that said: “If that’s baby-making music, the human race is gone in  years’ time.”The saving grace of the ITV show’s format is that there’s nothing he could do or say to the judges afterwards either.Dean Mac just had to trudge back to his “really cool penthouse apartment”.Living the dream.Chris Kamara: “He headed his shot just over the bar.”The food: “Pizza, pasta, ravioli and all that s***.”I know. Close your eyes and you could almost be there. And s***.Tipping Point, Ben Shephard: “On a computer ­keyboard, the abbreviation PGDN is short for page what ”Gerry: “Up.”The Time It Takes, Joe Lycett: “Who wrote Handel’s Water Music ”Lindsey: “Pass.”The Chase, Bradley Walsh: “What name links a chocolate bar and a ship on which a mutiny occurred ”Lauren: “Cadbury.”And Ben Shephard: “In which century did the Second World War take place ”Vicky: “st.”An epidemic of head-tilting right-on morons telling us: “It takes a whole village to raise a child.”Loose Woman Gloria Hunnord conjuring up a horric mental image when she told ice-dancing Saira Khan: “I worry about you when the one-hand job comes in.”And Icons presenter Chris Packham boldly comparing himself to Marie Curie and Einstein with the observation: “I’m a bit of an outsider too.”Though, just so we can put their achievements in proper perspective, neither Marie Curie nor ­Einstein ever got their own episode of Celebrity Cash In The Attic.GOOD Morning Britain, Piers Morgan: “I believe in fat-shaming.

The Prime Minister faces a vote of no confidence today after suffering a massive parliamentary defeat over her controversial EU withdrawal agenda. Labour launched a bid to oust the Government after Mrs Mays Withdrawal Agreement was overwhelmingly rejected by  votes to . Now Parliament remains fundamentally split over what form of Brexit would be best for Britain. But how do the options dfer   Despite the huge defeat the agreement may still be on the table in an amended form as Mrs May seeks cross-party talks for genuinely negotiable solutions she can take to Brussels. From the start of the Brexit process, Mrs May had insisted that she wanted a bespoke deal tailored specically for the UK and not an off-the-shelf model shaped around arrangements offered to other trading partners. The Withdrawal Agreement reached in November guarantees the rights of UK citizens currently living in the EU states and European nationals in Britain, settles the UKs outstanding liabilities to Brussels budgets for a payment of around pound billion and takes Britain out of the EU single market and customs union, the common agriculture and fisheries policies and the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice. It offers a -month transition period after the official Brexit date of March   to prepare for the new arrangements. Alongside this is a Political Declaration agreed by the UK and EU, setting out a common determination to forge a close future relationship in areas such as trade and security. If this cannot be secured by the end of the transition in December , the period can be extended by a further two years. If the transition concludes without a deal, the so-called backstop must be triggered, keeping the whole UK in a customs union with the remaining EU to prevent a hard border in Ireland.  If no alternative to Mrs Mays deal is agreed, the default option is for the UK to leave the EU without a deal on March . This would mean there would be no transition period, and iniduals and businesses would have to adapt immediately to new arrangements. The UK would leave EU structures such as the single market and customs union and would fall back on World Trade Organisation rules, which require tarfs on many imports and exports. Experts and businesses have warned that an abrupt withdrawal could cause chaos, with speculation over gridlock at the Channel ports, empty supermarket shelves, a collapse in the value of the pound and even aeroplanes being stopped from flying. But advocates of no deal say the warnings are exaggerated and the UK would benefit by being able immediately to strike new trade deals around the world. Brexiteers argue that the UK could save its pound billion orce bill by leaving without a deal, but this could be challenged by the EU in the courts.  The holy grail for some Eurosceptics is an ambitious Canada-style free trade agreement with the EU, removing tarfs from almost all imports and exports of goods, offering co-operation on standards and allowing mutual recognition of professional qualications. A Canada-style agreement would allow the UK to leave the EU institutions, end freedom of movement and strike new trade deals where in the world. Critics say that the model would severely restrict access to European markets for the UKs vital service industries - particularly the financial sector. But the options fans say services could be included in what they term a Canada-plus-plus-plus deal. Ministers warn that it would not resolve the backstop problem, as Brussels would still demand the North remains in the EU customs area to avoid a hard border.  Some supporters of a soft Brexit argue that the UK should take its lead from the members of the European Free Trade Association- Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland - and seek a close relationship with the EU short of full membership. As a member of the European Economic Area , Norway enjoys full access to the internal market for most trade in goods, but must implement the bulk of Brussels regulations without having a say in its decisions. It also pays substantial sums into the EU budget. Switzerland, which is outside the EEA, has a more remote relationship with the EU, based on dozens of bilateral agreements which must be constantly updated. The Swiss are required to follow EU laws in areas which give them access to the single market but make much lower contributions to Brussels budgets. Crucially, the arrangements do not cover services. Proposals for a Norway-style option often envisage a single market and customs union relationship with the EU after Brexit, but the Efta states are actually not part of the customs union. It is far from clear that existing Efta members would accept a UK application to join.  If the UK chose to abandon Brexit - either through a second referendum or by simply revoking its Article  notice of withdrawal - before March , it would retain its membership of the EU under existing terms. Trade with EU neighbours would continue to be free of tarfs and non-tarf barriers under single market rules, and UK and EU nationals would retain the right to work and settle in one anothers countries. The UK would keep its seat in the EUs decision-making bodies and hasty arrangements would have to be made for the election of MEPs in May. The UK would be subject to ECJ rulings and would continue to make contributions to Brussels budgets, currently running at around pound billion a year net, but the orce bill would no longer be payable. Future trade deals would be made as part of the EU bloc and not bilaterally. If the UK applied to rejoin after the Article  deadline has passed, it would have to go through a y accession process which would almost certainly involve giving up the rebate negotiated by Margaret Thatcher, as well as opt-outs in areas such as justice and home affairs. It could be required to join the Schengen free movement area and the euro as part of the price of readmission.

Last night the Prime Minister claimed she would discuss a way forward with senior parliamentarians from across the House after her Brexit deal suffered the worst defeat in Commons history. She also promised to come forward with an amendable Plan B by Monday. But within minutes No officials indicated she would not rip up her plan - and appeared to suggest senior MPs could mean backbench MPs. Today Mrs Mays representative in the Commons stuck the boot in. Not only did Commons Leader Andrea Leadsom slam Corbyn - she also reiterated key red lines like refusing to rule out no deal or delay Brexit. Labour backbencher Yvette Cooper said she was making a mockery of Theresa May’s proposal for cross party talks.   The chairwoman of the Home Affairs Committee added: PM has to accept she failed by  votes - she can’t just keep digging in. MPs in Commons bars were left baffled by the PMs response to last nights vote. One told the Mirror: Did she even notice it had happened  Ms Leadsom was questioned today as the government faces a historic no confidence vote at Mr Corbyns hands at pm tonight. She repeatedly rubuffed questions from the BBC on whether Mr Corbyn would be approached. She said: Jeremy Corbyn had the opportunity yesterday to put to the house exactly what his alternative proposals were. He clearly has none. Instead what he seeks to do is disrupt the country [with a general election]... He needs to come to the table and tell us what he wants to do.   Labour hit back on Twitter: Disappointed @BBCrtoday failed to correct @andrealeadsoms obviously inaccurate claim that Labour doesnt have an alternative plan. We have been promoting it for months: a new Customs Union, a close relationship with single market, no race to the bottom on rights. Ms Leadsom indicated the government STILL isnt ruling out a no deal Brexit, despite a vast majority of MPs being against it. She said: No deal is better than a bad deal and of course its still the legal default.   She rejected suggestions that the government could delay Brexit . She said: “We’re clear we won’t be delaying Article , we won’t be revoking it and we are determined to deliver on Brexit on the th of March. That’s what we are seeking to do.” And she indicated Theresa May is trying simply to re-work her existing deal with the EU.  She said: The prime minister will then not necessarily be looking for brand new ideas that no one has thought of before, but actually seeking a consensus, actually a fresh initiative to find a solution that is negotiable with the European Union and that would command a majority in the House of Commons. Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell said today he and Mr Corbyn have not been approached for talks. And after Number  made clear that Theresa May remained committed to securing an independent trade policy after Britain leaves the EU, he warned she was in danger of negating any talks before they started.  She is now laying conditions down about those discussions which look as though they will prevent any discussion of a permanent customs union, he told BBC Radio s Today programme. That is what most of the other opposition parties support so she seems to be negating the discussions before they have even started. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn left his home in Islington, north London, at around .am.  He refused to answer questions from reporters on whether the vote of no confidence is a distraction orhe will win it, and simply wished everyone a good morning. Meanwhile with just  days left to Brexit, EU chiefs have demanded she make the next move. Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney warned: I dont think the EU is in any mood to change the Withdrawal Agreement signicantly at all. EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier this morning told MEPs he will respond favourably - but onlyBritish red lines change.

How does a vote of no confidence work  Jeremy Corbyn tabled the motion last night, and Theresa May agreed for it to be debated today.Under the Fixed-Term Parliaments Act, a no confidence motion is passed like any other vote in the Commons - by a simplemajority.That meansLabour , the SNP , smaller parties, Mays DUP allies and a small clutch of Tories team up, they can pass one.If this vote is passed, it starts a -day countdown clock to the governments doom. The PM can stay in office for these  days. But they must win a second vote with support from at least half of MPs within two weeks, otherwise a general election is triggered automatically. Other MPs can try and hold and win this vote too - but they would all need to win the support of half the House too. If its still deadlocked, we get a general election.   What time will the vote take place  Tonights vote will take place at around pm, with the result expected at around .pm. Will Theresa Mays government win a vote of no confidence   Quite possibly.That is because her DUP allies have indicated they will not side with Labour against her - unless her Brexit dealpasses.Labour are saying theyll force a no confidence voteTheresa Mays deal isdefeated. So its quite possible the DUP will side with the government or abstain. Without the DUP against her, it will be quite easy for Mrs May to survive. Would Theresa May be forced to resign  Legally, no. But the political pressure might well be too greatshe lost the vote.  Yes.Unlike a Tory leadership challenge, which can only be called once a year, Jeremy Corbyn can call multiple no confidence votes. He can even call a second no confidence vote a day after the first one fails.But this would be politically damaging because Labour could be accused of crying wolf. And insiders argue multiple votes would stretch the convention that they are only used when really necessary. Despite this, a spokesman for the leader refused to rule out multiple votes and Shadow Justice Secretary Richard Burgon said: If we dont win this no confidence vote this time, then we can bring it again and again and againnecessary.  Technically yes. If the Conservative Party finds a way of winning round enough MPs in the -day period, there is no general election. So the government could cling on , for example, the DUP side with Labour in a no confidence vote - but only to remove Theresa May as leader. DUP MPs may then back the government again within  days on the promise that May is leaving and a leadership election is under way. Eventhere is a general election, the Tories might just win and get back into office. Is it the same as a TORY no confidence vote   No. This is a completely dferent process. A Tory leadership challenge is triggered by  Tory MPs submitting letters to the chair of the backbench  Committee. Unlike government no confidence votes, which can be called multiple times , Tory no confidence votes can only be called once a year. Because Theresa May survived a Tory no confidence vote in December, another cant be called until December .  Technically yes, but the road to this is unclear. Its thought it would need the Leader of the Opposition to be sent for by the Queen to try and command support. There is no duty for this to happen automatically. And Labour have been clear their preference is to force a general election which could easily happen by letting the clock run out. Is there any other way to have a no confidence vote  Yes. The Commons Constitution Committee has decreed that the Fixed-Term Parliaments Act is NOT the only way to hold a confidence vote. If the government makes something a confidence issue, theres no -day clock - but its still treated as a confidence vote all the same. In both cases, the government either has to give up and allow a general election, or to retain the confidence of the House through a further, second vote.

With just  days left to Brexit, Theresa May has promised cross-party talks to find a way forward and amend her -page plan. But Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney said this morning: I dont think the EU is in any mood to change the Withdrawal Agreement signicantly at all. We dont even know what the ask is, well have to wait and see what theyre asking for. French president Emmanuel Macron insisted that Brussels was not prepared to move much further.He said the EU would look into improving the deal but suggested it had already reached the maximum compromise possible.We won’t, just to solve Britain’s domestic political issues, stop defending European interests, he said. EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier this morning told MEPs he will respond favourably - but onlyBritish red lines change.  Mr Barnier said he profoundly regrets that the deal he agreed lost by the biggest Commons majority in history. But he complained the failure was based on the red lines of the British Government. Addressing the European Parliament this morning, he said: If the United Kingdom chooses to let its red lines change in future, and that it takes this choice for its advantage of the ambition of going beyond a simple but not negligible free trade accord, then the European Union would be ready immediately to ... respondfavourably. Yet the EU has repeatedly said it wont reopen the actual -page deal or the backstop contained within it for fresh talks. The backstop is a key clause which would trap the UK under EU customs rules from theres no agreement to keep the Irish border open.  Tory Brexiteer Steve Baker said there was no way the backstop would survive a vote in the UK Parliament. Mr Barnier said the ball was firmly in the UKs court. It is up to the British authorities today or tomorrow to assess the outcome of this vote and up to the British Government to indicate how we are going to take things forward on March  to an orderly withdrawal, he said.   Theresa May has promised to speak to senior parliamentarians and make a statement on next steps by Monday night. In the meantime she is expected to survive a no confidence vote in the government at the hands of Jeremy Corbyn thanks to her DUP allies. But European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker said time was running out.   I urge the United Kingdom to clary its intentions as soon as possible, he said last night. Time isalmostup. Yet Commons Leader Andrea Leadsom today insisted she still didnt want to extend the March  date of Brexit. What we need to do is to find a way thatdeal or some part of it or an alternative deal that is negotiable can then be put to the European Union so that we will get this Brexit through by March , she told the BBC.

Now is the time to find out what UK parliamentarians want. In the meantime, the rights of citizens must be safeguarded. Ireland said it was the clear position of the European Union that Britains draft orce deal was not open for renegotiation, even after its crushing defeat. The Irish Government recalls the clear position of the European Council at its meeting of December  when it stated that the withdrawal agreement is not open for renegotiation.   This was restated in the joint letter from Presidents Tusk and Juncker to Prime Minister May yesterday, Dublin said in a statement. The Irish Government recognises, however, that a disorderly Brexit is a bad outcome for everyone, not least in Northern Ireland. It is not too late to avoid this outcome and we call on the UK to set out how it proposes to resolve this impasse as a matter of urgency. Irelands foreign affairs minister Simon Coveney said the Irish government regretted the outcome of the Westminster vote. Mr Coveney told RTE News: We regret the decision but were not hugely surprised by it. I think the predictions were consistent enough over the last few days that this would be a heavy defeat and so we now need to be patient and calm to allow this process in Westminster to take its course.

She unwittingly plotted her path to parliamentary defeat almost exactly two years ago, when she painted her withdrawal “red lines”. The Prime Minister delivered a speech at Lancaster House in January  outlining what she wanted a future relationship with the EU to look like. Yet it was made without consulting opposition MPs, the EU, Tory backbenchers or even her Cabinet.The UK would quit the single market and customs union and end free movement, the issue driving many to reject the EU at the June  referendum.  There would be no hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic, and Britain could sign trade deals around the globe. But in making this address, Mrs May threw away her one chance to unite a ided country, which voted by a majority of ,, to Leave. This stubborn leader made no attempt to craft a consensus and find out what could secure a Westminster majority. As Home Secretary, she had backed Remain at the referendum. On becoming PM, she felt she needed to demonstrate her Brexiteer credentials.That strategic misjudgment further alienated the ,, voters who opted to stay in the EU. But as well as fuelling Remainers’ disillusionment, she was building up Brexiteers’ hopes, unwilling to tell them compromise would be needed. It blew up spectacularly just after .pm today, as pro-EU MPs ganged up with hard Brexiteers to detonate her blueprint. The PM’s record shows she refused to listen, consult or learn as she went along. Secretive Mrs May had to be forced at every point to share information or give Parliament a say.   Campaigners had to take her to court so she would need MPs’ backing before Article  could be activated. She even tried to prevent last night’s “meaningful vote”. Opposition MPs resorted to an ancient parliamentary procedure to uncover Brexit impact assessments. The PM also resisted releasing key legal advice until forced to by MPs using the same arcane tactic. Whitehall frustration with Mrs May had been revealed weeks before her Lancaster House speech, when Britain’s ambassador to the EU resigned. Sir Ivan Rogers told staff: “We do not yet know what the Government will set as negotiating objectives for the UK’s relationship with the EU after exit.” Calls to activate Article , the mechanism for starting withdrawal from Europe, were growing louder. Once triggered, the clock on a two-year deadline for exit would begin ticking.Yet still no major discussions took place with the Cabinet about what sort of Brexit the Government would seek. The PM could not face it. Time after time she dodged confrontation, choosing instead to plough on alone.   On March , , despite warnings, she triggered Article  anyway. She assumed she would eventually reach agreement with Brussels, and failed to plan for a no-deal Brexit. Yet the PM enjoyed record popularity ratings as the Tories led Labour by as many as  points. This lured her into a needless snap election, despite repeatedly denying she would call one. Returning to Westminster after an Easter walking holiday with husband Philip, Mrs May announced a vote for June , . Experts predicted a -seat majority. But the Tories ran a dreadful campaign. Loyal, able ministers were sidelined as Mrs May visited tiny gatherings of Tory activists, repeating her dire “strong and stable” slogan.   She carelessly surrendered David Cameron’s hard-won,slim, majority from two years earlier, forcing her to seek a confidence-and-supply arrangement with the hardline DUP. Realising time was running out to come up with a Brexit plan, she finally started drawing up plans to put to the Cabinet. After a Brussels summit of EU leaders, including France’s Emmanuel Macron, ministers headed to the PM’s Chequers retreat, Bucks, on July  last summer. They were presented with Mrs May’s blueprint, which they agreed on.The next day, Brexit Secretary David Davis quit. Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson followed.Mrs May had failed to appreciate that compromises for Brexiteers would be easierthey could be made earlier. But, because she was too fearful to take them on when she had the authority and public support, she left it too late. New enemies were made.   Mrs May also seemed isolated at a Brussels summit last month, where she confronted EC President Jean-Claude Juncker after he accused the UK of being “nebulous” on Brexit. Though she survived a no-confidence vote that month, the seed of her deal destruction had been sown a year earlier, in December . Just before Christmas, she caved in to the EU’s border backstop arrangement for Northern Ireland so Brussels could say “sufficient progress” had been made for talks to move on. The DUP would never sanction the plan as Northern Ireland would be treated dferently from the rest of the UK, in a customs union with the EU under the terms of the backstop. This ghost of Christmas past is what came back to haunt the PM, something she knew was coming and which a better leader would have avoided.

The humiliated PM lost the vote on her EU plan by a staggering  majority that leaves Britain staring at a catastrophic no deal. After the crushing defeat – which followed two and a half years of botched negotiations with Brussels – Mr Corbyn launched a motion of no confidence in her shygovernment. It will be voted on at pm on Wednesday. But the stubborn PM refused to quit, despite the blow to her Brexit plans that left her stripped of all authority as MPs finally buried her deal.   Instead, she plans to resurrect it and try yet again to win over MPs before the next vote on Monday. Mr Corbyn branded Mrs May’s defeat “catastrophic” and said it represented an “absolutely shydecisive” verdict on her handling of Brexit. He added: “She is only attempting to reach out now to try to keep her failed process and deal alive after it’s been so roundly rejected by Parliament on behalf of the people of this country. “At every turn the Prime Minister has closed the door on dialogue. In the last two years she’s only had one priority…the Conservative Party. Her governing principle of delay and denial has reached the end of the line.”   Mr Corbyn’s no shyconfidence motion could force an early general electionit wins the support of more than % of MPs. But his hopes of winning were undermined when the DUP’s Sammy Wilson said the party’s  MPs will back Mrs May in her fight for survival. MPs voted  to  against her Brexit plans, which critics warned would leave us tied to the EU without any say on it. The huge Tory rebellion of  Tory MPs included fervent Brexiteers such as Boris Johnson and Jacob Rees-Mogg as well as leading Remainers Anna Soubry and Dominic Grieve. Her two former Brexit secretaries David Davis and Dominic Raab also voted against the deal. The -vote margin of defeat was the worst suffered by any government and in normal circumstances would be enough to force a PM from office.  But Mrs May made clear she plans to cling on, holding talks with MPs to find “genuinely negotiable” solutions she can take back to Brussels. She pledged to open cross-party talks with senior Labour MPs over the next few days to help save Brexit. But the invitation did not initially seem to extend to Mr Corbyn. And the PM appeared to rule out any dramatic changes to her deal with aides insisting it would form the basis of her Plan B. But she was last night looking increasingly boxed in with her Cabinet, her party and Parliament all urging her to change tack. Mrs May said: “The House has spoken and this government will listen. It is clear this House does not support this deal, but tonight’s vote tells us nothing about what it does support.” As noisy crowds gathered outside Westminster she promised to approach talks Tory backbenchers, the DUP and Labour MPs “in a constructive spirit” but Downing Street immediately set out her red lines for talks. No  sources appeared to rule out discussing a customs union, a key Labour demand thought likely to command a majority, saying the PM wanted an independent trade deal. They also played down expectations of her compromising over a second shyreferendum or extending article . Mrs May insisted she was not running down the clock to no deal. She added: “Every day that passes without this issue being resolved means more uncertainty, more bitterness and more rancour.”  But Labour MP Yvette Cooper said: “This was the biggest government defeat in over  years. “The PM says she now will listen and work cross-party but she had  months to do that and she repeatedly refused. “She cannot just carry on asnothing has changed.” Hilary Benn, Labour chair of the Brexit committee, added: “The PM says she is now going to reach out across the House of Commons, she could have done that two and a half years ago”.  But Attorney General Geoffrey Cox confirmed minimal changes were expected. He said: “This agreement will have to , in much the same form, with much the same content.” Remainer Tory minister Amber Rudd, backed by several Cabinet colleagues, led calls for the PM to reach out to Labour MPs to try to reach a compromise. Senior Labour figures indicated to the Mirror they could be open to shynegotiation. It emerged PM’s chief Brexit advisor, Olly Robbins, has been working on secret contingency plans for cross-party talks. Mrs May was urged her toto shyBrussels to demand more concessions EU chiefs warned the PM to “urgently” set out her plans as the clock was ticking down to Brexit. Eurocrat Jean-Claude Juncker said: “I note with regret the outcome of the vote in the Commons this evening. “I urge the UK to clary its intentions as soon as possible.

Despite all the talk of a nation ided, furiously riven over what to do about our membership of the EU - she’s actually managed to unite Britain’s most ardent Leavers and Remainers on one thing. They all hate her deal. I’m referring, of course, to the people gathering outside the Houses of Parliament to protest about Brexit - one way or another. In what is rapidly becoming the political equivalent of Henman Hill, hundreds of Remainers are gathering in the cold on Parliament Square across the road, to watch the result of the meaningful vote come in. It’s like a rubbish Eurovision.  Meanwhile, a bit further down the road, more EU flags are waving, but they’re peppered with the odd pro-Brexit banner. I spoke to Leavers and Remainers, backers of a People’s Vote and folk who fancy a hard Brexit on WTO terms. And I couldn’t find a single person who was there to back Theresa May’s deal. Kate, who works in the NHS, and Pete, a retired journalist, have been standing on the corner all day with a sign that says “Hoot for Brexit”. Kate says they they’ve had “hundreds” of cars passing them and honking their horn since they’ve been standing there - including what looked awfully like a ministerial car, which passed while we were chatting. Pete doesn’t like May’s deal because it doesn’t take us out of the single market or EU rules. “I’d be happy with no deal, so we can make our own deals as we go along,” he said. He reckons the problem was that the EU have been playing hardball, and Mrs May hasn’t.   Meanwhile, across the square, Charlie Rone, a -year-old from Charlton is dressed up as Jacob Rees-Mogg, complete with top hat and tails. He’s a regular protester outside Parliament, and alternates between the Mogg costume and a Robocop outfit. He changes daily because press photographers have confided that they wouldn’t snap himhe was in the same costume every day, because they still have the previous day’s photos for sale. And he’s not a fan of the PM’s deal either. He said: “I hope that the deal gets thrown out, because it’s a very, very bad deal because it cedes all our control away to the EU and it puts us into their hands.” As we were talking, a gentleman in a van slowed down at the pedestrian crossing to advise Charlie to take his top hat and “stick it where the sun don’t shine.”   There’s also a fellow walking around the area dressed as a plague doctor, complete with a black hook-nose mask, shouting “THE BELL TOLLS FOR THE DEATH OF BREXIT.” He declined to be interviewed, but gives off the distinct impression he wasn’t a fan of the PM’s withdrawal agreement. The atmosphere in Westminster tonight is noisy, but relatively amicable. People are arguing about Brexit in the street - but they’re doing it quite politely. There’s little evidence of the sinister, borderline fascistic displays of intimidation that has been much discussed in recent weeks, but it hasn’t entirely gone away.   Tucked away in a corner, next to a small band of pro-Brexiteers hammering drums and ringing a bell, I spotted a placard bearing the slogan “CUCK YOUR VOTE”, and telling “CONSPIRATORS” they were “CHEATING BRITAIN FOR BROWNSHIRT POINTS”. Alongside a picture of Theresa May, there’s a small tree with a noose in its branches. But largely it’s a festival atmosphere, where some of the angriest people in the country have come together to agree that the Prime Minister is rubbish.

Stephen Waterson, , was in the front passenger seat and allegedly pushed it back on Alfie Lamb twice in anger over the “noise and fuss” he was making. The three-year-old cried out “Mummy” in the shyrear footwell and made a choking noise, the court was told. Mum Adrian Hoare, , who was sat behind Alfie, is charged with manslaughter alongside Waterson. Driver Marcus Lamb, , and Emilie Williams, , also in the car, will give evidence.   Prosecutor Duncan Atkinson QC said Alfie died from crush asphyxia in February last year. He said: “It was caused by the passenger seat, Waterson’s seat, being moved further into the rear passenger-side footwell.  “In effect, he was squashed by the car seat and suffocated. “This was a deliberate action by Waterson who knew Alfie was there and was angered by the noise and fuss [he made].”  Medics and police were called in Croydon, South London, and Waterson and Hoare allegedly lied about what happened. Mr Atkinson said it was obvious Alfie had been dead for some time and CCTV showed all of them travelling in an Audi.   Hoare allegedly told medics: “We got in a taxi. He fell asleep. We tried to wake him and found him unresponsive.” She said the driver “kicked us out” and left. Mr Atkinson said it was “only the beginning of the lies”.

Heartbreaking footage shows Ashley on the garage forecourt before the freak accident, reports Kent Live. Emergency services rushed to the scene, where Mr King was sadly pronounced dead soon after.   The Health and Safety Executive said they have not been able to establish exactly how the tragedy happened. An inquest into his death was held at Archbishops Palace in Maidstone on Monday - with assistant coroner Katrina Hepburn ing a verdict of misadventure. A jury, sworn in to help Ms Hepburn come to her conclusion, was shown footage of Ashley working on the car.  Chris Marshall from Health and Safety Executivesaid: The front of the car had been jacked up, with axle stands placed underneath the car, before the jack was removed. “You can clearly see Mr King placing the stands and where they are placed in the footage. It doesn’t necessarily suggest that they are under a structural element of the vehicle. They are under the vehicle but it’s basically impossible to tell from the video whether they were under a structural element of the car.   “The image on the camera is of the jacked up [Ford Escort] and [Mr King] going around the side of it, the far side away from the camera. “The next time the CCTV is triggered, the car has fallen off the stands and is laying on the ground.” "},{"url":null,"title":"how meghan markle transformed party","story":"NewsHow Meghan Markle transformed party-loving Prince Harry with daddy detoxThe Duke of Sussex reportedly revealed he now practises meditation every day - a hobby that appears to have been inspired by we Meghan MarkleShareCommentsByDanya BazaraaNews Reporter:,  JAN Updated:,  JAN NewsMeghan revealed she is six months pregnant on a day out with Harry this week \"Get Royal Family updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailOnce a party-lover, Prince Harry appears to have transformed somewhat since meeting Meghan Markle - even revealing this week that he practises meditation. The Duke of Sussex is understood to be avoiding caffeine and alcohol to support the pregnant Duchess as part of a daddy detox. Harry, , has also reportedly become a yoga fan after being introduced by his we last year. And cigarettes are a thing of the past. According to reports, the father-to-be has started meditating every day, and people think this new pastime may have been inspired by his we. On the Duke and Duchesss first official engagement of the year on Monday, in Birkenhead, Prince Harry revealed his new hobby.   People claims Prince Harry chatted with a -year-old Buddhist monk named Kelsang Sonam in the Merseyside town, telling him about his daily meditation habit. Kelsang reportedly presented him with a copy of a book called  Steps to Happiness. Meghan, who announced shes six months pregnant on the day out, is also known to be a big fan of meditation.

She previously wrote: Last week marked the one year anniversary of my relationship with meditation, something I found endlessly daunting at first , but soon became the quietude that rocked my world. I cant put my finger on the why or the how, but I will tell you this much, for me...I am just happier. And meditation has so much to do with that. I urge you to give it a shot. The worst thing that can happen is that you gave yourself ten minutes of quiet in an endlessly loud world. Shhhhh......it feels good.

The yoga room is among a range of amendments the Duke and Duchess of Sussex are making to the house - previously five apartments used as staff quarters.

Stella Brown, , suffers from achalasia which affects the oesophagus and can mean the muscles cant contract properly. Swallowing can become near impossible with food and drink unable to pass through to the stomach and often being brought back up. Stella, from Leicester, said her disorder left her unable to swallow properly and in constant pain. Thankfully, after surgery her diet has been expanded, but Stella says for two years the only thing she was able to eat was Cadburys Creme Eggs. She told Leicestershire Live: To be honest, laugh or not - Cadburys Creme Eggs saved my le. They were the only food I could eat - odd I know but it is true. I had one one day and for some reason I could eat it and it just stayed down.   Speaking about how it all began, she said: It was really weird because I just woke up one day and I couldnt swallow. It got worse over the next two weeks and eventually I went to the hospital and they thought it was just a reflux and gave me some Gaviscon. Three weeks later, Stella said she was finding it almost impossible to keep water down, and was struggling to swallow anything at all. Everything started coming up, and I started to panic, she said. Theres not really any medication to ease the pain and I lost weight so much that Ive literally gone down to size  clothes. I was starting to get really depressed because of the weight that I had lost. I have had two operations to dilate my oesophagus just so I can swallow - which I struggle with every day.  At this point Stella claims doctors told her she only had a year to liveher condition did not improve. NHS guidelines say there is no cure to the disorder but certain treatments can help sufferers. These include medicine, surgery to stretch the oesophagus muscle, and botox injections into the ring of muscle to help it to relax. Stella has had two operations which have helped her. This surgery is called balloon dilation, and involves a balloon being inflated inside the oesophagus to help stretch the muscle so that people can swallow more easily. But Stella thinks herback to health is also down to the Cadburys Creme Eggs. She said: Before I started eating them I would faint a lot because I wasnt getting the energy I needed from food and would blackout. They saved my le. I carried one around with me wherever I went for two years. The symptoms, according to the NHS, are:choking and coughing fits heartburn chest pain repeated chest infections drooling of vomit or saliva gradual but signicant weight loss. Since having surgery, Stella says she can eat a bigger selection of foods, however she is still sick every day. Its dficult,I got to a restaurant, for example, I have to sit as close to the toilets as possible, just in case. And its not just her social le that has been affected. I want to go back to work, but because of my sickness it affects my ability to work, she told. I have volunteered at the council working in kitchens cooking for elderly and also on Goldhill Park a year ago, helping out in school holidays. But after my latest results in February I will see what lies ahead and try and get back into work when Im fully fit and healthy.

But for Cath Ascroft, it is a reality she has had to live through five times. After three miscarriages, a baby who was stillborn at  weeks, and tiny tot Hendrix who lived for just  hours after being born  weeks premature, heartbroken Cath had almost given up on having another child. But then her prayers were finally answered with the arrival of baby boy Phoenix, now eight months – all thanks to a plastic band. Cath, , says: “Losing five babies seems especially cruel, and it’s hard not to think of what we’ve lost. “At times the grief has been overwhelming. “Having Phoenix doesn’t take away from the loss – in some ways it makes it even more poignant to think about what might have been. “But we are just thankful for our little miracle.”   Cath and partner Jonny Hall, of Southport, shyMerseyside, chose their son’s name as a tribute to their NHSangel Dr Alice Bird, who made his birth possible. Dr Bird, consultant obstetrician and gynaecologist at Ormskirk Hospital in Lancashire, recommended rare keyhole surgery to place a synthetic band around the top of Cath’s cervix to prevent her going into premature labour again. Cath says: “The name Phoenix is a symbol of rebirth and hope for us – but also to honour Dr Bird, without whom our little boy wouldn’t be here.” Busy concentrating on her career as a shyjournalist, Cath admits babies were never on her radar until she got pregnant by accident and had elder son Marley, now eight. When Marley was two years old, Cath and Jonny, who runs a plumbing and electrical business, decided to extend their family and were overjoyed when a couple of months later Cath was pregnant again. Everything looked fine until the day before her -week scan when her waters broke in the middle of the night.  “Within hours I’d delivered my baby,” she says. “I was in shock. When they brought him to us, a perfect tiny baby boy wrapped in a blanket, I didn’t know how to feel. “I only held him for a short time, couldn’t process what had happened. “We didn’t even name him – this little boy who’d never even had a chance at le.” The couple had a funeral for the baby they had lost but struggled afterwards. Cath recalls: “It was so hard trying to carry on, going back into work to see all the sympathetic faces, struggling to find words to explain to Marley that there was no baby.” Apart from Cath being a carrier of the common Group B Strep infection, there was no explanation why it had happened, and they were told there was no reason not to try again. Five months later, Cath discovered that she was pregnant but at  weeks she miscarried. “I tried to brush it off and pretend it hadn’t bothered me, taking one day off before going back to work,” she says.  Have you been affected by the issues in this story  Email webnews@trinitymirror The following year she found she was pregnant again. It was dficult not to panic, but the scans all looked normal. And after  weeks into the pregnancy, Cath and Jonny felt confident enough to tell Marley he was going to be a brother. But two weeks later Cath started to bleed heavily. “When we arrived at Ormskirk Hospital, my cervix was cm dilated,” she says. “It seemed hopeless. At  weeks shypregnant the baby surely couldn’t survive. Lying in my hospital bed I met Dr Alice Bird. I remember her askingI knew what the likely outcome would be and me replying that I’m probably going to lose the baby. “She said, ‘We aren’t quite there yet’.” Dr Bird said they could sew Cath’s shycervix shut in the hope it would hold long enough for the baby to have a chance of survival. Cath went for the surgery and was given steroid injections to strengthen her son’s tiny lungs. She was also confined to bed rest. But at  weeks she went into labour and attempts to stop the contractions failed.   Their baby boy, Hendrix, was delivered and Cath only caught a glimpse of him before he was rushed to a special care baby unit. H e weighed just lb. Within hours of being born, Hendrix had shydeteriorated rapidly. “That was the worst moment of my le,” says Cath. “We stood watching as his vitals dropped and then they disconnected all his tubes and passed him to me. We watched him die in our arms – this perfect little baby we should have been taking home.” “The staff were so supportive, giving us as much time as we wanted to spend with Hendrix, taking tiny prints of his hands and feet to go in a memory box for us. “Marley took it particularly hard. He had gone to school a proud big brother, but by the time he came home he wasn’t. “The next few months were a blur. That second funeral was heartbreaking – he was in the tiniest of coffins. But we had close family and friends to support us.” Jonny and Cath resigned shythemselves to the fact they would never have another baby, but once again Dr Bird gave them a glimmer of hope. She had found a rare keyhole surgery that could be done at St Mary’s Hospital in Manchester. She believed a permanent band called a transshyabdominal cerclage could be tied around Cath’s cervix to keep it shut. She had the surgery and after  months became pregnant. Dr Bird was the first person she contacted, and despite being on maternity leave, she took charge of Cath’s case and booked her in for a scan. But the baby had failed to grow and Cath had to undergo surgery to have the foetus removed.  At , Cath knew her chances of conceiving were growing slimmer. Just as she had given up hope, she got shypregnant again in , and went into a panic. Once again Dr Bird was with her every step of the way. “She scanned me every two weeks, which was the only thing I had to hold on to. Alice and my midwe Linda Bishop were there for me all the way through.” Cath’s caesarean was planned for  weeks, and Phoenix was delivered by Dr Bird, who says: “Cath and Jonny showed unbelievable bravery. “I was delighted to deliver Phoenix.” Cath adds: “The moment I saw him will stick with me for ever, the smile on Alice’s face as she held him up. I’m not sure which of us was the most relieved. “Dealing with the years of loss and grief has been overwhelming at times, has left me a totally dferent person than I was before. “But thanks to Alice and the amazing NHS, we got our longed-for gt of le.” A Just Giving Page is raising funds for Ormskirk Maternity and Neonatal Unit.

Police in Malaga, Spain, insist they are working on the basis Julen Rosello is still alive, although privately officials have admitted the chances he will have survived what could be around  hours underground are slim. Spanish government officials say Julen’s mother and father face a near -hour agonising wait for news on whether their son can be saved. Parents Jose and Vicky, both , have spent day and night near the spot where Julen vanished down a -inch borehole as his dad prepared a Sunday lunchtime paella on land near Totalan a -minute drive from the Costa del Sol capital of Malaga. And today authorities have confirmed they have found hair belonging to Julen in the well. It was found on Sunday night but the find was only made public today following DNA tests.   A central government representative for the region said: “A little bit of hair was found in the well and the tests that have been carried out show it’s the little boy’s. “It gives us that a level of certainty that the boy is there, in that well.” A Swedish firm which helped locate the  Chilean miners rescued in  after  days underground joined the massive operation to try to locate Julen. Civil Guard officers leading the operation have not yet spotted the youngster on a rotating camera lowered into the borehole on a robot, spotting only a bag of sweets and a plastic cup by a blockage of sand and earth ft down the ft hole. Today work was continuing on the excavation of two new tunnels which officials yesterday afternoon said would take around two days to complete.   One is a vertical hole running parallel to the existing well and the other is a horizontal tunnel being dug across the hillside in the direction of the well Julen is trapped in. Mine rescue experts flown in from Asturias in northern Spain plan to excavate the last part of the ft-long horizontal tunnel by hand after the introduction of a camera rescuers hope will be able to pinpoint Julen along with specialist equipment used in the Chilean mining miracle. Julen’s three-year-old brother Oliver died in May  after suffering a heart attack believed to have been linked to a congenital heart defect.  His dad, recalling the moment he realised Julen had disappeared down the borehole as he prepared lunch with friends and relatives including a cousin, told a Spanish TV programme: “I was putting some more wood on for the fire and ran towards him. “My cousin was a bit nearer and threw herself on the ground as I reached the orice. “He had already gone. I heard him cry at first but then I didn’t hear him cry anymore.”  Fighting back tears in an emotional message to his son, he said: “The only thing I can say is ‘Stay calm Julen. Daddy loves you and your brother is going to help us.’” In an interview with Malaga-based paper Sur he added: “My we went to phone into work to let them know she wasn’t going. “She was with Julen and asked me to keep an eye on him as she made the call. He was only a few feet away. “I went to get a couple of logs for the fire for the paella and he began to run. “We saw how he fell down the hole, my cousin more than me because she was closer.” He also confirmed to the paper that the borehole had been made by a prospector at the request of his cousin’s boyfriend but no water had been found. The prospector has told police he complied with the law by sealing the hole after it was made but Julen’s family insist it had simply been covered with stones that weren’t properly laid.

The majestic creatures were cruelly attacked by locals in eastern India, prompting an outcry from animal rights activists around the world. Disturbing images, taken in Bishnupur, show the panicked animals fleeing as residents hurled flaming sticks and chased them with batons to deter them from damaging properties. Reports claim that deforestation has forced the confused animals into areas inhabited by humans. Other heartbreaking photos show a group of elephants attempting to navigate a railway line which runs straight through their habitat. In another image, the herd are pelted with rocks. The shocking pictures have angered animal rights activists around the world. They have called for more to be done to protect elephants from encroaching deforrestation.  Photographer Biplab Hazra, who captured the attack, has demanded an end to the destruction of the elephant habitats in the area. He told Caters: “This happens because the villagers have to save their crops. “There are many elephant corridors in human habitations. I’m trying to show this and spread my photos to increase public awareness on the matter.”Last year, footage emerged of a man being trampled to death by a wild elephant in Sri Lanka as his distraught family watched on.The man jumped out of his car in Kataragama, near Yala National Park, in a bid to stop the elephant and hypnotise it. But his trick spectacularly failed when the huge animal turned and ran towards him, knocking him to the ground as he tried to get away.The elephant then lts one of its rights leg and tramples him, crushing him to death immediately.

After last season, everyone expected a struggle but when they came in expectations changed to possibly a top-seven finish.“Up until October that was probably on the cards but they’ve dropped like a stone since, though that’s not to do with Davies. When he’s played he’s been excellent.”Quickly after signing for his boyhood club Pools in the summer, Davies was made club captain – a role he performed with distinction at Ross County, too – but Kennedy says Hartlepool’s loss will be Dundee’s gain.“He’s played for some good clubs and Dundee fans can look forward to him putting his head or whatever in where it hurts,” he added.“He’s somebody who plays for the badge and is a real battler, aggressive and whole-hearted.“Getting  games from him might be the dference between staying up and going down for Dundee.“Going away to a tough place like Aberdeen or Hearts or Hibs and you need somebody to head away every ball and give everything to win, he’s your man.“That’s something Hartlepool never had last season and I’m disappointed they’ve lost him for his leadership.“He’s a real leader and they’ll miss his presence around the place.“He was brilliant at times in the National League. It’s a really physical league, every team has massive strikers and lots play route one and he’s perfect for that.“He’s got such a good leap and there weren’t many better defenders in the league than him.”As well as a leader, Dundee have signed themselves a fighter – something that can get the better of him every now and then.“He loves a battle but lets it spill over a bit sometimes, which is the down side.“He got sent off at Wrexham after half an hour for nutting somebody and they got beat –he’s only playing  games or so then Dundee can’t be having him suspended and missing games.“You take that side away totally, though, and he’s not half the player.“He plays right on the edge but I’d be surprisedthere’s anybody in the Premiership will beat him in the air.“He’s also clever with his positioning so doesn’t get caught out by pace too much – he was the best defender in the National League because of that.“He’ll crank it up in training and will be putting the foot in when required when some wouldn’t and might just spark something in others.“Jim McIntyre knows him andhe’s looking for somebody with a nasty streak, they’ve picked the right man.”"},{"url":null,"title":"andy dales to join dundee but another signing needed after andrew davies blow","story":"Jim McIntyre was boosting his Dundee squad with the arrival of English winger Andy Dales yesterday but is set to resume his search for a centre-half after injury fears over another new signing Andrew Davies was confirmed.Twenty-four-year-old Dales was due at Dens for training yesterday morning after the Dark Blues agreed a deal with Scunthorpe.The former Derby kid can play on either flank and also in a central role.After  years in the youth ranks at the Rams, Dales stepped down to non-league football before moving to Scunthorpe last summer.

This tax relief would be beneficial as they moved forward with the new stadium project.#In January , the club owners informed the Supporters Society of their intention to proceed with the acquisition of the %+ shareholding in the club through the share issue, as previously discussed.#The share issue is a y and costly exercise for the club. The sole motivation of the owners is to offset the losses of the club against any gains made by Dark Blue Property Holdings.#The club met with the appropriate solicitors to discuss this matter over the following months in order to move the process forward.#In July  the Supporters Society enquired whether within this process they could move their class rights associated with the ‘A’ shares into a shareholding agreement.#The owners of the club took into consideration this request, as taking on the Society shares would save time and money needed for the share issue process, and therefore began negotiations in good faith to purchase the ‘A’ shares from the Society.#The acquisition of the ‘A’ shares has potential benefits for both sides, and while the negotiation of the finer details has yet to transpire, one such benefit is that the club could operate in a more commercial manner, which would allow for idends to be paid. This could also allow for greater investment into the club.#It is disappointing to see that the Society has chosen not to make it clear that at no time has the merging of the Dundee clubs ever been discussed in any of these meetings, nor has it ever been contemplated by the owners of the club.#The owners of the club will continue to take informed and proactive decisions that are best suited for Dundee Football Club.#"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/01/5c3c74dfcf9c70.25745917.jpg ","title":"dundee people there is nothing else like this farmshop in dundee","story":"This butchery is a cut above the rest with a passion for its craft and sourcing quality Scottish produce.The Butcher The Baker was opened in December  by Jonathan Clark, who is also part of the Clarks Bakery business, on Anfield Road in the city’s West End.The massive butchery features high quality meats, with the whole production process on display, and also an extensive range of wines, gins and beers which have been sourced from mostly all Scottish companies with the exception of a few beers.Operations manager, Dan Bunce, has been at the business for the past year and prides his role in the “farmshop in the city”.He said: “There is nothing  like The Butcher The Baker in Dundee.“Farm shops aren’t accessible to everyone so we wanted to create an environment which is bringing that feeling to the city.“Although we have that farm shop style and are doing everything a bit dferently, we do not bump prices up. We offer very competitive prices for fantastic meat and other produce.“All of our meat is from Aberdeen Angus cattle and we only use female heffers so we know we are providing incredible quality.”Butchery director, David Webster, has the trade in his blood and has followed in his father, grandfather and great grandfather’s footsteps by becoming a butcher.David said: “It has always been in my blood. I have worked in ious roles such as accountancy through the years, but I was always meant to be a butcher.“My great grandfather opened Webster’s Butchers on Blackness Road in  which continued to my grandfather and then my dad.

It’s been nice to see dferent generations of families.”After learning of the move, pupils at the school wrote a poem about the famous old school which, teachers say, helped to showcase all that was good about the place.Ms Heffell added: “The words in the poem sum up the feelings everyone has for their old school – it is more than bricks and glass.“It’s people – present, future, past.“We’re moving on but I know I’ll take this school wherever I go in the future.”One prominent former pupil is Lieutenant Hugh McKenzie, who was killed in action in Flanders near Passchendaele in October .He had a plaque in his honour in the former building.At one point Rosebank was being considered as the possible site for the new women’s custody unit, however it will be built on the site of Our Lady’s Primary instead."},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/01/5c3dee142315e3.60120202.jpg ","title":"tom duthie dundee united need to sign another out and out striker","story":"Two of the three signings Dundee United have made in this transfer window, as manager Robbie Neilson looks to add the quality he feels he needs to win automatic promotion, have been attack-minded in the shape of Aidan Nesbitt and Cammy Smith.And it should come as no surprise the manager will continue to work to bolster his attack between now an the end of the month by adding another central striker to his options.Although the Tangerines’ narrow victory over Dunfermline last weekend saw them close the gap to Championship leaders Ross County to just three points, not lost on Neilson will be the fact the three points taken from the Pars clash was only his team’s second win in their last seven.During that run, only once have United, in the pre-Christmas victory over Falkirk, scored more than a single goal, highlighting the need for a player to be found who can provide a more frequent goal supply than has been forthcoming of late.If Nicky Clark, the man who got the weekend winner against one of his former clubs, stays fit, it’s fair to assume he will hit the back of the net frequently.A proven scorer, particularly at this level, hisof six goals in  appearances since joining up in the summer represents a pretty decent goals-to-game ratio.The issue for the -year-old has been getting on the pitch.Injury problems mean he has missed almost half the games so far andyou take into account the number of times when, like last Saturday, he’s only been fit enough for the bench, more than half United’s game time this season has been without him.As well as reduce the goal threat, his absences have given the manager a tactical headache.Since early on in his time in charge, Neilson has said he would like to be able to go with the option of playing two out-and-out central strikers.More often than not, though, on-loan Pavol Safranko has had to be used in that role on his own.And as much as his admirable work ethic has made the Slovakian a firm favourite with both gaffer and fans, his promising start at Tannadice, in terms of goals, has now faded. That’s a worry.Seven goals in his first  games after arriving from Danes Aalborg in August suggested the man to get the goals to fire them to promotion had been found.The last seven games, with just one strike to his credit, have dampened such expectations.And while that work he puts in when up front, often on his own, means he continues to be a vital cog in the wheel for the team, there is little question he’d benefit from a regular strike partner.Of course, the arrival of Nesbitt and Smith should help ease the burden on whoever is right up front but only to a degree.Both are capable of chipping in with goals but a good chunk of the work they do is likely to be in creating chances as opposed to taking them.Putting more goals in the team would also ease the pressure on the defence.While the back four have been leaking too many goals this season, they’ve too often taken to the pitch knowing the loss of just one goal may well see a point or points dropped.That’s why the next couple of weeks will see Neilson, presumably backed by new owner Mark Ogren’s money, pull out all the stops to find another quality striker.Particularly in this transfer window, that’s usually easier said than done.If he succeeds and United are back in the top flight come the end of the season it would have been well worth the effort."},{"url":null,"title":"mcdonalds-launches-veggie-happy-meals-as-greggs-sells-vegan-sausage-rolls","story":"MCDONALDrsquoS restaurants across Glasgow have launched their first-ever vegetarian

this curious looking head-gear be the worldrsquos earliest surviving example of a Glengarry-style bonnet once worn by Highlander clansmen after the act of Proscription banned Highland dress That is the belief of relentless researcher Robert Harbord who is spurring-on staff at Inverness Museum to help solve the mystery.Being Oxford-based and an avid Highland visitor, Mr Harbord is perplexed by the bonnet which nestles inconspicuously behind glass in a cabinet in the museum building.And his task in hand is no mean feat: He wants to track down the inidual who unearthed it more than  years ago ndash or at least speak to one of their surviving relatives.Because he believes the bonnet is unique.He said: ldquoDespite their very best efforts, and their best record-keeping going back to , Inverness Museum does not have any other information on this particular item other than it was found in a peat bog in Fort Augustus pre-s.\"Its origins are a complete mystery.ldquoMy hope is that an article in the Courier might stimulate someone who does know more about its origins to come forward.Research shows bonnets in the lead up to the Battle of Culloden were knitted affairs, large, wide and flat.Insight into the crucial role they once played has been handed down by many historical sources but none so colourfully than the thcentury government roads contractor Edmund Burt who was sent to Inverness from London in the s.Remarking upon the Highlanderrsquos hardened stance to the wet weather in his letters to a friend, Burt, in his book Letters from the North of Scotland said their bonnets were ldquofrequently taken off and wrung like a dish-clout, and then put back on again.Mr Harbord said his research suggests that following the Act of Proscription in  banning Highland dress, clansmen pushed the sides of their bonnets upwards \"and at a stroke created an entirely new shape of bonnet\".And he strongly suspects that the Glengarry-style bonnet in Inverness Museum could be the earliest surviving example.He added: ldquoWhile the word bonnet was not actually mentioned in the Act, it can well be imagined that a clansman from Glen Garry, travelling to the strategically sited Fort Augustus six miles away, might think thathe was spotted by an Army patrol wearing a Highlanderrsquos traditional flat blue bonnet, he could very well be arrested, and jailed for six months, on the spot.Museum curator xxx apologies her name is in the caption of the pictures xxx said no information exists to argue otherwise.She said: ldquoWe think that it came to us before . Therersquos no record showing where this bonnet came from other than what is said on the label and all that says is it was found in a bog at Fort Augustus.ldquoMr Harbord thinks it might be the earliest surviving example and that seems perfectly feasible. If it does turn out to be the oldest one then that would make it a very signicant object.

end of this month, Lewis hopes the Reds have won the battle to retain their international stars.Captain Shinnie and winger Mackay-Steven are both out of contract at the end of the season and have been free to talk to other clubs since the winter window opened on January .Boss McInnes wants to secure both on extended deals, but admits he faces a fight to do that.MLS side New York City, part of the City Group Football franchise that also owns Manchester City, have targeted Mackay-Steven.The American side contacted the Dons while they were at a training camp in Dubai to inform them of their

Local girls Jasmine McPhie and Carla Todd were both key players in Rangers Girls triumphant run in the Girls Under  Scottish Cup.In their run to the final, Rangers played the top four under  girls teams in Scotland beating Aberdeen - in the first round, then Hamilton - and Central Girls - in rounds two and three. A quarter-final tie against Glasgow City saw the Rangers Girls win - to set up an old firm semi-final against Celtic Girls in which the Rangers Girls emerged - winners in a close game.The final was played on Saturday November  at the Oriam Performance Centre in Edinburgh. In a competitive match, Rangers started strong but Hibernian began to come into the game and whilst both sides had chances, the score remained - at half time. In the second half, Rangers took the lead in  minutes but three minutes later Hibernian drew level.There were few chances in the remainder of the second half and at full time both teams were level at -.

Invited to join Cameron up at the Cruachan dam for the second of his two recent programmes, I was delighted to tramp the mighty mountain with Scotland’s Number one authority on outdoor pursuits.As an author and broadcaster, Cameron always has an eye on a good story, and so as well as asking me about the lack of health and safety regulations at the time the hydro project was being built, he also wanted to knowthere really was a murder during the construction. There was, as I told him, a body – but the body wasn’t identied, no arrests were made, no court case took place.It would be a shamethat construction period went down in history as an invasion of , workmen – #Tunnel Tigers# as they were dubbed – into one of Argyll#s most beautul settings and a possible murder.My book was intended to give the story of the local people whose lives were punctuated by this ambitious construction project. Quite rightly, those Tunnel Tigers had been lauded in a number of publications. The work that was done hollowing out Argyll’s highest mountain to provide electricity for the nation was amazing.The plan for Cruachan – as for the other major hydro projects of the post World War II era – was conceived by Tom Johnston, to whom I dedicated my book. Johnston was a politician who remained true to his ideals of bringing rural Scotland into the modern world. There was no power in the Highlands, and without power there could be no industry and no prosperity. The engineering genius was Sir Edward MacColl, whose biographer Norrie Fraser called him #a maker of modern Scotland#.Cruachan was the first reversible pumped-storage system in the world. During its years of construction from  to , eminent international engineers visited the project to see how the water was pumped between two reservoirs through reversible turbine generators. At off-peak hours, the water was – is # pumped back up to the reservoir you see high up in the corrie above Loch Awe, held back by a dam that is now so much a part of our landscape. The loch itself is the lower reservoir.I had imagined that the scale of such a project – using Scotland’s top engineering companies who shipped in workers from other parts of the UK and Europe – would have been a cause for resentment and protest by local people.That, of course, failed to take account of the vision of the folk of Dalmally, Lochawe, and Taynuilt. Although it took men with engineering experience to blast the  miles of tunnels, hollow out the mountain itself, and construct the dam, there was also a need for a support army. There were clerks and porters, joiners and caterers, folk willing to let out a room, a caravan, a house, serve in a pub where just occasionally it was necessary to keep a baseball bat behind the bar to maintain bonhomie. The project kick started careers, fortunes and marriages, and gave the area good roads and a tourist industry.If you haven’t visited the hollow mountain or walked Cruachan’s slopes, make  the year you do.[In bold please] Cruachan: The Hollow Mountain is available from the Argyll Book Centre in Lochgilphead and all good book shops, along with Marian Pallister#s other books of local interest.PICS:The Pass of Brander before work started. no_aCruachanLe before the project # the Loch Awe Hotel with steamers. no_aCruachanThe Queen opening the project in October . no_aCruachanWorking on the  miles of tunnels. no_aCruachanWorking on the road to the dam, overlooking Loch Awe. no_aCruachan"},{"url":null,"title":"now ewe see him the mystery of tarberts rambling ram","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowA four-legged Houdini running free around an Argyll fishing village has had local people flocking to social media channels.A rogue sheep # a maleof the Scottish blackface breed # was first spotted loose near Tarbert Golf Club around New Year#s Day.There followed a number of sightings around the Loch Fyne village of the scarlet-painted pimpernel, ranging from the harbour side to the Campbeltown road.He was even spotted near Tarbert Parish Church on Sunday January , though it is not clear whether he joined the flock.One Tarbert resident commented: #It#s like now ewe see him, now ewe don#t.#The woolly wanderer#s fun was curtailed early the following week when he was captured and taken to a nearby farm.As the tup sheepishly set off for more secure accommodation, it seemed the online jokers# fun was at an end # puns involving  #ewe#, #horns#, #mint sauce# and even some unfair references to certain football fans were all the rage on Facebook.But that was that, the sheep was gone.

Plans to buy council-owned Dam Park are at an advanced stage. The club, currently top of the Tennent’s Premiership, hope the bold switch will take them to the next level. Ayr would earn a multi-million pound jackpot by hiving off their own land for housing, with builder Cala Homes believed to be preferred bidder for the site. And they plan to use part of the cash for a pound, synthetic surface to be laid at their new home. Club chiefs have spent the last year in talks over a move and hope to seal the deal soon.  If the switch is rubber-stamped by South Ayrshire Council Ayr could be playing out of Dam Park as early as . One source said: “It is the move that makes sensethe club is to continue growing. “Next season sees the start of the Super Six set-up with games to be broadcast live on television. “It is potentially a great  for Ayr and bringing the club into the heart of the town can benefit so many.” The switch would see Ayr Seaforth Athletic Club on the move to a new sporting centre planned for Craigie. And junior side Whitletts Victoria couldto the heart of their community with a revamp of the old activity complex on the cards. Ayr rugby supremo Billy McHarg said talks on the move are progressing well.  He said: “Discussions to this point have been positive. “We’re keen to work with all parties to find the right solution and one which will benefit the whole town. “We feel that Ayr Rugby Club coming into the town centre would be a big step forward.” Club members would still have to approve such a move. Ayr have been at scenic Millbrae since . Prior to that they played out of Newton Park, Dam Park, the Old Racecourse and King George V playing fields. Whitletts chairman John Dalton said: “Talks have been very positive and we are currently looking at alternative options. “The football park at Whitletts is the obvious route to go down and would represent ahome to our roots. “A lot of water is still to go under the bridge but as Ayr’s junior football club we are viewing this as a positive opportunity.” Craigie councillor Ian Cavana said: “It may be that a deal is close but nobody will be moving anywhere until the new sports centre at Craigie is up and running. “Work is due to start on that next summer and that’s when we should see real progress.” A council spokesman said: “Discussions on the future of Dam Park are ongoing.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr NewsAyrAyr Rugby"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article13859701.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_JS171103908.jpg","title":"ayr united fans chance sleep","story":"NewsAyr United fans have chance to sleep on Somerset Park in homeless fundraiserThe fundraiser, being staged by Ayr United and homeless charity SeAscape, will be held under the lights at Somerset Park.ShareByStuart Wilson:,  JAN Updated:,  JAN NewsAyr stars Robbie Crawford, Andy Murdoch, Craig Moore and Declan McDaid join Ky Kane of SeAscape \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailAyr United fans dream of playing on Somerset Park’s hallowed turf.

The document added: “The prospects of securing a bulky goods retailer to occupy the whole unit are extremely limited. “Sub-ision of the unit is the only viable option to secure tenants.” Ediston is waiting for a decision from the council on whether food can be sold from the space.

And a court ruled there was ‘a substantial sexual element to his breach of the peace offence. Ross McKay, , insisted he was innocent of the sordid behaviour. But Sherf John Montgomery told him: “Your defence is absurd . ‘It wasn’t me. It wasn’t my car’. “There is overwhelming evidence it WAS you, in YOUR car. You’re guilty all day long.” The sherf heard evidence from neighbours in Ayr’s Peggieshill Road who saw McKay in a four-wheel drive vehicle near Belmont Academy. Gary Cornelius, , saw McKay taking sneak pictures with his phone – every time schoolgirls walked by. He took a note of the car’s registration number and called the police. Mr Cornelius said: “It was obvious he was taking photos of every single girl who passed.” This incident occurred in mid  – and Mr Cornelius was shocked to see McKay’s vehicle outside his house again, on March , . Neighbour Paul Cunningham, , also identied McKay on this occasion. Mr Cornelius went to the school where he told a police officer what he had witnessed. Police later seized McKay’s phone and found images of schoolgirls in miniskirts. McKay admitted it was his phone but said he had not taken the pictures. He claimed: “I am aware of a client, just before I retired, who could have done this.” Sherf Montgomery asked: “You mean someone who didn’t like you put them there.” “Yes, but I can’t substantiate it,” replied McKay. “So, it’s a frame-up job – that’s your position ” asked depute fiscal Ed Sheeran. Someone’s in a car with the same registration as yours  Is Mr Cornelius in on the fit-up  Is Mr Cunningham  That’s thoroughly ridiculous,” Mr Sheeran concluded. McKay acknowledged driving in Peggieshill Road on March  but insisted he never stopped or took the pictures. He said he was on his was from the Ayrshire Archives at Auchincruive and the Tesco Express in Ayr’s Maybole Road. Defence lawyer Gillian McBlane pointed to ‘a degree of doubt’ over identication and dates. But after hearing the trial, Sherf Montgomery was in no doubt that McKay was guilty. A report will be compiled on McKay, of Ardlochan Terrace in Maidens, before he is sentenced on February . He has been placed on the Sex Offenders’ Register.

We now look forward to the merriment of Hogmanay! These days in between, traditionally known as the Daft Days, are my favourite of Yule time.Yet not so long ago the most popular focus of festivity was neither Christmas nor even Hogmanay, it was Handsel Monday.It fell upon the first Monday after New Year, although there was some dispute as to the exact Monday it should be celebrated, for some measured the date by the old calendar.This was the case for the country folk in East Lothian, or Haddingtonshire as it was then known. So Auld Handsel Monday fell for them on the first Monday after January .It was the country folkrsquos winter holiday because Christmas and Yule festivities had for so long been banned by the Kirk.The word Handsel apparently comes from an old Saxon word which means to give by hand.On Handsel Monday the family gathered together and shared gts and social time, which for much of the th century remained the main winter festival of the rural poor in East Lothian.The East Lothian writer and poet James Lumsden captured the atmosphere of this now forgotten holiday in one of his poems about the day.He tells us the children would wake up all excited, and the merriment would begin as the dawn of this winterrsquos day heralded a special time of conviviality and reunion:ldquoBy screich o morn the bairns are up,\"And loud the auld folk rousin\"What braws are donnd, what sangs are connd,\"What daffin an carousin!\"It was a time when family members made huge efforts tohome and celebrate together. Food had been specially kept for the occasion and those at home awaited the arrival of others who they had perhaps not seen since the previous Handsel Monday.Lumsden says streams of young folk left the towns for their homes in the countryside. Domestic servants, shop assistants, apprentices all set off in the early hours on Handsel Monday ason a pilgrimage, to share in the celebrations:ldquoSune ran we hame wi anxious haste\"For our grand Hansel denner,\"Pork chops and dumplins ndash lord a feast ndash\"A gorge for saunt or sinner!We can picture the scene as daughters and sons ed, greeted by parents and younger siblings, grandparents and old friends. It was a time of gt giving, with family and neighbours sharing treats.But the rich were expected to give too, as it was the tradition that masters and employers would give gts of drink, food and even a financial contribution to the communityrsquos festivities. In fact, the social norms were often overturned on this day, with the landowners serving and working for the poor on this one special day.While it had no religious content, Handsel Monday was in its own way sacred. It was a longed for day off for those who worked hard with little in the way of holidays. It was Christmas Day, Boxing Day and Hogmanay all wrapped into one.And as the day wore into evening, the merriment would build. People made the most of this precious social time together, with stories, dance and song:ldquoSyne sune wi reels, an strathspeys even,\"The wee cot housie dirled,\"As a the blasts o yearth an heaven\"Were gainst its boukie hurled\"Braw lads and lasses lap and skirled.As is always the case with such gatherings, time flew and too soon the day would draw to a close:ldquoBut daffin jigs, an sangs, an tales,\"Sped far too swith the hours on.Sad farewells would have to be made. Mothers and fathers hugged tightly their grown children as they prepared to set off back to their employment.

This apple is magic and is found at the top of a tall ancient tree, which grows deep in a dark forest.ldquoTo get to the tree first you must find your way through the forest. Then you will come to a circular clearing, where there are no trees except the ancient tall apple tree.ldquoThis tree grows in the middle of the clearing and its single fruit, the apple of your dreams, can be seen on its topmost branch.The storyteller looked round his audience.ldquoWill you try to reach it and pick it to make your dream come true  he asked.The children all answered yes.ldquoThen first you must decide what your dreams are.ldquoBe rich, was a common response. The storyteller smiled and nodded: ldquoYes we all have dreams of being rich, but rich in what  Rich in love and happiness, or rich in money and things ldquoItrsquos the same, said one child. ldquoI donrsquot think it is, said another, looking at the storyteller. ldquoIs it ldquoThat is a good question, replied the storyteller, ldquofor sure having too little money is not a good thing. And the world is an unfair place where those who have too much money and too many things keep it to themselves, so those who have too little money never get their fair share, even though there is sufficient for everyone to have enough.ldquoSo I want to be one of those that has too much! declared one member of the class, to laughter.ldquoAndso would you share what you have with others who do not have enough  asked the storyteller.The child paused for a moment for thought: ldquoMaybe some of it.Other children voiced dferent opinions. ldquoIrsquod keep it all, ldquoIrsquod share it, ldquoIrsquod give some to my family and friends.It created some discussion amongst the children.The teacher was going to ask the children to be quiet and listen to the storyteller, but he indicated he was happy with what was happening.ldquoBut then yoursquod end up being poor again, said one. ldquoNo, Irsquod not give it all away.ldquoBut the whole point of being rich is that you can do what you want.ldquoWell, it also means you can help other people.The storyteller listened to the debate for a minute or two, then he beat his drum to regain the childrenrsquos attention.ldquoAnd so, for most here, money will be your dream. I understand that. Nobody wants to be poor. But lots of money is not really your dream.A chorus of: ldquoYes it is!ldquoNo, replied the storyteller, ldquomoney is not your dream, it is what you spend it on, what it might make possible for you that you do not have now, that would be your dream. That is what you must think of before you set out on your quest.ldquoBecauseyou pick the apple of your dreams, but have no dreams for your le, then you will still be poor, evenyou have all the money in the world.ldquoThatrsquos just stupid, said one boy. The teacher was quick to remind him not to be rude, but the storyteller asked him: ldquoWhat is stupid ldquoWhat yoursquove just said, you canrsquot be pooryou are rich, that doesnrsquot make sense. Thatrsquos what I meant is stupid.The storyteller smiled. ldquoPerhaps you are right, but do you think sometimes people can also be poor in things that money canrsquot buy There was silence for a moment. Then a girl said: ldquoYou mean people can be poor in dreams for their le The storyteller smiled and nodded.ldquoPrecisely, said the storyteller. ldquoThe whole issue of getting rich has stopped us thinking about what our dreams actually are.ldquoI want to be a dancer, said one child. ldquoI want to drive fast cars, said another.ldquoI still want to be rich so I donrsquot have to do anything and just play computer games.ldquoI want to make the computer games, said his friend. ldquoYeah, me too, agreed his pal.ldquoI want to be the President! another said.ldquoI just want to be happy!The storyteller beat his drum again.ldquoAnd so before you set off on your quest you must think about your dreams. And let me tell you that dreams can be shared too.ldquoHowrsquod you do that  he was asked.The storyteller thought for a moment: ldquoWell, for some their dream may be to save an animal that is in danger of being extinct.ldquoOr save the planet, called out another.ldquoThatrsquos why I want to be President.ldquoSo I want you to think about your dreams, and once you have you got your dreams you are ready for your quest into the forest, said the storyteller.The children assembled their thoughts and soon everyone had a collection of dreams to take with them to the apple tree.ldquoThere is one more thing I forgot to tell you, said the storyteller. ldquoItrsquos an important piece of information. You see, when you finally get to the clearing you must be very careful, for wrapped around the base of the ancient apple tree there is a ferocious dragon.ldquoIt sleeps, but very lightly. It will wake when you approach the tree. It will hear you no matter how quiet. It will hear your heartbeat. And there is no place to hide in the clearing. The moment you approach the tree, the dragon will pounce on you.ldquoCan the dragon fly  asked one.ldquoYes.ldquoAnd breathe fire ldquoYes.There were murmurings.ldquoAnd so, the storyteller continued, ldquoyou must decide how you will overcome and defeat the dragon. It is there to stop you reaching the apple of your dreams.Some of the children came up with immediate ideas:ldquoIrsquod run as fast as I could in zig zags.ldquoIrsquod distract the dragon.ldquoIrsquod shoot the dragon with a gun.ldquoIrsquod make a giant kite and fly to the apple.ldquoIrsquod take some friends and feed them to the dragon while I get the apple, then dream my friends back again.There were many solutions and the storyteller listened to them with interest. Each child came up with a dferent strategy.The storyteller nodded, explaining the powers of the dragon that it couldnrsquot be killed by bullets or blades or fire, that it was faster than lightning and once it had heard you and seen you it would go for you.ldquoKnowing all this, are you still going to try and defeat the dragon and reach the apple of your dreams They all said yes, refining their ideas.And so once the children had come up with their final strategy, the storyteller asked them to think about what they might need to take with them to defeat the dragon. They will have to carry these things through the forest, or perhaps collect them on the way.Then the storyteller set the children the task of drawing the things they would need and then the dragon and apple tree. In drawing the apple they would have to decide what the apple of their dreams would look like.When this was all done, the children settled down to hear who had the right answer.ldquoI have looked at all the ideas, said the storyteller. ldquoWhat I must say is that le is unfair and so is this quest. For some, the journey through the forest will be longer than others. The dragon will be more dficult to defeat for some than others, as its mood changes. But you have all come up with the same answer, and so you are all right.There were howls of protest.ldquoNo, we didnrsquot we all have dferent answers!The storyteller beat his drum again to calm the children.ldquoWell yes, you all have dferent ideas on how to defeat the dragon and reach the apple, that is true. But you all have the same answer to the most important question.ldquoWhatrsquos that  the children asked.ldquoWell, said the storyteller, ldquoI had told you how fierce and dreadful the dragon could be. And then I asked youknowing all this, are you still going to try and defeat the dragon and reach the apple of your dreams.ldquoAnd you all said yes, yoursquod try to reach your dreams, even though you had a big fight on your hands.ldquoThat, I believe, is the right answer. You may have dferent ideas on how to get that apple, but yoursquore all right because each of you will have to fight the dragon in a dferent way. The most important thing is your determination to get to that apple.ldquoWhatafter all that we fail  asked one child.ldquoYou might, said the storyteller, ldquobut on your journey to your dreams you may find a new path that leads to another ancient tree without a dragon.ldquoTherersquos another magic apple tree without a dragon !ldquoPerhaps, perhaps not. But the only way to find out is set off on the journey with determination in your heart. You might realise on the journey that your dreams are easier to reach than you had thought, or it could be the other way round.ldquoBut the most important thing is to have your dreams and find ways to reach them.The storyteller finished his session. He left the children with their dreams and their strategy to reach them.Happy New Year and good luck in defeating your dragon, and reaching your apple."},{"url":null,"title":"salon-owner-astonished-as-sign-to-be-torn-down","story":"Anna Mather moved her business from grade C listed premises in Gford into a grade B listed building on Haddington High Street last year.The switch has allowed her successful hair stylist team, who were named Scotlandrsquos Hair and Beauty Salon of the Year, to take on larger premises as they moved into the converted George Hotel building in the centre of town.But Ms Mather was stunned when East Lothian Council planners wrote to her to say that her shop sign, which is the same as the one she had at Gford, would be forcibly removed in a few weeksrsquo time.Ms Mather said: ldquoI contacted planners about the sign when we moved in and was told that, because it is plastic, it is the wrong material for the building, even though the shops across the road use the same type of signs.ldquoWe had gone to great s to ensure it was mounted properly to avoid having to screw it into the wall of the building and it is the same as we had at our previous salon.ldquoI appreciate it is a grade B listed building and am happy to meet requirements but when I asked for advice about what materials I could use they said they could not tell me.ldquoI have to apply for planning permission but, without knowing the material I can use, it will just be rejected and cost us money.ldquoNow they have written to say they are coming to forcibly remove the sign on January  and will charge us for the work.ldquoWe are a new business in the town and cannot afford to have these types of expensive bills.

And so I think I shall.A story from your head is a term I use to describe a story either made up on the spot or a remembered story that was made up at an earlier time. So essentially itrsquos a story that isnrsquot written down anywhere or got from a book.Of course, reading to, and with, children is really important. But making stories together with a child is a really bonding experience and a fantastic way to encourage the child to explore and develop her or his creative imagination.This dadrsquos child is quite young but the process Irsquom about to describe can be used for any age group, and indeed yourself.Firstly, I want you to think of a mountain. You are standing at its base on one side and you want to get to the other side. In order to do so you will need to climb to the summit first. This mountain in your imagination is going to initially help you make a story, because itrsquos called a story mountain.So now you are standing at the base of the story mountain. You need a few things before you begin your journey to the summit, and the first thing is a character or characters.This is the first question to ask your child: who is in the story  Let them decide, and it can be anyone or anything: a dragon, a princess, a footballer, Spiderman, a Minion, a witch, a boy or girl, or even your child themselves.Next question is to find which place the story begins, that is what the setting is for the beginning of the tale. So you can ask where the character is.It can be an imaginary setting or a real one, perhaps even local, itrsquos up to the child for example, answers might include ldquothe dragon is hiding in a school or ldquothe princess lives in a cave.Once you have a character or characters and some kind of setting you have the beginning of the story. ldquoOnce upon a time, a dragon was hiding in a schoolhellip ldquoThere was once a princess who lived in a cavehellipYou can now help the child to add a few detailsyou wish by asking simple questions about the characters and or the settings. For example: ldquoWhy is the dragon hiding in the school  Or: ldquoWhat does the cave look like Questions like these can help direct the story towards what is going to happen, and that is the next part of your journey up the slope to the summit of your story mountain.So the child may say: ldquoThe dragon is hiding in the school because itrsquos scared of a bigger dragon. Or: ldquoThe cave is cold.Now we have the characters and setting, itrsquos time to make the climb to the summit of the story mountain. This climb represents the issue within the story: a problem, a task or quest, a desire or dream to be sought, a need for change or something to be found and so on. In other words, itrsquos the beginning of the adventure.Itrsquos at this point that beginning the process of visualisation is useful. Visualisation is a technique used by storytellers to help them remember a tale and tell it in their own words. It involves actually imagining yourself in the story, asyou are there.So before you set off on the story, imagine the dragon in the school, enter into the image in your head. Is it your old school, what does the dragon look like, where in the school is it hiding, what are its emotions Likewise with the princess, can you see her in the cave  Enter it in your imagination and look around. Is it large or small, cosy or scary  Where does she sleep and can you see the princess shivering in the cold  What is she feeling and thinking This is what story is all about, entering the world of imagination. Itrsquos not the words you need to remember but the images in your mind. Itrsquos like they become a memory which you can later describe.Your child will have his or her own visualisations, but you can help develop that by asking questions and allowing the child to describe what he or she sees.Painting vivid moving pictures in your mindrsquos eye is the key to not only remembering but developing the story.So now we may have a terried small dragon hiding in the dinner hall of your childrsquos school, and a shivering princess sitting by a small campfire in a huge cave, feeling hungry.The next step is to find out what is going to happen. This begins us on the journey to the summit of the story mountain. To give the child ownership of the story, ask him or her questions like: ldquoSo does the big dragon find the one hiding in the school  Or: ldquoWhat does the princess do to make the cave warmer and get something to eat Now we have the issue that takes us up the hill to the summit. The summit represents the transformative moment in the story, the thing or person or happening that alters the course of events. In any story, this is an important ingredient.So perhaps we will end up with: ldquoThe big dragon flies into the playground and all the children run. But the teacher comes out and is really strict and makes it go away so the children are safe, and so is the wee dragon. Or: ldquoThe princess goes fishing. And she sees a pirate ship while shersquos fishing and decides she wants to be a pirate instead.So the headteacher and the pirate ship are the transformative factors in these examples. They change the course of the story, and in doing so the journey back down the other side of the mountain can now take place, for this represents the conclusion or ending of the tale.Is it a happy, sad, funny ending  So questions like ldquowhat happens to the wee dragon  and ldquodoes the princess enjoy being a pirate and living on the pirate ship  may lead to answers that the wee dragon loves the school and becomes a part of the P class and learns to read, and that the princess becomes the pirate captain.So now the base of the other side of the mountain has been reached, with the storyrsquos ending. Now you can take away the structure of the mountain and lay down the bones of the story you have made along the journey.Here are the bones: wee dragon hides in a school from a bigger dragon, teacher chases bigger dragon away, wee dragon decides he likes the school and stays and joins P princess is in cave cold and hungry, she goes fishing by the sea and sees a pirate ship, she joins the pirate crew and becomes the captain.The visualisation technique can now be used to put flesh on the bones, giving it more detail. You can revisit the tale and develop it later, or leave it as it is.In telling the story, donrsquot think of words, think of the images created in your head, then the words will come naturally as you describe what you see.This way you will remember the story. You may tell it slightly dferently each time, but thatrsquos fine. Your child may remind you of how it was told before, as he or she will have their own visualisation of the tale.Or your child may ask you for a dferent story, in which case you are back at the base of another story mountain ready to climb it!Happy storytelling!"},{"url":null,"title":"plans-for-250-more-homes-in-dunbar-to-be-revealed","story":"Members of the public have the chance to view the

A similar amendment by Conservative MP Hugo Swire, which would have given MPs a vote on implementing the backstop, was also not selected.But Mr Bercow, who last week enraged the Government by breaking with convention on parliamentary procedure, rejected the two Tory backbench amendments.At the start of the fth and final day of the Brexit debate, he decided only four of more than a dozen amendments should be put before the main motion is voted upon. In effect, this means that the chances are there will be around .pm a straight vote on the May Plan, thus raising the prospect of a sizeable and humiliating defeat for the PM.The amendments to be voted on from pm are:*Labourrsquos, which rejects Mrs Mayrsquos compromise proposal because it fails to provide a permanent customs union and \"strong single market deal\" as set out in its \"six tests\"*the SNPrsquos, which declines to approve the PMrsquos proposed deal and calls for the UKs departure from the EU to be delayed until another withdrawal deal is agreed*Conservative MP John Barons, which would enable the UK to terminate the backstop at any time and without the agreement of the EU.Mr Bercow explained that they would be voted on in this order and that Mr Baronrsquos amendment would be called onlySir Edwardrsquos was rejected.During Commons exchanges, Mr Swire launched a thinly-veiled attack on the Speaker, asking Geoffrey Cox, the Attorney General,he believed the ldquonon-selection of his and Mr Murrisonrsquos amendments would make the ldquoGovernmentrsquos challenge harder to convince those of us who are still concerned about the implications of the backstop.Mr Cox replied that he had never underestimated the challenge facing the Government but said that after reflection he had concluded the risk of the backstop was an ldquoacceptable one.Meanwhile, the Democratic Unionists pointed out that what MPs were being asked to vote on this evening was the ldquolegally-binding Withdrawal Agreement negotiated with the EU, which did not contain any end date on the backstop.The party said in a statement: ldquoThe Prime Minister has known for many weeks what we require. Amendments tabled in Parliament will have no bearing on the legal status of what has been negotiated. What is required is for the Prime Minister to go and secure legally-binding changes as she promised.ldquoTodayrsquos very belated amendments are part of the internal parliamentary games and do not change the need to secure legally-binding changes, it declared.At the weekly Cabinet meeting, Mrs May reminded colleagues that the Government was the ldquoservant of the people.Her spokesman said senior ministers had discussed the process \"before, during and after the vote,\" but declined to give any details on a Plan B.Askedthe PM felt she had the full confidence of her Cabinet going into the vote, he replied: \"Absolutely.\"Mrs May will close the debate at around .pm. Voting will then take place and is expected to finish just before .pm.The spokesman explained that the PM would respond \"quickly\" to the vote result from the Commons dispatch box. The general view at Westminster is that she will simply make a holding statement before, possibly, ing to Brussels to seek more concessions later this week.However, that could prove problematicshe suffered a massive defeat as EU leaders would be reluctant to give groundthey believed it was simply impossible for her to get any version of her Brexit Plan through the Commons.Alternatively, Mrs May could opt to bring back the compromise deal to the House for a second - or possibly even a third - time in an attempt to wear down the opposition. Scottish Secretary David Mundell has already suggested this might be a way forward tacitly confirming that the expectation is that the PMrsquos plan will be rejected.However, Jeremy Corbyn is expected to create more parliamentary drama by tabling a no-confidence motion tonight following the PMs expected defeat with a vote taking place tomorrow after Prime Ministerrsquos Questions.Earlier today, Labourrsquos Hilary Benn pulled his amendment to the Governments Withdrawal Agreement motion, which would have rejected both the PMs deal and leaving the EU without a deal.The backbencher, who is chairman of the Commons Brexit Committee, had Tory support for his proposal but tweeted that he had decided to act because \"its vital that we now get the clearest expression of view from the House on the Governments deal\".The Labour leadership wants the cleanest of votes on the May Plan in order to maximise the scale of her expected defeat.Up until the vote, the PM is expected to have private meetings with a number of wavering Tory MPs she spoke to  over the weekend.Michael Gove, the Environment Secretary, referenced the popular television fantasy drama Game Of Thrones when he warned colleagues of the consequences of rejecting the May Plan, telling BBC Radio rsquos Today programme: ldquoIf we dont vote for the deal tonight, in the words of Jon Snow: Winter is coming.The Scot added: ldquoIf we dont vote for the deal tonight, we will do damage to our democracy by saying to people we are not going to implement Brexit and the opportunity that all of us have to live up to our democratic obligations is clear.\""},{"url":null,"title":"holyrood-parties-say-theresa-may-has-lost-all-authority","story":"Scottish Labour continued to talk up a snap general election, while others said a Peoplersquos Referendum was the more realistic option.:Brexit crisis just got much deeper ndash who,anyone, will take control Fe Labour MP Lesley Laird, the shadow Scottish Secretary, said Mrs May had ldquolost all authority.The Tories have failed miserably on Brexit and it is no surprise Theresa Mayrsquos deal has been rejected by such a massive margin.We need a General Election and a Labour government to break the deadlock and end austerity.She said: ldquoThe vote confirms what we already knew ndash that Theresa Mayrsquos deal is bad for Scotland and bad for the UK.

her office then repeatedly refused to name who was involved.Mr Hamiltonrsquos presence was revealed by Mr Salmondrsquos former chief of staff, Geoff Aberdein, who said Ms Lloyd told him before the meeting, in late March, that she suspected that a misconduct complaint had been levelled against Mr Salmond, but she did not know any specics, and had not told Ms Sturgeon.When the conversation was relayed to Mr Salmond it was interpreted as an attempt by Ms Lloyd to put him off trying toto frontline politics, adding to his tensions with Ms Sturgeon.Ms Aberdein said he was also at Ms Sturgeonrsquos home on April , but that Ms Sturgeon and Mr Salmond talked alone.Mr Carlaw said it stretched credulity that Ms Lloyd had discussed a complaint against Mr Salmond with Mr Aberdein, then arranged a meeting between Mr Salmond and the First Minister without telling her what was coming.He said: ldquoIf itrsquos true, the chief of staff was failing in her duty, anditrsquos not true, the First Minister was even more reckless in proceeding with the discussion.Ms Sturgeonrsquos spokesman declined to elaborate on Mr Aberdeinrsquos statement or Ms Lloydrsquos role, maintained April  was a ldquoparty meeting, and said Ms Sturgeon continued to have full confidence in Ms Lloyd and Ms Evans.A spokesperson for Mr Salmond said: ldquoAlex will be happy to co-operate, in principle andasked, with a parliamentary inquiry which seeks to examine how the administration of the Scottish government could get itself into a position where the Court of Session had to rule that it had acted unlawfully, unfairly and tainted by apparent bias.Welcoming the Holyrood inquiry, Scottish Labour leader Richard Leonard said: ldquoThis is the right decision and a positive step forward.

Mr Salmond has made no secret of his enthusiasm for an early referendum, and made clear last spring that he intended toto active politics to help lead it. Not everyone in the Scottish Government was entirely relaxed about this prospect.The First Minister, Nicola Sturgeon, has been intensely cautious about any future referendum, not least because of her failed attempt to launch one in . But many activists are instinctively with Mr Salmond, and believe a historic opportunity could be lost. The issue has been rumbling in the undergrowth since October when Ms Sturgeon once again delayed her long-promised timetable for indyref. She said shersquod deliver it when the fog of Brexit had cleared ndash but many in the party, even her strongest supporters, are giving up hope that there will be a referendum before the current mandate expires in .:Nicola Sturgeon facing second inquiry over Alex Salmond as feud worsensLast week, the First Minister yet again promised a statement on the referendum timetable, but that was overtaken by the Scottish Governmentrsquos defeat in court, when it admitted it had acted unlawfully and unfairly over the Salmond inquiry. Now, the prospects of any announcement this year must be close to zero.Ms Sturgeon has referred herself to parliamentrsquos standards , which could take three months to report. Parliament also agreed a special committee to investigate her series of private meetings with Mr Salmond. The  will probably exonerate her from any serious violation of the ministerial code. Therersquos nothing in the rules that says the First Minister canrsquot speak to her predecessor, though it is likely to say there should have been a written record of any meeting in which her chief of staff, Liz Lloyd, was present.But this will not be the end of the matter. There is also a criminal investigation by the Information Commissioner into the leaks of the Salmond ldquosex pest allegations to the Daily Record, which could be highly damaging. The journalists will of course protect their sources. Ms Sturgeon, on behalf of the Scottish Government, will deny all knowledge of a leak. But there will be a wealth of speculation and a running commentary from both sides.Already, wersquove had Ms Sturgeonrsquos spokespeople accusing ldquoTeam Salmond of ldquosmearing her. This is the first time I can recall such a serious accusation being made between such senior SNP figures in public. Mr Salmond claims that Ms Lloyd made contact with him in March, before he was informed of the allegations against him, and advised him not toto active politics. Ms Sturgeon denies that her chief of staff had prior knowledge of the specic complaints, though she concedes that Mr Salmondrsquos future had been discussed ldquoin the context of #metoo ndash which rather suggests that he was being warned off.Read More: Sturgeon accuses Team SalmondThis takes us into another ongoing aspect of this case: the presumption of innocence. The First Ministerrsquos many supporters on social media have been condemning Mr Salmond for making le more dficult for the ldquocourageous women, as the Scottish Labour leader Richard Leonard described the civil service employees who made the complaints. This public speculation about Mr Salmondrsquos presumed guilt actually does no service to those women. As the former President of the Scottish Law Society, Ian Smart ndash a long-term critic of Mr Salmond ndash pointed out this week, such prejudicial commentary could undermine prospects for a successful prosecution. ldquoIfthis matter should ever proceed criminally, he wrote, ldquothese are remarks upon which any competent defence team will undoubtedly seize.The police have been examining Mr Salmondrsquos conduct over recent years and questioning employees and colleagues of the former First Minister to establish whether there is any evidence of similar sexual harassment. This is standard practice in such cases. But it is dficult for details of an investigation into such a high-profile figure as Mr Salmond not to leak into the public domain.No one knows whether Mr Salmond will be found to be innocent, I certainly have no wish to speculate on this. But many of his supporters believe that the most likely outcome is that the police will find insufficient evidence for a criminal prosecution. This could be the worst of both worlds for the SNP, because some would declare Mr Salmond guilty by default, others would condemn the Scottish Government for investigating him in the first place, and for making the allegations public.Whatever happens, Mr Salmond has made clear he will claim damages from the Scottish Government, which will rack up the already-substantial legal bill being paid by the taxpayer. That will renew the attack on Ms Sturgeonrsquos handling of the affair. Opposition parties may eventually support the call from the former SNP minister, Alex Neill, this week for a full judge-led inquiry into the procedures and practices of the Scottish Government that led to last weekrsquos Court of Session fiasco.So, this story could run and run ndash but will it destroy the SNP Government  I doubt it. In the end, Ms Sturgeon is not directly implicated in the mishandling of the Salmond inquisition ndash that was her civil servants. Moreover, Brexit and the aftermath to last nightrsquos vote will dominate politics for the next year. Scottish voters are quite capable of looking beyond questions about Mr Salmondrsquos personal conduct to the bigger issues.However, a bit of ision right now might be no bad thing. The SNP is far too averse to controversy, and it is about time it had a proper debate about its future and its leadership structures. Making a fetish of unity, and ignoring political reality, is almost as dangerous as a split."},{"url":null,"title":"how-did-european-media-react-to-crucial-brexit-vote","story":"In France Le Monde says Mrs May was subject to a \"humiliating defeat\" that left the future of her Government and Brexit \"more uncertain than ever\".The Prime Ministers loss is on the front page of El Pais in Spain, which says the \"crushing defeat\" make the \"crisis\" over Brexit worse.: Brexit crisis just got much deeper ndash who,anyone, will take control In Germany Der Spiegel says Mrs Mays Brexit plan has been \"shattered\" and asks: \"Must she go now \" - while a commentator for Bild describes the situation as \"Brexshit\".In Belgium LEchos headline reads \"The shadow of a hard Brexit\", while La Libre Belgique mulls \"the jump into the void of the British parliament\".The Brexit vote is also on the front of two papers in Sweden, the Svenska Dagbladet, which leads with Mrs Mays \"historic loss\", and the Dagens Nyheter, which says: \"After the historic setback - Mays fate can be decided today.\"In Denmark the national Jyllands-Posten leads with the \"big defeat for May\", saying it leaves Brexit facing \"maximum insecurity\".:Theresa Mays Brexit deal suffers historic Commons defeatDescribing the loss as a \"humiliating defeat\" that has \"thrust Britain further into political chaos\", the New York Times picks up on Mrs Mays warning before the vote that the decision will \"set the future of our country for generations\".The paper says: \"Like most others, though, the prime minister had no easy answers about the way forward.\""},{"url":null,"title":"glasgow-city-council-to-scrap-free-sunday-city-centre-street-parking","story":"The move comes after the council says free parking was having a damaging effect and a lack of availability as drivers park for free for longer.The council is proposing charging on a Sunday the same as Monday to Saturday with a pound per  minutes or pound an hour with a maximum stay of two hours, meaning there will be parking charges seven days a week in the city centre.Currently, there are no charges on SundayPoor air quality and increase pollution are thought to be one of the reasons free parking is considered being removed with drivers looking around for a space thought to be a contributor to congestion and air quality.Good vehicles and deliveries being able to unload are also being affected by free parking on Sunday according to the council.The Councils plan is to introduce restrictions to encourage drivers to move on and ensure there is a sufficient supply of short term parking spaces in the city centre for shoppers, tourists and businesses.A spokesman for Glasgow City Council told The Evening Times: ldquoThe current situation leads to a number of problems such as congestion, frustration for motorists struggling to find somewhere to park, dficulties with loading and unloading vehicles, all underlined by unacceptable levels of pollution.ldquoThe proposals are about ensuring the best and most even use of the limited space for street parking in the city centre.ldquoBut they are also about encouraging better use of under-utilised car parks and encouraging a sht to more sustainable forms of transport.ldquoThe recent Connectivity Commission report highlighted the need for radical change in the cityrsquos transport system.

He will be  next month but still visits schools and other groups to give slideshow presentations about his war experiences. Here we reproduce an interview with Don which was published in the Groat in June  to mark the th anniversary of the D-Day landings. Don flew to Normandy twice on D-Day, first dropping paratroops and then a glider with more troops and equipment.*WHEN the grey dawn broke over Normandy on June , , Don Mason had already made the first of his two contributions to the momentous events of D-Day. The young airman was part of the six-man crew of a modied Stirling bomber that had dropped  paratroops and their equipment at Ranville under cover of darkness. Heading for home, the Stirling came under fire from anti-aircraft guns on the French coast but ed unscathed to its base at Fairford in Gloucestershire. In the early evening the same crew were back over Normandy, this time towing a glider with more troops destined for the original dropping zone ndash and by this stage, almost  hours after the start of the Allies seaborne invasion, the full enormity of Operation Overlord was clear to see. \"It looked like a scene out of a nightmare,\" Don now recalls.Don had been fascinated with aeroplanes since his childhood in Worcestershire. As a young boy he once walked four miles with his family to see a travelling circus which featured a plane of Great War vintage Don could only gaze in wonderment as the flying machine entertained the crowds, and he resolved that one day he would fly an aircraft of his own. It was an ambition that would be fulfilled with the onset of World War Two.Although just  at the time of D-Day, Don had already clocked up numerous operations as a bomber pilot. He had been severely injured in a fighter attack over Germany in  and was declared medically unfit. After being reinstated on appeal, he was retrained as a radio observer.\"We had been in No.  Group Bomber Command,\" says Don, who moved to Thurso in the s but whose Caithness connection goes back to  when he flew Blenheims out of Wick. \"The whole squadron were suddenly lted out of Bomber Command and put into  Group, airborne support, which was a completely new role because wed never worked with paratroops or the like before.\"He was now in  Squadron, flying a modied version of the Stirling four-engined heavy bomber: the Mk IV troop-carrier and glider tug. \"We had to do a lot of exercises to get used to that aeroplane and to get used to dropping troops and towing gliders, which obviously was a dferent ball game altogether... it required a lot of dferent techniques.\"And it was necessary with any airborne group to drop them accurately in as tight a bunch as possible ndash therefore youd got to operate at a low height and also not get them scattered, so timing was important.\"There developed a formation flying technique which was called starboard echelon, so youve got two lines of aircraft flying parallel to one another. We had to practise these on group exercises, and a number of things happened: tow ropes broke, gliders went down in dferent places.\"On one group exercise we were flying along in this starboard echelon formation and there were literally hundreds of us ndash it wasnt just my squadron, it was a number of dferent squadrons ndash and suddenly an aircraft in the port line veered straight across into an aircraft in the starboard line and they both went down in flames. We lost two aircraft and two crews, just like that, on an exercise. Those are the things that stick in the mind.\"That tragic accident occurred on May , , in one of the last group exercises before D-Day. It was becoming clear that a big operation was imminent, one that would have major repercussions for the course of the war.\"Obviously we knew something was happening,\" Don says, \"because we were practising with troops and gliders and whatever. But we werent aware, of course, until the th of June when we were briefed originally.\"The invasion was scheduled initially for June  but was postponed for  hours because of the weather. \"Before that we had the indications of the airfield being closed off and we werent allowed to leave ndash we were shut in, the mail was censored.\"Paratroops of the th Airborne Division had been arriving at Fairford from the middle of May, and glider pilots were gathering there too as the security arrangements became ever tighter. The troops camped out on the airfield and Don remembers: \"One thing that struck me was that most of them were not very big men but the amount of equipment they carried was phenomenal, with kitbags full of gear strapped to their legs. The other thing that struck me as quite remarkable was they were all carrying water bottles full of white rum!\"Stirling LJ  took off from Fairford at . hours on June  in what was code-named Operation Tonga, with Don as wireless operator air gunner. On board were  fully equipped paratroops and the BBC correspondent Guy Byam.Dons chief recollection of that night flight over the English Channel is the sight of vast numbers of landing craft and other vessels in the assembly area ndash which was known as \"Piccadilly Circus\" ndash as they awaited the signal to head for the beaches.\"We were briefed to drop precisely at a time and place,\" he explains. \"It was important to get the troops on the ground in a bunch, not scattered. We were only over mid-Channel so we did an orbit ndash that was a bit dicey with so many aircraft about, all flying in one direction, and us crossing the stream. It all went to build up the tension.\"Finally, at . hours, the troops were released at Ranville, where they were to set up a homing beacon to aid following aircraft and also to assist in holding bridges over the nearby river Orne after the seaborne invasion had begun. Don remembers the red light in the fuselage turning to green on reaching the dropping zone. \"They all had to go together. Naturally some hesitated on the lip of the door ndash but they had all got to go.\"In the lead-up to the drop, there had been a close encounter between the Stirling and a group of paratroops released by a nearby Dakota. \"He released his troops and they came past us and we flew right through and didnt touch one,\" says Don.\"There was no flak at all over Normandy but then we had to fly in a northerly direction towards the Pas de Calais after dropping our troops, which was a feint because the Germans expected us to attack the Pas de Calais rather than anywhere . So we flew on a northerly track and we experienced flak around Le Havre and Dieppe, and then when we exited France towards Beachy Head we got some light flak on the coast, but there wasnt a great deal of resistance.\"It was a dferent matter altogether when Don and his crew-mates embarked on their second operation of D-Day, code-named Mallard.This time their Stirling had a Horsa glider in tow, containing more troops bound for the Ranville area along with an armoured jeep, four anti-tank guns and ammunition. Take-off time was . hours and the glider was to be released at ..Don remembers the scene vividly: \"The Channel was still littered with shipping but when we approached the Normandy coast it was a chaotic mass of ships and landing craft and smoke and explosions. It looked like a scene out of a nightmare, really. And, of course, as we went over land and approached the landing zone there was a lot more activity and a lot more flak.\"You couldnt tow a glider above  knots so it was fairly slow. You were low because you didnt want the glider to be shot down before it could get down to land. So obviously a big aircraft like the Stirling, with a ft wingspan or thereabouts, and a Horsa glider behind it, was a good target. In fact, all  of our aircraft were hit by anti-aircraft fire.\"Indeed one of those planes was shot down and crash-landed into the beachhead. The airmen were uninjured and got away for a while before being picked up by a German patrol.Subsequently the German position where they were held prisoner was captured and the crew ed to base.Reflecting on the chaos and confusion of D-Day, does Don recall feeling scared by what was happening around him  \"Well, everybodys scared ndash I dont care what anyone says,\" he replies. \"If youre not scared you dont perform, but its discipline and training that takes you through. You do reach a point of no .\"This is rude, I know, but its what I call s**t or bust. You go on and do it. Its a matter of accepting whats going on and just dealing with it, and doing the job youre supposed to do.\"Its not a question of bravery. Im very suspicious when people say, Oh, youre a brave man, or Youve got a lot of courage. You react to circumstances. Its a question of training and discipline and doing your job, without really recognising the probability of being killed.\"And I think to some extent the unorm protects you ndash you feel less vulnerable when youve got a unorm on and youre acting in that capacity. Everything happens very quickly.\"So Im very suspicious about bravery. I think we react more instinctively based on our training and our own iniduality. I dont think I could have coped with being an infantryman, for instance. I dont know how those chaps did it, because it must have been hell on earth for them.\"Don can look back on hundreds of hours of operational flying in a distinguished RAF career that included missions for the Special Operations Executive. And yet, despite the passage of years, he has never forgotten the thrill of his first tantalising taste of aviation.\"I fell in love with aeroplanes when I was a kid when Alan Cobhams Flying Circus came to visit our town with an old World War One aeroplane, and it was fascinating,\" Don says. \"He had a couple of old SEs [fighter aircraft] and you could have a flip round the field for  shillings ndash but of course  shillings was half a mans wage, so we just stood there with our mouths open.\"But the smell of hot engine oil, castor oil and fumes and what-not got into you. I was determined to try to get into it in some way, and of course thats what I did.\"He grew up in Kingswinford, Worcestershire, where his father ran a transport yard. Don trained as a motor mechanic after leaving school at the age of  and went on to qualy as a motor vehicle technician in the summer of . He was called up when war broke out in September of that year, having joined the volunteer reserve two years previously.After pilot training he enjoyed rapid promotion in Bomber Command and was an acting squadron leader when, ing from a mission near Hanover in May , his aircraft was attacked from below by an unseen German fighter plane. The bomb aimer, navigator, flight engineer and wireless operator were all killed but Don survived along with his mid-upper and rear gunner. Somehow he managed tohis crippled Stirling to an emergency landing field on the east coast of England despite suffering severe spinal injuries, damage to his left eye, lacerations around his head and a hole in his knee. He still bears the scars.Don spent eight months in hospital and was discharged as medically unfit. However, he refused to accept that his flying career was over and lodged an objection with the air ministry. Eventually his appeal was successful and he was reinstated, being retrained in the new discipline of radio observer.Operations in the aftermath of D-Day included Market Garden in September  ndash \"I went to Arnhem five times during that debacle,\" says Don ndash and he continued in Stirlings until .He and his first we Lillian were married in  and they had three children: daughter Elaine, now living in Ashby-de-la-Zouch, and sons Peter and Robert, who are both ex-Navy. Peter is in Denmark while Robert has a management post at Dounreay.Don ed to the motor trade after the war and became general service manager with a large garage group. He then spent more than  years working in further education, including a spell as head of the engineering department at a college of technology in Salisbury.Lillian died in  after many years of ill-health and in  Don moved to Thurso, coming out of retirement to work for eight years with local firm Ashley Ann. In  he was married for a second time, to Lybster-born Isabel, whose three daughters became part of the family. Isabel died in .Don still keeps in touch with three of his former crew-mates from those D-Day operations: Jim Wayman, the rear gunner, who lives in Dorset Eric Winter, flight engineer, in Coventry and Sid Harrison, the mid-upper gunner, who lives in Crewe. However, there was a particularly close and enduring bond between Don and his pilot, New Zealander Frank Cox.\"Although our families were half a world apart, they sort of grew up together ndash he came over [to this country] and I went to New Zealand,\" says Don. \"In  his daughter rang me from New Zealand and said Frank was dying of bowel cancer ndash he knew he was terminally ill and he hadnt got long to live. They had asked himthere was anything he really wanted, and hed said, Id love to see my old mate again. So I went to New Zealand and I was with him when he died.\"Now you cant explain relationships like that ndash they exist because of the worth of each one of you to the other in action. Its what they call camaraderie. Im still in touch with his family.\"As his thoughtsto the events of  on the Normandy beaches, Don agrees that D-Day was a turning point ndash \"theres no doubt about that\". But he adds: \"I regret to say I dont think weve learned any lessons. I dont think we should be doing what were doing now [in Iraq].\"As I look back I think first of all how lucky I was and I feel very sad about the people who gave their lives in that struggle. Its not really appreciated, the sacrices that were made both on the home front and in action. Its a sad reflection on society, I feel.\"We ought to be very thankful that were free, because thats what it was about. We should remember that this country wouldnt be freeit had been overrun by Nazi Germany.\"It was all for a cause. People may say, Oh, thats patriotic nonsense. But it isnt.\"* This is a slightly edited version of an interview first published in the John OGroat Journal of June , .Wednesday  Jan  : PM"},{"url":null,"title":"More festive frustration for Wick Academy as Formartine snatch victory in stoppage time","story":"Wick Academy  Formartine United Formartine United took advantage of a late red card to Danny Mackay to hit an injury-time winner and consign Academy to a second defeat over the festive period.The Scorries struggled to create any clear chances but defended resolutely and the game appeared to be drting towards a goalless draw before Graeme Rodgerrsquos late strike.Manager Tom McKenna made two enforced changes to his side, with Ross Allan and Andrew Hardwick replaced by Gordon MacNab and Craig Gunn. Sixteen-year old Mark Macadie, brother of Richard, made his first appearance on the bench.Academy started positively and Marc Macgregor twice tested Formartine keeper Kevin Main within the opening  minutes ndash first when he scuffed a shot straight at Main after being set up by a driving run down the right from Davie Allan, and then seeing an edge-of-the-box effort comfortably held.With Wick sitting deep in clear defensive blocks of four and five, the visitors took control after that and passed up several decent opportunities to take the lead.Archie Macphee found himself with a clear look at goal a quarter of an hour in but he somehow poked wide of Sean McCarthyrsquos left-hand post, and Rodger followed that moments later by guiding a shot wide of the same spot.After coming through that tough -minute spell, it was Academy who threatened next when, after a great spin in midfield by Grant MacNab, the ball came through for Macgregor whose shot was blocked by Main.The biggest cheer of the half came when Formartine assistant manager Russell Anderson, unhappy with what he felt was a series of unfair decisions against his team, was given a strict talking to by lineswoman Molly Alexander.Academy made a tactical switch with Craig Gunn and Davie Allan swapping wings and Gordon MacNab moving upfield to partner Macgregor up top. The move failed to pay idends as Wick couldnrsquot trouble the away defence throughout the half, Davie Allan coming closest to goal when he skewed his shot wide after a one-two with Macgregor.Formartine similarly struggled to break down a well-drilled home defence, but they smelled blood when Mackay was given a second yellow card in the last minute after a collision with substitute Scott Ferries.It was another Formartine sub who played a key role in the winner when Liam Burnett skipped past Craig Gunn to the by-line and cut back for the unmarked Rodger, who had the simple task of tapping it home.Wick Academy: McCarthy, M Steven, Farquhar, D Mackay, Manson, Henry, Gunn, Macgregor , D Allan, Gordon MacNab , Grant MacNab .

Nevertheless, well over  party-goers turned out to sing along with local band CoverCover who played popular hits such as the Proclaimers Im Gonna Be .Thursos Santa Claus decoration in the square looked a bit worse for wear as it fell to the ground in the high winds, with one reveller joking that \"hed had too much mulled wine\".Santa wasnt the only casualty and a few wreaths from the base of the Victory war memorial were blown away as well.Tracey added: \"Well be holding an AGM soon and details of this will go on Facebook page for anyone interested in being a part of future events.\"Wed like to thank all those who volunteered, helping with the litter pick at the end, and the sponsors, as well as everyone who attended.\"In Wick, the heat was on as  revellers braved the wind and gathered around the annual bonfire at the top of Bignold Park.Under the guidance of local man Iain Sutherland ndash who revived the tradition over  years ago with friend Mackie MacDonald after the council had given up on it ndash a ft high conglomeration of discarded Christmas trees, wooden pallets and compressed paper had been built earlier that same day.Looking down from a safe vantage point in his daughter Helens car, Iain said he was proud and \"delighted\" as he watched the bonfire take hold.His son-in-law Mervyn Hill, who runs the Netherclfe Hotel with Helen, had not only learned the fine art of fire-building but had organised for some members of the towns pipe band to bring in  with Hogmanay tunes.\"Its been a successful night and despite the wind we had around  people show up,\" said Mervyn.\"We had people of all ages here. It was a good family event and everything went really well.\"Mervyn explained how his father-in-law had shown him techniques to make the blaze take hold by building around a central core of compressed paper and cardboard. \"You need to make a tunnel into the centre. Then you light a box, push it in and away she goes. The wind blows through the pallets and eggs it on too.\"Mervyn said that the help of local contractors, builders and volunteers helped keep the tradition going.Long after the public had left as the rain came on at around .am, Mervyn was still busy tending to the fire with a sturdy rake in his hand.\"Ill keep an eye on it through the night and make sure its under control,\" he said. \"Ill rake up what I can and come back when its cooled down to pick up any nails that people or their pets could get injured by.\"* See this weeks John OGroat Journal for more Hogmanay pictures.Wednesday  Jan  : PM"},{"url":"https://www.johnogroat-journal.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04118000/04118861.jpg","title":"Young people make their mark","story":"Scottish Government ViewpointIN , Scotland came together to celebrate its younger generation.Year of Young Peopleinspired the whole country to look at eight to -year-olds in a more open, positive way: celebrating their achievements, valuing their contributions and giving them an opportunity to influence decision-making.In a year dominated by political uncertainty, young people were the positive force in making change happen.

Following on from its four other adaptations of children’s classics, as well as pantomimes and avant-garde entries to the SCDA festival, the group has decided to stage a musical version of Arthur Ransome’s well-known book Swallows and Amazons.Developed for the famous Bristol Old Vic theatre, it tells the story of four rather straight-laced children on holiday in the s, given permission, in those pre-risk assessment days, to take a dinghy out onto the lake with their father’s warning not to be “duffers,” in other words, just to be sensible. They soon get their sense of adventure heightened when they meet the fierce Amazon pirates, otherwise the Blackett sisters, Nancy and Peggy. After a brief “battle of the boats” on the lake, they decide to wage another war against the Blacketts’ Uncle Jim, soon to be renamed “Captain Flint,” simply because he has spent the summer writing a boring book and isn’t a fun uncle any more. That, and a mysterious burglary, makes for an exciting, funny and absorbing play, with a surprise at every turn.The story is great fun, all the more so since the production uses a number of clever devices to turn everyday household objects into boats, rocks, weapons and everything  needed to tell the story. The cast, made up of actors ranging in age from  to  plus, have enjoyed creating their characters and learning the very catchy songs with this year#s musical director Glenys Hughes.Soyou want to see how a hall can be turned into a lake without flooding it, Deerness Dram Group encourage you to come along on February ,  or  and join in the fun!

Though questioned at the time, it was another  years before Michael Ross was apprehended for the crime. On June , , Mr Ross was convicted of murder at the High Court in Glasgow. Last year, he admitted attempts to escape HM Prison Shotts, where he is currently serving a -year sentence. This came shortly after news that high-profile lawyer Aamar Anwar would be representing him in an appeal case.“It’s an incredible story,” added Mr Clarkson.“I think it’s one of the most extraordinary true crime stories in UK criminal history.”Having already secured a book deal, Mr Clarkson has long-term aspirations of bringing the story to Netflix which he says, has shown interest in making a six-part series about the case. For now, he is trying to get folk who were involved in the case, or who knew Shamsuddin Mahmood or Michael Ross, personally, to come forward.“I’m really interested in speaking to witnesses who were in the restaurant, to Michael’s ex-girlfriend, and to anyone who knew Shamsuddin when he was living here in Orkney,” he explained.“To be fair to the people who are fighting for his innocence, they deserve a voice as well, and they will get a voice in my book, because what I’m trying to do is look at it from all angles.

Wherever you are in Scotland – all you need is a clear night, a dark place to watch and a dose of good luck!Scottish Natural Heritage are currently running a competition to find the best image of the lights, with budding photographers in with the chance of winning a  Scottish Natural Heritage calendar.Jonathan Swale, who works on Shetland for Scottish Natural Heritage, is a keen watcher of the aurora borealis.“The winter months are the best time of year to see the northern lights and the best time is a couple of hours either side of midnight,# he said.#This amazing spectacle is caused by charged particles from the sun colliding with gas particles in the Earth’s atmosphere. This produces the wonderful patterns of dancing light that we see in the sky.#According to Mr Swale, the colour of the northern lights ies depending on the type of gas particles that are colliding. Most common is a pale yellowish green, produced by oxygen particles about  miles above the earth. Nitrogen gives out blue or purplish-red light, and the rare, all-red auroras are down to high-altitude oxygen, at heights of up to  miles.“The top places to see these magical light shows are areas free from light pollution,# Mr Swale continued.#You need absolutely clear skies with no clouds and your best bet is to stand somewhere where you have a view of the northern horizon. While they have been seen as far south as Kent and Cornwall, you have much greater chance of seeing them here in Scotlandthe conditions are right, as they get stronger the further north you go.““Andyou don’t get lucky and see the northern lights, you will get a fantastic view of the night sky, peppered with stars.”To find out more about the SNH competition, you can follow their social media channels on Twitter, Facebook or Instagram.For aurora alerts and forecasts, try the AuroraWatch UK, Service Aurora Forecast or the Glendale app.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

SSEN say these changes are aimed at improving the security of supply serving one of Orkney#s most remote islands, enhancing network resilience for the local community.The network operator has also installed new automation equipment on the network which allows SSEN’s teams to remotely operate switches, meaning power can be restored much quicker in the event of a power cut by remotely isolating the affected part of the network.Colin Rendall, SSEN’s Orkney Operations Manager, said: “The work on Sanday forms part of an ongoing commitment to target our investment towards improving network reliability in the areas with the greatest potential impact and improvement for our customers. We’re delighted to have completed this project on time and on budget, providing a more resilient, stronger electricity network for our customers on Sanday.“As a responsible network operator, we worked closely with archaeologists and ecologists to ensure all works were completed in a responsible manner, with careful consideration for the local landscape and environment. We’d like to thank the local community for their support and patience during these works.”This work, delivering on one of SSEN’s business commitments, means the main network line serving  properties from Stove to the north end of Sanday has now been upgraded — resulting in a more resilient network for SSEN’s customers living and working on the island.Mobile generation was deployed throughout the duration of the project to minimise disruption to the island community, ensuring schools, shops, hotels and local businesses stayed on supply whilst SSEN’s engineers undertook this essential work.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Therersquos no record showing where this bonnet came from other than what is said on the label and all that says is it was found in a bog at Fort Augustus.ldquoMr Harbord thinks it might be the earliest surviving example and that seems perfectly feasible.

He told the Ross-shire Journal: ldquoThis issue has rumbled on for some time and as the public interest shows, needs resolved quickly. I have written to Highland Councilrsquos director of community services, William Gilfillan, to ask that he attends a meeting with myself and other local community representatives.ldquoI am eager to get the community and the council round the table and thrash out the best way forward for Fighting Macrsquos monument. I have also written to the ward manager to request a site visit so I can see for myself the locally disputed health and safety concerns.More than  people have already signed a petition pressing Highland Council to take action. It states: ldquoThe time for excuses has passed, we have been let down far too often by officials.Its instigator, George Murray, who is leading moves for a business improvement district in the town, said he was delighted but not surprised by the public response.He said: ldquoThe council never understood the monument is more than just a local landmark with a nice view ndash in our area the MacDonald monument is a source of pride. The first man to ever make it from private to general in the history of the British army was a local from the Black Isle and people are proud of that history, why wouldnrsquot they be He said: ldquoWhat that shows is just how big the disconnect between the people and the council really is ndash I suspect its own officials are out of touch with the new chief executive, at least she listens.ldquoPeople are saying how they loved going up there as a child and how good it would be for education ndash the closure has really hurt the town.Dingwall Community Council chairman Jack Shepherd said support for the petition was a good indication of the strength of feeling towards getting the monument reopened.One who signed the petition, Iona McAuley,said: ldquoI used to love visiting the monument every Thursday evening with the Dingwall in Bloom group. I often take my children up to sit at the canons and tell them the story behind it. I have promised one day Irsquoll take them inside ndash hopefully in the near future.Another, Ireneusz Grochowski, said: ldquoIt would be great to see Dingwall from the top of the monument. I think it will be an amazing viewpoint for villagers and tourists.A Highland Council spokeswoman said: ldquoThe council has offered a community buyout and are waiting to hearthis is a proposal the group want to progress. We are following the findings of the health and safety report that highlighted a number of issues.

Francis Fukuyama – he who announced, prematurely, perhaps, the end of history – is certainly of this view, as he explains in his recent book, Identity. But it is not just in the political arena that identity has been a much-discussed topic: philosophers have long been concerned with the problem of personal identity and what makes us the same person across time . As a philosopher might put it, is pthe same entity at t as at t  To which Joxer Daly, the inimitable bar-room philosopher of Seán O’Casey’s Juno and the Paycock, might say: “That’ s the question, Captain! That’s the question!”Joxer Daly was quintessentially Irish, as was O’Casey. And that ties in with my theme of Irishness, in that I have been thinking recently about how many people have suddenly become Irish. An old friend of mine, whom I had always believed to have been Welsh to begin with, and who then became Scottish by habit and repute – to use the old term of informal marriage in Scots law – suddenly announced that he was Irish and acquired an Irish passport to prove it. This, of course, was something to do with the recent political uncertainties surrounding British and indeed Scottish identity, into which we do not currently need to go. Suffice it to say that he had identied an Irish grandmother and acquired his new nationality on the strength of that.Irish grandmothers are very useful. Many people who did not know that they had an Irish grandmother are now discovering that they have one, and writing off for their new Irish passports on the strength of that. Others who may not have ready access to an Irish grandmother have been investigating the possibility of acquiring one, and have, in many cases, succeeded in finding perfectly serviceable Irish grandmothers at very little cost. This process reminds one of the wonderful scene in di Lampedusa’s novel, The Leopard, in which the wealthy parvenu to Sicilian society is introduced as a man who has many distinguished ancestors, or,he does not currently have them, will surely have some soon.: Brexit: Voting down Theresa May’s deal is in national interest – Ian Murray MPIrish grandmothers come in the living or dead category. There is a strong argument against acquiring a living Irish grandmother, as this may involve future expenditure in terms of birthday presents and so on. Deceased grandmothers are more convenient in every respect, and cannot in any event challenge your assertion that you are their grandchild. This is important when you are applying for your Irish passport, as it can delay mattersthe grandmother on which you base your claim appears to have no knowledge of your existence. You can try putting this down to forgetfulness on her part, but that may be dficult to establish.How do you establish your Irishness for passport purposes  Many people, without a great deal of Irish ancestry in their past, are put off from applying because they fear that documentary evidence will be required, and they have none. This is unnecessarily defeatist: Irish Consulates are usually very agreeable places, staffed by charming persons of impeccable Irishness, and usually more than happy to help. I’m sure, in most cases, they will take you at your word, andyou insist that you are Irish and do so in a reasonably credible way, they will come up with the passport bypost . But do not overdo it. Some applicants go to the consular authorities dressed entirely in green. This is not advisable, as Irish consular officials can usually see through that sort of thing. All is required is the occasional phrase that indicates Irishness, such as “Would you look at that sky now. Sure, aren’t we in for a spot of rain, so we are.” That will do it. Do not attempt to speak Irish to the officials, nor to fill in your form in Irish, unless you are skilled in the language. You may end up applying in Early Irish, which is quite dferent from the modern language, and being given, as a consequence, an Early Irish passport, which is of very little use.: Brexit: Huge poll shows % favour second referendumOn the subject of grandmothers, the question might be asked: “If an Irish grandmother is so useful, of what use is a Scottish grandmother ” This is a very interesting question, the answer to which is that a Scottish grandmother will entitle you to play rugby for Scotland. Many people are unaware of this rule, which is applied with generosity and admirable consistency by the Scottish Rugby Union. If you have such a grandmother, then you are entitled to play rugby for Scotland and, furthermore, entitled to be selected. This rule applies whether or not you have any knowledge of the game, although caution should be exercised before putting yourself on the national team. Rugby is a contact sport, and not everybody enjoys that sort of contact.Going back to the newly Irish.

But we are not.As the leader of the UK Government, she has spent the last two-and-a-half years developing a plan to fulfil the result of the Brexit referendum and leave the European Union. And, on this most important issue, she has failed. And failed spectacularly.Her Brexit deal met the biggest defeat for a British Government in more than a century, eclipsing the record of  held by Ramsay McDonald in .But the crises of recent times utterly pale in comparison to the situation Britain faces today. And, regardless of The Scotsman’s view, it appears likely that May will win a confidence motion in the Commons today, a bizarre prediction in keeping with the growing bizarreness of the situation.Ahead of last night’s vote, May told the Commons that her deal was the only option. After the vote, she said she would hold talks with MPs, thento the EU, suggesting she would look for another option. Jean-Claude Juncker, the European Commission president, noted the vote “with regret” and urged the UK to “clary its intentions as soon as possible”. One of the first things May should do – assuming she does survive today’s vote – is seek an extension of Article  because, as Juncker said, “time is almost up”. We need more of it. And the EU should accept that request. It would be in the economic interests of both parties, and also their political interests.: Theresa May’s Brexit deal overwhelmingly rejected by MPsSigns that the UK, one of the world’s biggest economies, is struggling to leave will act as a warning to other EU states thinking of doing the same.During that extension, May will clearly try to find a solution to break the impasse, but it seems unlikely the EU will make any signicant concessions.The  referendum was a hugely isive event, but the Government has done its best, in dficult circumstances, to honour the result. Unfortunately, there was always an element of fantasy about the promises of a “have our cake and eat it” deal from the likes of Boris Johnson. Regrettably, Jeremy Corbyn appears to have joined the fantasists’ ranks, claiming the UK could have a deal of that ilkonly he were Prime Minister.So it’s understandable that the vision which persuaded  per cent of people to back Brexit has not been turned into reality. And that means the Brexit question has now changed and, therefore, it requires a new answer from the people, expressed in a second EU referendum.: Brexit: Time for wishful thinking is over, Irish Government warns UKHowever, there are dangers associated with this course of action. Brexiteers who believed the issue was settled in  may feel aggrieved – and with some justication. There is a risk that some will boycott the vote, undermining the result. Others may decide that democracy has been betrayed and may – wrongly –conclude that unrest is therefore justied.Make no mistake, a badly handled second referendum would pose a serious threat to law and order in this country. Faith in democracy, a most important thing, could be badly damaged.In order to minimise the chaos involved, the question would have to be agreed with leading Brexiteers. Given a clear majority of MPs are opposed to a no-deal Brexit, hard Brexiteers may actually be sympathetic towards a second referendum that offers this choice as it seems like the only way this could happen. Speaking last night, Nigel Farage appeared open to the idea and suggested Leave would win a second referendum.Any ‘People’s Vote’ could not be a Remain stitch-up – or be seen to be one.©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4857068.1547586294!/image/image.jpg","title":"scotland faces loss of a modernist masterpiece martyn mclaughlin","story":"The demise of St Peter#s Seminary near Cardross would rob Scotland of an architectural wonder, writes Martyn McLaughlin.It was never intended as a great secular pilgrimage – quite the opposite, in fact – butyou veer off Carman Road, a country lane which ekes its way up the north bank of the Clyde, you can still discover one of the country’s th century marvels.When I first visited the former St Peter’s Seminary two decades ago, the path was less certain. Overhanging branches of yew trees obscured the route, with the invasive species of contemporary Scotland – glass Buckfast bottles and empty Tennents cans – dubious navigational aids. Along the way, however, there were abundant hints of wonder: sandstone gorges spanned by moss-flecked stone bridges, the ruins of a th century castle, and walled gardens which nature had long since robbed of their Victorian order.Yet nothing quite compared to the final reveal, when the unruly woodland seemed to thin out and bow in quiet reverence before the seminary itself, a building so out of place and time it makes Cardross feel like Scotland’s answer to Roswell.It is a journey that has been made over the past three decades by countless artists, designers, and writers intent on savouring a contested architectural masterpiece in person. How sad it is we can offer future generations no guarantee of following in their footsteps.The news coverage of St Peter’s earlier this week will be wearily familiar to those who have championed the building’s merits over the years. Its owners, the Catholic Church of Scotland, conceded it was in a state of limbo and faced an “impossible situation” in trying to secure a future for the site.: Church warns it is in impossible situation over seminary ‘albatross’Such a quandary has defined St Peter’s almost from its opening in . At its peak, it only ever housed little more than half the number of trainee priests it was intended for. By the time the Second Vatican Council decreed that the community, rather than isolated cloisters, was the best place for their education, the building’s fate was sealed.A short-lived rebirth as a drug rehabilitation centre offered some respite, but a building designed to do God’s work eventually went to the devil. In the years that passed, a host of unrealised solutions for St Peter’s were floated, but they were either drearily lumpenor fancul .Only in the past decade did a thoughtful and pragmatic blueprint emerge courtesy of Angus Farquhar’s NVA, one of Scotland’s most energetic and ambitious arts organisations. It moved mountains to turn St Peter’s into an arts and community facility through partial restoration and consolidation of the abandoned and careworn structure.Having secured millions of pounds in backing, it restored scores of the seminary’s vaults and rid it of hazardous material, even offering a hint of what might be possible with Hinterland, a spectacular  art installation which harnessed St Peter’s desolation as well as its energy.: Joyce McMillan: The closure of NVA is immensely sad, but the company leaves a lasting legacySadly, such promise went unfulfilled with NVA’s collapse last summer. The reasons for its demise are numerous, but included increased costs within the capital funding package and uncertainty over whether a Scottish Government loan could be repaid over the next quarter of a century. The nail in the coffin was being turned down for long-term funding by Creative Scotland, which put paid to any alternative plans for the site. Now, with St Peter’s abandoned once more, the church has described it as a “huge albatross around our neck”.Ronnie Convery, communications director at the Archdiocese of Glasgow, explained: “We can’t sell it, we can’t give it away, we can’t demolish it. We are in a Catch  situation. We would literally give it away for nothing but we can’t find anyone to take it off our hands.”On the one hand, the church deserves sympathy for its reluctant stewardship of the A-listed white elephant. It has indeed tried to give away the building, only for potential suitors to realise the extent of their obligations.Yet the church must also realise that even the promise of handing over an internationally signicant treasure for free is not enough. It will cost several million pounds on top of what NVA spent simply to make St Peter’s safe, and there are few bodies with that kind of money to spare. One of them, however, is the Archdiocese of Glasgow. It is currently sitting on more than £m in funds, as well as fixed assets and investment properties with a net book value of nearly £m. It is not duty bound to delve into its coffers to come to St Peter’s aid, but perhaps investing a modest sum towards its preservation is the only way it can finally be freed of its burden.There are glimmers of hope. Argyll and Bute Council has designated the land surrounding the seminary as an “area for action”, while Historic Environment Scotland is currently considering viable options for the building’s future at the behest of Culture Secretary Fiona Hyslop.Granted, the local authority barely has two pennies to rub together, while the quango is not in the business of saving derelict shells for the nation.Butthey and the church can work together, it may help broker some kind of compromise. No one realistically expects St Peter’s to be restored to its former majesty, but neither should we stand by while a slice of modernist brilliance disappears from view.©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4857076.1547587375!/image/image.jpg","title":"nicola sturgeon and alex salmond agree to co operate with holyrood inquiry","story":"Nicola Sturgeon and Alex Salmond are to be brought before a Scottish Parliament inquiry into the botched sexual harassment investigation into the ex-first minister. A Holyrood inquiry is to be established into the case that has rocked Scottish politics as revelations continue to emerge over secret meetings between the SNP#s two most senior figures about the claims.Relations between Ms Sturgeon and her predecessor have degenerated into open hostility amid claims of a “smear campaign” by the former leader, who alleges some iniduals are out to remove him as a political threat. A special committee of MSPs will be set up to look into the collapse of the government investigation after allegations by two women about Mr Salmond. He denies the claims. A separate police investigation in ongoing.The inquiry will examine the meetings between Ms Sturgeon and Mr Salmond while the Holyrood inquiry was under way and the process used by the civil service in handling the complaints. The new Holyrood investigation comes on top of an inquiry by an external  of advisers into potential breaches of the ministerial code of conduct after Ms Sturgeon referred herself to this body. A \u2028spokesman for Mr Salmond said: “Alex will be happy to co-operate, in principle andasked, with a parliamentary inquiry which seeks to examine how the administration of the Scottish Government could get itself into a position where the Court of Session had to rule that it had acted ‘unlawfully’, ‘unfairly’ and ‘tainted by apparent bias’.“We believe the Permanent Secretary should already have accepted the responsibility for that expensive farce, which has cost the Scottish people an estimated £,.“Everyone, those who complain and those complained about, has the right to the protection of a procedure which is fair, balanced, confidential and above all lawful.”The First Minister has previously made it clear she would co-operate with any inquiry held by MSPs into the case. The investigation was agreed by all parties on Holyrood’s business bureau yesterday, including the SNP.The SNP hierarchy has been plunged into open warfare after the collapse last week of a government internal inquiry into Mr Salmond over claims from female civil servants of sexual harassment relating to his time as first minister. Holyrood officials will prepare options on its remit and membership, which is likely to include measures to ensure it does not conflict with an active police investigation that is under way. The government conceded defeat last Tuesday after a legal challenge brought by Mr Salmond at the Court of Session when it emerged the head of the investigation, before being appointed, had been in contact with the women making the complaints about their cases.Scottish Conservative interim leader Jackson Carlaw said: “An investigation has been botched, two complainants have been let down and hundreds of thousands of pounds of taxpayers’ money has been wasted.“These are clearly matters for the Scottish Parliament to investigate and the inquiry must be able to examine what went wrong and why this was allowed to happen.“The setting up of the inquiry does not mean that legitimate questions cannot be asked – or answered – in the short term.”He added: “This scandal cannot be swept under the carpet. Parliament must, and now will, get the chance to probe this matter fully, learn lessons and ensure it can never happen again.”The affair has seen relations between Mr Salmond and Ms Sturgeon nosee, with the First Minister accusing her predecessor of a “smear campaign” over the meetings.Scottish Labour leader Richard Leonard described news of the Holyrood inquiry as a “positive step forward”.He said: “Full transparency in this matter is essential in order for the public to have confidence in the First Minister and the Scottish Government. That means full public and parliamentary scrutiny.“At all times it is essential to remember that at the centre of all of this are two courageous women who put their faith in a system that has badly let them down and we must never lose sight of that by safeguarding the duty of care to them and their access to justice.“We must restore trust and confidence in the system.”Liberal Democrat leader Willie Rennie said the police investigation must be the priority. “These complaints deserve to be thoroughly investigated by the police without political interference,” he said.©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"help for families feeling the pinch after christmas ","story":"The Scottish government plea is being made as it was revealed that about half a million people across the country are not claiming all the support they are entitled to.Impartial advice is available through the government-funded Financial Health Check scheme provided by Citizens Advice.The health checks were launched in November and cabinet secretary for communities Aileen Campbell said: “Too many people are not accessing everything they could be, and we want to ensure the right support is there to help people make the most of their financial situation.#The service will cover issues such as access to free school meals, benefit uptake, council tax reduction and cheaper deals on energy and other utilities to reduce household costs.“If you’re a parent struggling to make ends meet, you’re not alone.

The rig was still there on Friday .Alistair Philp, secretary of the North West Responsible Fisherman’s Association, praised KPL for the standard of communication with the affected fishermen.He said: “They have been pretty good with updating us. We have been getting passage plans and times and we have been disseminating that information out to the local fishermen.

However, so long as the OGW sticks to its route damage should be minimised.”Despite the optimism, Mr Philp said he wasn’t sure what “process or policy is in place” in the event of damaged or destroyed gear.He added: “I would suggest that, considering this the first time this has happened in over  years, we assess the outcome from the passage of the rig and then cross that bridge when we come to it. So far, the fishermen and KPL are working together to minimise disruption. Hopefully,there are any issues, they can be resolved in good faith afterwards.“Considering this may become a regular occurrence and some fishermen are dedicating considerable time to moving gear clear and then once the rig is in Kishorn will have to dedicate considerable time to reinstating their gear, it would only seem reasonable in future to consider our options for some sort of compensation for the disruption.”"},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_1376897.jpg--.jpg?1546959914000\n","title":"agewell partnership delivering handyman service to residents","story":"Mid  East Antrim Agewell Partnershipare a local charity working across Ballymena, Carrickfergus and Larne to support older people.

This is an issue which needs addressing and one which requires a Strategy, to be put in place.Whilst I like the idea of our local Assembly producing a strategy, it is vital that this statistic is reduced, drastically.”Ian’s we Beverley lost a family member over  years ago, through suicide. Beverley commented: “our family knows only too well the pain and heartache which family and friends endure, following such a tragic loss. For many years, you ask the question why.You also wonder,only they had engaged with someone, and that person had been able to offer some glimmer of hope, which resulted in them not pursuing their course of action. “There have been a number of suicides in our town recently and since the Samaritans are a wonderful organisation, who offer a tremendous telephone helpline service, we thought that it would be worthwhile to try and raise some funds, for this great charity.”The Samaritans’s vision is that fewer people die by suicide. They believe that it is time to look beyond the statistics and into the real lives of these people, so that they and others, can find ways, to reduce any unnecessary deaths. The Samaritans know that when people are in crisis, talking can help that person.Beverley added: “ the money raised at this event, can fund just one phone call to the Samaritans and the Samaritan at the other end of the line is able to provide some hope and results in one person not proceeding with their plan to take their own le,then this event will have been very worthwhile. “I would appeal to anyone who is facing dficulties, no matter what they are, to call the Samaritans on  . The Samaritans volunteers provide a listening ear,  days per year and you can call them any hour of the day, or night,”If you are able to help out in any small way, by baking a few scones tray bakes or by just coming along to have a cuppa and a scone and to give a donation, the organisers will certainly appreciate your kindness.IN PICTURES: Dromore High opens its doors to prospective pupils Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\""},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_auto,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.banbridgeleader.co.uk/webimage/1.8770151.1547557159!/image/image.jpg","title":"education  ","story":"Dromore High School recently welcomed prospective pupils to the school.

Schoolchildren, cyclists, runners, older people and people with acute medical conditions immediately spring to mind, but in fact I think everyone should carry an ICE Card. People don’t think twice about wearing a seatbelt or cycling helmet, butyou had a serious accident you’d like your next of kin to know as soon as possible and you’d want the best care possible in a medical emergency. Almost everyone carries a wallet or purse with them so this is the ideal place to keep an ICE Card”.Chief Inspector Barney O’Connor commented: “PSNI is fully supportive of this initiative which is straightforward, practical and user-friendly and provides families reassurance that a loved one has personal information accessible in all emergency situations. Ideal for use whether you are a student studying away from home, an older person or someone with a medical condition.”The ICE Card ensures all the essential information is accessible in one place meaning it could help save lives, provide the best help and care, as well as make sure your next of kin can be contacted promptly.Information about medications and allergies helps ambulance personnel make better decisions about treatments they can give you and crucially in the case of heavy blood loss, it is important for emergency staff to know your blood type. In the case of people with conditions such asAlzheimer’s it can help a person who may be confused contact their family and avoid any unnecessary distress.The cards are initially being rolled out at PCSP and PSNI engagement events and through groups.

Why  Because De Gaulle called it right. England doesn’t belong in Europe, remains Atlanticist, attached to imperial preference, consumed by the ‘great-game’ of ide-and-rule, of balancing powers in Europe, never committed to “ever closer union”, focused on financial chicanery over agriculture and manufacturing. Was De Gaulle wrong  After the illusion of the Edward Heath era, Britain was only ever in Europe to disrupt it. That game is now up.Whether through opt-outs or rebates, through Maastrict and Lisbon, England’s subsequent conduct in Europe has been as drag-weight and chief saboteur. On reunication, Francois Mitterrand sought to bind Helmut Kohl’s Germany to deepen the European core. British diplomacy embraced Eastern Europe to widen, make shallow and reduce it to free-trading nations. England weighed in under Ireland’s Pat Cox’s cloak to undermine the Commission, the EU’s centre of gravity. And the Jacques Delors social-Europe of the s gave way, under English influence, to free-market liberalism.Things turned with the creation of the Euro. Decisions, increasingly, were taken by the Eurozone. The capacity to disrupt waned, the mileage for further meddling ran out. Whether Little-England or Global Britain, Brexit was the means to get out, to save its soul, or lose the sense of itself. Will England’s dficulty be Northern Ireland’s opportunity I hope so. Northern Ireland is a profoundly dysal polity. Alone in Europe we cannot elect thegovernment. We can’t vote Labour. Conservatives don’t seek a mandate here. We can’t elect the government and more importantly, we can’t chuck a bad government out.Voting in the Northern Ireland entity is like going into the bookies and being told you can back any horse you want – except the horses that might win. We can vote for losers all day long, but not winners. After  years of Northern Ireland, we remain a quarantined zone, the UK’s political slum. Local government is through a Stormont-based native-council, or what apartheid-era South Africans called a Bantustan. Well subsidised, maybe, but a Bantustan nonetheless.As a long-time campaigner to normalise politics within the UK, that avenue is long closed, over, dead. The Brexit vote has allowed us to throw the balls in the air. ‘Creative-chaos’, the policy wonks call it. Or Tony Blair’s prophetic words, to shake the kaleidoscope, and re-order our world. After a change of government, a hard Brexit will allow us to re-join Europe through a border-poll. A hard Brexit will allow us to join an independent Irish state, whose government we can, at least, elect. A border poll, for people like me, is a vote to get the vote # for the first time ever. I’d do that in a heartbeat.The Deltapoll online poll published in September  asked the question: “Imagine now that the UK decided to leave the EU. Under these circumstances how would you vote in a referendum on the constitutional arrangements of the island of Ireland ”More than half, %, said they would vote for a united Ireland, while % said they would vote for Northern Ireland to remain part of the UK. In the event of a ‘hard’ Border, % said they would vote for unity, with only % voting to remain in the UK.The most recent Lucidpoll, published in December found, in the event of a ‘No-Deal’ Brexit, % would vote for unity, with only % to remain in the UK.These polling figures are unparalleled since partition.A hard Brexit will hasten the break up of the UK in other ways. Scotland will have a second independence vote, a second penalty kick to drt off, politically, towards Scandinavia. Whether they have the cojones to do so remains to be seen, but my vote for creative chaos gives them the chance.Hard Brexit will see the City of London diminish. The apex of an imbalanced economy, the ‘City’ is, effectively, a criminal paradise facilitating money-laundering, tax-evasion and the myriad dodgy financial products of predatory casino capitalism. Economists like the ’s Larry Elliot believe the shock-treatment of EU withdrawal could force Britain to focus on developing the real, productive, manufacturing base required to re-balance the economy.

Mrs May has called for politicians to back her deal or risk letting the British people down. But with many of her own MPs expected to join opposition parties to vote against the deal, it is widely expected to be defeated.MPs will also be able to suggest amendments that could reshape the deal before voting commences this evening.Sinn Féin President Mary Lou McDonald TD has said the EU backstop cannot be set aside or diluted.Speaking from Stormont after she and Sinn Féin Deputy Leader Michelle O’Neill met leaders of the north’s main political parties, Mary Lou McDonald said: #Whatever transpires at Westminster it is essential that Irish interests are protected that the economy is protected and that the Good Friday Agreement is protected in all its parts.#We have commitments from our partners at an EU level that the needs of this island north and south have been recognised and will be protected. Sinn Féin expects those commitments to be honoured and that is what we have been making clear to the Irish government and the EU.#There is no such thing as a good Brexit but the backstop is the bottom line. Anyone who imagines that can be unpicked or diluted or set aside isn#t dealing with the political realities. The DUP position on Brexit is reckless and irresponsible. It certainly is not in the interests of the people of the north of Ireland. I would urge all political leaders to act in the interests of workers, of communities, of society and political stability.”DUP Deputy Leader Nigel Dodds said that Mrs May should ask for and deliver changes to a Withdrawal Agreement. Despite a letter of supposed reassurance from the EU, he saidthere are “no legally binding assurances” as the Prime Minister talked about in December.“In fact, there is nothing new, nothing has changed,” he said. “Rather than reassure us, the Tusk and Juncker letter bolsters our concerns by confirming that everything the Attorney General said in his legal advice regarding the backstop, still stands, there has been no change to the Withdrawal Agreement and Northern Ireland would be subject to EU laws with no representation in Brussels. We would rely on the Dublin government to speak up for us. I stead of meaningless letters, the Prime Minister should now ask for and deliver changes to the Withdrawal Agreement.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"patricias latest work set to banish january blues with latest work","story":"MONDAY morning and a trip across the city to the old Belfast politan College on Tower Street ,whose beauty and hair salon is proving the perfect rehearsal space for Patricia Gormley’s latest work ‘Is That Too Hot ’Set in the world of hairdryers, rollers, straighteners and all things beauty, the hilarious sequel to ‘I’ll Tell My Ma’ is heading to The MAC stage this month to lt our spirits during the post-holiday slump.West Belfast scribe Patricia, who has performed her work across the city on many stages from the Cultúrlann to the Lyric, in her new play traces the antics of Granny Eileen, Davina Carina and Cha Marie as they stumble their way through another year in their ever turbulent lives as they pop in and out of their local hairdressers for a cuppa, a ‘curly blowdry’ and a catch-up.Starring Christina Nelson, who brought Patricia’s work and characters to le on the Lyric stage last year, and Roisin Gallagher, both actors told Daily Belfast how audiences are in for a treat when curtain comes up.“I play the character of Olive, in whose salon the stories of each character unfold in,” explained Roisin. “Olive has her own drama going on which the audience find out about throughout the piece. It is based on a real le person and hairdressers in the heart of West Belfast. It’s a brilliant observational piece and it’s a story about what happens at the heart of any community that has people who are lonely, struggling, having relationship problems and maybe don’t have anyone to speak to and are coming to this place for their own needs once a week. As Olive says in the play, “This place is like a psychiatrist’s couch, only they get to sit in a swivel chair. The character of Olive hears more about what is going on than the priest,” she laughed.Fresh from her stint as the white rabbit in the Lyric’s Alice the Musical, Christina Nelson is preparing to transform once again into a iety of roles for this sequel. “Granny Eileen, feisty as ever, is back, bless her, back from Turkey where she had a great old time. Cha Marie is back and Patricia has written a new character, Mrs Hughes, who is a bit of a prickly one and worth a watching.”Christina continued: “The energy with Roisin is brilliant, we are working brilliantly together and we are working our socks off to make sure those coming to see us will be laughing in their seats.“So much of everyday le is heard and discussed in the hairdressers, some people even just go to sit under the dryer to get a bit of heat, get a cup of tea brought to them. It’s very much a social thing and they are very much embedded throughout communities.”When asked about plans for a trilogy, Christina revealed that Patricia is “writing as we speak.” “Granny Eileen will definitely be back and there is more to come for these characters.”The new production will reunite Roisin with her recent Bah, Humbug! co-star Alan McKee, who this time will be sitting in the director’s chair. The former St Genevieve’s High School pupil will also be bringing her own work to The MAC stage in March with the self-penned Natural Disaster. “I wrote this piece, it’s what I would call a creative documentation, after my daddy passed away last Christmas. It’s like a journey through grief and I had documented things during that time that were said whether they were funny and sad. It’s not all doom and gloom, though, it’s how we look at grief, how we carry it with us and it will be great to perform it at The MAC following our run with this show.”“You can’t help but fall in love with these characters,” said Roisin. “It’s the perfect tonic for people needing a lt in January to put their worries away for an hour or two and come and see the show.”Is That Too Hot runs at The MAC from January  until February .

It must remain a credible backstop,” he said.That view was echoed by Irish foreign minister Simon Coveney who said Dublin was not prepared to consider alternatives to a backstop which it had taken two years to negotiate.“We’re not going to allow physical border infrastructure to reappear,” he told RTE.“I don’t think the EU is in any mood to change the Withdrawal Agreement signicantly at all.”"},{"url":null,"title":"scottish government to intensify calls for second brexit referendum","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

We want UK to stay in EU which is why we back a #PeoplesVote. But it is becoming increasingly clear that Scotland’s wider interests will only be protected with independence.— Nicola SturgeonJanuary , However Conservatives accused Ms Sturgeon of using the Commons vote defeat to push for a second independence referendum after she tweeted: “It is becoming increasingly clear that Scotland’s wider interests will only be protected with independence.”Ms Sturgeon spoke to Mrs May following Tuesday night’s historic defeat in the Commons – the biggest Government defeat on a meaningful vote for at least a century.She tweeted that while she had had talks with the PM, it was “not obvious that she has any real idea what to do next”.Ms Sturgeon added it was “not at all clear she  is open to any fundamental change of thinking in her proposed cross party talks”.“The reality is that a second EU referendum, with the option of remain on the ballot paper, is now the only credible option to avoid untold damage to the economy and the prospects of future generations.”– First Minister @NicolaSturgeon. pic VEWywQSPQ— Scottish GovernmentJanuary , In a letter to Mrs May, she repeated her call for the looming March  Brexit deadline to be extended as she pledged her administration will be stepping up efforts in support of a second European referendum.The First Minister was clear: “The Scottish Government believes that the best way of resolving the current impasse is to negotiate an extension to the Article  period and hold a second EU referendum.“Given the rejection of your deal we will now be intensying work towards the achievement of that aim.”She insisted the draft Brexit deal rejected by MPs would “make people poorer, damage our society and undermine the democratic decision of the people of Scotland to remain in the European Union”.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Theresa May and Nicola Sturgeon met in July , with the First Minister saying then she had been told the UK Government would be`open and flexible’ over Brexit. Almost two-thirds of Scots voted to stay part of the EU in , but Ms Sturgeon argued the Prime Minister had consistently failed to recognise this and had rejected Scottish Government pleas to remain in both the single market and customs union.The Tory Government at Westminster has “clearly failed to bring the country together” behind Mrs May’s deal, she added.Ms Sturgeon said: “It is time to recognise that reality and change course, starting with a new approach which seeks to find a way forward by genuinely involving the four nations of the UK.“Up until now, despite stated intentions, the UK Government has taken little or no account of the views of the people of Scotland or the position of the Scottish Government.”But Stephen Kerr, the Conservative MP for Stirling, told BBC Radio Scotland’s Good Morning Scotland: “The SNP has been clear again this morning by Nicola Sturgeon’s tweet, they are only interested in this subject for one reason and that is to bring about the second independence referendum.“Nicola Sturgeon was up at the crack of dawn on her way to London and she took time to tweet about a second independence referendum.”What will happen after the #Brexit vote On Tuesday, MPs will go into Parliament to vote on Theresa Mays withdrawal agreement. In this weeks summary I outline what I think will happen this week. #Stirling pic lmcexFdrqE— Stephen Kerr MPJanuary , Mr Kerr, who voted for the Withdrawal Agreement, added: “Whenever it looks like the SNP might be in a position where they are prepared to talk in substance about how we bring about an orderly Brexit, they change their position, because they are not interested in an orderly Brexit, what they are interested in is a chaotic Brexit.”Fellow Tory Douglas Ross, who voted against the Brexit deal, said: “The SNP don’t want a good deal or a deal at all.”He claimed Scottish Nationalists “want to disrupt Brexit as much as possible and use it as a tool to enhance their chances of holding and winning a second independence referendum”.But Ms Sturgeon warned that “in  days the UK could crash out of the EU without a deal”.Speaking on Sky News she said: “I do think now the only credible way for the UK as a whole is to put this back to the people in another referendum, to see whether knowing everything we now know that wasn’t known in , people still want to leave the EU.”She called on Mrs May to “not just plough on” with a “misguided approach” to Brexit, but instead urged the Prime Minister to “take a step back, get out of that and start to look at real alternatives for the way forward”.Ms Sturgeon also said: “Of course Scotland has another option and every day that passes now it seems ever clearer that the only way of protecting Scotland’s place in Europe and our wider interests is actually to be an independent country.”"},{"url":null,"title":"widespread frosts and wintry showers forecast as temperatures drop","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The artwork consists of an MP player containing only Africa, which was first released as a single in , linked to six speakers.“The song is put on loop and the installation runs on solar batteries to keep Toto going for all eternity,” Siedentopf wrote on his website.Siedentopf said the artwork was inspired by the ever growing popularity of the song, which was recently covered by both Weezer and Pitbull and has become a staple of bizarre internet cover versions and memes.He told NPR: “I was very intrigued by this and wanted to pay the song the ultimate homage and physically exhibit ‘Africa’ in Africa.“The Namibian desert — which is, with  million years, the oldest desert in the world — seemed to be the perfect spot for this.”Should fans wish to track the artwork down, Siedentopf has included a map to its approximate location on his website.That approximate location seems to take in the entire Namib desert, but the fact that Siedentopf grew up in Windhoek and installed the work while visiting family in Namibia might give a clue to a starting point for any search.This isn’t the first time that hard rotation of the Toto single has hit the headlines.Just a few weeks ago, DJ Michael Savage organised a charity club night in Bristol in which he played Africa on a loop for  hours."},{"url":null,"title":"nike unveils selflacing shoes controllable from a smartphone","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Nobody would mind paying to use an open, clean facility instead of going behind a tree..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"‘Utter confusion’ at bin collections and overfull skips  ","story":"RATEPAYERS across the district were left confused about alternative bin collection arrangements over the Christmas holiday period, according to a local politician.Mournes councillor Laura Devlin said there was also frustration that household recycling centres struggled to cope with the huge volume of waste and that many were forced to close early.Cllr Devlin has met with Newry, Mourne and Down Council officials to discuss the issue which resulted in what she described as ldquototal confusion over Christmas bin collections.She said she was inundated with queries about alternative household bin collections due to the bank holidays and claimed that residents did not receive direct communication from the local authority, with the onus on householders to check social media or press advertisements.ldquoThis simply wasnrsquot good enough and didnrsquot work, declared Cllr Devlin. ldquoIf the council is serious about recycling and ensuring that its targets are met, as well as delivering a fit-for-purpose service to ratepayers, we need to improve lines of communication with the public.ldquoThis utter confusion in respect of when bins were to be lted had a knock-on effect on the demand at the household recycling centres with skips filling up much quicker than usual and centres being forced to close.Cllr Devlin said staff at the centres in Castlewellan, Downpatrick and Ballynahinch worked very hard.ldquoFor these staff to be placed in the position of having to deal with many irate members of the public who had duly loaded their cars and travelled to the ious sites which were closed as the skips were full is far from acceptable, she continued.Cllr Devlin explained council officials had taken her concerns on board and had invoked what is being described as a ldquolessons learned exercise.A report on how the service can be improved due to be tabled at the next meeting of the councilrsquos Regulatory and Technical Services Committee.ldquoThe council previously issued collection schedules but these ran out last October. Advising people to check online is all well and good, but we still have many households who donrsquot have access to broadband and people who are not computer literate.ldquoThe council needs to reflect on this and act accordingly and I look forward to seeing these much-needed changes in advance of the next bank holiday, she added.A local authority spokeswoman said Newry, Mourne and Down District Council was aware of a number of issues affecting both the collection of bins, as well as the operation of its household recycling centres over the holiday period.She said the organisation was ldquoactively working to resolve these issues as a matter of urgency..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Aidan’s work to go on display at Down Arts Centre  ","story":"A LOUGHINISLAND artist famed for his colourful and lelike portrayal of animals is holding his first exhibition at Down Arts Centre.Thirty year-old Aidan Sloan, whose work also includes some locally renowned politicians, will have  pieces on display in the exhibition entitled, lsquoThis Wee Place Herersquo.The talented artist can certainly stretch his imagination to determine what kind of surface to paint on. He has used everything from boards, wooden planks, old suitcases, football tops and even an old Belfast sink for his masterpieces.Aidan, who is often seen at home in his studio with a paintbrush in hand and his six week-old baby daughter Siacutene lying across his shoulder, says he has loved drawing all his le.ldquoIt wasnrsquot until  that I took a career break from my job as a civil servant to look after my young family and try to turn my passion for art into a career, he remarked.ldquoSo far it is going from strength to strength. I fit painting and researching my work in between school runs and the daily routine of having four children.ldquoMy we, Deacutearbhla, and our four children are my inspiration, although I can draw creativity from the subject I am painting too. Sometimes other artists and genres inspire me and perhaps inspiration comes from the meaning behind the painting.ldquoTo be totally honest I just go with what feels right to me at the time. I have no training in art or qualications in art history, but rather I have developed my talent from experimenting with paints, canvases and subjects over the years.ldquoI really admire the work of Christian Hook and Angela Bell. They both have created their own wonderful styles that are unique to them and I would say I have created something of my own style too.The painter, who already has one piece of work hanging in the Ulster Museum as part of the annual Royal Ulster Academy of Arts exhibition, described his delight in seeing his familyrsquos artistic gene falling onto the next generation.ldquoMy three eldest children love art too and they have grown up watching me paint and produce art.ldquoMy youngest child, Siacutene, is only six weeks old but I am sure it wonrsquot be long until she has a paintbrush in her hand. My eldest son, Ethan, won the Art Shield when he left primary school, and my daughter, Riacuteoghnach, who has epilepsy and autism, uses art as a therapeutic way to relax.ldquoHaving them watch me paint is also an inspiration and I feel it demonstrates to them that you should follow your passion and dreams, no matter what.Aidan has some of his own favourites in display at the exhibition, including lsquoBlending In, which is an acrylic painting of a hare on an old loft door, and a portrait of the late David Ervine, former PUP leader, which is acrylic paint and pencil on the inside of an old fishing wader.Heavily influenced by farming and all things agricultural, it comes as a surprise to learn the Co Down artist didnrsquot grow up on a farm.ldquoI often help my brother-in-law out on his farm and quite a few of his cows have become the subject of many of my paintings, he said.ldquoThere was something about the characters of animals that I really felt I could utilise in my paintings. Then I began to produce portraits of people with pencil, and my we encouraged me to try painting them a few years ago.ldquoI am Loughinisland, through and through. This has actually inspired one of the pieces of artwork that will be on display. The exhibition gives an insight into my depiction of growing up in Northern Ireland post-troubles.ldquoIt contains many animals from Northern Ireland, but I have also reflected on some things such as landscapes, political figures and events that had some sort of impact on me when I was growing up.ldquoWhen I was in primary school I loved art and I kept a booklet from P where I said that I wanted to grow up to be an artist. It wasnrsquot until I was in my late s, and with a lot of encouragement from my we, that I realised I could make a career out of something I had always done as a hobby.bull Aidanrsquos work can be admired throughout the month of January up to February  at Down Arts Centre and admission is free..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Devlin and Quinn selected by SDLP for upcoming elections  ","story":"THE SDLP has chosen sitting councillors Laura Devlin and Brian Quinn to defend their seats in the Mournes district electoral area at the forthcoming local government elections.Their nomination was confirmed at a recent selection meeting when the party also confirmed its candidates in the Downpatrick, Rowallane and Slieve Croob areas.Candidates for the Newry, Crotlieve and Slieve Gullion area will be selected shortly as the SDLP aims to increase its membership on Newry, Mourne and Down Council.Cllr Devlin said it had been her ldquotremendous honour to serve the people of the Mournes DEA over the past five years.ldquoAs someone who grew up with a strong sense of community and reconciliation, I believe the policies I have pursued during my years on council have adequately reflected that, as have the results, she explained.ldquoThis year will be busy as I am expecting another baby as well as contesting an election. But I enjoy a challenge and I hope that my constituency work on the ground spanning the past  years will stand by me as we approach polling day.Cllr Quinn said there was much more work to be done and he trusted that the public willboth him and his party colleague in the Mournes area to continue with this vital task.He added: ldquoI look forward to continuing to represent the needs of the public at council and ensuring that nobody is left behind.South Down MLA Colin McGrath paid tribute to the ing local government candidates.

An engineer explained that a conductor on a transformer, which had probably been smouldering due to a layer of snow or ice, caught fire.Carryduff, the highest point between Belfast and the Mourne mountains, had falls of up to six inches and drts were reported as deep as one and two feet in some areas.Ballynahinch had several inches fall inside an hour and this worsened as snow continued to fall. Dromara got it bad yet again and Comber reported several inches.The Department of the Environmentrsquos snow ploughs were in use at Carryduff, Ballynahinch and Dromara, and gritting machines were needed on many local roads.In Downpatrick and coastal districts there was sleet and heavy rain mdash and roads were made treacherous when this turned to ice yesterday morning. There was a spate of minor accidents as cars slithered through the snow and ice.Roads are being gritted by the DOE, but owing to decreasing fuel and salt they have only been treating priority roads.CROSSGAR mdash Crossgar is taking part in an appeal organised by the BBC programme Blue Peter, which will help provide bicycles for villages in Africa.The campaign, which involves the collection of stamps on Christmas card envelopes, is already well underway and these will be sold to buy bicycles which will help with transporting medical aid in remote African villages.Anyone in the Crossgar area who wants to help with appeal can leave their contributions at the Post Office.DOWNPATRICK mdash Representatives of Downpatrick organisations are asked to turn their backs on the wintry weather and go to the townrsquos library for a public meeting to consider plans for a major Maytime festival.A steering committee, which was born out of ideas kicked around by Down Councilrsquos arts committee more than a year ago, will present good thinking on how a wholehearted three-day festival of family fun will put the town in holiday form as never before.The centrepiece of the holiday weekend will be a pageant with a Patrician theme and possibly a medieval type flavour. Jousting is a distinct possibility and so are a number of other unusual dimensions.Although it will be called St Patrickrsquos Festival, the steering committee believe that a Maytime date would be better favoured by the weather than one on March  and would allow them to provide a much wider range of outdoor and indoor attractions.KILLYLEAGH mdash A Stormont Minister is to be asked to prevent the extension of a caravan park near Killyleagh.The unprecedented step is being taken by Down Council in protest against a recommendation made by planners to allow the development at East Down Yacht Club.

Because of the work to rule action by watermen, it meant the problem was not dealt with for several days.As a result families living near Tullymurray were without water since Christmas Day.PORTAFERRY mdash Stage two of a new sewerage scheme for Portaferry is expected to get underway in May and should take four months to complete.The Department of the Environmentrsquos Eastern Division Water Service has announced that the second of three contracts is now being advertised and work will involve the construction of a pumping station.

Joe is a very experienced performer, both as a solo artist and fronting his own band.A lot of the experience that shows through in Joersquos personal appearances was picked up during a three-year period touring the working menrsquos clubs circuit in England, Wales and Scotland, where he appeared alongside a great many of the artists regularly seen on television.SPORT mdash Outdoor sporting organisations, already facing fixture backlogs due to rain, snow, ice and frost over the past number of weeks, are now facing another problem mdash how to find petrol to get them to their matches.Most clubs find themselves in the predicament of not having the petrol to travel to away games and already one soccer league has decided to postpone all of this Saturdayrsquos fixtures, even though it throws the fixture list into further chaos.Soccer clubs have already been hit severely by weather conditions over the past number of weeks and now some are hoping that the governing body will see fit to extend the season into May.

She always kept a respectful distance unless you had some Nutella.Describing the vixen as very friendly, Aileen continued: ldquoOne of the ladies I play with always kept food in her bag.

One of the biggest problems the local authority has to tackle is the hardcore of dog owners who point blankly refuse to clean up after their pets.Details of the new initiative were unveiled a few weeks ago. This week council officials confirmed that the campaign will be officially launched at the end of June.With the rates process well underway to determine the local authorityrsquos budget for the new financial year, councillors have agreed to make provision for new advertising and publicity campaigns as they bid to get on top of the dog fouling problem. Advertising the campaign on radio is also planned.Councillors and local authority officials are becoming increasingly concerned that a number of dog owners are prepared to turn a blind eye to potentially harming children who come into contact with the mess their animals leave behind.With the new campaign aimed at changing minds, dog owners will be reminded that it is their responsibility to clean up after their dogs and that not doing so leaves them open to an pound fine.Councillors say they are frustrated at the ldquoblatant disregard some dog owners and ratepayers are displaying and are keen to finally address the dog fouling issue.With a number of notable dog fouling hot spots across the district, the local authority is determined to do all it can to tackle the problem, given that it does nothing to enhance the districtrsquos image.Rowallane councillor Billy Walker, who is severely critical of dog owners who do not clean up after their pets, hopes the new initiative will be a success.ldquoThis campaign is long overdue and I hope that the small number of dog owners who break the law by not cleaning up after their pets will get the message that their behaviour is inexcusable, he said.ldquoDog fouling is a problem in many areas, even in my home town of Killyleagh. We are talking about a district-wide problem which we have not yet been able to get to grips with. People should not have to constantly watch their step while out walking and while many dog owners are careful to clean up after their pets, there are those who donrsquot care.Cllr Walker said improving the districtrsquos cleanliness was at the heart of the new campaign.He said that while reminding dog owners to clean up after their dogs was important, one way of dealing with the problem was hitting them in the pocket with a fine.He added: ldquoI have always said dog owners who break the law should be lsquonamed and shamedrsquo and still hold this view. Letrsquos hope that when this new campaign is launched it will be a success and help tackle a problem which is a scourge on this district..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Irish Street traders need consulted about scheme  ","story":"A LEADING politician has backed calls for improved communication with Downpatrickrsquos business community following a series of pre-Christmas incidents.Over  spaces at the Irish Street car park were temporarily unavailable at what is traditionally the busiest trading week of the year after contractors sealed off an area to allow a large lorry to deliver granite paving stones.The move left business owners furious and to compound their frustration, several spaces in Irish Street were sealed off to allow the large lorries to safely turn into the car park.Contractors also arrived in Market Street just days before Christmas to replace a section of granite paving which led to minor disruption, while much of the nearby Lower Market Street car park was under several feet of water due to flooding.The granite paving was being transported to Downpatrick ahead of work starting on Monday on a near pound, environmental improvement scheme in Irish Street.Politicians described the temporary loss of parking spaces just days before Christmas as ldquoextremely unfortunate and insisted that traders should have been told what was happening.This week, South Down MLA Colin McGrath confirmed he has written to business owners in Irish Street traders in the wake of the pre-Christmas debacle.He said: ldquoThe situation which arose in the run-up to Christmas was something of a perfect storm. Part of Irish Street was sealed off, spaces in the nearby car park were temporarily unavailable, contractors were working in Market Street and much of the Lower Market Street car park was under several feet of water.ldquoThere were ious causes for these issues from early delivery of stone pavements for Irish Street works, flood water in the town and emergency work to kerbs, but we must have better coordination between authorities and there must simply be better communication with businesses in the town.Mr McGrath said he has written to businesses and forwarded his contact details should there be further issues as a temporary one-way traffic system comes into operation in Irish Street during work on the environmental improvement scheme.ldquoI have also written to the districtrsquos isional roads manager outlining my concerns. Newtownards, Bangor or Newry would not face public authority road blockages in the lead up to Christmas. Why should Downpatrick Mr McGrath said he wanted assurances that communication with the business community will improve and that work which has the potential to disrupt businesses will be kept to the absolute bare minimum over the coming weeks in Irish Street.The Department for Communities and Newry, Mourne and Down Council are jointly funding the environmental improvement scheme which will result in one traffic lane being closed during the work to facilitate the contractor.The work mdash which includes new granite footpaths, lighting and street furniture mdash is due to be completed before the end of the financial year and is designed to help regenerate Irish Street, providing a boost for traders and residents.Politicians are also confident the scheme can help arrest decline in an area where the presence of the townrsquos former police base was a major impediment to investment over many years..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Jane Coyne’s The Suitcase comes to Down Arts Centre  ","story":"DOWN Arts Centre is hosting The Suitcase next month.The highly acclaimed production by Jane Coyle takes to the stage on Sunday, February , at pm and tickets are now available.The play was premiered at the Belfast synagogue for the  Belfast International Arts Festival and won the Audience Award.Now, in response to popular demand, it is being revived and toured around Northern Ireland during this yearrsquos Holocaust Memorial Day commemorations.The storyline moves between s Vienna and modern day Belfast.

The congestion also blocks access at the crossroads to Kilclief and Ballyhornan.Cllr Enright said the problem had been ldquogrinding on for a number of years and could no longer be ignored.He said it was no longer acceptable to say that roads congestion in Strangford and the problems on the Portaferry side were not the Department for Infrastructurersquos responsibility.He added: ldquoFerry service managers insist that the congestion in Strangford is not a matter for them, but for their roads counterparts.ldquoBoth departments are under the Department of Infrastructure which is why it is vital we meet with the Permanent Secretary to seeheads can be banged together and any budgetary issues resolved.Cllr Gareth Sharvin said there had been many occasions where vehicles queuing to use the ferry service in Strangford had a dramatic impact on the village.He added: ldquoThere is a perfectly good traffic flow system already in place which is not being utilised by drivers. We need to ensure there is enough resource to accommodate ferry traffic flow and demand to minimise the impact on Strangford residents.Cllr Billy Walker suggested the provision of a bridge linking Strangford and Portaferry should perhaps be considered.Cllr Enrightrsquos motion was also supported by Cllrs Willie Clarke, Jill Macauley and John Trainor..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Mahon Cup success for disciplined St Michael’s  ","story":"THE final of the long-standing Mahon Cup was played out before an appreciative crowd in the Drumaness clubrooms just before Christmas.In the final were holders St Michaelrsquos from Downpatrick and Queenrsquos Hall from Newtownards.League sponsor Gary Rodgers conducted the draw for the match pairings, which saw Gareth McKeever up first against Alastair McDonald and Bobby Douglas taking on Keith Lemon.McDonald got into his stride the quicker and soon built up a good lead over Gareth at  points to .

There was no school reputation, no building, no funding, no resources. They were unbelievable and were really pioneering.Naturally delighted with the honour mdash the first in her family mdash Mrs Roulston says that she shares it with a lot of people.ldquoThroughout my career, I have worked alongside so many wonderful and dedicated people, committed to making a dference to the lives of the children and to ensuring that they received the very best possible education in the widest sense of the word mdash teachers, assistants, dinner ladies, caretakers, volunteer parents and members of the board of governors, etc, she said.ldquoSo, on the day that I receive my MBE, I will be paying honour to all the people I have known and worked with and all those from other schools and sectors who show dedication and commitment to the children in our schools.The little people who she had the pleasure of teaching until she retired in  will always have a special place in  year-old Mrs Roulstonrsquos heart.ldquoI would like to thank all the children, those I have taught and also those whom I had the pleasure of knowing for all that they have taught me, for the pleasure they have given me throughout my career, for all the funny things they said or did which brightened up my day, for their kindness to me in all the drawings and little hand-made crafts they made for me.Originally from outside Manchester, Mrs Roulston has lived and worked in the south Down area from the late s after marrying her husband, Mervyn.After teaching practice in England and teaching in two very dferent schools in France, Mrs Roulston taught for some years in Greyabbey and Portavogie Primary Schools, as well as the Rupert Steiner School in Belfast, before taking a career break while raising her three sons mdash John, Peter and Timothy mdash in Kircubbin.ldquoI did a lot of cross-community work at that time as chair of the parent and toddler group, said Mrs Roulston.ldquoI also formed and chaired a community association and did a lot of work together cross community to get facilities for Kircubbin. It wasnrsquot a paid job but it was an important part of everything and I believe itrsquos where I first understood that cross-community work was so important.While working in Portaferry Primary School in the late s, she was fascinated on learning about a group of parents in Carryduff campaigning for an integrated primary school.ldquoI was reading all about it in the local newspaper and it was very interesting to me, but it was hot and heavy as well as there was lot of objection to the school, she said.ldquoI never dreamt that I would apply for it or have anything to do with it. But I did apply as it was a teaching principalship and it was working with both sides of the community as all the work I had done with cross-community work just kept saying to me, lsquoThis is really important work, this needs to be done to break down barriersrsquo.The road to establishing Millennium was far from smooth, however, as the grandmother of three can testy.ldquoYou just wouldnrsquot believe the terrible trouble we had and itrsquos hard to believe now what happened, said Mrs Roulston.ldquoDays before we were due to open, I had  primary ones and no funding and no site as there was a lot of opposition to establishing the school where we had originally planned to in the Carryduff area.ldquoWe ended up down at Breda Park, close to Forestside in Belfast in an old heath trust building. We initially rented it for six months but ended up staying for two yearsldquoWe were in a very derelict, vandalised, dirty building which we all very quickly had to work very hard get it up to scratch for the children.ldquoWe all had to break down barriers in many areas.Together with P classroom assistant, Mrs Marie Coiley, who still works at Millennium, they began to establish a school with an emphasis on total inclusiveness from the start.ldquoIt was very important to me that the school would be child-centred and the children would have a voice, explained Mrs Roulston.ldquoIt would not only be integrated in the whole Catholic-Protestant area but integrated at every level and it would be highly inclusive and children of all abilities and backgrounds would be welcome.After dficult early years in the Breda Park site, she believed that the school finally turned a corner when it secured a site in Carryduff to build around mobile classrooms in its third year.ldquoI always knew it was going to work, I knew it was needed and I knew that I was determined and the others around me were also very determined, said Mrs Roulston.ldquoIrsquove always been a very determined person and Irsquove alway never liked inequality or injustice of any kind.ldquoIt was very important to me that it happened and I was surrounded by some amazing parents who eventually became the board of governors.Shersquos rightly proud of her achievements and adds: ldquoI know I did good work.ldquoI must say there were days when myself and Mrs Coiley would often look around during assembly at all the children and all of the staff and wonder how did we get here.Now a director of the Integrated Education Fund, Mrs Roulstonrsquos hope for the future is to see a planned integrated school.ldquoIntegrated education is a growth area and I would like to see a situation the Department of Education and the Education Authority actually decide to plan an integrated school and not to be relying on parents having to fight for them.ldquoAll our grant maintained integrated schools have had horrendous journeys to succeed..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Tally’s Down torment continues  ","story":"DOWN fell to their second successive McKenna Cup defeat when Donegal proved too strong for Paddy Tallyrsquos side in front of just over , spectators at Pairc Esler on Sunday.The Down manager made several changes from the side that started against Cavan as he continues in his bid to unearth some fresh talent, but it was Donegal and their new faces that impressed.The visitors registered the first score when Niall OrsquoDonnell converted in the first minute.

It aims to maximise independence, which research has shown is the outcome that matters most to people.The project is informed by a similar initiative developed in Canterbury, New Zealand and has a number of key elements which will improve how health and social services work together.Some these elements include a well-being website which will link services across the community and allow health and social care professionals to share information about patients and multi-disciplinary teams.During a visit to Redlands Surgery in Penarth last week, Mr Gething met members of the Cardf and Vale team and some of the team visiting from New Zealand to see the development of the project.Mr Gething said: ldquoWith an increase in le expectancy and our continued public health challenges, our health and social care services will continue to face increasing pressures. This is why, in our long term plan for health and social care, we have set out the need to truly transform the way we deliver care to ensure it is sustainable in the future.\"This will require better integration of health and social services to reduce reliance on hospitals and deliver care closer to home. The Transformation Fund will be used to fund a small number of projects which have the most impact in developing and delivering new models of care, and which have potential to scale up so they can be used across Wales.\" article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

The site will potentially generate up to  new work positions across management, supervisory, warehousing staff and apprenticeship roles.Speaking of the new facility and what it will bring, Mr Rattenbury said: ldquoWe are delighted that our vision of a lsquoone stop shoprsquo for our customers is being realised and having a  hour, seven day a week co-packing facility in the heart of Wales, is a game changer for our industry. We can now offer our customers a streamlined product supply chain package by integrating their co-packing requirements with the grouprsquos warehouse and transport subsidiary companies.ldquoLogistically, this works out to be more cost effective overall, but also lowers the carbon footprint on the transportation of food products, which is something we are passionate about.Wild Water Group has a current annual turnover of poundm and Mr Rattenbury believes the company can increase that figure by a further poundm within  months and then reach poundm within two to three years.The project is backed by a pound. million investment from Lloyds Bank Commercial Banking and the Development Bank of Wales and has secured Welsh Government funding under the new economic contract.Using a similar business model to the grouprsquos other three sites in Merthyr Tydfil, Llanishen and Cardf Bay, the first phase of development will be the conversion of available space into a large ambient open plan co-packing facility, which will be operational early November  to meet festive season demand.During the first quarter of , Wild Water Group will move the entire Cardf Bay co-packing facility to Aberbargoed, once freezer facilities, production lines and machinery are in place.The company will then continue services such as frozen to frozen storage, bagging, over wrapping, sleeving and tray sealing, as well as the full spectrum of print labelling applications required under the Food Safety Technicalspecications.Economy Secretary Ken Skates said: ldquoThis project will not only see a successful, growing Welsh business create an additional  jobs, it will also create a new strategic hub and facility for both large and small food and drink businesses across the region to pack or store products themselves. This could, in turn, open up new markets for those businesses ndash so Irsquom excited about what this means not only for Wild Water Group and Aberbargoed, but for the region more widely.ldquoIt shows that both our Economic and Food and Drink Action plans are delivering what we had hoped ndash jobs, prosperity and sustainable growth. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

The Lurgan campus has long been regarded as wholly inadequate in terms of facilities.Parents at Monday night’s meeting voiced their opposition to the plans amid calls for the children from the Lurgan campus to be accommodated at Lurgan Junior High School in an - school - retaining academic selection at age  for pupils to move on to Lurgan College.Parents were warned ‘not to be bamboozled by figures’ after EA officials outlined the case for their proposals and their reasons for rejecting other alternatives.Indeed there were weary laughs of derision as EA official Michael McConkey outlined the advantages or the Portadown solution and the Lurgan option - with a much shorter list for the Lurgan case. One parent pointed out many of the points made in favour of Portadown could - and should - be included in the case for Lurgan.A former governor at Craigavon Senior High and also a governor at the junior High, Mr Tom McKay, questioned a £. million deficit that officials said the senior high was running at.Stressing he was speaking in a personal capacity he asked what proportion of that deficit was due to pupil fluctuations in a two year school, pointing out: “Some will be due to running a split site school, but not all.”He went on to say: “Running a two year school was always going to be a risky business.”He pointed to the effect fluctuating pupil numbers could have as they could lose  pupils in a year which could have a signicant impact on the school budget.He added: “You talk about moving pupils to Portadown but its still going to be a two year school, it is always going to be subject to times of stress.”One key point of the discussions with regard to the ‘Lurgan solution’ was the EA’s insistence on protecting the Dickson Plan - which sees academic selection delayed to age  in this area. Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"PORT | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"PORT | Article Teaser\"The EA pointed to a statement made by DUP Education Minister Peter Weir on June ,  in defence of the Dickson Plan.He said at that time: “I want to assure people locally that I will be offering support and assurance for the continuation of the Dickson Plan system, and will be ushering in a period of educational stability on the issue. This is something that works, and so I will ensure that the Dickson Plan is not removed either directly or undermined through stealth, and that any threat is now lted.”Mr McKay: “We are paving over the cracks and stripping Lurgan of all these young people and all to satisfy the statement of a minister.“To say creating an - school in Lurgan could be perceived as weakening the Dickson Plan - that is very suspect. I support the Dickson Plan in as far as the Dickson Plan is selection at . This is not a detraction from the Dickson Plan.”It was a point which struck a definite chord with those at the meeting who applauded his remarks. He added the Dickson Plan did need to be changed with the colleges in Lurgan and Portadown taking more than the average number of pupils while the senior high school pupils were the “most vulnerable in society.”He commended the work done by the teachers at the senior high: “If it wasn’t for their hard work it would have failed long ago.”Another parent pointed to Peter Weir’s remarks and said: “Do not hold us to ransom for a man who was in a government that doesn’t exist anymore.”A number of speakers articulated the Lurgan solution while other expressed their practical concerns over bussing children to Portadown - especially from outlying villages.One pointed out: “A review is being carried out which could see bus passes taken away so it could cost you £ a year to get a child to a school you did not choose.”The EA officials stated the consultation was the start of the process rather than the end but a decision would be based on educational considerations rather than weight of numbers.try catch  TrendingOutrage as dirty needles found near play areaPolice hunt lsquoMike Tysonrsquo wannabe after manrsquos ear bitten in attackDamaged roof leads to part of Craigavon shopping centre being cordoned offBoyarrested on suspicion of carrying an offensive weapon close to a school arrested on suspicion of carrying an offensive weapon close to a school\"Shock and disbelief after kids fire massive kne at door of family home          ..

We believe this is the trend to track in  and beyond as investors across the UK and globally continue to look for opportunities in this area. “However, on a more positive note, we are seeing strong interest from a wide spectrum of investors for office investments in Belfast which is being driven by growing rents and demand, combined with limited supply of high-quality accommodation.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/34344455.jpg","title":"delta air lines buying  new airbus jets","story":"Posted on Monday January  by Ulster Business US carrier Delta Air Lines is buying an additional  part-Belfast made passenger planes, it has emerged.

Ann McGregor, chief executive of Northern Ireland Chamber of Commerce and Industry “The business communities that we represent have always had a erse range of views on what form the UK’s future relationship with the EU should take, however they do agree on the need to avoid a messy and disorderly Brexit. “To achieve this we therefore need an agreement that will secure the transition period and protect jobs. As businesses wait to see what happens next in Parliament, it is crucial that those at Westminster move beyond tactical manoeuvring and look at all the options in order to avoid a ‘no deal’s scenario. “Firms are in the dark on too many aspects of le after March . This has already led to many businesses taking action – pausing on recruitment and investment, stockpiling goods, and relocating factories in other parts of the EU. In fact, a third of NI Chamber members are currently putting growth and investment plans on hold in the absence of clarity from Westminster. There is however nothing to stop government acting decisively on areas within their control, such as migration and customs procedures.”  Aodhan Connolly, director of the Northern Ireland Retail Consortium “The result this evening will be a cause for concern across the Northern Ireland business community. Northern Ireland businesses desperately need certainty about the UK’s future trading relationship with the EU and will be severely disadvantaged by a no deal. A no deal Brexit means that Northern Ireland households will face higher prices and less choice on the shelves something they can ill afford. “Se need politicians  to coalesce around a workable solution that protects consumers from the costs and disruptions due to the loss of tarf-free and frictionless trade we currently enjoy with partners in the EU. We are now closer than ever to the possibility of a no-deal that will be a disaster for Northern Ireland.” “  Angela McGowan, CBI Northern Ireland director “Every business will feel no deal is hurtling closer. A new plan is needed immediately. This is now a time for our politicians to make history as leaders. All MPs need to reflect on the need for compromise and to act at speed to protect the UKs economy. “No deal would immediately put Northern Irish jobs and businesses at risk and jeopardise years of positive economic development and integration across the island.  It must be avoided to protect our all-island economy.”  Glyn Roberts, Retail NI chief executive “This is a disappointing but not unexpected result. While the Prime Minister’s draft Withdrawal Bill was in no way perfect, it was definitely preferable to crashing out of the EU with no deal. “The Government now needs to work on a cross-party basis with Labour and other opposition parties to reach a broader agreement for a withdrawal deal and secure the transition period, protect jobs and a positive future relationship with the EU  Colin Neill, chief executive, Hospitality Ulster “Leaving the EU without a deal would damage the sustainability of the Hospitality industry and impact on the potential growth of Tourism in Northern Ireland. We appeal to our elected representatives to work together in a spirit of consensus government to ensure that a no deal scenario does not happen.”  Tina McKenzie, FSB NI policy chair “With the clock ticking down to Brexit Day in just  weeks, we are running out of time to avoid a clf-edge, no-deal outcome. “A disorderly exit from the EU would be deeply damaging for small businesses, causing disruption to supply chains, increasing costs and stling investment. “A no-deal is something which we simply cannot countenance, so it is imperative that political leaders sharpen their focus and do all they can to reach agreement in the short time available.”  View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
