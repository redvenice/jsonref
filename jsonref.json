Would trophy hunting and culling stop elephants over-running the place? Certainly there are those who say it would. Not only that, they claim it would stop poaching too.Professor Keith Somerville, a fellow of London\u0027s Zoological Society and an expert on conservation in Africa, has pointed out that hunting safari operators efficiently policed their shooting areas to keep out poachers.Today, the criminals can slip in easily to Botswana from neighbouring countries and kill with near-impunity. Dr Chase\u0027s charity, for example, has revealed that it counted 87 recently killed elephant carcasses in northern Botswana during one aerial survey last year, higher than previous counts. Many were in the Okavango Delta, the epicentre of the Botswana tourist industry, which without hunting concentrates on photo-safaris.         Farmers used to receive a share of the country\u0027s income from big game tourism — a trophy hunter can pay £45,000 to shoot one animal, but today they get nothingHorrifyingly, the report included 63 pages of pictures of dead elephants, many with their tusks brutally hacked off and said to have been killed by poaching and ivory-trading networks.Most demand for elephant ivory comes from Asia. And while the international trade in ivory has been banned since 1990, illegal sales are flourishing still to Hong Kong, Japan, the United States and China, where the black market price of a big bull\u0027s pair of tusks can top £30,000.But it is the devastating impact of elephants on Botswana\u0027s people and the landscape they live in that really concerns the country\u0027s government. On the outskirts of the Moremi game reserve, which includes part of the Okavango Delta, there are hundreds of the animals.They wander across the road, eat at the grass verges, and push over trees as they march from waterhole to waterhole with the tourist cameras following their every move.So many photo-tourists visit Africa — and particularly Botswana — that their presence stresses out elephants, making them violent towards humans and each other, a new report said this week.Published by Liverpool\u0027s John Moores University, it warned that elephants\u0027 health is endangered as resting or feeding herds are disturbed by trucks of tourists.The conflict between growing elephant numbers and humans was highlighted in a letter to the Times newspaper a few weeks ago.         Most demand for elephant ivory comes from Asia. And while the international trade in ivory has been banned since 1990, illegal sales are flourishing still to Hong Kong, Japan, the United States and China, where the black market price of a big bull\u0027s pair of tusks can top £30,000London businessman Richard Colgan wrote: \u0027Having recently returned from a safari in the Okavango Delta region, I can confirm the damage to the bush caused by the ever-increasing elephant population. The landscape, at times, resembled a bleached First World War battlefield with splintered and dying trees as far as the eye could see, all the result of the catastrophic damage caused by the elephants.\u0027As the elephant population there grows unchecked, conflicts with the country\u0027s relatively small human population grow acute. \u0027All the locals I met were fully supportive of a programme of elephant control (by allowing hunts and commercialising the meat produced).\u0027Botswana is a democratic country that cares deeply about its wildlife. We (in the West) should not criticise its moves to deal with something that is a threat . . . this is their \u0027backyard\u0027 after all, not ours.\u0027Few iniduals would agree more wholeheartedly than 70-year-old farmer Boitshwarelo Seeptetswe, whom I found sitting with his wife, Atsile, under an awning in the middle of fields in the Okavango Delta, 16 miles from the village of Tubu where they have a small house.The couple travelled here by donkey cart and have put up a bell tent beneath the awning so they can stay overnight to try to fend off elephants from the 15-acre patch.Mr Seeptetswe tries to grow maize and pumpkins to feed his family. \u0027But now the elephants come and eat our crops. They have been here more times than I can count. The last time was two nights ago.\u0027They take what they want and we have to sit here and watch. We try to frighten them off by burning rubbish, but they are not scared of humans anymore\u0027, he tells me sadly in his threadbare and ripped work trousers.          Father Mange, his wife Omphemetse Mange (right), her husband Father Mange and friend Ntshonga Mabi walk back to their encampment with damaged pumpkins\u0027Nearly everything that we have grown they have eaten. We are having to buy the grain and vegetables that we would have taken home from this land, food that would keep our family all year.\u0027Yet this land was first ploughed by my forefathers. There were no elephants then. It is a new thing that has happened since they banned the hunting.\u0027Mr Seeptetswe cannot shoot the elephants that plague their lives because farmers — like safari tourists — are bound by the no-hunting rules.His son-in-law, Father Mange who is 44, takes up the tale. \u0027Last summer, I was at a hut I use some nights to watch over my cattle and goats.\u0027I was outside feeding the goats at 6.50 in the morning at the front of the hut when I heard an elephant burst through my fence and go to the back of the hut, which is only made of reeds and thatch.\u0027He stood there watching me. I ran back to the front door and hid inside. I could hear him rampaging behind me. I did not dare move. I was very afraid and did not come out for a long time that morning until it had gone quiet.\u0027The elephants have also traumatised the family\u0027s home village of Tubu, says Father\u0027s wife, 39-year-old Omphemetse.\u0027We have five children and the youngest is only four months. The elephants came two weeks ago, right up to the village boundary in the evening. They were eating the trees and pulling at the grass until the land was bare. We all ran to our houses and had to keep the children quiet,\u0027 she says.Father adds: \u0027The attacks by elephants started since the hunting ban. They no longer have fear of us. They have attacked our cars, they will chase our donkeys at a waterhole, they have killed cows and humans.\u0027One of our neighbours has decided not to plough his land this year, not to grow anything at all, so the elephants do not come to eat near his house.\u0027Last year, he was blinded when he ran away from an elephant which was chasing him. He was bending low under the trees as he got away and a thorn pricked him in the eye.\u0027Father tells the tragic story of 60-year-old John Monnaatshiupi, a friend of the family who was killed last October by an elephant near Tubu. \u0027He was in one of the streams near here collecting water lilies to take to the market. He was attacked by elephants who gored him from his waist to his chin.\u0027\u0027It was a terrible way to die,\u0027 says Father. \u0027He left a wife and seven children. I saw his dead body and the expression on his face. It was contorted with horror and fear. Now when I think of elephants my stomach churns.\u0027John is not the only one to have been killed. Two other adults have died in the area and last spring an 11-year-old boy was rushed by his mother to the local hospital in Gumare after he was trampled as he played in the bush.His life was saved, according to the hospital\u0027s medical officer Dr Alex Kalonji. \u0027There are a lot of elephants here and people do get injured,\u0027 he told me in his office last week. \u0027I had one in my own back garden at 4.30 the other morning. Of course, there are unfortunate people who are killed by an elephant. And then there is nothing we can do for them.\u0027As the West dictates how one African country cares for thousands of elephants, it would do well to remember the poor souls who have lost their lives and livelihoods since the ban on big game hunting in Botswana.Perhaps it is patronising even to question why they — the ordinary people — might welcome the return of the hunters\u0027 rifles."},{"url":null,"title":"Co op offer delivery electric bike customers spend 15","story":"Share this article \u0027We are re-imagining grocery deliveries and exploring a more sustainable transport system with our e-cargobikes that can do the same job as a van while requiring a fraction of the energy.\u0027The Co-op said it was considering a number of different home delivery schemes, and recently announced a free taxi grocery delivery service at eight stores around the UK.It is also trialling the use of robots in Milton Keynes to make small deliveries from a local store.

I could have gone on a massive rant about how you shouldn\u0027t speak to women like that but it wasn\u0027t worth the argument.         But Miss Kerr refused to get upset by the fat-shaming messages or block Tom on the dating app         Tom started the exchange with a blunt message asking for a s**g but when Miss Kerr refused he launched into a vitriolic attack on her appearance\u0027Then I got all that abuse back. At first I was shocked. I\u0027ve been called boring or frigid before by people on Tinder but this is the first time someone has really tried to hurt me.\u0027But then I started picking up on all of his mistakes and it was making me laugh, like he called me the mad controller instead of the fat controller.\u0027I also found it funny that he compared me to a Fiat 500 because I own a Fiat 500.\u0027I tried to find the funny side. That\u0027s my coping mechanism.. And I wasn\u0027t going to give him the satisfaction of just blocking him and acting like he\u0027d hurt me.\u0027So I sent him a funny reply and it\u0027s not the response he wanted. I got loads more abuse back.\u0027After reading his angry rant, Miss Kerr replied to Tom awarding him 1010 for effort and highlighting how funny she found it that she owns a Fiat 500.Tom appeared to continue trying his luck, asking Miss Kerr to perform a sex act on his \u0027average size c**k\u0027 in exchange for the party drug ketamine which is also used as a horse tranquilizer.When Miss Kerr pointed out that she had no need for the drug as Tom had called her a hippo not a horse, he replied: \u0027Shut up you fat ugly horrible dirty obese t***e.         After being branded a \u0027hippo\u0027 Miss Kerr laughed off Tom\u0027s offer of ketamine, a party drug which is also used as a drug tranquiliser         Miss Kerr poked fun at Tom who continued to mock her appearance, saying she looked like Bruce the Shark from the Disney film Finding Nemo\u0027You look like a mix between Bruce the shark and Shrek you fat ugly b***h. You have more rolls than f***ing Greggs.\u0027She responded by telling Tom he \u0027can\u0027t handle rejection\u0027 and questioning his taste in women.But the baker, who compares dating a fat girl to opening a bag of crisps in church on her own Tinder profile, thinks taking Tom\u0027s cruelty on the chin only angered him more as he quickly unmatched her.She said: \u0027It didn\u0027t upset me because he had asked me to sleep with him before so I can\u0027t be that bad.\u0027It\u0027s purely because I said \u0027no\u0027 to him that he was then being so spiteful.\u0027He wasn\u0027t giving me abuse out of nowhere. He messaged me asking for a shag but I knew I was better than what he was offering and he just couldn\u0027t handle the rejection.\u0027He wanted me to argue back and get upset so he could think he was the big man upsetting a girl but I wasn\u0027t going to let him win.\u0027And he was really unimaginative. He just picked up on one thing, the fact that I\u0027m a big girl. But my whole bio is a jokey metaphor about dating a big girl. \u0027He thought he was being funny so I thought it would be entertaining to give him a funny response back and he just couldn\u0027t handle it. He ended up unmatching me.\u0027I think he was really offended that I was seeing the funny side.\u0027While she was able to laugh off Tom\u0027s \u0027shocking\u0027 behaviour, Miss Kerr feels this kind of abuse from the Tinder reject could seriously impact women struggling with their body image.

Most currently expect it to be held on Tuesday night but this is not fixed.Can she win? It looks unlikely. The prospect of No Deal on April 12 will encourage Brexiteers they should vote down the deal a second time. There is currently little sign the DUP are being won over by a political offensive behind the scenes. Mrs May also alienated Labour MPs with her angry speech on Wednesday night.  It seems possible she could end up losing the third vote by a bigger margin than the 149 votes she lost the second one.What if she does win? If the PM manages a great escape, then Britain will be on track to leave on May 22. The Government will move quickly to get the necessary laws in place.What if she loses?  The EU has made clear that if the deal goes down a third time, Britain must come back with a plan in time for the new deadline of April 12.Most urgently, a decision will have to be made on whether the UK takes part in European Parliament elections on May 23. If it does not, there will be No Deal - and Mrs May says electing MEPs would be the wrong thing to do.However, there is still a majority of MPs in Parliament against No Deal so the choice could be taken away from the PM. If elections are agreed in the UK there will probably be a new EU summit around April 10 to approve a much longer extension - perhaps to the end of 2019 or even longer.The UK will have to have a new plan for what to do with the time as Brussels has made clear it cannot keep going over the same deal.         If the deal is crushed as expected MPs (pictured on Wednesday) must decide quickly whether to hold European Parliament elections - this will be the main trigger for a long delay to Brexit. Refusal means No Deal on April 12Will MPs vote on other options? Probably. Monday night\u0027s vote could setup a full-blown \u0027indicative vote\u0027 that would set all the options against each other. A defeated Government could stage the same procedure.The idea would be to find what kind of Brexit might be supported by Parliament or if there is none, see if there is support for a new public vote.   Will May resign? Nobody knows. No Prime Minister has ever soaked up so much humiliation and carried on and yet Mrs May is still in Downing Street.She suggested this week she would not accept a long delay beyond June 30, seen by many as a hint she would resign if it had to happen.A third defeat for the deal next week would also provoke huge calls for her to resign.A move to No Deal could also see some Tory MPs join with Labour to force the Government out with a vote of no confidence.  What happens to Brexit if May goes or the Government collapses? It is hard to know. Even with a tweak to the law to change the date, Brexit will still happen with No Deal on April 12 if other choices keep being rejected. But we also know there is a majority of MPs against a No Deal Brexit. It is possible there are enough Tory MPs prepared to remove the Government to stop No Deal by installing a Corbyn government ahead of a snap election. Only the Government can bring forward the necessary change in the law to change the Brexit date. What is Labour\u0027s position? Labour says no deal must be stopped - but also says it will not vote for Mrs May\u0027s deal.It wanted a three month delay to renegotiate the political declaration on the final UK-EU relationship but this would require it form a Government more or less immediately. Were it to do so, it would try pass the orce deal attached to a new political declaration that said the final relationship would be based on a permanent customs union. It has passed no comment on the actual proposed delay.          EU leaders (pictured gathering back in Brussels this morning) have given a two week extension to Brexit for one more push on the deal Will there have to be a new election or a referendum? This falls into the anything is possible category. Parliament is deadlocked and has been for months - which suggests an election is necessary. And yet the governing Tory party clearly has little idea what it would put to the country or who would lead it into an election. An election can be forced without the consent of the Tories but it is very difficult. Similarly, it is far from clear there are the votes for a referendum in the Commons. The idea was crushed last week because Labour did not vote for it.Will Brexit ever happen? Almost three years after the referendum, this depends entirely on your view of events. The law says it will but there are enough MPs to at least change the date if given the chance to do so.It could now happen on April 12 or May 22. Or it could be delayed much further. "},{"url":null,"title":"Botswana baby buffalo comes seconds eaten lion","story":"Share this article          This snap shows the mother butting the smaller lioness with its horns as another buffalo joins her for the attack          Mr Cranke said: \u0027An elderly 18-year-old lioness lead the hunt but failed to catch the young calf and got butted by an older buffalo.

A primary school principal says he will not allow his staff and pupils return to “dire” classroom conditions after the Easter holidays unless the Department of Education provides plans for a replacement building.Michael O’ Sullivan, principal of Charleville CBS Primary, Co Cork, said its “dilapidated” school building was no longer fit for purpose and sanitary conditions were “dire and similar to those of a school in a developing country”.“Our roof is leaking. Our plumbing fixtures are falling to pieces. Our timber floors in the classroom are cracked and broken,” he said.“Our ‘terazo’ surface in our corridors is broken, chipped and cracked. We have no disabled toilet and we have a child in a wheelchair starting our school in September.”In addition, he said there was no hot water in the school and it was too cold to work in during winter due to single-glazed windows and an ineffective heating system.The school, which has 175 pupils and 25 members of staff, was founded more than 150 years ago by the Christian Brothers. Its current building was built in 1969 and has been unaltered since.ActionIn a recent letter to Minister for Education Joe McHugh, he wrote that the school has “had enough” and wants action.“I wish to inform that if no concrete plan is put in place before Easter, we will not return to this building after the Easter holidays. If necessary I can supply you with a letter condemning the building,” he wrote.“Therefore, I require you to source alternative accommodationschool for our 175 pupils and 25 members of staff.”A spokeswoman for the Department of Education said it had been “advised of the concerns raised and is in contact with the school to progress the matter”.While the school was successful in 2015 in its application for a major extension and renovation, Mr O’Sullivan said no work had begun on site.In the meantime, he said, enrolments had risen by 20 per cent and were due to rise further next September.This meant the school had outgrown the planned extension “even before it has been built”, he said.While the school applied for a larger extension six months ago, Mr O’Sullivan said no response had been received to date.“This consideration process, as I well know at this stage, takes years,” he said. “In the meantime I have just received a grant for an additional four classrooms to be housed in prefabs. I feel the attitude from the department is to give us prefabs and to forget about us.”The department had previously said it was investing record sums in delivering 23,000 permanent school places this year, while projects in a further 700 schools were taking place under “summer works” schemes."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3834358.1553195816!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"invasive rodent spotted along dublin s royal canal","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tA coypu in a park in western Germany. The rodents carry several diseases harmful to humans and domestic animals. Photograph: Yann SchreiberAFPGetty Waterways Ireland has warned the public to be on the alert for a very “large invasive rodent” species which has been spotted along the Royal Canal in Dublin.Sightings of coypu, a semi-aquatic creature with bright orange teeth, a long cylindrical tail, and webbed back feet have been reported near the Ashtown area of the canal close to Castleknock.The rodents, which can be up to a metre long and weigh up to 9kg, carry a number of diseases harmful to humans and domestic animals.Waterways Ireland has issued an “invasive species alert” and warned the public “not to engage” the animals or make any attempt to trap them but to report any sightings, with photographs where possible.Coypu are “highly invasive impacting on wildlife, river and canal bank stability and is a pest of agriculture crops”, Waterways Ireland said.“Eradication programmes can cost several millions of euro and are not always successful.”“Its appearance is similar to a very large rat it could even be mistaken for a bulky otter at first sight,” Waterways Ireland said, but unlike an otter it does not have a fur tail but a “long rat-like tail”. Coypu are vegetarian, and particularly like carrots and parsnips.\u0026nbspThe “invasive alien species” originates from wetlands in South America, and is thought to have arrived in Ireland about five years ago. It is believed the animal was introduced as a novelty attraction to a pet farm in Cork but some escaped in 2014 and began breeding on the outskirts of Cork city.In 2016, 10 coypu were shot on the Curraheen river on the outskirts of the city. Sightings should be reported to Waterways Ireland and National Parks and Wildlife Service which will undertake “eradication measures”.A successful eradication programme in East Anglia in Britain in the 1980s “took 10 years and cost several million pounds sterling”, Waterways Ireland said."},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Flanagan says stamp on package at An Post depot is the same as letters received in UKScally progress report in wake of CervicalCheck scandal is generally positive over actions takenFunerals of Morgan Barnard, Lauren Bullock and Connor Currie take placeDrumcondra Road Lower closed in both directions as garda\u0026iacute appeal for witnessesCharleville CBS Primary school demands plans for new building within weeksGerman study establishes link between mistreatment and brain alterationsD\u0026rsquoArcy \u0026lsquodeeply dissatisfied\u0026rsquo by the behaviour of insurerAppearance on BBC Talkback led to charges of gross misconduct which were upheldAlert issued over coypu species that can grow in lengty up to one metre and weigh 9kgEighty per cent of those with Down syndrome who reach 65 years of age will have dementiaMinister for Finance to support plan only if all social housing retained for such purposeFr George Rutler in New York warns about the state of the Catholic Church in IrelandPeter Merrigan seeking alternatives for his business in light of Brexit uncertaintyFamily faced deportation and had trouble finding a place to live after leaving systemInvestigation into deaths of three teenagers on St Patrick\u0026rsquos night is \u0026lsquofast-moving\u0026rsquo and \u0026lsquohigh intensity\u0026rsquoVolunteers patrol the riverbanks in search of those about to take their own lives\u0026lsquoMy hope is to shift the public and then the political discourse,\u0026rsquo says charity\u0026rsquos chiefDelays of almost two years for civil cases to be heard"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3834434.1553198321!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"government seeks social housing pledge on nama homes","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tMinister for Finance Paschal Donohoe has  indicated ‘cautious support’ for the plan.  Photograph: Chris Ratcliffe BloombergThe Department of Finance last year sought guarantees that 1,300 houses controlled by the National Asset Management Agency (Nama) would continue to be rented to social housing tenants in the future, even if they were sold by Nama.Nama spent more than €200 million after the economic crash buying up the homes from bankrupt developers across the State, including places such as Dún Laoghaire, Co Dublin, Douglas, Co Cork, and Bettystown, Co Meath, and elsewhere.Today, the houses are leased to local authorities and housing associations as social housing by a Nama-owned subsidiary called National Asset Residential Property Services (Narps). In a briefing note last November, the Minister for Finance Paschal Donohoe was told, ahead of a meeting with Nama’s chairman, Frank Daly, that Nama expected to sell off the Narps-held homes “later this year”. The briefing note shows that Mr Donohoe indicated “cautious support” for the plan. However, the internal records show the department wanted guarantees from any buyer that the houses would be used for social housing in the future. The Minister said this was “provided that all housing currently provided for social housing could be retained for such purpose into the future”. Officials warned that it was “unlikely to be possible for Nama to facilitate a sale of Narps while retaining 100 per cent assurances that these units will be used for such purpose indefinitely”.Sale conditionsThey also said enforcing such conditions on a sale “would likely have a significant impact on value achieved”. Sources also expressed concern about the political impact of selling off a large chunk of social housing that is currently in public ownership.A note of the meeting shows Nama planned to write to Mr Donohoe this year “regarding their progress around the disposal of Narps”. However, both Nama and the department said on Thursday there was no sale under way, or currently planned. The strategy for the units will form part of a wider review of Nama which is under way.The homes are leased to local authorities or social housing bodies which have an option to buy the properties after 14 years. The leases and tenancies would remain in place after a sale. Prospective buyers of the houses would be attracted by millions of euros in payments from the State under the lease agreements, as well as the full ownership once the leases expired. Sinn Féin finance spokesman Eoin Ó Broin said the total payments from the State over the term of the leases would be in the region of €200,000 for each unit, or €260 million across the lifetime of the lease. Mr Ó Broin said any sale of the units would be “an absolute scandal”, and added that the units should be transferred into public ownership with local authorities.Selected by picture editor Frank Miller"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3835057.1553253296!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"limerick suspicious package may be linked to uk letter bombs","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tGardaí at the An Post sorting centre on the Dock Road, Limerick, where a suspicious package was found on Friday morning. Photograph Liam BurkePress 22A suspicious package that caused the evacuation of a Limerick postal sorting office on Friday morning may be linked to recent letter bomb incidents in the UK, Minister for Justice Charlie Flanagan has said.A group calling itself “the IRA” last week claimed responsibility for the four devices that were sent to the UK two weeks ago three to London transport hubs and one to a Scottish university.In that claim of responsibility, during which a recognised New IRA code word was used, the caller said while only four parcels had been found, five had been sent.And now Mr Flanagan has suggested the device found in Limerick on Friday morning could be the last of the five parcels the New IRA claimed responsibility for.The paramilitary group were behind a recent car bombing in Derry city and it has killed prison officers in Northern Ireland in the recent years.The alarm was raised at the An Post sorting office off the Dock Road in Limerick shortly after 6am on Friday when gardaí received a report of a suspect package at the depot.The building was evacuated and the Explosives Ordnance Disposal team was notified of the incident. It is understood the Defence Forces have also been contacted.Gardaí attended the scene to investigate the delivery of the package.Mr Flanagan said there seems to be a connection with the four letter bombs recently discovered in London and Glasgow and the device found Limerick.“This is a despicable act. The sending of incendiary devices like this is totally unacceptable. I hope the people responsible are brought to justice,” the Minister told RTÉ’s Today with Sean O’Rourke programme.Mr Flanagan said his assumption is based on the stamp which is the same as on the letters in the UK.He said that at the time, police in the UK said there was a fifth item and this could be the fifth. “We have reason to believe this could be the case,” he said.Three devicesThe London politan Police last Tuesday, March 5th, confirmed a call had been made to the Irish News in Belfast claiming responsibility for the three devices on behalf of the IRA.Following that call, the London Met has also said the devices were similar to others used by dissidents in the past.The three small devices found on Tuesday, March 5th, in London appeared designed to catch fire rather than explode. They were sent to Waterloo rail station and buildings on the Heathrow and London City airport campuses.The package sent to the Compass Centre offices at Heathrow was opened, causing the A4 envelope the device was in to catch fire. However, the other two London packages were not opened.The following day at Glasgow University in Scotland buildings were evacuated after a device, which was immediately directly linked to three devices in London, was discovered in the college’s mail room. It was not opened and there were no injuries.Dissident republicans and the Provisional IRA before them have used explosive and incendiary devices to cause damage and disruption for years. Gardaí and the UK authorities immediately suspected last week’s attacks were the work of the New IRA."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3834127.1553184360!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"nz mosque massacre changes dynamic of australian politics","story":"New Zealand prime minister Jacinda Ardern has announced that her government will ban military-style semi-automatic and assault rifles following the killing of 50 people in the country’s worst mass shooting.\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tAustralian prime minister Scott Morrison:  In 2012 he  warned that asylum seekers might cause a typhoid outbreak. Photograph:  James GourleyGetty ImagesIn 2013, after two terms in power, Australia’s Labor government was riven by internecine disputes, had twice torn down prime ministers in internal coups and spent more time talking about itself than its plans for the country. The public, to use the Australian vernacular, had had a gutful and voted it out in a landslide.In 2019, after two terms in power, Australia’s Liberal-National coalition government is riven by internecine disputes, has twice torn down prime ministers in internal coups and spends more time talking about itself than its plans for the country. The public has had a gutful and was all set to vote it out in two months’ time, probably in a landslide.But that was before last Friday. That morning, prime minister Scott Morrison probably thought the only new issue he would have to deal with was the climate protest school strikes taking place across the country. By early afternoon, however, news came in of the mass murder of 50 people at two mosques in New Zealand, allegedly carried out by an Australian.Brenton Tarrant (28) has been charged with murder over the shootings. The prime minister was resolute in his condemnation, saying the actions were those of an “extremist, right-wing, violent terrorist”.On Wednesday, Morrison met the Turkish ambassador Korhan Karakoc, and asked that the president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, withdraw remarks threatening that Australians and New Zealanders could be sent home in coffins if they insulted Islam while in the country.“Your grandparents came here . . . and they returned in caskets,” Erdogan said, referring to the thousands of Australian and New Zealand soldiers who died during the Gallipoli campaign in Turkey during the first World War.“Have no doubt we will send you back like your grandfathers.”ExtremismMorrison has also called for a calmer discourse in Australia. “As debate becomes more fierce, the retreat to tribalism is increasingly taking over, and for some, extremism takes hold,” he said. “This is true of the left and the right, and even more so from those shouting from the fringes to a mainstream of quiet Australians that just want to get on with their lives.”However, in 2012 Scott Morrison warned that asylum seekers might cause a typhoid outbreak. Last month Morrison said asylum seekers might be paedophiles, murderers or rapists. And earlier this month, he said asylum seekers would take housing and hospital places from Australians.While he now rails against the “tribalism” of “those shouting from fringes”, Morrison has not addressed his own tribalism, shouted from the heart of political power.His comments look like dog-whistling when compared with the words of his counterpart in New Zealand, Jacinda Ardern. “Many of those who will have been directly affected by this shooting may be migrants to New Zealand, they may even be refugees here. They have chosen to make New Zealand their home, and it is their home,” she said.Australia’s opposition Labor leader Bill Shorten was more direct in his condemnation of what may have influenced Tarrant and others like him. “Not all right-wing extremist hate speech ends in right-wing extremist violence, but all right-wing extremist violence starts in right-wing extremist hate speech,” he said. In a plea to media commentators, he added: “Can I just say for those who believe that freedom of speech extends to hate speech and right-wing extremist hate speech: can’t you call time on this?”With internal government discord over action on climate change, leadership tensions in the National Party and six ministers announcing they will quit politics at the election expected in May, Labor looked like it was heading for a comfortable win.But then Christchurch happened and continues to dominate the headlines. Labor has led in all polls for more than two years, but what happened in New Zealand could change that. If people think they need protection from danger, they could revert to the coalition, which polling consistently says is more trusted on security.But if people examine what Morrison and some of his colleagues said about mainly Muslim asylum seekers before last Friday, and compare it to what they say now, they may think it unacceptable.The next polling figures, expected next Monday, will have a tale to tell."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3834548.1553235571!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"britain s eu exit on hold for almost two months","story":"European Council president Donald Tusk says all Brexit options are still open for Britain until April 12th after a summit of EU leaders agreed on prime minister Theresa May\u0027s request to delay the leave date from March 29th.

Photograph: Jasper JuinenBloombergEuropean Union leaders have agreed to postpone Britain’s departure by almost two months until May 22nd if MPs at Westminster approve British prime minister Theresa May’s Brexit deal next week. If they fail to do so, Britain will leave the EU on April 12th, just two weeks after the planned exit date of March 29th, unless it chooses to hold European Parliament elections at the end of May.Mrs May spent almost two hours answering questions about her plans for Brexit from the other EU27 leaders before they continued their discussion without her for a further seven hours.Mrs May indicated that she intended to hold another meaningful vote soon on her withdrawal agreement with the EU, but stopped short of giving a clear commitment to hold one next week. She did say, however, that she believed she would have won a vote this week had the intervention by the speaker of the House of Commons John Bercow not led to its cancellation.Mr Bercow ruled that there could not be another vote on the same proposition, but Mrs May told EU leaders that she believed there were a number of avenues to ensuring that a new vote could be held, and that she was “confident” she could win the vote. However, there is a degree of scepticism about this among EU leaders. This was heightened when Mrs May used the same formulation to answer several different questions.The British PM repeatedly assured EU leaders, including the Taoiseach Leo Varadkar, that she wanted to avoid a no-deal outcome.She spoke to the summit for half an hour and was pressed for another hour with questions by the leaders, before leaving the 27 to their deliberations. But the PM declined to speculate when asked about what she would do if the Commons again votes down the withdrawal agreement.In a debate that extended long over schedule into the leaders’ dinner they also approved the text of assurances agreed between the EU and UK in Strasbourg last week.The formal approval of the Strasbourg assurances by the European Council should assist Mrs May to argue that there are significant changes to the deal that has twice been voted down, enabling it to be put to the Commons again. The council once again also declared in its formal “conclusions” that the EU will not renegotiate the Brexit orce terms included in the withdrawal agreement.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

The UN Security Council resolution 497, issued after the annexation, refers to Israel as the occupying power and says Israel\u0027s attempt to impose its laws, jurisdiction and administration in the occupied Syrian Golan Heights is null and void and without international legal effect.Damascus also said Mr Trump\u0027s statement clearly shows the US disdain to the international legitimacy and violates its resolutions, especially Security Council resolution 497 while also threatening international peace and stability.Arab League chief Ahmed Aboul Gheit also criticized the American stance, saying it comes outside the international legitimacy and no country, no matter how important it is, can make such a decision.Recep Tayyip Erdogan, the Turkish president, said Mr Trump\u0027s unfortunate declaration has brought the region to the brink of a new crisis and new tensions. We will never allow the legitimization of the occupation of the Golan Heights, Erdogan added.The US will be the first country to recognise Israeli sovereignty over the Golan, which the rest of the international community regards as territory occupied by Israel whose status should be determined by negotiations between Israel and Syria. Attempts to bring Israel and Syria to the table have failed.It was not immediately clear how a UN peacekeeping force that is in place in the Golan might be affected by the US move. That force\u0027s mandate expires at the end of June.There had been signals that a US decision was coming. Last week, in its annual human rights report, the State Department dropped the phrase Israeli-occupied from the Golan Heights section, instead calling it Israeli-controlled.Easter 2019: Forbidden eggs, Eostre and how the date is decidedBusinessman who cut down tree which was blocking sunlight to his home must pay back £21k after it increased value of his home, court says in first case of its kind Brexit latest news: Emmanuel Macron claims Theresa May has just \u0026#39five percent\u0026#39 chance of her deal passing next weekChristopher Davies MP admits two expense fraud chargesEurope\u0026#39s first underwater restaurant has opened in Norway – and is fully booked for six monthsUS ramps up pressure on North Korea with new sanctionsComment: The DUP wants to support a deal, but Mrs May\u0026#39s weakness gives it reason to be waryHow Emmanuel Macron seized control of the fate of Brexit from Theresa May\u0026#39s hands - as EU\u0026#39s facade of unity started to crackLibby Squire: Police confirm body found in Humber Estuary is missing studentNew Zealand broadcasts Muslim call to prayer on day of mourning for mosque shooting victimsCan Article 50 be revoked and what would it mean to cancel Brexit?What next for Brexit?

The crew of the US vessel will carry out joint exercises with South Korean units, including ship inspections, and patrols.US officials have confirmed that North Korean ports received deliveries of oil from at least 263 tankers in 2018 after the vessels carried out ship-to-ship transfers at sea. If the vessels had been full, the US estimates that the North would have imported 3.78 million barrels of oil. Under UN sanctions, Pyongyang is permitted to import 500,000 barrels per year.A statement from the US Indo-Pacific Command said: “The Bertholf’s patrol is part of the United States’ ongoing contribution to international efforts in combating North Korea’s maritime sanctions evasion activities.”Despite tight restrictions on how much oil North Korea can import under international sanctions, US officials believe it is accessing far moreJoe Dunford, chairman of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff, said in an address to the Atlantic Council think tank on Thursday, that disrupting at-sea transfers of petroleum is a critical part of the military’s support for diplomatic efforts to encourage Pyongyang to scrap its nuclear weapons programme.“We’ve been after that for many months,” he said. “Clearly, the North Koreans have found ways to work around our enforcement efforts.“It’s a constant cycle of adaptation to make sure that we are staying out in front of the North Korean adaptations and we do the very best we can to enforce the United Nations Security Council resolutions as it pertains to refined petroleum products.”Pyongyang has signalled its anger at the renewed pressure, with state media criticising Japan on Thursday for supporting efforts to crack down on ship-to-ship transfers and, in a separate editorial, condemning South Korea’s plans to carry out regular military exercises.In an article printed on Thursday in the Rodong Sinmun, the mouthpiece of the Workers’ Party of Korea, it said the nation would rather “starve or freeze to death” than give up its “self-esteem.”Easter 2019: Forbidden eggs, Eostre and how the date is decidedBusinessman who cut down tree which was blocking sunlight to his home must pay back £21k after it increased value of his home, court says in first case of its kind Brexit latest news: Emmanuel Macron claims Theresa May has just \u0026#39five percent\u0026#39 chance of her deal passing next weekChristopher Davies MP admits two expense fraud chargesEurope\u0026#39s first underwater restaurant has opened in Norway – and is fully booked for six monthsComment: The DUP wants to support a deal, but Mrs May\u0026#39s weakness gives it reason to be warySyria criticises US\u0026#39s \u0026#39blind bias\u0026#39 to Israel over Golan Heights decisionHow Emmanuel Macron seized control of the fate of Brexit from Theresa May\u0026#39s hands - as EU\u0026#39s facade of unity started to crackLibby Squire: Police confirm body found in Humber Estuary is missing studentNew Zealand broadcasts Muslim call to prayer on day of mourning for mosque shooting victimsCan Article 50 be revoked and what would it mean to cancel Brexit?What next for Brexit?

Although at first some found them strange-looking or were convinced they would fall out of their ears, they quickly became the in-ear wireless headphone to aspire to.Rarely in the two years and three months since launch has demand eased off. As a result, the look has gone from curious to acceptable to – dare I say it\u0026nbsp– iconic. And certainly ubiquitous.Now, the second-generation AirPods have been announced, I talked to Greg Joswiak, Apple’s Vice President of Product Marketing and Kate Bergeron, Vice President of Hardware Engineering about the new arrivals.The new AirPods look, at first glance, like the older model, even down to the price, which remains the same at £159. There is no difference in the look or shape of the buds themselves and there is only one visible change to the case: a Wireless Charging Case is now available\u0026nbspfor an extra £40, allowing you to place the case on a compatible wireless charging pad instead of plugging it in with a Lightning cable.This means there’s a tiny LED on the outside of the case to show when it’s charging.\u0026nbspThe new\u0026nbspAirPods\u0026nbspare on sale online now and will be in Apple Stores next week.Created with Sketch.Apple unveils the iPhone X Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Apple Senior Vice President of Worldwide Marketing, Phil Schiller, introduces the iPhone x during a launch event in Cupertino, California, U.S. September 12, 2017Apple Senior Vice President of Worldwide Marketing, Phil Schiller, introduces the iPhone X during a launch event in Cupertino, California, U.S. September 12, 2017Apple Senior Vice President of Worldwide Marketing, Phil Schiller, introduces the iPhone X during a launch event in Cupertino, California, U.S. September 12, 2017Apple Senior Vice President of Worldwide Marketing, Phil Schiller, introduces the iPhone x during a launch event in Cupertino, California, U.S. September 12, 2017Apple Senior Vice President of Worldwide Marketing, Phil Schiller, introduces the iPhone x during a launch event in Cupertino, California, U.S. September 12, 2017Apple Senior Vice President of Worldwide Marketing, Phil Schiller, introduces the iPhone x during a launch event in Cupertino, California, U.S. September 12, 2017Apple Senior Vice President of Worldwide Marketing, Phil Schiller, shows Animoji during a launch event in Cupertino, California, U.S. September 12, 2017Apple Senior Vice President of Worldwide Marketing, Phil Schiller, speaks during a launch event in Cupertino, California, U.S. September 12, 2017Apple Senior Vice President of Worldwide Marketing, Phil Schiller, introduces the iPhone x during a launch event in Cupertino, California, U.S. September 12, 2017Tim Cook, CEO of Apple, speaks about the iPhone X during a launch event in Cupertino, California, U.S. September 12, 2017Apple Senior Vice President of Worldwide Marketing, Phil Schiller, introduces the iPhone x during a launch event in Cupertino, California, U.S. September 12, 2017Apple Senior Vice President of Worldwide Marketing, Phil Schiller, introduces the iPhone X during a launch event in Cupertino, California, U.S. September 12, 2017Apple Senior Vice President of Worldwide Marketing, Phil Schiller, introduces the iPhone X during a launch event in Cupertino, California, U.S. September 12, 2017Apple Senior Vice President of Worldwide Marketing, Phil Schiller, introduces the iPhone x during a launch event in Cupertino, California, U.S. September 12, 2017Apple Senior Vice President of Worldwide Marketing, Phil Schiller, introduces the iPhone x during a launch event in Cupertino, California, U.S. September 12, 2017Apple Senior Vice President of Worldwide Marketing, Phil Schiller, introduces the iPhone x during a launch event in Cupertino, California, U.S. September 12, 2017Apple Senior Vice President of Worldwide Marketing, Phil Schiller, shows Animoji during a launch event in Cupertino, California, U.S. September 12, 2017Apple Senior Vice President of Worldwide Marketing, Phil Schiller, speaks during a launch event in Cupertino, California, U.S. September 12, 2017Apple Senior Vice President of Worldwide Marketing, Phil Schiller, introduces the iPhone x during a launch event in Cupertino, California, U.S. September 12, 2017Tim Cook, CEO of Apple, speaks about the iPhone X during a launch event in Cupertino, California, U.S. September 12, 2017So far, so good.“The bigger picture, though, is that AirPods simply deliver a magical wireless experience.”I’m not sure I like using the word magical, but I see what he’s saying. Pairing AirPods with an iPhone is exceptionally simple. As Joswiak explains, “As soon as you’ve pulled the AirPods out of the box and flipped open the lid on the case, there’s a simple one-tap set-up, they’re automatically paired and connected. Once you’ve done that, they’re immediately set up to work with all your Apple devices, including an Apple Watch, iPad or Mac that uses the same Apple ID. Once you’ve used AirPods, you never go back. They’re the most popular wireless headphones in the world. They’ve become a cultural phenomenon. For us, they’re the key ingredient to the wireless future. We designed them to be effortless to use.”Open the case near an iPhone and a screen will pop up showing the exact battery life. And there are other cool features, like the way when you’re talking to someone, and you naturally take one of the AirPods out your ear to do so, the music pauses, resuming when you put the bud back into your ear.All these features remain the same in the new version. By the way, you can use AirPods with Android phones, for instance, but the pairing is not as seamless.Kate Bergeron explains the new headphones in more detail:\u0026nbsp“When we were thinking about generation two, we really wanted to focus on this new H1 chip that was designed specifically for headphones. We’re combining wireless technology which is a hallmark of Apple’s and very highly customised audio. Together, these things create an amazing audio experience. Because the H1 chip is more powerful, it delivers some profound efficiencies, which means you can have Siri available all the time.”Ah, yes, I forgot to say, another AirPods feature is the way you can tap on either of the buds while they are in your ear and then ask Siri, Apple’s virtual personal assistant, to change the track, lift the volume or even give you spoken directions to wherever you’re going.AirPods 2 on Wednesday, 20 March (Apple)Now, with the new AirPods, you don’t need to tap. Just say, “Hey, Siri” and it will respond. This is made possible thanks to the H1 chip saving so much battery life that it can be listening for the magic wake words at all times.“So, we’re able to have \u0027Hey, Siri\u0027 listening enabled at all times and still keep the same battery life as before: five hours’ listening time is still achieved thanks to this new chip,” Bergeron says.“In addition, we’ve been able to deliver 50 per cent more talk time so when you’re on a call, you’ll have three hours of battery life, not two.”Leaving aside whether jabbering on for three hours is really desirable, this is quite a feat. So, how come more talk time but no extra battery life? That’s because when you’re talking, listening out for “Hey, Siri” is turned off.Switching between devices is up to twice as fast, now, too. “If you’re using your AirPods between your Mac, your iPhone and your iPad, switching is even more seamless and the connection to phone calls, when you’re pulling your AirPods out of your pocket to connect to a phone call, is up to 50 per cent faster than before,” Bergeron says. “In addition, for some casual gaming on your iPhone, for instance, we’re able to provide up to 30 per cent lower latency.”My experience of Apple’s stats in situations like this is that the figures don’t mean that much but the experience when you use them is noticeably different.Apple leak reveals bizarre new feature for 2019 iPhoneApple unveils brand new iPads in surprise announcementThe improved chip means improved audio in different ways, too. “The combination of the wireless changes we’ve made in the chip as well as the audio gives a more robust wireless connection, which turns into better audio quality in different conditions. When going outside, some people have found that in that environment there can be problems maintaining RF (radio frequency) links. Now, in all sorts of different conditions we find we’re able to have better audio quality all the time.”The LED on the new wireless charging case is the main visible difference compared to the previous case. “The cases are exactly the same size, there’s a slight increase in weight thanks to adding the wireless charging coil but it’s negligible.”Wireless charging is traditionally slower than through a Lightning cable. “It’s just over two hours to charge the case from zero to 100 per cent via Lightning,” Joswiak chips in, “and around three-and-a-half hours wirelessly. But realistically, customers rarely charge from zero, and the fast charge is the same as before – just put the AirPods themselves into the charging case for 15 minutes and you get three hours of listening time.”Apple is expected to release a new version of iOS, the operating software for iPhones and iPads, soon. I wonder if the new hands-free Siri feature will have to wait for that, but Joswiak’s reply is elegant rather than factually revealing: “We always recommend that for every new product that customers install the latest version of software that’s available at that time.”Reading the runes, I would imagine it means that by the time the new AirPods reach customers next week, that enhanced software will be available to make hands-free Siri work.The new AirPods are a big event because almost no product attracts the level of interest of these little in-ear wireless headphones.\u0026nbsp Next week, if they live up to Apple’s promises, they’ll be even more desirable.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Show all 21Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Iron Man 2 barely holds together. Rather than act as a straight sequel to the surprisingly successful Iron Man, Marvel Studios decided to overstuff the film with universe-building references (Black Widow, Nick Fury and SHIELD’s Agent Coulson all make appearances) and two-dimensional villains (played by Sam Rockwell and Mickey Rourke). The result is a film without any direction that serves as a Trojan horse set-up for the Avengers.When the Thor franchise lost its director Kenneth Branagh between the first and second films, it also had to kiss goodbye to the Shakespearean theatrics that had lent it a sense of goofy charm. Directed by Game of Thrones’s Alan Taylor, The Dark World prioritises its VFX effects above all else. It’s a dull affair: Christopher Eccleston’s Malekith is (by far) Marvel’s worst villain, being a pile of prosthetics with zero personality, while Chris Hemsworth’s Thor completes one of the most unrealistic London Tube journeys in all of cinematic history.Edward Norton’s version of the smashing Hulk often gets forgotten by Marvel fans – and for good reason. Whereas Mark Ruffalo’s bumbling interpretation of the character has a gravitational charm, Norton’s moping monster is void of any charisma. With Liv Tyler phoning in her performance as love interest, Betty Ross, the film falls emotionally flat and serves only as a by-the-numbers origins story.421 Avengers: Age of UltronJust in case we’d forgotten that the Disney corporation is an all-consuming titan that owns half of Hollywood, the sequel to 2012’s Avengers decided to sneak in a little corporate synergy: when Iron Man accidentally creates a sentient robot (voiced by James Spader) who decides the earth’s only salvation is through the destruction of humanity, he announces his grim plans with accompaniment of a little citation of the classic “I’ve Got No Strings” from 1940’s Pinocchio. It’s a moment that exemplifies how Ultron feels like a cold, calculated operation from Marvel Studios. It’s merely tick list of obligations to move us on to the next chapter of the MCU.Although Kenneth Branagh’s introductory outing for Marvel’s God of Thunder fared perfectly well on release, it’s suffered massively from the MCU’s dramatic sense of progression over the years. Certainly, Tom Hiddleston’s Loki is a strong, well-crafted character right out of the gate, and his plot against his adoptive father (Anthony Hopkins) is delightfully heightened. Yet, it arguably took until Thor: Ragnarok for Chris Hemsworth’s hero to develop much sense of character beyond the initial “fish out of water” trope.A self-centred wealthy white man ventures to a distant land and realises his superhero potential – sound familiar? That’s because Doctor Strange and Iron Man are basically the same story, except one uses magic and the other explosives. Benedict Cumberbatch’s Marveldebut impresses with kaleidoscope visuals but lacks the heart of Robert Downey Jr’s hero, leading to a film that wastes the talents of both Tilda Swinton and Mads Mikkelsen. 721 s of the Galaxy Vol 2The first s of the Galaxy was a risky Star Wars-inspired romp through space, following a bunch of a-holes who form an unlikely familiar bond. For the second film, James Gunn decided to turn everything up to 11, cramming half a dozen interweaving storylines, leading to Chris Pratt’s gaunt Star Lord getting side-lined. The sequel did, however, introduce the now beloved line “I’m Mary Poppins, y’all”, shouted by Yondu as he gracefully falls from the sky. A wonderfully comedic moment in a film that misses on another half-dozen punches.Marvel’s first crossover film was an unparalleled cinematic event – one that arguably changed Hollywood filmmaking forever, now that every major studio seems to be attempting the “shared universe” approach to franchises. Although the MCU has refined the template since, The Avengers still established the focus on humour, character, and heart that would come to define the success story of Marvel Studios. It’s a blockbuster that feels large on all fronts, delivering thrills not only in the “Battle of New York” finale, but in the creation of a team of characters that feel perfectly balanced and complementary.Despite Captain America: Civil War (AKA Avengers 2.5) featuring Iron Man, Black Widow, and Ant-Man (as well as introducing Black Panther and Spider-Man), the film remains first and foremost about Captain America. And that’s perhaps why the stuffed blockbuster works – were it not for a central focus, Civil War could have fallen into the trappings of other Marvel sequels in being too convoluted. The Russo Brothers also direct one of the best actions scenes in Marvel history so far, the airport scene, which looks as if it leapt straight out of a comic book.1021 Ant-Man and the WaspWhile the first Ant Man was a mirror image of its star Paul Rudd, essentially delivering a studio comedy dressed in dex, the second found a new trick up its sleeve in the form of Evangeline Lilly’s Hope van Dyne – a smart, capable female hero who didn’t simply exist to serve as a caretaker for the male characters.Ant-Man should not have worked as a film. Just look at the title! Ridiculous to think a movie about a man with ant powers should work – let alone be a blockbuster success and part of the biggest cinematic universe going. Yet, despite production problems (Edgar Wright was initially meant to helm the film), Peyton Reed directs this hilarious heist film with aplomb, taking the Marvel world a little less seriously than others. Marvel redefined cinematic narratives once more in 2018, creating a single culmination to a decade’s worth of films. While it plays as total nonsense to anyone who’s a newcomer to the franchise (if that’s possible), it was, for fans, an unmatched emotional release. The Russo brothers faced the monumental task of making each crossover – from the s of the Galaxy to the kingdom of Wakanda – work in a way that feels natural, while also ushering the MCU’s biggest villain, Thanos, into centre stage. Epic both in its sense of scale and stakes, Infinity War also stages one of the most memorable finales in blockbuster history.With or without the beard, Steve Rogers aka Captain America has now become the brooding centre of the Avengers, but there was once a time when he was all about the old-fashioned heroics. Director Joe Johnston stayed true to the film’s 1940s setting in a film that embraces that pulpiness of early comic book history, as Steve punches Nazis and romances military officer Peggy Carter (Hayley Atwell), although her character is thankfully never relegated to the role of damsel in distress.Despite centring on a super-powered American nationalist, the Captain America trilogy has the most consistent quality in the MCU. Its crowning moment comes with The Winter Soldier – an adrenaline-fuelled conspiracy thriller that features a spectacular twist and provokes questions regarding modern day surveillance. However, given The Russo Brothers root the rest of the movie in realism, the bombastic CGI-heavy ending is a little ridiculous. Brie Larson gives a superpowered performance as Carol Danvers, the actor playing a hero that\u0027s both relatable and aspirational, strong but vulnerable. While Captain Marvel may not revolutionise the studio’s formula, the superhero\u0027s debut outing provides a platform to show off her Thanos-annihilating powers.  Thanks to a smart script, it also offers some of the very best character development in the MCU.While Spider-Man’s miraculous arrival in the MCU came with Captain America: Civil War, it was not until Homecoming that we truly got to know Peter Parker. Tom Holland’s incarnation swings past Andrew Garfield’s version, thanks to the film’s lower-stakes high school story allowing for intimate moments with the character. Along with including some great comic performances (Jacob Batalon as Ned stands out), Michael Keaton’s Vulture makes for a terrifying villain, and the twist is superbly done.While isive among Marvel fans, Shane Black’s superhero outing – with the writerdirector’s sharp, stinging dialogue – brings Tony Stark\u0027s story arc to an end (or what should have been its end) with humour and heart aplenty. As Robert Downey Jr’s genius, billionaire philanthropist deals with PTSD and struggles with his robotic creations, we see an actor giving his all. While Civil War and the Avengers films dragged him back into action, fingers are crossed Avengers: Endgame will give the character a similar emotionally satisfying send-off.Completely transforming the Thor franchise in a single, effortless move, director Taika Waititi injected new energy into the MCU. Ragnarok is perfectly balanced both as a standard Marvel movie, with all the right heroics and world-building intact, and as a work belonging exclusively to Waititi, filled with the humour and charm he’d previously displayed in What We Do in the Shadows and Hunt for the Wilderpeople. By finding a way to incorporate inidual voices into its massive franchise machine, Marvel found the secret to true long-term success.Where it all started. Iron Man subverted expectations by not only reintroducing Robert Downey Jr to the world, but by showing that a relatively unknown B-character could be at the centre of a blockbuster. Other cinematic universes fail because they attempt to introduce too much (a mistake made in Iron Man 2). The first Iron Man, though, had a self-contained story that only hinted at a bigger world – a world that would eventually become a multi-billion-dollar franchise. 2021 s of the Galaxy Blasting the Marvel universe into space for an adventure with a truly ragtag group of heroes, including both a talking racoon and a sentient tree-creature, s of the Galaxy is arguably the biggest risk the franchise ever took. And it paid off in spectacular fashion, with director James Gunn giving the superhero genre a light coat of B-movie glee. It also transformed Parks and Recreation star Chris Pratt into the major box office draw he is today.Although Black Panther still dutifully fulfils all the requirements of a Marvel film, providing a bridge to films both past and future plus ending in a cinematic battle filled with CGI trickery, Ryan Coogler’s achievement as a director is to use a familiar framework to tell a radical story within mainstream filmmaking. In the strife between Chadwick Boseman’s T’Challa, the ruler of Wakanda, and Michael B Jordan’s Killmonger, he provided a nuanced, layered commentary on colonialism and black identity. It’s a film that triumphs both within its genre, bringing new perspectives to the superhero story, and outside of it, satisfying purely as a piece of narrative drama.Iron Man 2 barely holds together. Rather than act as a straight sequel to the surprisingly successful Iron Man, Marvel Studios decided to overstuff the film with universe-building references (Black Widow, Nick Fury and SHIELD’s Agent Coulson all make appearances) and two-dimensional villains (played by Sam Rockwell and Mickey Rourke). The result is a film without any direction that serves as a Trojan horse set-up for the Avengers.When the Thor franchise lost its director Kenneth Branagh between the first and second films, it also had to kiss goodbye to the Shakespearean theatrics that had lent it a sense of goofy charm. Directed by Game of Thrones’s Alan Taylor, The Dark World prioritises its VFX effects above all else. It’s a dull affair: Christopher Eccleston’s Malekith is (by far) Marvel’s worst villain, being a pile of prosthetics with zero personality, while Chris Hemsworth’s Thor completes one of the most unrealistic London Tube journeys in all of cinematic history.Edward Norton’s version of the smashing Hulk often gets forgotten by Marvel fans – and for good reason. Whereas Mark Ruffalo’s bumbling interpretation of the character has a gravitational charm, Norton’s moping monster is void of any charisma. With Liv Tyler phoning in her performance as love interest, Betty Ross, the film falls emotionally flat and serves only as a by-the-numbers origins story.421 Avengers: Age of UltronJust in case we’d forgotten that the Disney corporation is an all-consuming titan that owns half of Hollywood, the sequel to 2012’s Avengers decided to sneak in a little corporate synergy: when Iron Man accidentally creates a sentient robot (voiced by James Spader) who decides the earth’s only salvation is through the destruction of humanity, he announces his grim plans with accompaniment of a little citation of the classic “I’ve Got No Strings” from 1940’s Pinocchio. It’s a moment that exemplifies how Ultron feels like a cold, calculated operation from Marvel Studios. It’s merely tick list of obligations to move us on to the next chapter of the MCU.Although Kenneth Branagh’s introductory outing for Marvel’s God of Thunder fared perfectly well on release, it’s suffered massively from the MCU’s dramatic sense of progression over the years. Certainly, Tom Hiddleston’s Loki is a strong, well-crafted character right out of the gate, and his plot against his adoptive father (Anthony Hopkins) is delightfully heightened. Yet, it arguably took until Thor: Ragnarok for Chris Hemsworth’s hero to develop much sense of character beyond the initial “fish out of water” trope.A self-centred wealthy white man ventures to a distant land and realises his superhero potential – sound familiar? That’s because Doctor Strange and Iron Man are basically the same story, except one uses magic and the other explosives.

Fans believe that Endgame will see the surviving characters, including Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson), Captain America (Chris Evans) and Ant-Man (Paul Rudd), attempt to reverse the cataclysmic events.Many theories have been doing the rounds, but one that has fans particularly excited centres around the character of Hulk (Mark Ruffalo), who is expect to play a huge role in the film.Avengers: Endgame will be released in cinemas on 26 April.The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxThe best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The index is a measure of inflation calculated by tracking the price of a selected basket of goods and services.Beer prices rose 0.6 per cent\u0026nbspbetween January and February compared with a decline of 1.1 per cent\u0026nbsplast year. Annually, food and alcohol inflation hit 1.1 per cent\u0026nbspand 5.1 per cent\u0026nbsprespectively.The price of food was up 0.4 per cent between January and February compared with 0.1 per cent last year. Alcohol and tobacco were up\u0026nbsp0.9 per cent increase on the month versus flat prices in February 2018.Howard Archer, chief economic adviser at EY Item Club, said: “While February’s rise in inflation may be marginally disappointing for consumer purchasing power, it is still looking appreciably better than in mid-2018 – especially as earnings growth retained its firmer tone in January. Real earnings growth is currently 1.5 per cent, the best level since end-2016, although still appreciably below longterm norms.”Created with Sketch.Tariffs in the event of a no-deal Brexit  Show all 15Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.There will be tariffs on pork in order to protect British farmersThere will be tariffs in place on some cheeses including €22.10100kg of cheddar, €19.10100kg of processed cheese and €18.60100kg on some blue cheesesThere will be no tariffs in place on milkThere will be no tariffs on car parts imported from EuropeThere will be no tariffs on alcoholic drinks - except on some rums due to ingredients used in their distilling processThere will be tariffs on beef in order to protect British farmersThere will be no tariffs on many types of fish including cod, haddock, salmon and sea bass915 Fruit and vegetablesThere will be no tariffs on almost all fruit and vegetablesThere will be no tariffs on chocolate or other cocoa productsThere will be tariffs on poultry in order to protect British farmersThere will be some tariffs in place on ceramisThere will be no tariffs on steelThere will be no tariffs on coalThere will be tariffs on the meat of sheep in order to protect British farmersThere will be tariffs on pork in order to protect British farmersThere will be tariffs in place on some cheeses including €22.10100kg of cheddar, €19.10100kg of processed cheese and €18.60100kg on some blue cheesesThere will be no tariffs in place on milkThere will be no tariffs on car parts imported from EuropeThere will be no tariffs on alcoholic drinks - except on some rums due to ingredients used in their distilling processThere will be tariffs on beef in order to protect British farmersThere will be no tariffs on many types of fish including cod, haddock, salmon and sea bass915 Fruit and vegetablesThere will be no tariffs on almost all fruit and vegetablesThere will be no tariffs on chocolate or other cocoa productsThere will be tariffs on poultry in order to protect British farmersThere will be some tariffs in place on ceramisThere will be no tariffs on steelThere will be no tariffs on coalThere will be tariffs on the meat of sheep in order to protect British farmersHe added that different Brexit outcomes were likely to affect CPI in the coming months.He said: “Our suspicion is that inflation will spike significantly higher if the UK leaves the EU without a deal,\u0026nbspprimarily due to a likely marked fall in sterling – even though the government has indicated that under a temporary scheme, 87 per cent\u0026nbspof imports by value would be eligible for zero-tariff access compared to 80 per cent\u0026nbspof imports currently being tariff-free.”Mike Hardie, head of inflation at the ONS, said: “The rate of inflation is stable, with a modest rise in food as well as alcohol and tobacco offset by clothing and footwear prices rising by less than they did a year ago.”Upward pressure also came from recreation and culture, as prices rose between January and February 2019 compared with a smaller rise between the same two months last year. Computer games had the biggest effect.But clothing and footwear prices had a downward effect. Although pricetags were higher in February as usual, following the January sales, the increase was smaller than the same period last year.Annually, clothing and footwear prices dropped 2 per cent.At the pumps, motorists saw lower fuel costs last month, as petrol fell by 0.5p per litre on the month to 119.1p. Diesel also fell by 0.2p to 129.3p.The Retail Prices Index (RPI), a separate measure of inflation, was 2.4 per cent, down from 2.5 per cent\u0026nbspin January. It is the lowest since October 2016, when it was 2.2 per cent.It comes ahead of the Bank of England’s interest rate decision on Thursday, when the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) is widely expected to leave rates unchanged at 0.75 per cent.KPMG UK’s chief economist Yael Selfin said the central bank may need to act more aggressively in future.She said: “Our expectations are for inflation to average around the Bank of England’s 2 per cent\u0026nbsptarget this year but to rise further in 2020, putting pressure on them to act more aggressively than markets currently anticipate.”We’ll tell you what’s true.

It was on the side of the angels with the second of those, and stands a better chance of winning the next fight\u0026nbspClick to followThe IndependentHyundai\u0027s patriach Chung Moon-Koo. The family Chung family is locked in a battle with Elliott over HyundaiHyundai Motor was celebrating victory this morning. Its investors rejected a demand for the appointment of several new directors and a huge special idend, tabled by the activist investor, Elliott Advisers, which has become a major thorn in the side of the South Korean conglomerate.\u0026nbspPaul Singer’s outfit may have pushed too hard when it came to the size of the Won7tn (£4.7bn) idend it wanted. Hyundai has vast reserves of cash, but its profits have been in decline and the global outlook is cloudy for the motor industry. Given the latter, it’s perhaps understandable that investors baulked and opted for the company’s offer, even though it is worth less than a sixth of what Elliott was proposing.It was on far firmer ground with its demand for a shake up in the boardroom to foster improved governance and greater accountability at the firm, one of the country’s famed family controlled Chaebol that have long dominated the South Asian nation’s vibrant economy. They have been facing criticism on a number of fronts, including the charge of taking minority investors for granted.\u0026nbspHyundai creates app to unlock and control vehicles with mobile phoneHyundai unveils walking car to help save livesHyundai to introduce new electric cars for 2022While this battle may have been lost Elliott’s war is far from over.\u0026nbspIt won a dust up\u0026nbspover a proposed\u0026nbspownership restructuring last year, which critics held was designed solely to benefit the Chung family, and cement its control.The next one will come when a revised plan is submitted later this year. Hyundai only needed the support of 50 per cent of its investors to knock Elliott back over the idend and board seats, and it was assisted by investors such as South Korea’s National Pension Service, the second biggest shareholder, falling in behind the Chung family.\u0026nbspA revised restructuring plan could require up to two thirds support to pass. Elliott should find that easier to win if it objects by aligning with other overseas investors. They hold about half the company.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.Business news: in pictures Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.110 No deal, no tariffsThe government has announced that it would slash almost all tariffs in the event of a no-deal Brexit.

They can be of benefit to lumbering,\u0026nbspunderperforming companies with moribund boards that get stuck in the mud and are in need of a good jolt. But they can also cause a great deal of damage in their desire for a quick buck, leaving scorched husks behind them and longer term investors scratching their heads and wondering how it happened.\u0026nbspHowever, while its demand for a huge payout from Hyundai is debatable, Elliott’s call for improved governance sees it on the side of the angels.

The index is a measure of inflation calculated by tracking the price of a selected basket of goods and services.Beer prices rose 0.6 per cent\u0026nbspbetween January and February compared with a decline of 1.1 per cent\u0026nbsplast year. Annually, food and alcohol inflation hit 1.1 per cent\u0026nbspand 5.1 per cent\u0026nbsprespectively.The price of food was up 0.4 per cent between January and February compared with 0.1 per cent last year. Alcohol and tobacco were up\u0026nbsp0.9 per cent increase on the month versus flat prices in February 2018.Howard Archer, chief economic adviser at EY Item Club, said: “While February’s rise in inflation may be marginally disappointing for consumer purchasing power, it is still looking appreciably better than in mid-2018 – especially as earnings growth retained its firmer tone in January. Real earnings growth is currently 1.5 per cent, the best level since end-2016, although still appreciably below longterm norms.”Created with Sketch.Tariffs in the event of a no-deal Brexit  Show all 15Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.There will be tariffs on pork in order to protect British farmersThere will be tariffs in place on some cheeses including €22.10100kg of cheddar, €19.10100kg of processed cheese and €18.60100kg on some blue cheesesThere will be no tariffs in place on milkThere will be no tariffs on car parts imported from EuropeThere will be no tariffs on alcoholic drinks - except on some rums due to ingredients used in their distilling processThere will be tariffs on beef in order to protect British farmersThere will be no tariffs on many types of fish including cod, haddock, salmon and sea bass915 Fruit and vegetablesThere will be no tariffs on almost all fruit and vegetablesThere will be no tariffs on chocolate or other cocoa productsThere will be tariffs on poultry in order to protect British farmersThere will be some tariffs in place on ceramisThere will be no tariffs on steelThere will be no tariffs on coalThere will be tariffs on the meat of sheep in order to protect British farmersThere will be tariffs on pork in order to protect British farmersThere will be tariffs in place on some cheeses including €22.10100kg of cheddar, €19.10100kg of processed cheese and €18.60100kg on some blue cheesesThere will be no tariffs in place on milkThere will be no tariffs on car parts imported from EuropeThere will be no tariffs on alcoholic drinks - except on some rums due to ingredients used in their distilling processThere will be tariffs on beef in order to protect British farmersThere will be no tariffs on many types of fish including cod, haddock, salmon and sea bass915 Fruit and vegetablesThere will be no tariffs on almost all fruit and vegetablesThere will be no tariffs on chocolate or other cocoa productsThere will be tariffs on poultry in order to protect British farmersThere will be some tariffs in place on ceramisThere will be no tariffs on steelThere will be no tariffs on coalThere will be tariffs on the meat of sheep in order to protect British farmersHe added that different Brexit outcomes were likely to affect CPI in the coming months.He said: “Our suspicion is that inflation will spike significantly higher if the UK leaves the EU without a deal,\u0026nbspprimarily due to a likely marked fall in sterling – even though the government has indicated that under a temporary scheme, 87 per cent\u0026nbspof imports by value would be eligible for zero-tariff access compared to 80 per cent\u0026nbspof imports currently being tariff-free.”Mike Hardie, head of inflation at the ONS, said: “The rate of inflation is stable, with a modest rise in food as well as alcohol and tobacco offset by clothing and footwear prices rising by less than they did a year ago.”Upward pressure also came from recreation and culture, as prices rose between January and February 2019 compared with a smaller rise between the same two months last year. Computer games had the biggest effect.But clothing and footwear prices had a downward effect. Although pricetags were higher in February as usual, following the January sales, the increase was smaller than the same period last year.Annually, clothing and footwear prices dropped 2 per cent.At the pumps, motorists saw lower fuel costs last month, as petrol fell by 0.5p per litre on the month to 119.1p. Diesel also fell by 0.2p to 129.3p.The Retail Prices Index (RPI), a separate measure of inflation, was 2.4 per cent, down from 2.5 per cent\u0026nbspin January. It is the lowest since October 2016, when it was 2.2 per cent.It comes ahead of the Bank of England’s interest rate decision on Thursday, when the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) is widely expected to leave rates unchanged at 0.75 per cent.KPMG UK’s chief economist Yael Selfin said the central bank may need to act more aggressively in future.She said: “Our expectations are for inflation to average around the Bank of England’s 2 per cent\u0026nbsptarget this year but to rise further in 2020, putting pressure on them to act more aggressively than markets currently anticipate.”We’ll tell you what’s true.

Thousands of students as part of the Youth for Climate movement took time off school to call for stronger action against climate change.A Conservative plan to change the law to allow new grammar schools to open was scrapped following the general election – but selective schools are still allowed to expand, or open annexes.Dr Nuala Burgess, chair of Comprehensive Future, said: “The legal position is very clear – new grammar schools are illegal.“It’s a shocking use of education funding to try to bypass the law and build a new grammar school via the back door.\u0026nbsp“If this goes ahead, there’s nothing to stop the Department for Education from building dozens of dubious ‘annexe’ grammar schools all around the country, all without parliamentary scrutiny, and all in breach of the law.”Grammar schools look to open \u0027annexes\u0027 amid ban on selectionShe added that the country needs “good, properly funded, local secondary schools that work for everyone”.Last year, the Weald of Kent Grammar School opened a controversial annexe in Sevenoaks – 10 miles from its original site – after ministers ruled it to be an expansion of the same school.“The government is expanding selective education and ignoring all the evidence that such a system harms the life chances of our poorest pupils,” said Dr Burgess.“Expanding grammar schools deprives three or four surrounding schools of their most talented pupils, dramatically impacting on attainment levels.\u0026nbsp“This is why Kent’s results are so poor, and the problem certainly isn’t going to be fixed by creating another grammar school.”Government gives £50m to expand grammar schools amid funding \u0027crisis\u0027Government gives £50m to 16 grammar schools for 4,000 pupilsThousands protest against grammar school plans to boost poorer pupilsThe grammar-comprehensive school advantage gap has never been so wideThe two schools in Kent are bidding for funding from the Selective School Expansion Fund, which awards £50m\u0026nbspeach year to grammar schools that can demonstrate “ambitious and realistic” plans to boost the intake of disadvantaged pupils.According to Comprehensive Future, Barton Court currently admits 9.7 per cent of pupils classed as disadvantaged, while Queen Elizabeth’s is said to admit 6 per cent.The campaign group said it was seeking legal advice about whether there was potential to challenge the funding of a satellite selective school using Department for Education funding.The Independent has contacted Barton Court Grammar School, Queen Elizabeth’s Grammar School and Kent County Council for comment.We’ll tell you what’s true.

Are you kidding me? Give me a break! Everyone, including Facebook, have tech debt and security debt that piles up. But that\u0027s not an excuse any longer, Sam Curry, chief security officer at security firm Cybereason, told\u0026nbspThe Independent.Facebook is starting to look like critical social infrastructure, where there responsibility is to the public. It\u0027s past time to go back and clean the skeletons out of the closets. How can we trust this platform to get bigger and get more connected under the hood if they can\u0027t do the basis blocking and tackling right? Facebook needs a security strategy for the 21st century not the 20th century.

Then on 25 October a cow fell ill on a farm near the market town of Oswestry in Shropshire.That was the beginning of an epidemic that only ended five months later, with the farming business on its knees and huge areas of the country covered by overlapping five-mile exclusion zones.A total of 442,000 animals had been slaughtered in 2,364 separate outbreaks. Roughly £150m\u0026nbsp–\u0026nbspa huge amount at the time –\u0026nbspwas spent on slaughter costs and lost sales farmers received £27m in compensation.It became known as the Great Cattle Plague, and even today it is still the subject of angry discussion in rural circles.As outbreaks popped up around the country, triggered by the combination of the virus’s 14-day incubation period and its extreme infectiousness, the Ministry of Agriculture began imposing five-mile exclusion zones as new infections were identified animals could not be moved in or out.Created with Sketch.Looking back at Britain’s foot-and-mouth outbreaks: 1927-1967 Show all 25Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Two farmworkers read a notice declaring a footpath closed because of foot-and-mouthA man hoses down a car at Cockernach Farm, Barkway,  Hertfordshire, in an attempt to contain the spread of foot-and-mouth.

Entrances to fields and farms were blocked with disinfected straw members of the public were not allowed to enter them.Humans are usually safe from the disease, but at least one person died from the epidemic some of the worst outbreaks were in Cheshire, Shropshire and Wales.The disease was later reckoned to have been virtually eradicated throughout the European Union after a campaign of vaccination and slaughter. That makes yesterday’s action, in which the EU banned all meat, milk and livestock exports from the UK, understandable.After slaughter, farms had to be scrubbed twice a day with special disinfectant and animals were not allowed on to the land for at least six months. Restricted entry signs stood over the entrance to farmland, bearing warnings including: “You are now entering an infected area.”Horse racing was suspended in Britain after the 1967 outbreak and the official Shrovetide football game in Ashbourne, Derbyshire, was cancelled in 1968 because of continuing restrictions.The outbreak was finally linked to frozen lamb carcasses imported from Argentina.Although Britain did suffer another foot-and-mouth outbreak in 1981 on the Isle of Wight, it was easily isolated. A total of 200 cattle and 369 pigs were destroyed.This article first appeared in The Independent on 22 February 2001We’ll tell you what’s true.

In nine days, Scottish farmers and dealers reach the more important deadline when they can apply for a resumption of overseas exports, because then they will have been free of the disease for 90 days.The auction at Kirkwall, capital of the Orkneys six miles off the mainland, was seen as a trial run for the resumption of trade in other unaffected areas of the United Kingdom.Though no more than two dozen buyers, many of them mainland farmers from Aberdeenshire, made the ferry trip for yesterday’s sale, only auction and government veterinary officials, and representatives from the Scottish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, were allowed close contact with the livestock. The buyers, dressed from head-to-toe in hats, clean boiler suits, rubber boots and white plastic raincoats, had to forgo the usual close inspections of the cattle before the sale began.For the Orcadians, the resumption of the weekly cattle mart was more than just a lifeline for business. The social effect of the closure has been devastating. Since the beginning of the crisis, movement on the island has been curtailed because friends and neighbours fearful of spreading the disease kept their distance from other farms.Created with Sketch.How the 2001 foot-and-mouth outbreak brought Britain to a standstill Show all 26Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Around 150 dead cows that may have come in contact with foot-and-mouth disease are burnt on a funeral pyre at Great Warley Hall farm in Great Warley, Essex, 27 February 2001.

There’s much still to do to get out of the mess that foot-and-mouth has caused and get the farmers back to a kind of normality.”Steven Metcalf, chairman of Orkney Auction Mart, said: “The social effect of the mart reopening is good news. Early in the outbreak people were frightened to move around and weren’t visiting neighbours or friends. It is a good boost for the morale of agriculture and it is a step nearer to normal trading and normal life.”Although the slaughter of more than 800,000 animals north of the border has so far limited the number of confirmed cases to 187, Maria Limonci, spokeswoman for the NFUS, said Scottish farmers needed to see export bans lifted. “Around 40 per cent of the sheep produced in Scotland usually go out of the country and at present they have nowhere to go,” she said. “More farmers deal in sheep than cattle, and this was only one sale. It’s a huge step in the right direction but it doesn’t mean things are now OK.“We have to hope nothing goes wrong in next few days. Having 90 clear days would give Scotland grounds to put forward the proposal to Europe to allow exports to restart.”In England, continuing restrictions prompted 600 farmers yesterday to demand a public inquiry into the handling of the crisis.David Handley, head of the pressure group Farmers For Action who spearheaded last year’s fuel blockade, led a protest march from Hyde Park to Downing Street to hand in a petition condemning the government’s policy on dealing with the crisis and the failure to implement a vaccination strategy to prevent the spread of the disease.Although the turnout was lower than expected, protesters included farmers from foot-and-mouth hotspots in North Yorkshire, Cumbria and Devon and Cornwall.Up to 3,000 civil servants at the Department of the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs held a one-day strike on 20 August 2001 over pay inequalities that followed formation of the new departmentThis article first appeared in The Independent on 21 August 2001We’ll tell you what’s true.

Nor is the belief that it remains one even now. Knowledgeable historians calculated that it was once the greatest empire in human history, if one takes into account both the territory it controlled and the time its\u0026nbspdomination lasted.\u0026nbspAdventurous political analysts have argued that in recent times Russia is inclined to regain its imperial powers. As Zbigniew Brzesinski, the former\u0026nbspnational security adviser to President Jimmy Carter, put it in 1997: “without Ukraine, Russia ceases to be a Eurasian empire … however, if Moscow regains control over Ukraine, Russia automatically again regains the wherewithal to become a powerful imperial state, ning Europe and Asia.”\u0026nbspThe annexation of Crimea is apparent evidence of this process.Yet many observers believe the present “empire” (ie the Russian Federation) might itself collapse once more, dissolving into different parts. Some politicians hope that it will.Very few, however, attempt to understand the nature of the Russian imperial project – and the similarities and differences between the Russian empire and the other European ones.The most striking similarity between the Russian and the western imperial histories – the one that is arguably critical to any European adventure of the kind – is the fact that they were clearly ided into two discrete, consecutive phases.\u0026nbspWhat the Roman empire can tell us about modern middle eastThe first was the period of settler colonisation, by which the applicable imperial power subjugates great landmasses either on its own continent or overseas, and relocates there significant numbers of people, to the point they are able to outnumber the indigenous tribes. This was the case for the Russians in Siberia, for the French in Louisiana and Canada, for the British in the Thirteen Colonies, Australia and New Zealand, as well as, in some senses, for the Spanish in Latin America.\u0026nbspAll these appropriations were made between the early 16th and mid-18th centuries and resulted in what Angus Maddison called “the western offshoots”.\u0026nbspThe second phase involved more straightforward military conquest this tended to see locals being dominated by relatively small regular armies and a complicated system of vassalage (like in the case of the British Raj in India). Here Russia followed the western path as well: just as the French conquered Indochina and west Africa and the British took huge parts of Asia, from modern Pakistan to Malaya, and of Africa, from Kenya to Rhodesia, so the Russians added to their empire both the Caucasus and parts of central Asia, confronting the British during the Pandjeh incident of 1885.In both phases, Russia was as European in its behaviour as either Great Britain or France: it built its empire directed by European logic and using European means of communication and warfare. Nevertheless, between the western method and the Russian approach there was one huge difference.Created with Sketch.Protests break out after Russia seize Ukraine warships Show all 32Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Activists of opposition parties burn flares during a rally demanding to break an agreement with Russia on the use of the Azov Sea and the Kerch Strait, in front of the parliament building in KievVolunteers with the right-wing paramilitary Azov National Corps light flares during a rally on the snowy streets in front of the Ukrainian parliament in Kiev after Russia seized two of their armored artillery vessels and a tug boat in the Black SeaUkrainian Nationalists demand to break the diplomatic relations with Russia and nationalization of Russian property in UkraineUkrainian activists burn flares during their rally in front of Russian Consulate in KharkivSeized Ukrainian ships, small armoured artillery ships and a tug boat, are seen anchored in a port of KerchThe President of Ukraine, Petro Poroshenko, announced, on 25 November, at a meeting of the National Security and Defense Council that they will introduce martial law in Ukraine for a period of 60 days and appeal to the Parliament to consider the moveRussia seized two small-sized \u0027Berdiansk\u0027 and \u0027Nikopol\u0027 armored artillery boats.

This forced the colonial powers to turn to military force effectively to create new, second empires – usually in different places.\u0026nbspIn Russia’s empire, meanwhile, neither its Siberian provinces nor the newly “reconciled” lands of today’s Ukraine and Belarus tried to secede.\u0026nbspTherefore, while Britain and France in fact possessed two different empires each, consecutively, the first and the second Russian empires (the first achieved through settler colonisation, the second through military action) were simply added to one another, rather like the traditional Russian matryoshka doll.\u0026nbspThis key difference between the imperial histories of Russia and the west helps to explain how the European powers have ended up where they are today.In particular, let’s consider the dissolution of the Soviet Union. With some minor exceptions, the borders of Russia now resemble those that existed in the mid-17th century, the time when the first empires of both Russia and the west powers were almost complete. Therefore, I would argue that the fall of the USSR was broadly the same process which evolved on a global scale between the end of the Second World War and the early 1970s and which is widely known as “decolonisation”\u0026nbsp(I dislike the word because I believe the European overseas appropriations of the time were not colonies, but rather military controlled possessions).\u0026nbspBut whereas this process ultimately left countries like Britain and France without empires at all, today’s Russia lost only its second – by retaining its first, it never lost its ambition for future re-expansion.For political elites in Russia and Ukraine, war still makes senseHere we should return to history.\u0026nbspThe Russian and the western empires were similar as it comes to the timings of their creation and to the methods of their construction – but they differ from each other in terms of the actors that stood behind the process.In western Europe the major nations (kingdoms then of course) had gained a clear national identity before they started their colonial adventures. Portugal, the oldest European nation state, fully sovereign since 1143, was the first to launch its overseas expansion. France emerged in full grandeur after peace with Britain in 1453 and the defeat of Burgundy in 1482 Spain became united in 1469 and Britain itself evolved as a single state after England was joined by Scotland and Ireland under James I in 1603.\u0026nbspWe can see this period as pre-imperial. By the time the Portuguese, the Spanish, the French, and the British sought to expand overseas, their own national unity was beyond question. This meant that when their first empires dissolved towards the end of the 18th and beginning of the 19th centuries, little damage was done to the sense of national identity of the imperial bases. As a consequence, the later, “second” empires appeared in the same sense British and French, as were the earlier ones.Contemporary Russia remains and will remain an empire since it simply has no place to retreat toIn Russia, things followed a different path. Moscow, a small settlement at the time when the Kievan Rus’ (the medieval alliance of Slavic and Finnic groups) reached its apex in the 11th and 12th centuries, became stronger when the separated Russian princedoms fought for their liberation from the Mongols.\u0026nbspTill that time, the vast country we call Russia today was united not so much by national or even quasi-national identity, as by its Orthodox faith as well as by the belief that it had become the beacon of the “true” Christian faith after the fall of Constantinople.\u0026nbspThe Muscovites overthrew the Mongol domination in 1480 and less than a century later ruined the Mongol khanates in the Volga region and started their expansion to the east. It took them another 100\u0026nbspyears to reach the Pacific shores – but in the west they weren’t able to advance further than the current border between Russia and Belarus.\u0026nbsp“Russia” as the country’s name became widespread in the mid-17th century as all the three major centres of Russian statehood – Novgorod, Kiev and Vladimir – started to be governed from Moscow. But the key point about this development is that the Russian state emerged as an empire, was administered as an empire, and possessed many other imperial elements. In other words, Russia itself arose as an empire – built not by Russia, but rather by Muscovy. Therefore the first Russian empire was actually the empire of Moscow, and not the empire of Russia.The Muscovy-built empire called Russia consolidated itself during the 17th and 18th century, strengthening its domination both in its settler colonies in the east and in the “original” “Russian” lands in the west.\u0026nbspOnly as this consolidation process was actually completed did Russia begin\u0026nbspto conquer militarily neighbouring lands – from Finland in the North to the Caucasus in the south from Poland in the west to Bukhara and Kokand in the southeast.\u0026nbspAs such, the second Russian empire became an empire built by Russia, not Muscovy and in a self-fulfilling cycle, bolstered the sense of a “Russian” national identity.\u0026nbspThe imperial core of all the western European examples remained the same from beginning to end (Britain, France, Spain etc) in the Russian case, it changed from Muscovy to Russia. Therefore, in the 20th century it was not only Stalin’s will that ided the Soviet Union into different “Socialist Republics”, but rather Russia’s entire history. The vast “country” of the USSR consisted of the Russian republic, which had boundaries similar to the first Russian empire, and all the other republics which replicated the second Russian empire’s military possessions.\u0026nbspIt should be noted that while in the USSR-era Russian republic Russians themselves accounted for 81.5 per cent of the population according to the 1989 census. In none of the other Soviet republics did they make even a simple majority.\u0026nbspThis history and these demographics were the two major factors that made the Soviet Union ready for speedy disintegration after 1989.From all this, three crucial conclusions can be drawn.First, contemporary Russia remains and will remain an empire since it simply has no place to retreat to. As Russia lost its possessions in 1991 it returned to an entity territorially similar to one that started the last wave of expansion in the late 18th century.\u0026nbspOn the face of it, it looks like all the other European empires which, during the “decolonisation” of the 20th century were pushed back to those territorial limits from which they began. But while the western imperial cores were and always had been nation states, (some of them democracies and even republics), Russia was itself an empire when it started to expand two and a half centuries ago.\u0026nbspA socially acceptable form of murderRussia detains two US Mormons as tensions flare US generals ‘thinking about possibility of nuclear war’Russia orders all orcas and belugas kept in \u0027whale prison\u0027 be set freeThe Russians are European people who share the major European values and principles – but nevertheless Russia as a country arose not as a nation based on these values but as an empire driven by a thirst for power and expansion.\u0026nbspIf a nation state builds an empire and fails, it comes back to being a (hopefully better) nation state, one which transcends imperial aspirations. But if an empire constructs an even bigger empire and fails, it reemerges as an offended, revanchist and aggressive empire – exactly as Russia now looks like.The second I draw is that we should not expect Russia to fall apart, as many current observers suggest. Even though the country remains multiethnic, the Russians make up the majority of the population in almost every part of the country. I cannot think of any cases in which truly consolidated, culturally homogenous country collapses and is ided into parts unless as the result of a war (a prospect for which there are no markers).\u0026nbspInstances of countries existing as ided entities but being inhabited by the same ethnic group or people were all caused by military conflicts (East and West Germany, South and North Korea, North\u0026nbspand South\u0026nbspVietnam, continental China and Taiwan).\u0026nbspNo foreign force could at present defeat Russia militarily and cut it into parts moreover, the fear of external powers is so huge in today’s Russia that those parts of the country that used to have some inclination for greater autonomy (like\u0026nbspeastern Siberia or the far\u0026nbspeast), no longer do.\u0026nbspAnxiety in those areas about the growing influence of China outweighs any concerns about growing pressure from and “exploitation” by the (imperial) centre. As Russia becomes weaker in the economic and political sense, any outsider hopes for its dismemberment actually fade.The final conclusion is the most important and it is this. There is, despite everything, a crucial weakness in the existing political construct of the Russian “Federation”. Inside this federation there are still several regions that look completely alien to it – those that were acquired not during the first wave of empire-building but during the second.\u0026nbspThese territories are the entire north Caucasus, which was attached to Russia as a result of bloody wars in the mid-19th century, and the Republic of Tuva at the border with Mongolia that first became part of the Soviet Union in 1944. The north Causasus lands are by no means “Russian”: today the complete share of the ethnic Russian, Ukrainian and Belarusian population in the “Russian” republic of Ingushetia is a mere 0.9 per cent. Compare this with\u0026nbspremote Kyrgyzstan, a sovereign nation in central Asia, where it accounts for close to 6 per cent.\u0026nbspThese parts of the current Russia are elements of the second empire which were incorporated into the first one due to a historical mistake. Things were nearly different: in early 1990s, as Chechnya revolted against the Russian rule, it was thought other regional republics were ready to follow – but it never happened. \u0026nbspNow, Russia claims it “re-established” its control over its former military possessions, although in reality it pays countless tribute to local “khans” and “emirs”. In the end though, these remnants of the second Russia empire will surely secede at some stage.\u0026nbspIn sum then, Russia is a unique creature: not so much superior to other European empires, but drastically different from them. These differences shouldn’t be either neglected or denied one should look on the country sine ira et studio for exploring its European nature and history and for understanding what might be expected from it in the future.\u0026nbspRussia is the last existing empire – and an empire that lasts, if not forever, than for longer than its western equivalents. It should not be criticised for this, but explored and investigated.Vladislav Inozemtsev’s new book, with Alexander Abalov, is ‘The Last Empire’, published\u0026nbspin Russian\u0026nbspby Alpina Publishing House.

It is able to identify different facial features, as well as glasses, clothing, makeup and facial hair.Up until now, Face ID has struggled to differentiate between identical twins, though Apple claims it is still significantly more advanced than its Touch ID fingerprint scanner.The creating and storing of facial maps have inevitably led to concerns from privacy advocates, who worry about the implications if such data was accidentally leaked and fell into the hands of malicious actors.“I think we should be quite worried,” Jay Stanley, a senior policy analyst at the American Civil Liberties Union, told\u0026nbspThe Independent\u0026nbspwhen the technology was first announced.“The chances we are going to see mischief around facial data is pretty high – if not today, then soon, and if not on Apple then on Android.”It is not clear whether Apple plans to introduce the new subepidermal\u0026nbsptechnology to Face ID in its 2019 range of iPhones and iPads, as the company\u0026nbspdoes not comment on rumours surrounding forthcoming products.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

This, however, needs to be further investigated.”Humans share almost all of our DNA with cats, cattle and miceResearcher Derry Taylor monitored 22 of the animals –\u0026nbspnative to southeast Asia –\u0026nbspin\u0026nbspspontaneous social play sessions.The bears, aged up to 12, were housed in Bornean Sun Bear Conservation Centre in Malaysia in which enclosures were large enough to allow bears to choose whether to interact or not.During hundreds of play bouts, two distinct expressions were coded – one involving a display of the upper incisor teeth, and one without.\u0026nbspThe bears were most likely to show precise facial mimicry during gentle play.Mr Taylor said such subtle mimicking could be to help two bears signal that they are ready to play more roughly, or to strengthen social bonds.He said: “It is widely believed that we only find complex forms of communication in species with complex social systems.“As sun bears are a largely solitary species, our study of their facial communication questions this belief, because it shows a complex form of facial communication that until now was known only in more social species.”The results were published on Thursday in the online journal Scientific Reports.We’ll tell you what’s true.

Not all companies are prepared for the worstWith a week to go, the prime minister has finally sought to delay Brexit.

And in some cases, that’s probably true. (There is still the feeling that “it just won’t happen” in some quarters.)\u0026nbspBut there is a much larger slate of smaller firms that simply lack the resources to be able to plan effectively\u0026nbspfor the\u0026nbsplooming earthquake.\u0026nbspWatchdog bans advert encouraging loans to fund Brexit food stockpilesWe’re just over a week away from the notional exit date and it’s still the case that no one really\u0026nbsphas the faintest idea how (or when) this will end, and what the impact will be. That being the case, small firms have opted to take a wait and see approach. They will react to what emerges, because they don’t have much of a choice.\u0026nbspThe IoD, and the Scottish National Party, have called for businesses to be issued with prep vouchers, along the lines of\u0026nbspthe\u0026nbspschemes the Irish and Dutch governments have put into operation.\u0026nbspThese, the IoD says, could persuade some to act in the event of a short delay by incentivising them to take preparatory measures.\u0026nbspWhatever is agreed, those businesses that are prepping will continue to do so. Those that aren’t will carry on crossing their fingersBut that looks unlikely at present. For a start, the EU doesn’t seem minded to agree to a short extension\u0026nbspand such a scheme would be an example of something the current government seems allergic to: forward-thinking policy-making.Suren Thiru, from the British Chambers of Commerce, says those that have been preparing for no deal will continue to do so if a delay is secured. That means a continuation of the weak investment that is slowing the UK economy to a crawl as resources are erted to emergency planning.\u0026nbspThe problem for all businesses, as he points out, is that there are just “so many key questions to which we don’t have answers”. How will trade work, how will customs work, how will\u0026nbspfirms lay their hands on the staff they need?The prospect of a “rolling”, non-date-specific delay fills businesses with almost as much horror as no deal (which\u0026nbspmost regard as the equivalent of Hereditary, The Exorcist\u0026nbspand Children of the Corn all merged into one).\u0026nbspSo whatever is agreed, those businesses that are prepping will keep doing so. Those that aren’t will carry on crossing their fingers in the hope of Westminster coming to its senses.\u0026nbspThey’d probably best cross their toes, and anything else they can lay their hands on while they’re at it.\u0026nbspGot an unanswered question about Brexit?

I couldn’t do very much.\u0026nbspIt was a really difficult time, and all the while his visa was getting refused.“Right now I’m just sitting at home, and I’m desperate to go back to work. Childcare costs almost £1,000 each per month,\u0026nbspso it’s not worth me working part-time. I’m having to rely on benefits, which is not what I want.“If he were here and we were a unit, everything would be consolidated. We would be able to support each other. But right now our life is on hold. If I’d have known things would be this complicated, I would have had an abortion.”If she were able to go back to work, Ms\u0026nbspMettle-Olympio\u0026nbspwould be able to sponsor a visa for\u0026nbspMr\u0026nbspKponouglo, which carries a minimum income requirement of £18,600 a year. But without childcare, it is impossible for her to meet this threshold.Families forced to spend Christmas apart due to UK immigration rules“I’m in a catch-22 situation,” she said. “And it’s been very difficult for my partner. He feels incompetent and almost useless. I have to tell him this is beyond our control. We’re doing\u0026nbspall we can do.”The\u0026nbspJoint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants (JCWI) said at the “very least”\u0026nbsp15,000 British children were living without one of their parents because of family visa restrictions. When asked to provide a more\u0026nbspaccurate figure in a recent parliamentary question, immigration minister Caroline Nokes refused.Mary Atkinson, family reunion campaigner at the JCWI, said: “In 2019, we can and should do better than forcing young mothers into a\u0026nbspsituation like this, making them raise their children alone and give up on their careers simply because of who they have chosen to build a life with.A Home Office spokesperson said: “All UK visa applications are considered on their inidual merits, on the basis of the evidence available and in line with UK immigration rules.”We’ll tell you what’s true.

The letter focuses on overshooting a March deadline for re-opening the seaside attraction. The work and pensions secretary\u0026nbspsaid she “can’t support any scenario” in which the pier remains closed indefinitely.While she is the MP for the area, Ms Rudd has little power to intervene as the pier is privately owned. The letter has prompted numerous comparisons to the torturous Brexit negotiations between Theresa May, the European Union, and parliament.Here is the letter:It was described as “an ill-disguised jibe about Mrs May\u0027s habit of keeping her cabinet in the dark about her plans for Brexit” by one newspaper.\u0026nbspOn Twitter many have expressed similar views. “This entire letter is an absolutely masterful trolling of Theresa May,” journalist Thomas Colson wrote.A genuine row has been unfolding in Hastings in recent months after the purchase of the pier which underwent a £14m lottery-funded facelift in 2017 and won it the prestigious Stirling Prize for architecture.Created with Sketch.Who could succeed Theresa May as Conservative leader?

As of tonight, April\u0026nbsp12th\u0026nbspis the new March 29th.Speaking after the agreement was struck, European Council president Donald Tusk said Ms May “accepts the extension scenarios”.He added: “Frankly speaking I was really sad before our meeting –\u0026nbspnow I am much more optimistic.”European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker added: “This closes and completes the full package. There’s no more we can give. We’re hopeful that the agreement will be adopted by the House of Commons.”I hope we can all agree that we are at the moment of decision, Theresa May said at a press conference in the early hours of the morning.Jeremy Corbyn refuses to rule out revoking Article 50It gives us the opportunity, MPs next week, to look at the choices that clearly face them: we can leave with a deal, in an orderly manner, have that extension until 22 May - or, if we don\u0027t get that deal through, if we don\u0027t get that vote through then before 12 April we have to come forward with another plan, and if that plan means a further extension it means standing in those European Parliamentary elections.At the start of the mammoth Brussels drafting session Theresa May took questions from EU leaders about her Brexit strategy,\u0026nbspwith diplomats privy to discussions describing her responses as unconvincing and wooden.According to several accounts, the prime minister was unable to answer what would happen if she could not pass the vote in parliament and had no apparent plan B, spooking her fellow leaders.After Ms May was sent out of the room, the 27 leaders discussed options for an extension that included dates in April, May, and delays until the end of the year. Both conditional and unconditional extensions were considered by EU leaders.Discussions and drafting of the new plans spilled over into a late night dinner, with a planned meeting about China-EU relations pushed back until Friday. Planned press conferences by Theresa May, Donald Tusk and Jean-Claude Juncker were postponed until just before midnight.Leaders ultimately agreed a text which read: “The European Council agrees to extension until 22 May, provided the withdrawal agreement is approved by the House of Commons next week. If the withdrawal agreement is not approved by the House of Commons next week, the European Council\u0026nbspagrees to an extension until 12 April and expects UK to indicate a way forward before this date for consideration by EUCO.”Arriving at the summit in the afternoon Theresa May said the prospect of a delay was “a matter of regret” for her. She also confirmed she would seek an extension until 30 June.On the way into the meeting Emmanuel Macron had perhaps the starkest warning of Ms May’s European counterparts, telling reporters: “We have to be clear: we can discuss and agree an extension if it is a technical extension in the case of a ‘yes’ vote. In the case of a ‘no’ vote, it will guide everybody to a no deal, for sure.”The French president said that a longer delay would require “a deep political change” in the UK, adding: “We cannot have a long-lasting situation where there is no visibility, no purpose, no political majority.”Meanwhile Irish prime minister Leo Varadkar described the situation in London as “somewhat chaotic” and said a no-deal Brexit would be a decision by the UK because it had the power to revoke Article 50.We’ll tell you what’s true.

back\u0026nbspher Brexit deal by staging repeat votes are in tatters, after speaker\u0026nbspJohn Bercow dramatically blocked the tactic, citing rules dating back to before the Gunpowder Plot.The prime minister was left stunned by the shock announcement – which torpedoed her hopes of a third “meaningful vote” while threatening MPs with a long delay to leaving the EU if they refused to give way.The dramatic twist, outlawing fresh votes without substantial changes, left ministers scrabbling for solutions – including an extraordinary proposal to suspend parliament and start a new session.It also achieved the remarkable feat of uniting supporters of a no-deal Brexit and a second referendum, who both believed it made their favoured option more likely.The solicitor general, who warned of “a constitutional crisis”, put forward the escape route of ending the current parliamentary session early to get around the 1604 convention invoked by the speaker, which lapses after a fresh Queen’s Speech.Here’s how Theresa May can get around Bercow’s dramatic Brexit ruling“There are ways around this – a prorogation of parliament and a new session,” said Robert Buckland.Created with

surrenders in reference to the likelihood of Brexit being delayed after the vote Experts pointed to a possible precedent from 1948, when Attlee’s Labour government prorogued parliament for a new 12-day session to pass legislation to reduce the power\u0026nbspof the House of Lords.No 10 is also mulling a possible vote to overturn the speaker’s ruling – but this seemed only likely to succeed if there are enough supporters of the deal in the first place.There was no immediate official response from Downing Street, other than to express its fury that Mr Bercow gave no warning of his bombshell announcement, made in the Commons chamber.The speaker said a further meaningful vote\u0026nbspwould be ruled out of order if the motion was “the same or substantially the same” – under a 1604 convention to stop the government bullying parliament on issues MPs have rejected.Ms May has already admitted that the negotiations with the EU are over, making it hard for her to argue that a further meaningful vote will be on a different question.Crucially, the speaker suggested something would have to be renegotiated with the EU to constitute a “change”, rather than, for example, a clarification of legal advice by the attorney general.Is Matteo Salvini going to veto a Brexit extension?French EU minister names cat ‘Brexit’ because of its indecisive natureMr Bercow told MPs: “What the government cannot legitimately do is resubmit to the house the same proposition – or substantially the same proposition – as that of last week, which was rejected by 149 votes.”The Independent revealed in January that pro-EU MPs believed that Ms May’s tactic to bludgeon her deal through, despite heavy defeats, was barred by parliamentary rules.Senior Tories were livid, believing the speaker had once again laid bare his anti-Brexit bias while twisting constitutional rules to suit his purpose.Rory Stewart, the prisons minister, taunted Mr Bercow by tweeting: “‘When I use a word,’\u0026nbspHumpty Dumpty said, in rather a scornful tone, ‘it means just what I choose it to mean.’”He added: “In the normal course of events, as the speaker says, parliament says no, and the issue is dropped.“But in this case, this is not an option, because these votes respond to an instruction in a referendum, endorsed by parliament, which rules out dropping back to the status quo.”Supporters of a Final Say referendum were delighted, with former Tory MP Anna Soubry telling\u0026nbspThe Independent: “It puts a second referendum very firmly at the top of the agenda –\u0026nbspit must do. We need a way out of this and this is the only way out.”Guto Bebb, a former Tory minister and People’s Vote supporter, said: “It is inconceivable now for ministers to carry on trying to force this broken Brexit deal on the people of the United Kingdom.”And David Lammy, a Labour supporter of the anti-Brexit Best for Britain group, said: “If the prime minister wants us to vote on her deal again, she should add an amendment allowing for her deal to be put to the people.”In the short term, the speaker’s intervention killed off any prospect of a third meaningful vote this week – already in doubt as the Democratic Unionist Party failed to switch sides.It appears certain that Ms May will have to ask EU leaders for a long\u0026nbspextension – anything between nine\u0026nbspand 21 months – to the Article 50 process at a summit in Brussels on Thursday.The new departure date will then be put to a “take-it-or-leave-it vote” in the Commons and Lords next week, just days before the 29 March Brexit day.For that reason, it increases the chances of a crash-out Brexit, which the Treasury has predicted could\u0026nbsptrigger a near 10 per cent GDP decline.However, a long extension could also open up the space for a further referendum, which some believe the prime minister might yet embrace if it is the only hope of passing her agreement.Speaking to a silent Commons, Mr Bercow said repeat votes had been blocked on 12 occasions up until 1920 – a situation only not repeated since because of “general compliance”.“This convention is very strong and longstanding, dating back to 2 April 1604,” the speaker said.“It’s a necessary rule to ensure the sensible use of house time and the proper respect for the decision which it takes.”We’ll tell you what’s true.

So, I think it won\u0027t go through.Mr Kwarteng replied: The government\u0027s focus at the moment is to make sure we can potentially get a meaningful vote and actually secure the deal on the table, that is what I have always maintained.If the meaningful vote doesn\u0027t get through, we will have to look at alternatives.Kwarteng adds that\u0026nbspit would be “surprising” if the prime minister\u0026nbspdoes not offer free votes on any indicative votes in the House of Commons, should MPs reject the meaningful vote.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspIndicative votes allow MPs to vote on a series of Brexit plans, including a second referendum.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspIf the House is being asked to decide a way forward, it would be surprising if those votes were not free votes.Kwarteng provides a pretty dire response to Pennycook, and the only question he does engage with\u0026nbsp(when will the next meaningful vote be), he fails to answer, simply saying it is the government\u0027s intention to bring the vote back.\u0026nbspIn respect to his question about the meaningful vote, it is the Government\u0027s full intention, I think, to bring this meaningful vote to the House, he says.Matthew Pennycook - Labour’s shadow Brexit minister - is now asking an urgent question on the Article 50 extension.\u0026nbspResponding for the government Kwasi Kwarteng outlines the conclusions of the EU Council summit last night.\u0026nbspHe says any extension of Article 50 beyond May 2019 will require the UK to take part in European elections later this year - something the PM will not countenance.\u0026nbspPennycook says given the significance of the summit yesterday, a statement should have been made to parliament, rather than opposition MPs “dragging” ministers to the chamber.Sir Graham Brady, the chairman of the backbench 1922 committee, was reported to have met with the prime minister earlier this week to tell her that most Conservative MPs now want her to stand down.The Daily  said that Sir Graham visited her in Downing Street on Monday after being bombarded with text messages from MPs demanding she should go.The paper said that it was one of a series of direct confrontations with Conservative MPs in the run-up to the summit.Asked about the claims by The Independent, Sir Graham declined to comment.Speaking on the BBC’s Radio 4 Today programme, the former Ukip leader Nigel Farage said he will take over the leadership of the Brexit part.\u0026nbspWhen asked if he would stand again in any EU elections for the new party, Mr Farage said: Absolutely I will.The Brexit Party was set up a few weeks ago, it\u0027s registered with the Electoral Commission, it is at the moment a virtual party - it\u0027s a website - we haven\u0027t launched.\u0026nbspWe’ll tell you what’s true.

Residents have complained about traffic jams, as visitors have arrived as early as 5.30am to visit the wildflowers, whose burst of growth was triggered by recent record-breaking rainfall. One person was reportedly hurt in a traffic accident.For the last few weeks, crowds have swarmed onto the fields, many ignoring\u0026nbsp instructions that they stay on the designated path. Some have even picked the flowers to take home.\u0026nbspMayor Steve Manos told The Independent he had never known a\u0026nbspbloom as spectacular as the one this year. “It only happens when it rains hard,” he said. “The last one was 2017, and before that it was 2010.”“People were pulled over on the side of the road to see the flowers as we drove here,” she said. “It was amazing to see the number of flowers grow as we got closer.”Mr Manos, mayor of the city located 70 miles to the south east of Los Angeles, posted videos of himself helping direct traffic on Facebook, to try and give an insight into how bad the situation was.\u0026nbspOn Monday morning, amid some criticism over the shutdown, the city said access to Walker Canyon had been reopened, though parking was extremely limited.\u0026nbspMr Manos appeared in another brief video, standing in front of people walking through the footpaths amid the flowers.REDIRECT Nature Studies by Michael McCarthy: A Western Isles idyllWild flowers are overpowered by exhaust fumesBritain’s most common wild flowers are latest species to disappearThe last stand of the wild flower“As you can see, there are a number of people behind me here to experience the bloom.\u0026nbspBut we are full.

It would be an Establishment stitch-up, with serious consequences for the public’s faith in democracy for decades to come.For those Labour supporters who voted to leave, it’s a reminder that the party’s MPs are desperate to overturn the result of the ‘People’s Vote’ in June .There are some notable exceptions. But the vast majority are determined to frustrate Brexit, regardless of the result of our biggest ever democratic exercise.Labour is now far more interested in north London than the north of England.The threat of Remainers wrecking our departure gets more pressing by the day.Brexiteers must accept reality and back the best Brexit possible: the PM’s deal.MIKE Thalassitis’ suicide is a wake-up call for Britain’s TV companies — and the country at large.Suicide is the single biggest killer of men under  in the UK.

Run for your lives.“But it really isn’t like that.”Oh, OK, you could maybe take your chances listening to her Fanny impression then. Talking of which, This Morning’s Martin Lewis. There’s a strong argument to say he should have been made to do If I Were A Rich Man, from Fiddler On The Roof. And an equally strong one to say he really shouldn’t. But he ended up doing Any Dream Will Do, from Joseph, and oh-my-s**tting dachshund he was bad. Talking point of the night, evenCorrie’s Daniel Brocklebank won, was Alan Titch-marsh singing Some Enchanted Evening, from South Pacic, on a stretch of thoughtfully placed decking.A man overcome with emotion. The main one being anger by the look on his face.Like next door’s kids had just punted their football straight into his prize begonias, it was.The audience went nuts for it, though, the judges were in floods of overwhelmed tears and, must admit, even I was aware I was watching something that would be played again and again, for both good and bad reasons.But I must urge caution here. Antony Cotton got his own ITV chat show after winning Soapstar Superstar.It just needed Simon Cowell tuning in on Sunday, and, before you know it, he’s got Titchmarsh back in the white blazer trying to Dream The Impossible Dream for the Christmas No.Still, we have to look for the positives, and what I’ll ultimately take from All Star Musicals is the fact John Barrowman appeared on telly, for two entire hours, and didn’t shout: “FAB-U-LOUS!” once.Progress. FRIDAY.

Or am I just odd ”No, you’re corpulent as well.ROMESH Ranganathan broke with  years of Red Nose Day tradition and said something vaguely funny about Four Weddings And A Funeral on Friday night.“As a young Asian kid growing up in Crawley that film really spoke to me.”OK, not belly  laughs, but an acknowledgement that some of us don’t get Four Weddings and think we need a charity sequel about as much as Gregg Wallace needs a hairnet on Inside The Factory.Still, it was a chance to see what the ravages of time have done to almost everyone except Andie MacDowell, who certainly hasn’t spent the past  years taking acting lessons.The lesbian wedding plot was also entirely in keeping with the right-on tone of an event that’s so self-satisfied, starstruck and preachy you can understand why some people think Africa should go it alone rather than submit to Comic Relief’s condescension for all eternity.You’ll have to make your own judgment call on the true value of Red Nose Day, where the night’s grand total has been dropping ever since  and civilians have been almost vanished from the process entirely.Personally, I took inspiration from Sir Lenny Henry’s final words of the night: “See you in two years’ time maybe.”’Cos I heard that “maybe” and thought, “maybe not”. Channel ’s  Hours In Police ­Custody.The “fat ginger” ­playground line on Ricky ­Gervais’ new Netflix ­comedy After Le.Goggleboxer Lee dipping his Doritos in Jenny’s face pack.Scotland’s Finn Russell suddenly deciding he’d given England enough of a head start at - in an enthralling Calcutta Cup match.And Celebs Go Dating civilian Joe asking Love Island’s Georgia Steel, “What do you actually do ” and getting the perfect response  from narrator Rob Beckett: “In summary, f*** all.”b “Down Royal and Downpatrick in Northern Ireland host the racing of what animals ”Matt: “Cows.”Bradley Walsh: “What flying animal is the slang term for doing time in prison ”Rachel: “Monkey.”Bradley Walsh: “The hymn Guide Me, O Thou Great Jehovah is most associated with which sport ”Shirley: “Fishing.”Tipping Point, Ben Shephard: “Colloquially known as ‘Dubya’, President George Bush used which middle initial to distinguish himself from his father ”Jacob: “J.” .CHANNEL ’s hugely entertaining series The Bachelor UK was further proof that men are  from Mars and women are from an as-yet- undiscovered galaxy many thousands of light years away.They seemed surprisingly keen to mate with Alex Marks, though, considering he looked like Captain Haddock with a man-bun, below, and would’ve been the most vacant lot on any planetit wasn’t for the presence of host Mark Wright.He had only one tactic with all of the women as well: Tell them “You’re beautul,” ask for “a hug,” then move in for the kill with Reanne, Robyn, Charlotte T, Charlotte E, mad Georgie the circus performer, and even shark-eyed Essex nightmare Alicia.It was working a treat as well, until Tuesday’s episode, when Alicia found Alex snogging Charlotte T and it all kicked off massively.Reanne took the smartest option available, in the circumstances, by immediately quitting  the show.Alicia  took the dumbest option available, by locking herself in the South African mansion’s bathroom.So she can probably be thankful it wasn’t a celebrity version of the show and Alex is hardly the sharpest tool in  the box.Because the gormless, great oaf  only went and ruined everything by picking Alicia ahead of talented, beautul and much nicer Charlotte T on Thursday night’s final.I’d give it until the end of the credits.INCIDENTALLY,you’re still trying to decide whether Baptiste is great TV or not, it’s not.Andyou don’t believe me, watch next Sunday’s far-fetched finale and try to avoid replying: “Not bloody soon enough” when Stratton screams: “God, when does it end ”Bet you can’t. SORRY.

Then MPs backed a Brexit delay.It’s asthe House of Commons is ­following Tony Blair’s step-by-step guide to overturning the  referendum.A No Deal Brexit will only happen in nine days’ timethe EU refuses an ­extension. That is unlikely.Theresa May will beg for a delay, whatever the conditions.EU members will not want to be blamed for a messy No Deal outcome.From next week, MPs could start voting on their preferred Brexit options through so-called indicative votes. Spoiler alert — they will not end up backing a harder exit.I know there are Leave voters who do not like Theresa May’s Brexit deal.Butyou do not like her deal, look at the alternative options for softer Brexits, which would be far worse for the country.If you think this deal risks the UK ­getting stuck in a customs union, just wait till you see what the deal would look like with Labour’s “permanent” customs union glued on top.Better to have an imperfect route to controlling our own trade policy than no route at all.If you do not like the fact that, under the PM’s deal, we would have to keep existing EU goods and agricultural rules, imagine staying in the Single Market or, as it is rebranded, Common Market .. We would lose the veto over goods rules which we have in the backstop, and be forced to follow rules on services too.Even in a worst-case scenario, Theresa May’s deal lets us escape the EU’s “ever closer union” political project and seize control of our own immigration policy.We would be in control of almost all our economy and not have to pay a penny for it on an ongoing basis.It is far better than most critics will admit. Thanks to changes secured at Strasbourg last week, we have new protections.The EU can no longer do what French President Macron arrogantly threatened. It will not be able to use the backstop as a “trap” to demand access to UK fishing waters.The EU cannot just say “non” to every sensible idea for resolving the Irish border issues. The so-called Star Chamber of MPs were quick to reject the Strasbourg changes.But they should listen to the Irish opposition party.Their Brexit spokesperson said: “We have come a long way” from a “bullet-proof, rock-solid, cast-iron backstop”.Or how about top barrister Lord ­Pannick  He is the QC who won the case for Gina Miller against the Government.He argues that in some circumstances the UK could terminate the deal through the so-called Vienna Convention.Conservative Eurosceptic big beasts, from ex-leader Michael Howard to former Chancellor Norman Lamont, have all weighed in behind the deal.David Davis, who resigned over ­Chequers, is now onside.Lord Trimble, who won the Nobel Peace Prize for the Good Friday Agreement, has backed it. If he can live with the backstop, that should count for something.But some Eurosceptic back- benchers still refuse to support the PM’s deal.Led by Jacob Rees-Mogg, they would prefer a harder deal. But face facts. There is no harder Brexit on offer.With No Deal out of reach, there is no incentive for the EU to provide any more concessions.That means the choices are this deal or a softer Brexit. Or no Brexit at all.And be sure that the Speaker, John Bercow, will bend every possible rule to frustrate Brexit.So, do not expect a long delay to offer a better answer.Anyway, the choice on our future could be made soon.There is no time to lose to save Brexit. Even a snap General Election offers no easy salvation. It would mean Theresa May leading the Tories into another campaign on a manesto of her deal — precisely what her critics want to avoid. And of course, the Conservatives could lose any path to power at all, kissing goodbye to any Brexit.Brexit would never have happenedit had not been for Boris Johnson.Now he has a crucial opportunity to save the whole project.He can show how he can be a ­statesman, by compromising in the national interest.And he can demonstrate the sort of leadership that won him so much praise as Mayor of London.If the Government can persuade the DUP to vote for the deal, backbenchers including Dominic Raab, Iain Duncan Smith, Theresa Villiers and Mark Harper should follow suit.Otherwise, they risk being remembered as the MPs who wrecked Brexit, along with Labour MPs who helped trigger ­Article  and then opposed both No Deal and the current deal.Theresa May also needs to recognise that backbenchers want someone  to take forward the next stage of the negotiations.If she tries to cling to power, critics on both sides of the Brexit ide may never back her deal.Whereasshe pledges to step down on getting her deal through, she can step down as a hero who delivered Brexit against the odds.MPs should know that politics is about taking the world as you find it, not as you would like it to be.And leadership is about taking decisions, even when all the choices are unpalatable.It is fine to stick to principle, but notthat means emulating King Canute’s stand against the waves.If Brexit does not happen it will be a ­national democratic calamity.As the party in power, the Conservatives will be punished.That means risking ­letting Jeremy Corbyn — a leader who can not even deal with anti-Semitism in his own party — seize control of the country.The stakes simply could not be higher. If this chance is squandered we will likely never get another moment.Right across Europe, critics of Brussels will think “even Britain couldn’t break free”.Henry Newman is director of the Open Europe think tank.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Maybe to keep up levels of national happiness we should leave horrible, authoritarian bureaucracies every year. Just to put a grin on our faces. I mean, the French don’t seem very happy, do they But here’s the bad news. Theresa May is still Prime Minister and we’re currently heading for a Brexit which would be a travesty of the one we voted for in . If we get Brexit at all.Some of the Brexiteers in Parliament think we might still be able to escape the EU with a No Deal, on World Trade Organisation terms. I think they are deluding themselves.Parliament, which is two to one in favour of NOT leaving the EU, simply will not let it happen.And the EU, desperate to retain its market for goods in the UK, will make sure it doesn’t happen, too.Our Brexiteers are right that Theresa May’s deal is awful. Butthey get a chance to vote on it again, they should hold their noses and vote in favour.Because I reckon it’s that or nothing. We will have a delay, the EU may insist we hold a second referendum as a condition of that delay.And trust me, the second referendum will be rigged in favour of remaining in the EU. It will not be a straightforward in or out option. There will be three options, to split the Leave vote down the middle.In this fight to leave the EU, the British people have had everything against them. The EU, obvs. But also the House of Commons and the puffed-up, ludicrous, pro-Remain speaker John Bercow. And the House of Lords, the civil service and the BBC.The lesson for us low-born, powerless Leavers is to take what we can and scarper before the whole idea is killed stone dead. Which I fear it may be.And now Mrs May is heading back to Brussels to plead for a delay in triggering Article .All along she has been too obsessed with the process of leaving the EU, rather than the clear imperative as demanded by the British people — to simply LEAVE the EU, all of it.She has followed Brussels’ agenda at every twist and turn. And she’ll be following it now. She’ll do what the EU wants.So here’s the deal, as I see it. Give her hopeless proposal one more chance and this time vote for it.We will have been cheated, but not as badly aswe do not leave at all.Because the longer this goes on, the more likely that outcome will be.THIS country becomes more deranged by the very hour.A Roman Catholic journalist claims she may face JAIL because she referred to a transgendered person by the sex assigned at birth, rather than the one she now identies as.Caroline Farrow has been told she must attend a police station for a taped interview.She said: “I have pointed out to police that I am a Catholic journalist commentator and it is my religious belief that a person cannot change sex.”Quite.

I quickly came to learn that, in relation to Brexit, nothing could be further from the truth.Unfortunately, I must remain anonymous for fear of the backlash I would receive at my place of work.However, I can reveal I am a senior policy professional within the service and work closely with a number of government departments.There are a number of extremely dangerous myths regarding civil servants that I must dispel because of the impact they are having on the Brexit process.MYTH : The civil service is independent. The civil service was founded on the pillars of political neutrality.Civil servants are meant to ensure that their own political persuasions do not affect their work. Crucially, they should accept those from all political leanings and points of view.It has become clear to me that the vast majority of civil servants support Remain.From my observations I would estimate this number to be well over  per cent.This is worrying in itself and far from representative of the  per cent of the people who voted for Brexit.Most horrying, however, is the sheer disdain and utter contempt that my colleagues display towards people who voted to Leave.I have lost count of the number of insulting and derogatory terms that are used in my own department and where to refer to the .million people who voted for Brexit: “Racist”, “stupid”, “uneducated”.Anti-Brexit jokes and snide remarks are dropped casually into everyday office con-versations. I live in fear that my colleagues will discover through a slip of my tongue that I am a Brexiteer.Were this to happen, I believe that most would refuse to talk to me again and I might even lose my job.This entire culture creates a thickening cloud of negativity towards Brexit that shades all areas of the civil service. I have witnessed first-hand civil servants doing everything within their power, subtly and under the surface, to frustrate Brexit and talk it down at every opportunity.This can only seriously undermine our efforts to be in the strongest position possible on leaving the EU.MYTH : Civil servants are experts in their field.One would like to think the iniduals making decisions that affect our entire nation would have some level of skill or experience.If only that were true.For example, I know of one stand-alone “expert” policy team leading our preparations for Brexit.You can imagine my disbelief when I discovered none of its members had worked on anything remotely related to the EU before. In fact, I have discovered over time that the vast majority of “experts” within the service have no expertise whatsoever.In many cases the “portfolio” you take on when you join the service is dictated by the one held by your predecessor.As a result, you have new civil servants inheriting politically sensitive and highly important work without the faintest clue about what they are dealing with.Civil servants who are seriously underperforming will usually have a new job title and position created for them somewhere  in the organisation instead of being sacked or performance-managed — they become someone ’s problem then.Given the influence that civil servants are exerting over the Brexit process, this is truly concerning.MYTH : The civil service does not engage in scaremongering.I had hoped that civil servants, even in times of crisis, would be able to remain calm and level-headed in pursuit of ensuring the best outcomes for our country.And yet it is not uncommon for me to receive emails from colleagues promoting Brexit scare stories that are nothing more than lies and speculation. Recently, things have become so panicked that ious “Brexit contingency” plans have been set up throughout the organisation. This is to prepare for the “national public transport breakdown”, “surge in criminality” and “widespread public unrest” that is going to follow after we leave.These plans also involve collecting the personal details of certain civil servants to put in place a -hour, on-call rota for the “emergency” that is looming. This scare-mongering, created and whipped up by civil servants, is having a marked impact on the confidence and well-being of ordinary citizens.For example, one acquain-tance of mine is so terried by the speculative threats put out by the service they have started to stockpile large quantities of their medication. This needs to stop.MYTH : Ministers are in charge.When I was outside the civil service looking in, I always believed civil servants were there simply to advise their ministers, who, as elected representatives of the people, would make the ultimate decision. However, I have come to realise that ministers are often mere puppets, with civil servants pulling ferociously at their strings.The level of bureaucracy is unimaginable.In my experience parlia-mentary briefings go through — at a minimum — five stages of internal clearance, with crucial information being amended or deleted at every stage on the whim of that inidual civil servant.The power and competence of our ministers is, I’m afraid, a facade.They are nothing more than a megaphone for the views of biased civil servants who lurk behind them in the shadows.I am a supporter of the Leave campaign.To go against the will of the people expressed in the  referendum would be the ultimate act of betrayal.The Government MUST allow us to take back control by leaving the EU on World Trade Organisation terms. If the people are betrayed, I may have no choice but to resign.Honesty, impartiality, integrity and objectivity.

But its a loan which means the repayments will be automatically deducted from your future Universal Credit pay out.Alternative Payment Arrangements- If youre falling behind on rent, you or your landlord may be able to apply for an APA which will get your payment sent directly to your landlord.

These are only in cases like your cooker breaking down or for help getting a job. Youll have to repay the advance through your regular Universal Credit payments. Youll still have to repay the loan, evenyou stop claiming for Universal Credit.Cut your Council Tax - You might be able to get a discount on your Council Tax or be entitled to Discretionary Housing Paymentsyour payments arent enough to cover your rent.Foodbanks - If youre really hard up and struggling to buy food and toiletries, you can find your local foodbank who will provide you with help for free. You can find your nearest one on the Trussel Trust website.Some Brits are also stung for previous over payments on the old system - many of whom are totally unaware that they owed money until its taken off their Universal Credit payment.A DWP spokeswoman said: When claimants have housing or utility arrears, we make deductions from their benefits to help pay off debts and keep them in their homes.Safeguards are in place to ensure that deductions are affordable.Earlier this week MPs revealed they will look into whether Brits are being forced into prostitution because of Universal Credit."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/NINTCHDBPICT000477487236.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"baby born without nose birth defect","story":"The infant was delivered in Fallujah, Iraq, two weeks ago.Medics say the newborn has microcephaly - a condition where the head is smaller than normal, usually because the brain hasnt developed properly.It can be caused by a genetic abnormality, drug or alcohol abuse by the mother, or being exposed to a toxin or virus such as Zika during pregnancy.Images of the newborn were published by Fallujah Birth Defects, which has been documenting congenital malformation in the city, which was heavily bombed during the Iraq war.The organisation said it is the first time they have ever seen a case of microcephaly since setting up in .They said the child, whose gender hasnt been made public, comes from a family who live in a rural area and has three healthy older siblings.Writing in comments on Facebook, the organisation said that the nose deformity was due to a cleft lip and palate and everything  in his body was considered healthy.They added that the youngster was only able to breathe by gasping as the family had refused a tracheotomy, which is where a tube is inserted into the windpipe.In another similar case, an American toddler was born without a nose but died in  at the age of two.Eli Thompson had no nasal passages or sinus cavities - an extremely rare condition known as congenital arhinia - which only affects one in  million births.He had a tracheotomy to help him breathe at only five days old and was able to communicate through sign language.In , he got the chance to meet another child with the same condition - little Tessa Evans from Ireland who was two years old at the time.After the pair met, Tessas mum Grainne said: To get to introduce Tessa to Eli was like a dream come true and it meant the world to us to sit and talk with his family.Tessa was totally taken with Eli and hugged him and stroked his head.

Insiders claimed Sir Graham Brady, the Tory kingpin backbencher, had been to see the PM on Monday to tell her a growing number of MPs believe she should quit.Arch Brexiteer MP Nigel Evans said the PM would be a heroineshe took the country out on No Deal. But the move would risk exploding the Conservative Party in two.Some  Remain Ministers have already threatened to resign en masse over a No Deal.Eight mid-ranking Ministers went to see Tory chief whip Julian Smith yesterday to demand the freedom to vote for a longer extension of the Article  negotiating deadline in the Commons next weekthe PMs deal is voted down.In a startling volte face late last night in Brussels, Mrs May took a No Deal exit for March  off the table.Vowing to introduce legislation next week to formally delay the UK’s exit date, the PM still claimed No Deal was still an option for April her deal isn’t passed.That was despite insisting to MPs on Wednesday that she wouldnt allow the UK to remain in the EU beyond June .Quizzed by The Sun last nightshe will agree to be bound by whatever MPs decide to do next, the PM said: “I am very clear we will need to work with house how to proceed.“The council has tonight clearly framed the choices open to people”.Speaking just before her at midnight, EU Council boss Donald Tusk outlined four choices open to MPs – Mrs May’s deal, no deal, a long extension or cancelling Brexit altogether.The only one of the four that the PM ruled out was the last one, an Article  revocation.BUSINESS bosses and union chiefs appealed to Theresa May to come up with a Plan B.Leaders of the CBI and the TUC joined forces to warn that a No Deal would be a wrecking ball to the economy.They urged the PM to seek a longer Brexit delayshe lost the third meaningful vote.Their joint statement said: “Our country is facing a national emergency.”Earlier, the Mr May was forced to endure the humiliation of waiting outside a summit room for hours as feuding EU leaders carved up Brexit’s timetable without her.The PM went to Brussels to issue a plea for a three month Brexit delay to June  to give her a final chance to pass her exit deal next week.After grilling her for  minutes, Europe’s  leaders then asked her to leave.A massive row then ignited among them over what to do, as dferent national bosses pitched dferent ideas and ripped up Mrs May’s - with all fearing her third and final ultimatum to MPs would fail.In an embarrassment to her, Britain’s PM was left having to wait nervously for more than five hours in a nearby room with no windows, with only her No officials for company.An EU official told The Sun: When leaders asked her what she was going to do, PM May would only say she was still pursuing Plan A of getting the deal through.It was then they decided that she didnt have a plan so decided they would need to come up with one for her.Another EU source told The Sun it was “lively in the room” of the  leaders as a battle royal raged late into the night.EU Council chief Donald Tusk initially proposed offering the UK an extension until at least May , regardless of whether or not she gets her deal through Parliament.At the insistence of the rooms doves - Germany, the Netherlands and Poland - another plan was then pitched to offer a long delay with no final limit on it.Instead, they vented the possibility of two dferent delays – dubbed a Flextension – a short one of a few monthsthe deal is passed by MPs on Tuesday, and a longer one of nine monthsit falls.But Emmanuel Macron lead another group of leaders including Belgium who insisted on a harder line, saying Britain should be made to leave the club by May  no matter what.The French president picked the date because it would mean the UK being out before the EU holds a crucial summit on its future direction in Romania on May .With still no agreement by pm, the talks – which started at .pm - spilled into dinner, which had previously been earmarked for a major discussion about strategic relations with China.It meant leaders dined on green lentil terrine with langoustine, roast duckling à lorange with parsnip mousseline and glazed carrots and chocolate iations, again without the PM who was initially due to join them.As the EU leaders tucked into their three course dinner, some took pity on hungry Mrs May and sent out her servings to her on a silver service tray.Her No aides had to resort to ordering in pizza.An EU diplomat told The Sun: The unity of the  was broken for the very first time.Earlier Mrs May had addressed her fellow leaders for over an hour in a performance that diplomats panned as unconvincing.One EU source said: It wasn’t clearshe has a plan B,she has a plan at all.She’s still convinced she can get this vote through. No leaders believe that because the conditions aren’t dferent.The PM was also repeatedly asked by several leaders what she would doMPs voted the deal down.But she was described as “evasive” and “tight-lipped”.Another diplomat added: We’re running out of time and it’s not clear what’s going to happen next.Its % sure leaders will need to come back next week. That will be the real Council. Today is just an appetiser.The two-day leaders’ meeting was supposed to be the last EU summit for Britain in its  years as an EU member – but even that remained unclear.Earlier on arriving in Brussels, Mr Macron turned the screw on MPs to declare there will be “No Deal for sure” in seven days timethey torpedo it for the third and final time on Tuesday.Mr Macron also said a short delayMrs May’s deal passes to give Commons the time to push through all the necessary laws “must be as short as possible”.He added: “In case of a negative British vote, we would go to a No Deal for sure.“We cannot have an excessive extension because it affects our ability to decide and act.“We are ready for Brexit. France didn’t chose this. The British people did.”Luxembourg’s testy PM Xavier Bettel backed him up, saying: “You decided to leave - you want us to be the bad guy - we are not in a souk where we are going to be bargaining for the next five years”.Traders took fright at Mr Macron’s words, and the Pound fell by one per cent against the Dollar, leaving it worth . at the end of the day.But Germany’s Chancellor Angela Merkel took a far softer line, and vowed before the summit started to fight until the last hour to try and ensure Britain doesnt leave the European Union without a deal.In a clear hint that she would be ready to then offer a longer delay, Mrs Merkel added: “We will work until the last day — I will say until the last hour — to ensure that this emergency planning doesnt come into effect.“We will do everything in the remaining, admittedly few, days to achieve an orderly, joint solution.In a sign of the trouble ahead, Mrs May hastily arranged a meeting with Mr Macron for the summit’s margins.She also had a bilateral meeting with Irish Taoiseach Leo Varadkar.They will command more than , troops to boost police and other services from Whitehall.An MoD spokesperson said: “We have committed to holding , troops at readiness to aid contingency plans.”Government departments have taken out hundreds of gagging orders to stop No Deal plans leaking. Transport had  and the Home Office at least .Under EU law, the decision to delay Brexit has to be taken unanimously by Mrs May and all  other EU leaders.Asked when the EU would run out of patience with the Brexit saga, EU Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker joked: I didn’t even know I had this much patience.Earlier yesterday, Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt warned MPs the only other alternativethey reject the deal again will be a long delay with tough conditions from the EU such as a second referendum.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Here are the  biggest things you need to know as you wake up this morning.  After almost  hours of gruelling talks, the EU and UK have reached a deal to delay Brexit . We definitely won’t leave on March , whether or not MPs back Theresa May ’s agreement next week. Donapost worry, youaposre not the only one.

But the EU have now made clear there is absolutely no more change to the Brexit deal. And there are still huge unanswered questions and a political crisis in the UK. . We have two dates - and MPs get to choose  If MPs AGREE a Brexit deal by March , there will be an extension of Brexit until May . The two-month extension will give enough time to pass the hundreds of laws necessary in the UK to leave the EU in an orderly, managed way. If MPs DO NOT AGREE a Brexit deal by March  - seen as far more likely - there will be a tiny extension of Brexit until just April . In this short time the UK faces an emergency European Council summit - and an incredibly hard set of choices.  In this situation, according to EU chief Donald Tusk, the UK has four choices: It agrees the deal after all It leaves the EU with No Deal It revokes Article  to cancel Brexit Or it puts forward a dferent plan to get a “long extension” - which would mean taking part in EU elections. Theresa May says she doesn’t want the first two but bizarrely did NOT rule out a long extension - despite, erm, doing just that on Wednesday. . Theresa May was left impotent and humiliated  The PM wanted a delay until June  -MPs approved her deal. But she said nothing about what would happenthey didn’t. So after an address to EU leaders brutally described as “ minutes of nothing”, they took the decision out of her hands. With May out the room, EU leaders thrashed out their own two-way plan for a conditional delay.  The Prime Minister has was told directly by Tory MPs’ envoy THIS WEEK that they want her to quit, it’s been revealed. According to the Daily , Sir Graham Brady had been “bombarded” with texts from MPs pleading with him to confront their own leader. The leader of the backbench  Committee duly conveyed their message during a face to face meeting in Downing Street on Monday, it is reported. Despite the threat Mrs May cannot be forced out by a leadership vote until December because she has a hear’s grace after winning the last one. . She was forced to U-turn on her threats to MPs  The PM climbed down after furious claims she had “fuelled the far right” with a vicious attack on MPs. Speaking on Wednesday night, she put the entire blame on Parliament for refusing twice to vote for her failed deal. It emerged she made her speech just hours after being asked to dial down the rhetoric by Labour MP Paula Sherrf - who received a beheading threat.  And Labour MP Lloyd Russell-Moyle revealed he was assaulted hours after the PM’s address. Last night Mrs May said: “I know MPs on all sides of the debate have passionate views, and I respect those dferent positions.  “Last night I expressed my frustration. I know that MPs are frustrated too. They have dficult jobs to do. I hope we can all agree, we are now at the moment of decision.” . The EU had a massive disagreement  Usually the views of the other  EU countries are stitched up in advance at the big Brussels summits. But in a sign of just how chaotic Brexit has got the talks ran over by about  hours. Frances’s Emmanuel Macron went in with a much harder line than the other leaders, demanding that a ‘no’ vote by MPs would “guide everyone to no deal”. But his hardline stance was clearly outgunned in the final deal. . Hell is filling up with Brexiteers  There is still “a lot of space” in hell for Brexiteers who campaigned with no plan, EU chief Donald Tusk declared. The European Council president doubled down on his claim that there’d be a “special place in hell” for Leaver politicians in a bizarre midnight exchange. Askedthe special place in hell should be extended to include more members of the commons, Tusk said: “According to our pope, hell is still empty… it means there’s a lot of space [in it].” As journalists burst out laughing an aide said awkwardly: “I think this is the right moment to conclude the press conference.” To cap it all, EU chief Jean-Claude Juncker then shouted at the world’s press: “Don’t go to hell!”  Yes, this is all really, actually happening, in real le.

There will be an extension of Brexit until May . This date is signicant because it is just before the European Parliament holds its elections. .  The idea is the two-month extension will give enough time to pass the hundreds of laws necessary in the UK to leave the EU in an orderly, managed way. The dealgives us a “transition period” where EU laws carry over much as they do now until  December . During that time, we would negotiate a future trade relationship.  In this situation - seen as far more likely - there will be a tiny extension of Brexit until just April . This date is signicant because it’s the deadline to start the paperwork for entering European Parliament elections. In this short time the UK faces an emergency European Council summit - and an incredibly hard set of choices. In this situation, according to EU chief Donald Tusk, the UK has four choices:It agrees the deal after all It leaves the EU with No Deal It revokes Article  to cancel Brexit Or it puts forward a dferent plan to get a “long extension” - which would mean taking part in EU elections.  Theresa May essentially backs options  or . She said she does not support revoking Article , an idea backed by more than million people in a petition.  And said “it would be wrong” to take part in EU elections required by a long extension, though she did not rule them out. There has been speculation she could resign in a long extension. And tonight Juncker warned that extension would be “to the very end” a phrase that will leave Brexiteer Tories enraged. She said there was a “clear choice” open to MPs to pass her deal and ensure Brexit happens.  The summit rubber-stamped the so-called ‘Strasbourg Agreement’ - the deal from earlier this month giving “legally binding assurances” that the Irish backstop, a clause in the -page deal that could trap the UK under EU customs rules, will not be permanent. However, those same assurances were labelled as not a legal guarantee by the Attorney General. They’ve already been defeated by  votes. So they’re unlikely to win MPs round next week.  No. She wanted a delay until June  -MPs approved her deal. But said nothing about what would happenthey didn’t. After an address to EU leaders brutally described as “ minutes of nothing”, they took the decision out of her hands. With May out the room, EU leaders thrashed out their own two-way plan for a conditional delay.  They disagreed and the negotiation took many twists and turns, but eventually the plan above was agreed. What happens now   MPs are set to vote probably on Tuesday on the Brexit deal - for the third time.  If it’s voted down expect a furious series of events to unfold in Parliament and between Britain and the EU. There will be an emergency EU summit and possible “indicative votes” for the House of Commons to find the way forward. The EU has insisted it will not give any more on its deal - and “emergency plans” are in place for a No Deal Brexit . Juncker said: “This closes and completes the full package. There is no more we can give. “We’re ready for every eventuality including No Deal. We’re ready and we’ve been ready since . “Emergency measures are in place and we’re continuing to prepare.” "},{"url":null,"title":"brexit eu draws up plan","story":"NewsBrexit: EU draws up new timetable after Theresa Mays unconvincing extension pleaThe Prime Minister is facing stark warnings of a national emergency as Britain edges closer to a chaotic no dealShareCommentsByBen GlazeDeputy political editorPippa CrerarDaily Mirror Political Editor:,  MAR Updated:,  MAR Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news politics video theresa-may-am-not-prepared-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news politics  , theme : # , title : Mirror Politics ,bundledCss:,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,info:,article:,info:,],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news politics  , theme : # , title : Mirror Politics ,bundledCss:,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true\"\"Get the biggest politics stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailTheresa May was forced by fed-up EU leaders to delay Brexit until May  last night - but on the condition she gets her deal through the Commons next week.

A cross-party group of MPs have already announced plans for a series of votes on alternative plans next Wednesday. Tory Brexiteers are likely to be furious that Mrs May has opened the door to a longer delay - or Brexit no happening at all. But with just seven days to go until Brexit, fears were rising that Mrs May could be willing to swing behind a catastrophic No Deal Brexithers falls once again. Unions and business leaders have warned Theresa May about a looming national emergency as Britain edges closer to a no-deal Brexit. TUC general secretary Frances O’Grady and CBI director general Carolyn Fairbairn urged the PM to take swt action to protect jobs and rights. In a joint letter to Mrs May, they demanded she avoids a no-deal exit and comes up with a plan B.  They said: “Our country is facing a national emergency. The shock to our economy would be felt by generations to come... “Decisions of recent days have caused the risk of no deal to soar. Firms and communities across the UK are not ready for this outcome.” It comes as it emerged military planning for a no-deal has begun in a nuclear bunker under the Ministry of Defence. Around , troops are on standby as part of Operation Redfold. Mrs May’s chances of her getting her deal through the Commons still look remote as MPs reacted furiously to her attempts to blame them for her own chaotic handling of the Brexit process. Her own chief whip, Julian Smith, was reported to have openly admitted he found the statement “appalling”. The televised message was also described as a “low blow” by former Tory minister Sam Gyimah. Labour MPs in Leave seats, who she needs to get her deal through, appeared to be backing away. Wigan MP Lisa Nandy said: “There’s absolutely no chance she is going to win over MPs in sufficient numbers after that statement. “I will not support a Government that takes such a reckless, dangerous approach.”    Mrs May, asked last night whether she would apologise for trying to sht the blame onto MPs, offered a partial climbdown - but it was unlikely to be enough. She said: “There are passionately held views on all sides of this argument “Last night I expressed my frustration and know they are frustrated too. MPs have a dficult job to do.”  Tory Brexiteers were also bolstered by the belief that a short delay made a no-deal Brexit more likely. Some who switched to back her deal last week were considering U-turning to oppose it again. As leaders arrived at the Brussels summit, EU leaders had stark words of warning for the PM. French President Emmanuel Macron said it was heading for no-deal should MPs reject Mrs May’s plan again. Irish PM Leo Varadkar said “no-deal,it happens, will be a British choice and a British decision”.  A petition to cancel Brexit has already received over . million signatures just a day after it was started. The official Parliament petition website crashed several times yesterday because of the volume of people adding their names. The petition, set up by Margaret Anne Georgiadou, to revoke Article  has been backed by celebrities including actor Hugh Grant and scientist Brian Cox. Independent Group MP Heidi Allen also signed it and, more surprisingly, Camilla Cavendish who was the Director of Policy for then prime minister David Cameron. Petitions that secure , signatures receive an official response, while those that gain more than , signatures have to be debated. Officials have confirmed that the earliest the petition could be debated is on Tuesday.

We’re not running down the clock, we’re looking for solutions”.But Mr Corbyn revealed the only way Labour would back the PM’s deal wasshe agreed to move towards a softer Brexit. “If she could say she’s prepared to understand what we’re saying, the points we’re making about the future - customs union, dynamic relationship with Europe - then we will be able to talk to her about that,” he said. “She’s got to move forward on how things can change.” After talks in Brussels, Mr Corbyn warned that Left-wing EU leaders were “frustrated” with Mrs May’s handling of Brexit and “anxious” about the UK crashing out by accident. “It’s a very real threat obviously and it’s made worse by the PM preicating,” he said. “I’m very clear where the responsibility lies for where we’ve got to. I feel very, very worried indeed.”    But the Labour leader was hopeful that a cross-party group of MPs would agree a Norway Plus-style alternative this weekMrs May’s plan is defeated again, to prevent a No Deal. “I think Parliament will come to an agreement next week to stop that happening and we will do everything we can to help them,” he said. “The dangers of a chaotic exit are huge, on supplies, investment, jobs and everything .” Labour will support MPs getting a say over the way forward on Brexit on Monday. The party will then back a cross-party amendment focused on the UK’s future trading relationship with the EU, as well as workers’ rights. But it remains unclear whether there is a consensus in Parliament around a softer Brexit.The smaller opposition parties, including the SNP and the Lib Dems, are opposed to leaving the EU in any form and want a second referendum instead.But Tory Remainers working on a dferent way forward are opposed to a public vote. Mr Corbyn insisted: “I do believe that we can get there”.  He claimed his fellow leaders “get it” that Brexit is happening irrespective and “fully understand” the dangers of No Deal. And he said that Labour, which officially has kept a second referendum on the table despite Mr Corbyn’s private misgivings, would “certainly do our best to meet them” on a fresh vote. The Labour leader admitted striking a balance between referendum-supporting Labour MPs and members, and Leave voters who backed the party at the last election, was sometimes dficult. “I realise the tensions and I realise the pressures. My purpose is to prevent No Deal, to bring people together and keep the Labour Party together,” he said. “Of course it’s complicated but we weren’t sent into this le to have an easy time.”    He defended his decision to boycott a cross-party meeting convened by the PM because former Labour MP Chuka Umunna was there to represent the Independent group. Mrs May had earlier offered him a one-on-one but the No  talks had ended up “pretty chaotic”. He said: “I’ll be meeting her one Monday morning. I think it’s correct that the Leader of the Opposition should have an opportunity to meet the Prime Minister.” Mr Corbyn revealed that nothing keeps him awake at night - even Brexit. “I’m a very good sleeper,” he said. “At the end of the day I listen to a bit of music and I read a book.” He admitted concerns over the PM’s No  statement that blamed “indulgent” MPs for the chaos. “Children over-indulge themselves eating jellies at a birthday party. Parliament’s job is to hold Government to account... that’s what MPs are elected to do,” he said. “The fact that Parliament has comprehensively disagreed with her on many occasions doesn’t mean Parliament isn’t doing its job, it means it’s saying that what she’s proposing is unacceptable.” He agreed with some Labour MPs who have claimed the PM’s words had increased the risk of threats. Conceding that the approach was almost like Donald Trump, he added: “I don’t want to bring him into it, but yes, it’s this idea that you just attack somebody as having somehow or other bad motives when they’re making a political view known because they know her deal is not good.” "},{"url":null,"title":"only could jacinda ardern sort","story":"NewsopinionIf only we could have Jacinda Ardern to sort out our chaosWhy cant Theresa May be more like New Zealand PM, Jacinda Ardern who has shown what a natural-born leader can doShareCommentsByPaul Routledge:,  MAR Updated:,  MAR NewsopinionJacinda Ardern \"Get the biggest politics stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailIf only Theresa were more like Jacinda maybe we wouldn’t be in this mess.

The contrast is embarrassing. Mrs May is a politician’s politician: more than two decades as an MP, chairwoman of the Tory Party, holder of a string of ministerial offices and six years as Home Secretary, before taking over from David Cameron as PM in . But she’s not a natural leader. Jacinda is, and it shows. A one-time policy adviser to Tony Blair, this -year-old starter-premier could tell veteran Theresa a thing or two about doing the job. Like how to conduct ­yourself with people.    Mrs May is gauche, wooden and lacking in empathy. She came late to the Grenfell fire tragedy, and failed to win hearts and minds. Mrs Kiwi gets in there, talks the talk with victims’ families, and then walks the walk with tough new curbs on gun ownership. You can tell she gets it. If only we could get her, or somebody like her, to lead us out of this chaos. Time is running short. Mrs May signals she’s had enough, and might quit in the summer. No other person in her party is fit to succeed her, which is not surprising: there’s no such thing as a Tory Jacinda.

You see, one of the ways politicians and journalists have coped with the mind-numbing drudgery of having to spend all day, every day, for two years talking about something as fundamentally boring as our departure from the EU, is by making up shorthand words to describe it. But that’s left the rest of the country with a hellish glossary of meaningless jargon and confusing buzz-words. Here’s seven words, terms and phrases that nobody will miss when they’re gone. Article  The biggest problem with making people interested in Brexit is that it’s very similar to Star Wars Episode I. Stay with me.After Jar Jar Binks, the most commonly cited reason for Star Wars Episode I being rubbish is that it opens with the Jedi Knights, the last defenders of peace and justice in the galaxy, turning up to help negotiate a dispute over trade tarfs. Literal magical wizards with laser swords were rendered tedious by thrusting them into an argument about taxes. What we should have learned from that is that evenBritain had sent Obi Wan Kenobi to Brussels to deliver our Article  notication, people still wouldn’t care what it was or what was in it, because it’s fundamentally boring. Backstop  Nothing gets hard-Brexiteers quite as furious as the idea that we could be trapped in the Northern Ireland ‘backstop’ for all eternity. But convincing the public that a backstop is a bad thing is a hard sell for the British public. You see, we all grew up being told backstops were good things. Specically, they’re the best fielding position in Rounders. You feel involved in the action and get to do loads of throwing and catching, but the likelihood of having to actually run around anywhere is minimal. Good luck trying to demonise the word ‘backstop’, Jacob Rees-Mogg. We’re reclaiming it for the great British, lazy, glory hunter. No-deal  Until the Summer of , ‘no deal’ was something that people only really said to Noel Edmonds’ imaginary friend. And that’s why the Government is now struggling to convince people that no-deal would leave them materially worse off.    In Deal or No Deal, the worst-box scenario is that you go home with p and Noel’s tanned, wrinkly sympathy face forever burned on your retina for all time. Gamble wrong on Brexit and you’re stockpiling water puriers and eating freeze-dried fish from a bag. Meaningful vote Theresa May is a woman of many talents, but perhaps her greatest gt is her ability to take basic elements of the English language and strip them of all logic and relevance. Take the ‘meaningful vote’, for example.Presumably it was named that so MPs would think that whatever decision was taken in such a vote would be in some way binding. Now we’re staring down the barrel of a third meaningful vote, and the word meaningful has lost all meaning. It was a meaningless vote. Buccaneering  This is what Brexiteers reckon Britain will be once we leave the EU. A buccaneering trading nation, cutting a swath through the high seas and selling our wares to eager countries across the globe.    And the man in charge of that  International Trade Secretary Liam Fox. A man who looks like he probably gets seasick on the pirate ship at Alton Towers. A swashbuckler he is not. Future relationship  Nobody ever wants to have the conversation about ‘where this relationship is going’. It inevitably leads either to a messy, acrimonious breakup or one of you getting a dog when you don’t want to. Same deal with Europe. There’s a reason Brussels is putting this one off until after we’ve got Northern Ireland sorted. Brexit  Quite apart from it being fundamentally lazy to smash two words together to make a new one, there’s a massive problem with the word Brexit. You see, Brexit is a shortened form of ‘Britain’ and ‘Exit.’ Now, Great Britain is the name of the Island. It includes England, Scotland and Wales. You know what it doesn’t include  Northern Ireland. Including Northern Ireland makes it the United Kingdom, so really the word should really be UKexit. In any case, the fact that we even forgot about Northern Ireland when we came up with the name should have given us some idea of the ungodly mess that the negotiations would become.Are you bored of Brexit  Youaposre not the only one.  Click here to visit Paddy Poweraposs Brexit Bunker  - and find out how Eric Cantona can help you escape the madness ,,,,,,],totalVotes:,votesToShow:,mentometerId:,publicationId:,callbackUrl:https:www.mirror poll-ws poll  status,voteActionUrl:https:www.mirror poll-ws poll  vote,closed:,closedMessage:This poll has been closed!,hideResults:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror UK News ,bundledCss:,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true\""},{"url":null,"title":"alesha macphails mum reveals moment","story":"NewsAlesha MacPhails mum reveals moment she saw through evil killers web of liesAaron Campbell, , snatched Alesha, six, from her bed in the Isle of Bute, Scotland, before raping and killing her on July  last yearShareCommentsBySally HindAmber Hicks:,  MAR NewsGeorgina Lochrane, the heartbroken mum of murdered Alesha MacPhail \"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailAlesha MacPhailaposs shattered mother has revealed the moment she finally saw through the web of lies spun by the evil teen who raped and killed her daughter. As Georgina Lochrane locked eyes with Aaron Campbell for the first time in court, she couldnapost believe the -year-old schoolboy was capable of the brutality inflicted upon her six-year-old daughter, whose tiny naked body was found face down in woodland with  injuries. “I thought it would have been a grown man or someone who Alesha knew, admitted heartbroken Georgina, . “It never crossed my mind it could be a -year-old. I was his age when I had Alesha. He had his school, his friends, he clearly had a le ahead of him. I just don’t get it.    Campbell was yesterday locked up for at least  years for his sickening crimes. But even as he gave evidence at the High Court last month, his cocktail of deception had Georgina hoodwinked for a short time and she contemplated the idea he may be telling the truth. “To start with, it was that bizarre it was believable. We all believed it, Georgina told the Daily Record. The conniving thug tried to frame Toni McLachlan,  - the girlfriend of Aleshaaposs father, whom Georgina split with in . He claimed they had been having an affair and Ms McLachlan was jealous of Aleshaaposs relationship with father Rab so killed the smiley little girl.  The cannabis-smoking sicko concocted a far-fetched story for the jury in which he said he and Ms McLachlan had sex on the night Alesha was taken and he accused her of killing the youngster and planting his DNA on her body. “I wasn’t shocked he tried to blame someone  but I was shocked by who, said Georgina. For those charges, I presumed it was going to be a\u2028 male – it would have to be. Campbellaposs lawyer accused Ms McLachlan of taking Alesha to the site of an abandoned hotel where the child was murdered and “brutalised” with an “implement”. He then said she had “planted” the condom with Campbellaposs semen to implicate him, something she denied.  Georgina continued: “I think Campbell’s story had a lot of people doubting to start with. But when he took the stand, everything completely changed. “The way he was talking, it was like he was describing exactly what he’d done to Alesha but through Toni. “He said she must have thought about it and really planned it. But then his mask slipped and Georgina says his lack of emotion was the biggest tell-tale sign he was guilty. She said: There was no emotion from him. That’s when I thought, ‘No, it’s you’.” I came to believe she was innocent after a few days. I had seen Toni and Alesha together. Alesha really liked her.   “Toni was one of the only girls Rab had introduced to Alesha that I liked. I remembered how good Toni was with her. That’s when I realised, ‘No, it’s a sin.’ It’s\u2028 just not what Alesha would have wanted. Georgina has also told of how Campbell turned to her and smiled when he was found guilty of raping and murdering her girl. When the verdict was read out and he was walking down the stairs, he smiled at us, at our full family, she said. If he is  and has committed a crime which the pathologist said is the worst he has ever seen, imagine what he can do in  years’ time. He’s in a cell and has time to plot. He has clearly thought it out. That does not deserve to ever be released back into society. That thing is an animal.

Straight from spending  days sleeping rough on UK streets, Stafford will have to use all his survival skills learned from previous experiences to keep his family safe. Ed and his fellow explorer we Laura Bingham will have to go back to basics when they are left on the Indonesian island with their toddler son, Ran, with just the clothes they are standing in next month. Speaking exclusively to the Mirror about the Discovery TV show, Ed said: Itaposs not without its risks but I think it will be a really positive thing. “Surviving on your own is one thing but in real le you would have dependents. So, the concept we pitched to Discovery was to do a show with Laura and Ran.  “When you have a baby youaposre told you need so much stuff - this type of stroller, this type of teat for your dummy, this type of toy.  Butyou were living in an indigenous tribe you wouldnapost have any of these trappings of the western world.  So the concept of what weaposre about to do as a family is plonk ourselves on an island and seewe can live without everything, literally start from scratch, so no water, no kne, no food, go literally in the clothes weaposre standing up in. Iaposm confident that I have enough survival skills to look after a little baby, and Lauraaposs more than capable of handling herself. And it will be an amazing opportunity for all of us as a family to take the survival genre on.   I donapost think it is realistic for one man to be on TV beating his chest saying aposlook how tough I amapos. In a real survival situation you would have people who were dependent on you.  Laura, , is no stranger herself to surviving in extreme conditions after leading the first ever expedition to navigate Guyanaaposs  mile Essequibo river from source to sea just eight months after giving birth to Ran. Speaking about the familyaposs new challenge she added: Itaposs going to be an extreme test on us and our strength and itaposs going to be an extreme test of our inidual skills and it will really take us back to basics. Hopefully I can hold my own and do the hand drilland be an independent woman. It will be interesting to see how that evolution goes, who takes more of the childcare role or whether weaposre very equal with it all. “It will be like Swiss Family Robinson,” she said with a grin.  I met up with Laura at her family home just weeks before Edaposs latest TV challenge -  Nights on the Streets - aired on Channel .  Smiling, she swings open the heavy studded door to her home as two shaggy dogs the size of ponies push against her legs. Itaposs her birthday, but the intrepid explorer, world record setter, budding childrenaposs book author and mum agreed to an interview today anyway - pencilled in between hand drill fire lighting and fitness classes. And learning to light fires with nothing but scavenged sticks may be a very important skill to master for Laura and Edaposs new TV show. Butanyone can successfully take on such a challenge, they can. Last February, Laura led the first ever expedition to navigate Guyanaaposs  mile Essequibo river from source to sea just eight months after giving birth to Ran.  And despite the physical pain of missing him , she successfully completed her mission with fellow explorers Ness Knight and Pip Stewart. Her husband Ed, , shot to fame when he became the first person to walk across the Amazon, filming the gruelling trip in which he had to contend with an inhospitable environment and occasionally hostile locals who held him up with guns and bows and arrows.  He has since filmed multiple TV series with Discovery Channel, including Naked and Marooned and First Man Out.  The couple already have some experience of bringing up baby in the wild. When Ran was  months old he had already been to  countries, including the remote jungles of Guyana when Ed brought him to visit Laura on her expedition there. And while they believe that wilderness can be a statistically safer place to raise a child than driving him around British roads, even some brushes with nature are too close for comfort for the family. Ed pales a little as he remembers how a jaguar strolled through their camp in Guyana – straight over the area where Ran would have slept in a cot on the forest floorthey had not left just hours earlier. Ed had decided to move him away from the expedition to wait out the next leg in a nearby settlement with better shelter and shade when the large cat joined camp.]  Our baby was almost eaten by a jaguar. We can laugh now but it was scary, he said. As Laura offers drinks in their charming country kitchen, where trussed up plants cascade from the ceiling and plant cuttings jostle towards the light on deep stone windowsills, a tall man with bright blue eyes swings open the back door. With a shy smile he wishes Laura a happy birthday and hands her a box of chocolates. This is aposMikeapos, she says. Ed met him filming in London and invited him back to help with our house painting. Ed is just back from filming Channel  documentary,  Days on the Streets, where he lived rough with no food, water or shelter in Manchester, Glasgow and London for  days. The three-part C documentary examines the homelessness epidemic currently sweeping Britain. Laura said: “Edaposs a very good judge of character, so when he texted saying aposdo you mindI bring someone back apos I was like, aposyes, yes you can.apos “He met aposMikeapos on the first or second day, they struck up a conversation and Lee took him under his wing. He was essentially his aposinapos, his tour guide to the streets. So when they finished filming, Ed asked him to come here to help us with the house painting.  aposMikeapossapos amazing. Heaposs really, really respectful, really non-imposing, he just gets on and does the painting stuff for us. Heaposs a really nice, unimposing chap. Ed added: “I told him the house was like a nursing home and thereaposd be lots of space.” But after just  days on the streets eating fast food and sleeping rough, a previously healthy Ed has suffered heart, thyroid and gut problems. Laura said: aposEd is an extremely amazing man. Heaposs like an emotional sponge, he feels pain a lot and I donapost knowheaposs absorbed a lot of pain from the streets. Heaposs got a leaky gut after eating two months of pure junk food. So health-wise he needs to pick himself back up and heaposs on a health mission.

And he has all that from eating junk food for two months. We were talking to youafter getting the results and you were like aposI donapost want those blood teststhataposs what happens in two months.apos aposMikeapos, who did not wish to be identied by his real name, said: Yeah, mine would be through the roof! Then, ason cue, a courier calls to the door to collect a machete for a photoshoot to accompany a magazine article about Edaposs favourite item - which of course is a very large, al blade which he said cost about  in Brazil. Itaposs very rusty, he says, as he checks that tape is covering the blade to avoid cutting any future, less kne-practiced, handlers. More guests then call to the door laden with flowers, craft gin and a little silver bee keyring. “I love bees,” said Laura smiling at it, before the avid gardener and bee keeper retrieved her precious seed box to share her plans for planting more bee-friendly flowers across their garden this year. “I call Ed my Honeybee,” Laura said with a grin. The couple met while Laura was planning to cycle across South America with no money. “I emailed him for advice, he Googled me and said aposIaposll meet up with you.apos”  Ed smiled: “You happened to mention in first line of your email that you were a former model so thataposs why I Googled you.” “My greatest campaign was genital psoriasis in case youaposre wondering,” Laura said smiling broadly. “They said they wanted to book me because I had aposgreat facial expressions.apos They only told me what it was for after I turned up so it was too late then. “I mostly just did real le modelling jobs. “I was told thatwanted to book proper stuff I needed to lose a lot of weight to compensate for not being pretty enough. “I was a size eight but I was told to lose three inches from everywhere. Bulemia and drugs and are the only ways to do that so I chose to quit and be healthy instead. “Now I punish myself in expeditions instead,” she joked. The couple lived in London before selling their Battersea pad and moved to a big old country house in the pretty village of Hallaton, Leicestershire, near Edaposs parents. Ed wanted to move, and Laura “had never been a dream crusher” so she acquiesced. Born in Stoke Charity, a small village outside Winchester, country le has not been too dficult an adaptation for her and she has filled any precious spare time with raising her chickens and bees and growing her garden. “Iaposm much happier around plants and chickens, growing vegetables,” she said.  “If the apocalypse happens everyone can come here. I’ll grow the vegetables and Ed can teach survival skills.” The couple bought their country pile after falling in love with itaposs rangy rooms and giant garden which stretches down to a lake and woodland. The houseaposs previous owners lived there happily for  years, until when aged  and , they died within months of each other. So the houseaposs history seemed a good omen for a new couple. Months later, Laura gave birth to Ran in their bedroom, after having the two floors below her reinforced with steel joists to make sure her birthing pool did not plunge through the floor boards in the throes of labour. “Ran is now the only person with Hallaton on his passport,” she said. “And he’s the dictator of the house,” Ed said laughing. But despite the happy, vibrant hive of activity that their home is, the last few months have not been entirely easy. Laura suffered a miscarriage last year when she was three and a half months pregnant with twin girls. She said: “It was a molar pregnancy where two sperm fertilise one egg so there are an extra set of chromosomes and I had eclampsia in early September. “My body didn’t recognize that the babies had died, and the placenta grew like a tumour.  “If I did not have medical help, like so many of the women I’ve met on my travels don’t,  it would have been fatal. One in seven women die in pregnancy or childbirth worldwide. It makes you hugely thankful to have western medicine. “I felt awful with that pregnancy. I could barely get up off the couch, I started bleeding at  weeks and I was completely vulgar to Ed. “I think he was relieved to go filming. He was like “Bye, I’ll go be homeless for two months instead of being here,apos Laura said jokingly. “I’m almost in a good place now again after it. “I’m not a patient person and I hate having to wait to get pregnant again but we have to wait until my hormone levels are back to normal. “So we’ll go on our adventure in a month or so, and after that we’ll try again. Laura is friendly but focused, occasionally slipping into a charming goofiness or cracking self-deprecating jokes. She is beautul, wearing no make-up on a face that nature made so perfectly it needs no further enhancement.Her husband is unusually open for a TV personality, with the light and shade of unrepressed emotion and thought brightening and clouding his face like a shting weather pattern. That openness and ability to connect with people is one of the things that makes him so likeable on screen.Laura has been working on her first series of childrenaposs books based on ‘real adventures by real people’, which is due to be published by Award in June. “I hate the idea of children growing up thinking that their self-worth comes from how big your cleavage is, or how short your skirt is, or how many guys stare at you in a day. I want the books to teach little girls and boys that self-worth comes from within, from what you can achieve in le and the goodness you can give to others.  "},{"url":null,"title":"ex next employee reveals just","story":"NewsEx-employee reveals just how to get best bargains in Nexts famous saleThe Next sale is one of the biggest sales on the high street and whopping reductions are expectedShareCommentsByGemma Sherlock:,  MAR Updated:,  MAR NewsNext store at the Liverpool Shopping Park on Edge Lane \"Get the biggest money stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA ex employee at Next has revealed how to get the best bargain in the Next spring sale, which is coming soon. The sale, is one of the most popular across high-street stores, with shoppers known to camp outside larger Next stores during the early hours of the morning in order to make sure they can get first dibs on any sale items. Whopping reductions are expected - and that means big queues and a fight to get the best deals. The Liverpool Echo have spoken to a former employee for advice and top tips on how to grab the best deal for the sale which is expected to attract thousands. When is the Next summer sale  For  the Next spring sale is expected to start in store on Saturday March . The store usually opens at am on the first day of the sale.    When is the best time to go to the sale  Believe it or not, mid-morning is the best time to go, according to a former Next expert, who did not wish to be named. He said: Personally I would hold off from queueing unless there is something in particular you are desperate to get or unless you need a whole new wardrobe. If you are looking to queue I would say from .am or am for Liverpool. Try and have a rough idea of what you want - just because a top isnapost in the top section doesnapost mean we haven’t got it, it could mean it’s been dropped by a customer where. What sells out first  The home section, womenswear and kids tend to sell out first.    Customers go crazy in the morning, said a former Next staff member. The home section gets really good stuff, it can go less than half price. But with the furniture sale I would hold off for a few days because they normally drop again in price by five per cent each week. So a sofa that’s been dropped from £ to £ that’s just not sold in two weeks time then it will be dropped again in price. How can you spot a potential sale item before it hits stores  It is easy for staff to recognise whataposs going to be in the sale but is it for customers  Well, the trick may be in looking out for the small notes on the barcode. You can always tell what’s going to be in the sale, said an ex-staff member.    Staff write a letter and number in pen or pencil next to the barcode. For example say a t-shirt may have R on it that would mean red and £. Sothe barcode has a small letter and number written on two weeks before the sale it usually means itaposs going to be in there. Some customers may not realise that we do get stock in, some customerssale items later that day too. Other top tips  Here are some other top tips from a former Next expert:Be nice to staff - we have got sale stuff in the back, some customers used to speak to us poorly which didnapost make us want to help them but we will always try and do our best. Bring water - You need water, it gets really hot. We once had a woman fall and a child faint and be sick, so be careful.

The -year-old felt sheaposd lost her identity after her husband died and children moved away but is now loving performing after losing seven stone in weight - and claims it makes her aposthe coolest gran everapos. The gran-of-two now regularly takes to the stage as her alter-ego Foxy La Mer, complete with corset and nipple tassles - and even reckons burlesque should be on prescription for fellow OAPs. Retired outreach worker Marilyn said: Burlesque encompasses everything I want to do. From the first day I was hooked. I suddenly felt feminine and so glamorous.    Before, Iaposd felt like Iaposd lost all my femininity. Since my husband was ill there was nothing to make me feel glam. Iaposd lost that we role. Sex was out of the window, there was nothing making me feel sexy. It was like I was just existing. I felt very alone. I felt there was something missing. At  years old people have this idea that youaposre old and should just sit at home but thataposs not me.    I wanted something to make me feel like a woman, to feel glamourous and to feel desired. I say itaposs apostease without the sleazeapos. Thereaposs nothing sleazy about what we do. It should be on prescription. At ft in, Marilyn had always been big and was bullied at school by a girl who poured salt on her and called her a aposbig fat slugapos. Turning to drama and acting as a way of escape, she gave up performing when she got married at the age of  and had her children Cymon Hulmes, , and Rachael Knight, .  But her marriage broke down after  years while her confidence had plummeted as her weight crept up to  stone. Marilyn found love again with second husband David Bersey but the pair were devastated when he was diagnosed with Parkinsonaposs Disease shortly after they married in . He died four years ago. Marilyn said: The we role had gone and I had become more of a carer. I felt Iaposd lost my identity - as a we and a mother, my children were all grown up. I was thinking aposwho am I apos My weight was up and down and Iaposd been suffering from high blood pressure for years. I started to steadily lose weight.I lost three stone then another three stone after I retired and joined Slimming World. Another stone fell off after my husband died. I now maintain my weight of st lbs.I was scrolling through Facebook and saw this burlesque group pop up and I thought it sounded interesting.I was very tentative at first. There were a lot of younger ladies and I was the oldest by a long way. They were in their twenties up to their forties.    But I loved it and now go once a week. We learn a routine for four weeks and in the last week we dress up in burlesque and perform it. Theyaposre a fantastic group of girls. Marilyn quickly took on the persona Foxy La Mer and now has two comedy burlesque chair routines that she does at charity events and parties - where she strips down to a sexy corset and nipple tassels which she makes herself. Marilyn, who has a grandson Brandon Hanmore, , and step-grandson Aaron Knight, , said: One is to the ghostbuster tune where, as sexily as I can, I take off a bit of clothing and strip down to my burlesque outfit.  The other routine is the Burlesque Granny. Iaposm an old lady with a walking frame and do part of the routine as a grandma then the music changes and I take off my wig and glasses and strip down to my stockings and corset for the burlesque routine using the walking frame. Then I rip my bra off and reveal the nipple tassels. I love performing because Iaposm not being somebody  - Foxy La Mer is an extension of me rather than a character. Itaposs not important how old I am. I prefer itthey donapost say my age when they introduce me on stage. I want them to clap me because Iaposm doing well and they like it.  Itaposs also toned me up. When I first started I couldnapost get my leg over the chair but itaposs built up my stamina and strength and I can do everything that the others can do now. My daughter will come and watch me. She thinks itaposs fantastic and my son is really proud. My grandson thinks Iaposm the coolest gran ever. Although not looking for a relationship Marilyn said burlesque has given her the confidence to flirt and look men in the eye. She added: Itaposs made me feel sexy again. Iaposm quite happy doing what Iaposm doing andit met someone Iaposd feel confident enough to go for it. I would say to anyone just to try it. Weaposre all living longer and should be out there doing things not staying at home feeling miserable.

Before eczema took over Laurie Williamsapos le, she could treat minor flare-ups with E cream and summer sunshine, but it got increasingly worse spreading to around  per cent of her body, including her face. The events planner from Birmingham ended up being prescribed steroid cream to use twice a day, and was later given antihistamines as she was losing sleep due to her scratching.  Iaposve had eczema since I was little, but itaposs always been manageable with flare ups mostly in winter, said Laurie. The furthest back I can remember is when I was about eight years old and I just had it in the creases of my arms and legs.    I now have small scars all over my body from where Iaposve scratched, and the cut has been so deep and was scratched so many times in the same spot that Iaposve scarred my skin. After not seeing much improvement by the end of last summer, the -year-old started researching topical steroid withdrawalafter spotting people on Instagram warning others of the dangers of what she was applying. In January  Laurie stopped using all steroids and creams in favour of treating her skin naturally. The withdrawal caused Laurieaposs skin to become broken and flaky, leading her to cancel social engagements out of fear of people seeing her skin. Iaposve stripped everything back to basics and Iaposve been vegan since the new year, I have oat baths every two days and no longer slather my body with moisturiser, she continued.    I am also taking daily vitamins, D, zinc, selenium and acidophilus and drinking lots of juice. I actively avoid taking any paracetamol, which seems drastic, but Iaposd rather find the underlying cause of my problems and treat it myself rather than masking the symptoms. My sleep was disrupted every night without doubt as Iaposd wake up and scratch for about  minutes, five times a night.

I was a lot more self-conscious at the beginning than I am now, partly because my face is better and partly because Iaposm so used to looking the way I do. I want to raise awareness for TSW and urge anyone who thinks they may be experiencing it to look into it. Thereaposs a huge support network for everyone going through it. Itaposs been great to hear people say they used to look like me because it means thereaposs hope I can one day have skin like them. Iaposve learned that time is the biggest healer.

I thought that was too much time added on but, having said that, it’s not the reason,” he said.“We had a great opportunity on the counter attack with two minutes to go and we’ve got to be better.“That’s the reason we are where we are because we’ve been going into so many good areas in each of the last few games and we’re not punishing teams.“We didn’t do what Celtic did. They were ruthless and that’s why we’ve not picked up enough points since I’ve come.“There has been plenty of positive play, plenty of areas we’ve got into but we need to be better in the final third.“It’s the only thing that’s going to get you out of the situation that you’re in – winning games.”Returning to Madden’s decision to play on for so long, Jim confirmed he had spoken to the referee to get his reasoning.“He said there were a couple of head knocks, so that was the reason why. It’s generally about three but there were a couple of knocks, so I could understand maybe four.

The society board have now informed Dens financial director David Gray and their own members of the decision to hang on to all their shares.Given there’s no provision in society rules for the sale of any shares and their rejection of the original attempt to get their veto-holding shares, this latest move comes as no surprise, particularly as even an improved offer of £, for the ordinary shares was viewed as derisory by many members.Dundee are now likely to undertake a full share issue that would allow Keyes to break through the % barrier but is likely to entail administrative costs running into five figures."},{"url":null,"title":"dundee united confirm departure of laurie ellis","story":"Dundee United have confirmed former assistant boss Laurie Ellis’ departure from Tannadice.As the Tele revealed at the time, the former Raith Rovers stalwart was put on gardening leave back in January.United made no comment at the time but, in a statement today, announced the -year-old is no longer their employee.“As we continue to review all areas of the club and put in place our plans for the long-term vision we have for Dundee United, Laurie leaves with our thanks for his effort and commitment during his near-three seasons at Tannadice and our best wishes for his future coaching career,” said sporting director Tony Asghar.Ellis arrived at Tannadice as No  when Ray McKinnon was appointed manager in .He continued in that role under Csaba Laszo and for the first three-and-a-bit months of Robbie Neilson’s reign.“I am proud and honoured to have played a role at Dundee United,” he said today.“This is a fantastic club that has the potential to be in the Premiership and, while I wish that could have been achieved in my time here, I wish everyone at United all the best in their pursuit of promotion.“I now look forward to the next stage in my career.”Earlier this month reserve team manager Craig Easton and U  coach Scott Robertson were also stood down from their duties.To date, United have not commented on their situations."},{"url":null,"title":"dunfermline eventually say sorry to fans for late call off of dundee united game","story":"Dunfermline have apologised to fans after the late call-off of Saturday’s Championship clash with Dundee United.United were already at East End Park and most of their travelling support were close to completing their journey when the game was called off just  minutes before kick-off.That was despite the Pars insisting from first thing in the morning that, despite heavy snow and torrential rain, the pitch would be fine.When, however, match referee David Lowe inspected the pitch at around .pm it took him no more than a couple of minutes to give the snow-covered surface the thumbs down because it was waterlogged.That saw the United squad get straight back on the team bus and depart within minutes.The news was too late for some fans of both clubs and they arrived at the stadium to find there was to be no game.Other than confirm the game was off, referee Lowe declined to comment further.And, initially, the home club also refused to provide an explanation.Later, however, they did make a statement via their official website.“Following the cancellation of this afternoon’s match against Dundee United, DAFC would like to apologise to all home and away supporters who have been inconvenienced by the call off at .pm,” it read.“Our ground staff and officials have been in since . this morning and we have been in dialogue with the SPFL since then.“The weather conditions proved extremely dficult to predict with snow, sleet and then rain causing our pitch to ultimately become waterlogged, despite preparatory work being carried out yesterday.”"},{"url":null,"title":"scottish pop star to play exclusive dundee show","story":"Scotland#s newest favourite Lewis Capaldi is to play an exclusive show in Dundee – on the day his debut album is released.Capaldi will play the city#s Fat Sams on Friday May  in an intimate show organised by Ferry record shop Assai.The only way to get tickets for Capaldi#s gig is to purchase a pre-order bundle through Assai, either online or in store.The Someone You Loved singer, who#s latest hit features a video with Doctor Who namesake Peter Capaldi, will perform on the night with a full band.Tickets are expected to sell fast, according to gig organisers.Lewis# long-awaited debut album, Divinely Uninspired To A Hellish Extent, will be released on streaming websites, CD and vinyl.most shows only hold like  of us, will be saying hi to everyone!!!album entry tickets on sale tight now FUCKING GO GO GO!

They’ve managed just one win in four games.And as well as a dip in performance over that period, United have struggled to find the back of the net from open play.In the last five games, only Cammy Smith’s close-range opener in the draw at Falkirk was not from a set-piece and the four other efforts to hit the mark have all been from the boot of Nicky Clark, either from the penalty spot or free-kicks.The effort to improve on that will not be helped by the absence of main striker Pavol Safranko tonight and again when Alloa visit on Saturday, because he is now away on international duty with Slovakia.The other experienced No  in the squad, Osman Sow, would not have been fit for the weekend after aggravating a troublesome calf problem early on in the last outing down at Partick Thistle.Sow was being checked in training yesterday but the chances are he will not make tonight and will even be a major doubt for this weekend.That being the case, Robbie has a big call to make when it comes to how he sets up his attack for the next couple of outings.He does at least have Peter Pawlett back available after the one-game suspension he picked up for his red card in the league win over Inverness. Theof the former Aberdeen man could see Clark pushed right up top and him used in a supporting role.Another option would be to use Matty Smith as the main striker but given the young attacker has not started since the Tannadice win over Dunfermline back on January , that would be a big ask.Whatever way he decides to go, tonight and in the coming games, the boss will be looking for both more chances to be created and a much better conversation rate.That will be a challenge against a County team that have hit league-winning form since mid-January.Their only defeat in  games in all competitions was when they went down to Inverness on penalties in a Scottish Cup replay."},{"url":null,"title":"mcdonalds-launches-veggie-happy-meals-as-greggs-sells-vegan-sausage-rolls","story":"MCDONALDrsquoS restaurants across Glasgow have launched their first-ever vegetarian Happy Meal for children from today."},{"url":null,"title":"richard-madden-flashback-to-when-rising-actor-spoke-to-the-evening-times","story":"RENFREWSHIRE actor Richard Madden has picked up a Golden Globe for his role in gripping BBC drama Bodyguard."},{"url":null,"title":"hugh-jackman-in-glasgow-how-to-get-tickets-without-using-ticketmaster","story":"AS is usually the norm when big acts announce gigs, music fans have been unable to buy tickets to see Hugh Jackman in Glasgow through Ticketmaster, despite him having announced a staggering three-night run in May."},{"url":null,"title":"taking-your-car-abroad-after-brexit-looks-like-youll-be-needing-a-green-card","story":"THE prospect of a no-deal Brexit, meaning no transition period, will mean insurance lsquogreen cardsrsquo will be required for UK drivers venturing across the Channel or into the Republic of Ireland from March , ."},{"url":null,"title":"princes-street-evacuation-suspicious-package-found-day-after-glasgow-university-on-lockdown","story":"BREAKING:Glasgow Universityrsquos Dumfries campus evacuated after lsquosuspicious packagersquo found.

This area of Argyll is the most fragile in the region. The people of Argyll, businesses and visitors deserve no less.Forget the squandering of £m on unreliable, mitigation measures trying to justy a flawed decision made many years ago to use the Old Military Road as a ersion which has failed on many occasions and now has a landslip between the two roads. Forget the expensive excavation of pits by the A rather use the cuttings into the hillside to form a two lane road protected with a flow over canopy with closed outer edges at the four problems gullies. If the contractors on the present scheme can work without any road closures then the flow over canopy option would not lead to closures as many officials and some politicians claim.This is a red herring postponing #a proper solution#. When this is option is completed it will save on the expense of manning the ersion route involving - personnel and - vehicles, replacing expensive nettings, delays whilst the farmer clears his animals and collect his fees. A scandalous waste of public money. Solve The Rest Landslides and stop wasting on mitigating measures.Like Brendan O#Hara I#m neither an engineer or geologist but both of us are blessed with plain common sense. If the Faroese can build a tunnel at £.m per kilometre surely a simple open sided m canopy would cost considerably less. In  at Dawlish .km of double tracked railway and .km of sturdy seawall was built at a cost of £m in eight weeks. Why have we in Argyll after nine years, four dferent Transport Ministers and £m spent and still have no guaranteed safe passage   on The Rest and Be Thankful Follow the Argyll Advertiser#s campaign #Invest in the Rest#. Transport Minister Michael Matheson, Transport Scotland and our Government must abandon their obsession with mitigation measures and fund a permanent solution. We demand no less.Sir,Calls for assurances that the Rest and Be Thankful section of the A will be improved to resist future landslides were made during a session of Transport, Infrastructure and Connectivity questions in the Scottish Parliament.I quizzed transport secretary Michael Matheson, about what was discussed at the last meeting of the A Taskforce in November , and asked what assurances the Cabinet Secretary could give to local residents and businesses who rely on the A being open at all times.The Rest and Be Thankful was closed off for nine days in October  following the largest landslide in a decade, forcing road users to either take a major ersion, or to use the Old Military Road during certain hours of the day.A number of petitions were created during the period of the incident, including one by myself, calling for a permanent solution to the Rest and Be Thankful.The transport secretary said that the meeting was #full and frank#, and that there would be a #review of the potential for additional landslide mitigation measures at the Rest and Be Thankful#, and that this would be discussed at the next A Taskforce meeting in March .There was also a commitment that Argyll and Bute would be #prioritised# in the next Strategic Transport Projects Review.I welcome the assurances by the transport secretary that there will be a review of any additional measures for the Rest and Be Thankful, and that Argyll and Bute will receive priority at the next Strategic Transport Projects Review.Donald Cameron, MSPReserve forcesSir,Last issue#sletter raising concerns about the UK government’s proposed use of the army’s reserve force in the event of a no-deal Brexit is timely.In case anyone out there still thinks a no-deal Brexit is a good idea it’s worth noting that the legal authorityof Reserve Forces Act  allowing the Secretary of State to take this step requires him to establish that it is necessary #for the alleviation of distress or the preservation of le or property in time of disaster or apprehended disaster#.Enough said.Frances Roberts, Ardrishaig"},{"url":null,"title":"honours even for red star in argyll derby","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThe Ropework played host to this keenly contested local derby which was watched by a healthy crowd on Saturday February .And for the second time this season, Red Star and Campbeltown Pupils shared the points in a match both sides will feel they could have won.Both sides were struggling for fluency in the opening stages but Red Star settled first and grabbed the opening goal after  minutes. A long ball to the right hand side was met by Ryan Caskie who cut the ball back to Stuart McLean. The youngster took a touch before slotting past the Pupils# goalkeeper to give Star a - lead.Star continued to press and doubled their lead when Coll McCallum robbed the Pupils# defender on the edge of the box before cutting the ball across goal. The unfortunate Pupils# defender could only ert the ball into the empty net, with McLean waiting on a tap in. The game continued at a frantic pace, however, there was no further scoring in the first half and Star went in with a - advantage.Pupils came out with purpose in the second half as they looked to force themselves back into the game, however, it was a howler from Red Star which allowed them back into the match.A square ball across the back resulted in a mix-up between Star keeper Luke Kalache and defender Ben Forbes which allowed Donald McCallum to prod the ball home from just inside the box and Pupils were back in the game at - with eight second half minutes gone.The home side didn’t recover from this and you could sense a nervousness that gave the visitors plenty encouragement. The equaliser arrived with  minutes remaining when good play from Pupils down the right by Soudan saw him get a low cross in which was met by the on-rushing run of Ryan Deans and he finished well to level the score at -.This set up a frantic finish and both sides could have nicked it towards the end. Pupils went close with a headed effort which was clawed to safety while at the other end there was a goalmouth scramble which Star couldn’t convert and both sides had to settle for a draw in the end as referee Jimmy Litster blew for full time.Red Star were dealt a blow as it emerged that captain Aaron Moore suffered a dislocated shoulder. Hopefully this will not keep him out for too long.On Saturday February , Star have another important home game as they look to move off the bottom of the table when they take on Claremont AFC.

Plans to buy council-owned Dam Park are at an advanced stage. The club, currently top of the Tennent’s Premiership, hope the bold switch will take them to the next level. Ayr would earn a multi-million pound jackpot by hiving off their own land for housing, with builder Cala Homes believed to be preferred bidder for the site. And they plan to use part of the cash for a £, synthetic surface to be laid at their new home. Club chiefs have spent the last year in talks over a move and hope to seal the deal soon.  If the switch is rubber-stamped by South Ayrshire Council Ayr could be playing out of Dam Park as early as .

And junior side Whitletts Victoria couldto the heart of their community with a revamp of the old activity complex on the cards. Ayr rugby supremo Billy McHarg said talks on the move are progressing well.  He said: “Discussions to this point have been positive. “We’re keen to work with all parties to find the right solution and one which will benefit the whole town. “We feel that Ayr Rugby Club coming into the town centre would be a big step forward.” Club members would still have to approve such a move. Ayr have been at scenic Millbrae since . Prior to that they played out of Newton Park, Dam Park, the Old Racecourse and King George V playing fields. Whitletts chairman John Dalton said: “Talks have been very positive and we are currently looking at alternative options. “The football park at Whitletts is the obvious route to go down and would represent ahome to our roots. “A lot of water is still to go under the bridge but as Ayr’s junior football club we are viewing this as a positive opportunity.” Craigie councillor Ian Cavana said: “It may be that a deal is close but nobody will be moving anywhere until the new sports centre at Craigie is up and running. “Work is due to start on that next summer and that’s when we should see real progress.” A council spokesman said: “Discussions on the future of Dam Park are ongoing.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr NewsAyrAyr Rugby"},{"url":null,"title":"eyesore burns house knocked down","story":"South Ayrshire Councils Burns House, Burns Statue Square.\"Get the biggest daily stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailEyesore Burns House is set to be torn down this upcoming year.

Police objected to McLelland getting a personal licence at the council’s licensing board meeting heard last week, McLelland, , of Main Street, Auchinleck carried out the crime in November . Police Sergeant David Dougan told councillors McLelland was sentenced to a community payback order at Ayr Sherf Court last year as punishment. But McLelland said she was plagued by anti-social behaviour outside at her home in Main Street. She told the board: “I love kids. I regret it.” She claims she has had problems with people “chapping her door” and urinating in her garden. She rushed out to the nearby bus shelter during one incident, she told the meeting.. McLelland said: “I went out. It wasn’t even raw bleach. It is not an excuse. I shouldn’t have done it.” She claimed the bottle was kicked out of her hand and spilled over the victim. But the meeting heard McLelland pled guilty in court. The shop worker said: “I am not in the habit of going out and fighting with kids. “I am a -year-old woman.” She added: “Everybody in this le makes mistakes. Nobody in this world is perfect.” She told the meeting she had phoned the police numerous times to report anti-social behaviour at her property. Councillors adjourned the meeting to discuss whether she should be handed a licence. Ontheir opinion was split with three councillors voting to grant her application and the same number against. Board Chair Councillor Tom Cook had the ruling say and decided to grant McLelland’s licence. He said giving her the licence would not increase her chances of committing a similar offence in the future. Councillors George Mair, John Campbell and Fiona Campbell voted to refuse the licence. Councilors Drew Filson, Lillian Jones supported Councillor Cook’s view to grant it.

The consultation and engagement exercise – approved by Councillors last year – gives tenants the chance to choose their preferred option for the long-term future of the flats: Refurbish  – this means the Council would keep the flats, decant tenants, carry out identied refurbishment works, and thentenants to their refurbished flats. Rehouse  – this means tenants would be rehoused permanently in suitable alternative accommodation and the flats would be demolished. Rebuild  – this means tenants would be decanted to temporary accommodation and the flats would be demolished before some tenantsto a new-build housing development on the Riverside Place site. The detailed consultation, which is based around inidual one-to-one meetings with more than  tenants, has been planned in conjunction with the River Ayr Tenants Association, which represents tenants in the three blocks. The Council has communicated regularly with tenants in the lead-up to the consultation to ensure they have all the information they need to take part. A further letter has now been distributed to homes in Riverside Place following queries and concerns raised by tenants regarding a letter sent to them by Fort, Seafield  Wallacetown Community Council. The community council’s letter appears to query the three consultation options being discussed with tenants and questions South Ayrshire Council’s interpretation of the expert report approved last year regarding the “essential and advisable” works required to the flats. Councillor Philip Saxton, South Ayrshire Council’s Portfolio Holder for Housing and Community Wellbeing, said: “We are committed to ensuring that our tenants are fully involved in the discussions about the future of their flats, which is why we’re taking such a detailed approach to this consultation. “It’s vital that tenants understand all the facts so they can form their own views about the option that is best for them. That is why we have gone back out to them to respond to the queries and confusion that have been generated by the community council’s letter. “We fully appreciate that the community council may have a view on the consultation, which is why colleagues are meeting with them next week and we’re happy to keep them informed about the consultation and engagement process. “However, our focus – which was clearly expressed by tenants at the recent River Ayr Tenants Association meeting – has to be on hearing the views of those who will be directly affected by Councillors’ decisions later this year: the tenants of Riverside Place. “We thank them for their participation in the consultation and I can reassure them that their views will be taken into account before any decisions are taken about the future of Riverside Place.” Joe Lafferty, Chair of the River Ayr Tenants Association, said: “We have worked closely with the Council over the last couple of years as discussions around the future of the flats have moved forward – and we very much appreciate the approach the Council has taken. “It is for every tenant to consider what is the best option for them and to ensure their voice is heard by those who will be making the decisions about what happens next. Clear facts, easy to understand information and answers to the questions tenants have is what’s needed and that’s exactly what we have got from the Council.”   Feedback from the consultation will be considered by Councillors in June this year.Full details of the Riverside Place consultation are available at  www.south-ayrshire.gov.uk riverside-place .

The Post can exclusively reveal that the developers McCarthy  Stone have thrown in the towel and withdrawn their multi-million pound proposals. Major question marks hang over the building’s future following the bombshell announcement. The news prompted an angry backlash from Derek Hart, chair of Prestwick North Community Council. In an extraordinary outburst he claimed the building has been “plundered and left to rot.” The building provided a retreat for children battling cancer for more than  years. It was opened by Princess Diana in . In  it was sold by owners Clic Sargent after claims of a “challenging fundraising environment”. They sold it to McCarthy  Stone and trousered £.m from the deal. However, since McCarthy  Stone took ownership and unveiled their luxury flat plans they have been embroiled in a bitter fight with neighbours Prestwick Golf Club. The club was opposed to the development on the basis of its scale and design. Other objections included the potential impact it would have had on their historic course and the surrounding conservation area. In addition, there were fears that errant balls could smash into residents’ properties. Plans involved building  flats for people aged over , spread out in a T-shape over four floors. Many would have had sea views and balconies. The proposals were approved by South Ayrshire Council but last year Prestwick Golf Club successfully petitioned for a judicial review, meaning demolition work on the former retreat had to stop. It was estimated that  jobs would be created between the construction phase and posts at the new development. Despite a PR charm offensive from McCarthy  Stone throughout the process and a public exhibition of plans at the  Club in Prestwick’s Main Street, the developers pulled the plug on the project. A spokesperson said: “Following a strategic review last year we are no longer pursuing any new developments within Scotland and have withdrawn our plans for Prestwick.” Derek Hart reckons the decision is a kick in the teeth for all the campaigners who fought to retain the presence of a sick children’s home in Prestwick. He told the Post: “I find this action taken by McCarthy  Stone not only deplorable but a slap in the face to the Save Malcolm Sargent House team who fought bravely to try to purchase it. “Is it not time for South Ayrshire Council to stop and listen to the community  “The community stated that the development would only feather the nests of McCarthy  Stone – and perhaps chemists –as the age group targeted by them were over  years. “There’s been very little input to Prestwick and we are now left with a building that has been plundered and left to rot. “Will we find the same response to the other end of the beach, at the old Gym, I wonder ”He added: “Time after time SAC have allowed developers to build as they wish with barely a challenge to the character ofthe town and how it should look.”The news will be viewed as a major victory for Prestwick Golf Club, who fought long and hard against the development. A statement by the club said: “While we welcome this news we hope that, should a new development proposal for the site be put forward in the future, the design and scale will be more sympathetic to the surrounding area.” The statement said the club was not against the principle of redeveloping the site but was “disappointed” at the scale and design of the proposed development. It added: “We believed that McCarthy  Stone hadn’t listened to the concerns raised by the club.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnPrincess DianaSouth Ayrshire CouncilRoyal FamilyPrestwickAyr NewsAyr"},{"url":null,"title":"shopper yelled get back your","story":"NewsShopper yelled \"Get back to your own country, you Iraqi b******\" to Ayr Lidl workerManus McGhee avoided jail after his foul mouth outburst at the store.ShareByAyrshire Post:,  MAR NewsThe outburst took place at Lidl in Ayr \"Get the biggest daily stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA man who was asked to leave Ayr’s Lidl store went back in to racially abuse a staff member, writes Edwin Lawrence.

Super-fit Fiona McBlane was , practised yoga and cycled and was in London lapping up a glamorous working le in the music industry for companies such as EMI and Smash Hits. But during a Christmas visit home to Ayrshire she fell unwell with leg, arm and head pain. Such was her distress she admitted herself to hospital. First the minor stroke hit - on January ,  - and then the searing biggie nine days later. It left her semi-paralysed in hospital for  months, unable to speak, hardly walking and retaining very limited brain capacity. That was when Clan McBlane rallied round to give her the best future they could. They had been advised the best place for her was an old folks home but they stood firm. Once Fiona was fit enough to leave hospital she was brought into the bosom of the family in Prestwick. Twelve years on at the age of , Fiona is battling away and has got to the stage where she has joined the gym at Prestwick Tennis Club. Her loving older sisters Gillian McBlane, , and -year-old Gaenor Hardy have just pounded round the Stroke Association’s Resolution Run with Gillian’s -year-old son Graham to continue raising money for the charity. That added £ to a total now of about £. Gillian, a top civil lawyer in Ayr, and Gaenor, headmistress at Heathfield Primary, assist their parents Jean and Ian who are Fiona’s full-time carers. And Gillian is helped by the other legal eagle in the family, Ayr criminal defence agent Steven Maxwell. Gillian said: “She loved her work and was a real high flier. “People were drawn to Fiona’s fun-loving nature and her great big heart. “Never for a minute did we think she would have a stroke. “At  years old she had lost everything she loved.” Fiona is prone to falling and choking, often passing out. Sometimes the enormity of what has happened becomes too much for her and she struggles emotionally. But Gillian said: “Our parents taught us to look for the positive things in le and not to feel sorry for ourselves. We spend time together and Fiona enjoys the company. “Despite the extent of her disability, she does brilliantly. “Doctors told us that her friends would eventually tail off but Fiona’s haven’t . They keep in contact with her and visit when they can. “People have shown us great kindness over the years in so many ways and this means a lot, helping us immensely. We don’t know what the future will hold for Fiona but we do know that whatever it is we will face it together.” There are , strokes in Scotland every year. Angela Macleod at the Stroke Association said: “Our latest research shows that by training and taking part in a Resolution Run you are helping to lower your stroke risk. “The funds raised by each runner means we can reach out to more stroke survivors and their families to offer the support that they may need to rebuild their lives.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnstrokeAyrAyr NewsPrestwickRunningCharity"},{"url":null,"title":"upper crust roost alloway","story":"NewsAn Upper Crust roost in AllowayAyrshire Post Property of the WeekShareByStephen Houston:,  MAR Updated:,  MAR News\"Get the biggest daily stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailThere are few better places to bring up a family than the secluded suburban streets of Alloway.

Craig Galbraith worked well playing with, eventual man of the match, Calum Johnson for the first time.In the th minute there was a skirmish in the box after a corner, Johnson cleared the ball but it ricocheted off the incoming player into the net.The Glasgow students had more possession with the wind advantage. With  minutes left, a tremendous fingertip save, by Neil McMillan, pushed the ball over the bar.With four minutes left the away side put the game beyond #Dale#s reach when Matthew Lamont tried to clear a corner shot but unforunately scored an own goal.In high winds and driving rain the game fizzled out.Both sides had played well in the conditions and kept the ball on the deck in addition, referee, Archie Mitchell said it was an easy game to ref with no bad tackles.The match ball was sponsored by Wee Toon Sports and a Carradale spokesperson thanked Food for Thought for the post match hospitality.Tomorrow Carradale travels to Helensburgh for an early kick off at noon."},{"url":null,"title":"machrihanish bay is britains second best beach","story":"The bay, which is the beginning of the longest continuous stretch of sand in Argyll, extending all the way to Westport, was second only to Sandown Bay on the Isle of White in the BBC Countryfile Magazine Awards .After a long and detailed judging process to determine the shortlist for each category, the magazine#s readers and website visitors were given a month to vote for their favourites, with winners announced last week.The magazine#s editor, Fergus Collins, said: #Congratulations to each of the winners – and all the people and places who were shortlisted.#The aim of our awards is to celebrate the best of the British countryside and shine a light on lesser known places, projects and people who are doing great work.#Westport beach looking towards Machrihanish Bay. _cwestport"},{"url":null,"title":"down memory lane march 15 2019","story":"Peter Docherty, born and brought up in the Wee Toon, lives in a first floor flat, in Tangy Place tenement, at the end of the High Street, with a #marvellous# view of all the comings and goings on Campbeltown Loch.Back in , aged , he was an apprentice painter and decorator for a town firm, which he thinks might have been Galbraith and Cochrane.Mr Docherty#s son, also Peter, , talked to the Courier on Monday and said: #Dad told me that the young apprentices were always given the awkward, high up places to paint.#Back then this wall must have been under a ceiling as now the graffiti chipped into the plaster is at waist height.#Painters always used to leave their mark on a building, many will be painted over in people#s houses.#They often wonderedtheir #marks# would be uncovered in the future.#On this wall they could see the names of people who had painted it in the past.#When he saw Down Memory Lane last week dad said he was the only P Docherty in the town at the time.#Peter junior, who visits two to three times a year, said: #I was born in Craigard.

all the officers of the council, particularly Kirsty Flanagan, head of strategic finance and her team, for being so helpful during this process.I also thank the leader of the council for the manner in which the papers were presented this year which made alternative motions possible.However what did this year yield The main dferences in the budget came down to the administration of the council proposing £, more for winter gritting, outwith the A which is covered by the contract with BEAR.This was against cuts in the road safety unit, an award-winning safety programme for young children, a cut in youth and adult learning, a cut in environmental warden services, which means a focus on more fines but less time for fly tipping and dog fouling and a cut to music tuition in schools.There were amendments lodged by Councillor Donald Kelly and myself, the SNP group and councillors George Freeman and Jean Moffat.While gritting our roads is important Councillor Kelly and I, along with other council opposition groups, thought the other considerations were important to our communities which strangely enough is also supported by our corporate plan.Alas the gritting won the day.Full motions and votes can be found on the council website.However it was more disappointing that Councillor Kelly and I included in our motion a scheme to change funding due for Helensburgh and Dunoon.Just more than £ million would be moved to the regeneration project of Tarbert Lochgilphead Ardrishaig.This was defeated by the rest of the council which was particularly galling.Money for Helensburgh had been questioned by its community council which felt that too much had already been spent.The money for Dunoon was because of poor procurement processes and a general #I want syndrome#

Lauder, it is said, was the first place he stopped after fleeing from the Battle of Prestonpans.ldquoI suppose we kind of followed in his footsteps, said my friend, ldquoalthough in a very dferent way and totally dferent circumstances of course. Folk round here donrsquot really know the story, but coming from the Pans it gave us an immediate connection.The actual house on Lauder High Street that Johnnie Cope arrived at is now gone, replaced over  years ago. But Lauder must look much as it did on that fateful day when Cope arrived, with his horse close to collapse with exhaustion.Johnnie Cope was the general commanding the British Army at Prestonpans on that fateful day, September , . The battle was a major victory for the Jacobites. Cope fled the scene of battle, but only when it was clearly lost. He eventually arrived at Berwick-upon-Tweed to give news of his own defeat. Ever since, popular tradition has mocked Cope for running away and not standing his ground and dying lsquohonourablyrsquo, as Colonel Gardiner of Bankton House did.This ridicule was encapsulated in a traditional popular song, and the chorus remains well-known:Hey, Johnnie Cope, are ye wauking yet Or are your drums a-beating yet If ye were wauking I wad waitTae gang to the coals irsquo the morning.The song pokes fun at Cope and concludes with a harsh indictment:Now Johnnie, troth, ye were na blateTae come wirsquo news orsquo your ain defeat,And leave your men in sic a straitSae early in the morning.There are earlier versions with slightly dferent words, but the sentiment remains the same: Johnnie Cope ran away and should be ashamed of himself for leaving his men. However, he was later found to have done his duty, and this reputation deemed unfair. But mud sticks, especially when a catchy tune is added to it.This popular song is believed to have been written by Adam Skirving, a farmer at Garleton in East Lothian. There is a story that he visited the battle site a few hours after the fighting. Perhaps he spoke to some eyewitnesses who saw Cope flee up the road to Birsley Brae, and therefore got the idea for the song. The road Cope took as he fled from the battle has ever after been called Johnnie Copersquos Road.Lauder is a short journey from Prestonpansgoing by car. It had been a while since I had last ventured over Soutra Hill and into the border country and I enjoyed the drive despite the wild weather, or perhaps partly because of it.But what was Copersquos journey like as he galloped over Soutra Hill with some of his dragoons  He must have paused at the summit and cast a glance at the view over East Lothian and screwed his eyes to find Prestonpans. The panic and terror by this time would have given way to dferent feelings, I suspect.He rode more or less the same way I took to Lauder but it would have taken him much longer with very dferent emotions. His arrival in the town would have been a bewildering spectacle for the locals. He later continued his flight to Coldstream, which he reached by nightfall.All this was in my head as we headed home to Prestonpans from Lauder the next day. I could almost see the ghosts of Cope and his dragoons gallop past us as we ventured over Soutra.As we drove, I re-told the story to my kids and we sang the song in the car. They know the story and the chorus well, as we have many times ventured along Johnnie Cope Road on the way to the rail station.By the road is Bankton House, once the home of Colonel Gardiner, who did not run but stood his ground, and paid the ultimate price with brutal death.There is a small doorsquocot by the house, and inside you will find a free but almost secret visitor centre created with the support of the Battle of Prestonpans Heritage Trust.The doorsquocot can only be reached via a walkway through the wood from the rail station during the day, and inside lsquoAuld Archiersquo tells the tale of the battle, and the le and death of Colonel Gardiner. On the wall is a model map of how the area looked at the time of the battle, with the route taken by Johnnie Cope clearly marked.Itrsquos all fascinating stuff which had been unexpectedly brought to my mind by the visit to Lauder to see old friends.But it was the emotions rather than the events that I reflected on most. The hatred caused by this civil war , the loss, suffering and misery of conflict which is so often hidden by a cloak of romanticism.Adam Watters, a Panner who lives and breathes local history, and re-enacts it for children and visitors alike, is clear on this. It is a fascinating period to study, and to have the history on our doorstep brings it alive. But as Adam has said, letrsquos enjoy that sense of history on our doorstep and have fun with it, but let us not glory battle, rather learn from it.I think Johnnie Cope, even though he was a military man, may well have agreed with Adam."},{"url":null,"title":"east-lothian-council-cockenzie-revised-plan","story":"Inch Cape Offshore Ltd has been given approval to site the building ndash which will bring energy ashore from an offshore wind farm ndash on land at the former Cockenzie Power Station by Scottish Ministers.A planning application was initially lodged with East Lothian Council but was called in by the Scottish Government before a decision was made.That decision sparked anger after it was announced as First Minister Nicola Sturgeon was on an official visit to China, where she met representatives of Chinese state owned Red Rock, which owns Inch Cape.Now the company has presented a revised plan of the space it intends to use to Cockenzie and Port Seton Community Council.The community council posted the new design on social media and revealed plans were under way for Inch Cape to host workshops in the local communities in the coming months.The image shows the substation on about a third of the original .-hectare footprint applied for.One of the biggest concerns raised by communities and the local authority, which owns the land, was that a substation dominating the old power station site would make it a no-go area for other developments.The new plans were welcomed by many on the community councilrsquos Facebook page, with one person saying: ldquoGood news, less sterilisation of the site.Ian Johnson, Inch Capersquos project manager, said: ldquoWe are continuing to engage with East Lothian Council and local community councils on options to signicantly reduce the footprint of the onshore transmission works and moving this to the west of the site.ldquoWhile this detailed design plan is subject to further technical assessments, consultation and approval from the council, we are taking steps to ensure remaining land is available for other developments."},{"url":null,"title":"east-lothian-school-pupils-to-take-part-in-strike-against-climate-change","story":"The NBHS Eco Committee have encouraged students to travel by public transport to attend the rally campaigning for stronger government action to combat climate change.The Edinburgh protest is one of many around the world that are happening tomorrow morning, where school children are walking out of classes to protest climate change.The protest starts at am outside the Scottish Parliament.An East Lothian Council spokesperson said: ldquoWe want to support our young people as global citizens to have their voice and to be able to express their views on important matters such as climate change.\"The safety and wellbeing of our young people is of paramount importance to us.

That novel was widely lambasted for its so-called profanity, which so shocked one judge, Rabbi Julia Neuberger, she stormed out of the meeting. ldquoOver my dead body was the mildest of her comments.About a year ago, Kelman finished a new novel which, he revealed, has still to find a publisher. After a long period with Secker  Warburg and Hamish Hamilton, he moved to Canongate with his last two books, That Was a Shiver, and Dirt Road, both of which were well received. But this new manuscript languishes, untouched and apparently unloved. Nobody, it seems, even in his own heath, is willing to make a decent offer for it.With some writers, you could understand. Thanks to technology that registers every sale, publisherscan see exactly how bankable their books are. When approached by a writer, they can track their performance at the click of a mouse. If this is healthy, they are far more likely to pounce on them thanthe novelistrsquos sales have not even covered their advance, leaving a publisher effectively in the red.This does not, of course, mean the novelist is no good. Sometimes it indicates the reverse. Literary fiction is a highly raried taste ndash as it always was. Only the most fortunate of such writers make a good living from the proceeds of books alone. For most it is a struggle to get by, hence the number finding shelter teaching on creative writing courses. Kelman himself went down that route for a time, but you can be fairly sure thathis books had sold like airport bestsellers, there would have been no need to find a financial cushion.In what you can only call the good old days, a young writer like Graham Greene would be given considerable leeway with his early books by a publisher confident that one day he would reward their patience. Today, there is no slack in the system, no time to nurture or take the long view. You are only as good as your last book. And in the case of someone like Kelman, whose readership is a mere fraction of those interested in serious fiction, that spells trouble.Why do most of those who leap on every title by Julian Barnes or Rose Tremain often not bother with Kelman  Undoubtedly, the furore over his Booker winner damaged his reputation, not only in the rest of the UK, but also here. Kelman, however, suspects there is a more fundamental and disturbing reason. He believes that English publishers are ldquokeeping a lid on Scottish writers, by dismissing them as a genre. They would rather publish mediocre English novelists, he says, than good Scottish ones.Read more: Kelman: British establishment is keeping a lid on Scottish writingThere are enough excellent Scottish novelists reaching print to argue that point, but for me this is a distraction from the main issue. EvenKelman is right and there is anti-Scottish bias among literary publishers, that still does not explain why no Scottish publisher is willing to take him on.Could his new book be too dficult, or tricky  It would seem strangethat were the case, given his long and distinguished backlist in which there is rarely a misfire. The answer is far more likely to be about money, and the state of the book trade in general. In other words, there is no publisher able or prepared to offer a fee commensurate with what a Kelman book is worth. Thatrsquos worth in artistic terms, you understand, not sales. I do not doubt it would be a better investment to publish Diana Gabaldonfilling the coffers is the main objective.But while the kind of books Kelman writes are unlikely to shower a publisher in gold, they would add immeasurably to its lustre. Here is a novelist who has been shortlisted for the Man Booker International Prize, and is a worthy Nobel contender. Indeed, consider this my official plea to the Nobel Prize Literature Committee to read everything Kelman has written and tell us his oeuvre does not equal or surpass many of their laureates.Yet, nobody on his doorstep wants to take his new book. Itrsquos hard to think of another country where its foremost living writer would be treated like this. The only conclusion you can come to is that the world of books has lost it.

However, there are signicant caveats.Crucially, the resulting percentage is not a pass rate for the school. The figure provided by the Scottish Government represents the percentage of the total S roll who went on to secure five Highers - including those who didnrsquot sit Highers at all.That means schools such as those in the suburbs of East Renfrewshire are always likely to appear at the top of league tables because a majority of pupils in S go on to take Highers.Read more:Revealed: The top  state schools in Scotland Research tells us repeatedly that the factor that has the single biggest impact on exam results is deprivation, and this is clearly seen in our tables.Poverty has an impact on attainment from birth, meaning pupils from disadvantaged backgrounds fall behind early on in terms of literacy and numeracy and continue to lag behind because of the range of social problems they experience as they grow up.It is no accident, therefore, that schools in areas with very signicant levels of deprivation are almost always lower down the league tables than those in middle class areas.Many of the top  state schools in Scotland according to our tables have no pupils at all from the most deprived backgrounds. Some schools lower down have more than  per cent of pupils experiencing disadvantage.Armed with this information our league tables tell us something very signicant about the impressive work of many schools serving disadvantaged communities.St Andrews School, in the east end of Glasgow, is a case in point with  per cent of pupils from the most disadvantaged communities, but  per cent going on to secure five or more Highers.The national data from the league tables is also interesting because it shows how dficult it will be for the Scottish Government to achieve its stated aim of closing the poverty-related attainment gap.Read more:In full: How every secondary school in Scotland ranks in exam league tableThis yearrsquos figures show disadvantaged pupils have done better than ever before, with a . per cent improvement in average overall attainment.However, because pupils from the most affluent neighbourhoods have seen attainment rise by nearly two per cent, the attainment gap is actually getting wider on this measure.Mark Priestley, professor of education at Stirling University, said improvement in the performance of the poorest pupils was welcome, but closing the gap was dficult to achieve through education alone.He said: ldquoWhen additional resources are put into schools in disadvantaged neighbourhoods to improve performance it may not be surprising that pupils from other backgrounds also benefit.ldquoBut education is not a magic bullet and the impact of poverty has to be tackled with wider measures."},{"url":null,"title":"nicola-sturgeon-sets-sights-on-bigger-role-in-global-issues","story":"For the first time, her government has been registered with the US authorities as a foreign power trying to influence affairs on the other side of the Atlantic.Calling itself the ldquoGovernment of Scotland in North America, it has also engaged a public relations agency in Washington DC to help it become ldquomore vocal and present internationally.Explained:Nicola Sturgeon bids to give Scotland greater influence global issuesScottish business quangos in the US have been registered in the same way for years, but the governmentrsquos plans are overtly political.In paperwork filed with the US Department of Justice, it contrasts its own ldquoprogressive voice with the Trump presidency, Brexit and ldquoa conflicted Congress.The Tories said Ms Sturgeon was taking the Scottish Government into inappropriate territory.Ms Sturgeon last month spent five days in the US and Canada to promote Scottish businesses and Scotland as a place to invest, but also talked frequently to the media about independence.Read documents in full: Government of Scotland in North AmericaThe First Minister was also recognised by the United Nations for her work in advancing gender equality during the trip.Opposition parties have criticised the recent overseas forays as extravagant -

It was the home of Jacobite rebels, its illegal whisky trade led to the Scotch whisky industry we know today, and its people fought in the countryrsquos great wars but all this was in danger of being forgotten.\"The Heritage Centre will bring that history to le and unveil the secrets of the Cabrach through interactive exhibits where visitors will travel back in time to experience le in this harsh but beautul place.The project took shape two years ago after researchers commissioned by the Cabrach Trust discovered a former illicit whisky bothy built into the side of a hill and thought to date back to the early s.Sheltered by a small crag and built into the side of the hill, the secret bothy offering smugglers an excellent vantage point to keep an eye out for excise men on the nearby highway.The centre makes use of those existing traditional farm steadings.Peter McIlhenny, partner at LDN Architects, which has put together the design, said: ldquoThis project will transform an existing ancient steading into a visitor attraction, centred around a museum and distillery. Our design adapts the existing range of buildings in a delicate way, whilst incorporating a completely new st century building containing the reception, tasting room, shop, cafeacute and multi-purpose spaces.\"Those new spaces are tuned to visitor needs while taking full advantage of the magnicent panoramic outlook of the setting. Great care has been brought to the selection and placing of materials to both old and new.The distillery received pound, from the William Grant Foundation, pound, from Foundation Scotland, and pound, from the Reekimlane Foundation. A further pound, came from an anonymous donor.The funding from William Grant Foundation will go towards cultural heritage activities, refurbishing the buildings and preparing the site to allow preparatory works.Additional funding for the project has come from a mix of social finance, grants and charitable trusts and foundations, with several other funding applications in progress.The centre plans also included room for a shop, cafe, exhibition space and play area.Cabrach, which means antler place in Scottish Gaelic as a one time home of herds of red deer, is home to some of Scotlandrsquos rarest wildle and a once-secret nuclear bunker, among other attractions.In  it was given dark sky discovery site status.

It presented in their shining glory all the characteristics that have made her one of the worst Prime Ministers ever. As well as the delusional psychic powers, it illustrated her intransigence, her authoritarian tendencies, her utter contempt for her Parliamentary colleagues, a naked populism that Pierre Poujade would have thought de trop, and total disdain for trivial obstacles such as objective reality or telling the truth.Read more: Alison Rowat: Mother of Parliaments is unfitIt may be true that therersquos precious little popular or parliamentary appetite, and no majority, for the Withdrawal Agreement, no deal, y delay, a second referendum or reversing the vote. But it is a flat lie to say MPs have been willing to say only what they donrsquot want. Theyrsquove been clamouring to say just that, and attempting to get indicative votes that might narrow the options down to what might actually get through the Commons. But theyrsquove been constantly frustrated by Mrs Mayrsquos refusal to acknowledge that anything other than her proposals should be considered.Mrs May said that she was elected to deliver what the people had decided on in the referendum. But she wasnrsquot actually elected , having thrown away the majority she inherited in what must be the most inept campaign ever staged. Only the fact that Jeremy Corbyn is even more useless than she is kept her in the job, with a majorityof precisely zero. But leave that aside.The more puzzling question is why she, a Remain voter, should think she possesses unique insight into what those who voted to leave the EU want. The options, which she refused to let anyone, evenher own Brexit secretaries, discuss or explore, were legion. Many of those who campaigned for Leave wanted, for instance, to remain in the single market ndash pointing to the Efta countries, such as Norway, or to Switzerland, with its comprehensive free trade and movement arrangements. The fact that some may now have hardened their position to argue that that is not ldquoreal Brexit is irrelevant itrsquos still leaving the EU.Instead of giving this any consideration, Mrs May set out a series of ldquored lines plucked from her own imagination, though we are now apparently expected to regard them as something along the lines of the golden tablets and rock spectacles delivered to the prophet Joseph Smith.Unsurprisingly, these did not correspond with the views of most Leave voters, who ndash despite attempts to characterise them as unormly bigoted and xenophobic ndash never once listed immigration as their first priority in any poll conducted before or after the referendum. They did, however, resemble Mrs Mayrsquos track record at the Home Office, when she was responsible for such measures as the ldquoHostile Environment and attempted to deport members of the Windrush generation who were perfectly entitled to live in the UK.Another of her priorities was the European arrest warrant and security co-operation, though she seems not to have considered the security implications for the Irish border, despite it having been the single greatest security issue for the UK for the past half-century.She has given no evidence that she understood the opportunities Brexit afforded for free trade, something which should have been given a high priority,only because of the possibility of a no-deal Brexit. Indeed, on trade issues the only impulse she has demonstrated is a willingness to cave in to rent-seekers amongst the large corporations and special interest groups.But then that is of a piece with Mrs Mayrsquos political philosophy, profoundly illiberal when it comes to regulation, immigration and human rights, and essentially left-wing on economic issues.She is a disastrous failure, not just as a Prime Minister, but as a Conservative leader. Her efforts to keep the party together have left it split more than at any time since the arguments over the repeal of the Corn Laws. Her professed Unionism has threatened both Ireland and Scotlandrsquos future in the UK.The tragedy is that,her deal goes through, it will be worse than all the other possible outcomes, andshe resigns because it fails to go through, the damage will already have been done. She may yet go down in history as an even worse PM than Lord North, who lost America. She could lose not just Europe, but the UK."},{"url":null,"title":"is-o2-down-mobile-network-investigate-uk-service-outages","story":"\"Were aware of an issue,\" the companys coverage status page reads.\"Our technical teams are investigating.

We are now engaging with the treasury on the issue of revenue support for the sector, and any support she can give to that would be very welcome. In the meantime, we have the prospect of the Energy White Paper coming up.

We remain interested in marine and tidal as the Rt. Hon. Gentleman knows. Of course we need to discuss with the Treasury any support mechanisms, but I do want to continue to engage with the sector on a long term basis.#Speaking after the exchange, Mr Carmichael added: “White papers outline government’s thinking on policy areas, and are a key stage in influencing decisions made by ministers. Getting something in the white paper on support for the wave and tidal energy would be a huge coup for the industry which is big in the Northern Isles.“The marine energy industry is an innovative area of research, with the potential to add even more to our ability to export renewable energy to mainland Scotland.

He set out that, between -, tourism numbers have increased by an impressive  per cent to almost , people with an estimated value of nearly £m.Mr McArthur warned that this success could not be taken for granted and presented its own challenges. As well as urging ministers to resolve the stand-off over RET and provide support for the replacement Orkney’s ageing internal ferry fleet, the Orkney MSP also repeated his call for Orkney’s world-class heritage sites to be backed by world-class infrastructure.Speaking after the debate, he said: #Tourism is one of the few sectors that touches almost every part of the country and it is one where Orkney has been punching above its weight over recent years.#With the natural assets we have and a lot of hard work by those involved in all aspects of the tourism sector locally, Orkney has seen visitor numbers and income increase signicantly over recent years. This success has brought awards and recognition, but it also brings with it challenges.#Everyone knows that Orkney’s reputation for quality requires the tourist experience to be managed carefully. This will involve taking pressure off key sites as well as making more of what Orkney has to offer.#It also needs Scottish Government to step up to the plate, not least when it comes to transport links. The long-overdue introduction of RET would help Orkney remain competitive as a destination, while replacement of the ageing internal ferry fleet is not only vital for the islands they serve but a means of encouraging visitors to explore more widely once they get here.“Ministers also have a role to play, through Historic Environment Scotland, in helping ensure that Orkney’s world-class heritage sites are supported by high-quality infrastructure. Local partners, including Destination Orkney and the Council, must be closely involved but investment through HES is crucial to making this happen.“There is good reason to believe that Orkney can continue playing to its strengths when it comes to tourism and there will be plenty of opportunities over the years ahead showcase our islands.  However, we cannot be complacent about what it will take to maintain and enhance Orkney’s reputation for good quality”.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Representatives from the commission are due to come to Orkney next month to discuss the proposals.Speaking yesterday, Ronnie Hinds, chairman of the commission, said: “We are pleased to begin our consultation on electoral arrangements with the three councils today and I look forward to engaging with them on our proposals.#It is important that electoral arrangements for Scottish councils are effective and that our proposals deliver on requirements for electoral parity and, as far as possible, take account of local ties and special geographical considerations.“We also welcome the flexibility offered by the IslandsAct to use one or two member wards and have used this flexibility as appropriate in our proposals. After completion of our consultation with councils we will be seeking public views on our proposals over the summer.”The  Review of Electoral Arrangements will make proposals for the six council areas specied in the IslandsAct  – Argyll and Bute, Highland, North Ayrshire, Na h-Eileanan an Iar, Orkney Islands and Shetland Islands.The commission is conducting the review in two phases, focusing firstly on Na h-Eileanan an Iar, Orkney Islands and Shetland Islands, with the reviews of  Argyll and Bute, Highland and North Ayrshire to take place after the public consultation in the islands groups takes place.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

But when the guy propping up the bar is Theresa May’s top Europe advisor, Olly Robbins – the architect of her strategy in Brussels and the ERG’s favourite hate figure – you should safely be able to draw your Brexit roadmap from it.When ITV reported a second-hand overheard conversation in a Brussels bar where Robbins described how MPs would end up being presented with the option of May’s Brexit deal or a long delay, it seemed to offer a key that would unlock the whole process of leaving the EU.After MPs voted against no-deal last week and for an extension to Article , events appeared to be following Robbins’ script perfectly. The Government had hoped to bring the deal back for a third vote this week, with the threat of ­staying in the EU for anywhere between nine and  months looming over Brexiteers, forcing them to fall into line. Personally, I admit to breathing a sigh of relief at the end of last week’s chaos, thinking that a plan was coming together.But nothing has been more corrosive over the past three years than the illusion of government ­control, and some forces are beyond even Robbins’ reckoning. The fact that his plan was so dramatically derailed this week means that a no-deal Brexit – always the legal default – could now happen by ­accident, unless there is an even ­bigger twist in the week ahead.Rather than taking back control, the events of the past week put May’s fate in the hands of either the EU, or pro-EU Tories who could oust her to defeat her Brexit vision.: No-deal Brexit would place food banks in ‘dangerous position’, warns Ian BlackfordNo one in Government predicted John Bercow’s intervention ­ruling out a third vote on the Brexit deal unless there was a signicant change in content or circumstances. That in itself is worrying – the convention that motions can’t be voted on twice in the parliamentary session isn’t an obscure one. No one needs more evidence that Downing Street is floundering, but there it is.His critics say Bercow’s intervention was an attempt to block Brexit and allow the second EU referendum he really wants, or at least rule out a no-deal scenario. By ruling out a vote before yesterday’s EU Council summit, the ­Commons Speaker certainly denied the ­Government its best chance of ­getting the deal through.Bercow’s statement forced the EU Commission’s chief Brexit ­negotiator Michel Barnier to come out the following day and say a long extension needed a “clear purpose”. It also gave time for ­Brexiteers in the Cabinet to ambush May and force her to take a request for a long extension off the table.The spectre aimed at scaring Brexiteers was vanquished, ­leaving opposition MPs as the only pool of votes to pass the deal. May’s extraordinary statement in Downing Street, shting the blame onto parliament, burnt that bridge, too.With ious extension plans being discussed during intense talks in Brussels last night, EU leaders appear to have come to the conclusion that May, and her deal, are finished.If she isn’t in control, to avoid a no-deal Brexit the UK is now in the hands of two groups: Remainers in the Cabinet, and the  governments of the EU.A group of pro-EU Cabinet ­ministers have insisted they would do whatever it takes to stop no-deal. They may now have the time to show they mean it.Both Barnier and French president Emmanuel Macron have said there is a way back,the UK is ready for “deep political change”.This could be a general election or a second EU referendum, but what the EU really wants to hear is that the red lines that have made a deal so dficultare going to be jettisoned, either by May, or her successor.The Remain group in Cabinet includes Scottish Secretary David Mundell, who joined Amber Rudd, Greg Clarke and David Gauke in breaking a three-line whip to abstain on a motion to extend Article  last week. With so little time left, resignation isn’t enough. They would have to become the ‘men and women in grey suits’, insisting the Prime Minister abandons her red lines, or ushering her out of ­Downing Street.The likes of David Lidington would need to lead a government of national unity in all but name, getting a Brexit deal through with Labour and SNP votes that keeps the UK in the single market and customs union. It would likely mean the end of the Conservative Party as we know it at the very least, it would leave it to the next Tory leader to put its surviving pieces back together.: Jeremy Corbyn won’t rule out stopping Brexit as PM arrives in BrusselsEven in Brexit Britain, a week can’t possibly hold that much drama, but a longer extension offers the opportunity.Still, EU leaders can’t give the UK something it isn’t prepared to ask for itself. Conservative MPs lost the chance to push May from office when they failed to do the job before Christmas. The UK’s venerable ­parliamentary democracy has shown itself not to be nimble enough for the last-minute pivot needed, and evenit could, its leaders command too little confidence to bring the public along with them.In EU capitals, an election or a new EU referendum looks like a leap into more uncertainty, which the ­continent scarcely needs. Leaders and officials gathered in Brussels spoke openly about the “crisis” in the UK, and don’t want their fragile politics infected by the febrile mood around Westminster.A no deal Brexit could still happen by accident. The only thing that’s certain is that Bercow and the EU have called time on Robbins’ pub blueprint.©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"why scotland s roads aren t ready for electric scooters alastair dalton","story":"Electric scooters are common in parts of Europe and the US and the UK Government is considering whether to allow them on British roads. Alastair Dalton explains why that would be a mistake.They offer a potentially attractive new way of getting about – but also threaten chaos on Scotland’s car-centric road networks.Electric scooters are commonplace in some European countries and US states, and the UK Government is now considering whether to allow them here too.Ministers announced this week they will “consider options for appropriate testing regimes to ensure any such vehicles on the road are safe and fit for purpose”, which could be followed by localised trials.On the face of it, being able to hop on and effortlessly zip about our towns and cities has obvious appeal – especially to non-cyclists.It is hardly “active travel”, like walking and cycling, but could encourage some to switch from cars or taxis on short journeys.Anything electrically powered, which has no emissions on the street, also has to be a positive as part of efforts to cut urban air pollution.However, letting loose a new form of transport on roads still woefully unsuited for cycles could just make things worse for everyone.That’s not to say there’s not a case for them – but the radical redrawing of road space away from the car should be accelerated first.The brave would take their chances scooting among other traffic, though many are likely to be deterred from sharing roads with lorries, buses and taxis, let alone the cars who already pass cyclists intimidatingly close.: Electric scooters on British roads would create ‘dangerous cocktail’There’s also the small matter of scooters’ in wheels not being pothole friendly, causing discomfortnot danger, as shared transport group Comouk has highlighted.Most who scoot are likely to want to stick to the relative safety of pavements and cycle lanes –that is permitted. But here, a dferent risk is created, of scooters colliding with pedestrians.There are far too few cycle lanes they could use, on roads or pavements, and even fewer segregated lanes, albeit cities like Glasgow are adding more.In addition, there is already potential conflict between walkers and cyclists on shared paths, some of which would struggle to cope with more riders, let alone scooters too.Another concern is street clutter. Recent visitors to Berlin and Brussels tell me of large numbers of scooters strewn across pavements.Technology may now enable scooters to be left “dockless”, but this has caused a big problem in places like San Diego.It’s bad enough trying to negotiate pavements already littered with advertising A-boards, so this could cause another hazard.Karen Millhouse, a resident of the Calornian city, emailed me this week: “I think we have more than , dockless scooters in our fair city, and they just keep coming. It is a nightmare, especially for pedestrians and the disabled.”She said Disability Rights Calornia had even filed a class action against scooters blocking pavements.: Alastair Dalton: The ‘electric-bike smile’ is now officialA better plan for Scotland – and the UK – would be to focus on electric bikes first. The main rental schemes in Edinburgh and Glasgow are due to add them later this year, along with other parts of Scotland such as Stirling.Electric bikes are equally effortless to ride, but unlike scooters provide nearly as much exercise as traditional cycling, so have much more to commend them.They also encourage people to cycle further, and have a similar topspeed – mph – as has been proposed for scooters.©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"brexit theresa may s job on the line as tories lose patience","story":"Sorry, were having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...Theresa May is ing from another tumultuous Brussels summit amid warnings that her premiership is on the line.But she faces a Tory Party losing patience with her leadership and threats that MPs could now seize control of the withdrawal process.Sir Graham Brady, the chairman of the backbench  committee, was reported to have met Mrs May to tell her that most Conservative MPs now want her to quit.The Dailysaid that Sir Graham visited her in Downing Street on Monday after being “bombarded” with text messages from MPs demanding she should go.The paper said that it was one of a series of direct confrontations with Conservative MPs in the run-up to the summit.Mrs May was said to have been challenged by a group of  whips just before last week’s meaningful vote - which she lost by  votes - with one directly calling on her to quit, while others warned that the trust of backbenchers had been lost.And there was said to have been a further confrontation with Eurosceptic MPs on Wednesday when Nigel Evans, the executive secretary of the , told her: “It’s not that people don’t believe what you say, it’s that people don’t believe you can deliver.”Stewart Jackson, who was David Davis’s chief of staff when he was Brexit secretary, said she should “stand down immediately”she loses next week’s vote.“Conservative members will no longer tolerate her grovelling to the EU and national humiliation,” said the former Conservative MP for Peterborough. “I suspect the Whips, and Cabinet will help the process.”Mrs May’s former policy adviser George Freeman said thatshe lost the vote, Parliament would “take control and “switch to Plan B” to join the European Free Trade Association “with or without this PM”.At a late night press conference, the Prime Minister made clear that she intended to make another attempt to get her Brexit deal through the Commons.If she succeeds, the EU leaders agreed to extend the Article  withdrawal process until May  to enable the Government get the necessary legislation through Parliament.Butshe fails to do so, the UK will have until April  to set out its next steps, with a longer extension on offer onlyBritain takes part in European Parliament elections in May.The Prime Minister told reporters the “flextension” plan offered MPs a clear choice.“We can leave with a deal in an orderly manner, have that extension until May , orwe don’t get that deal, that vote, through, then we have to come forward with another plan, andthat plan means another extension, it means standing in those European elections,” she said.However, the chairman of the Commons Brexit Committee, Labour MP Hilary Benn, warned that he will table an amendment enabling MPs to hold a series of “indicative votes” on alternatives to Mrs May’s plan.“This won’t workthe Prime Minister is not prepared to move an inch,” he told the BBC Radio  Today programme.“We need to open up this process because we have rejected her deal, we’ve rejected no-deal, the EU has decided to give us a little more time, and we’ve really got to get on with it.”The amendment is backed by a cross-party group of MPs including Tory former ministers Sir Oliver Letwin and Dominic Grieve.Aides confirmed that Thursday’s agreement means that a no-deal Brexit is no longer a possibility on March , but stressed that it remains on the tableMPs have not approved the Withdrawal Agreement by April .The format increases pressure on Leave-backing MPs to row in behind Mrs May’s deal, for fear thatit falls the UK could find itself electing new MEPs and remaining for month or years within the EU.It also creates a fortnight’s breathing spaceMrs May reaches the end of next week without securing agreement for her package, orSpeaker John Bercow prevents her from tabling a motion which he regards as a repeat of those already defeated by  votes in January and  votes last week.Downing Street was unable to say which day the Government would seek to bring back the Withdrawal Agreement for a third “meaningful vote” - known in Westminster as MV.But sources confirmed that Mrs May will table secondary legislation to remove the date March  from Brexit laws.©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"royal mile treasure trove of mary queen of scots documents found","story":"Sorry, were having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...A treasure trove of documents signed by Mary Queen of Scots and revealing the #everyday reality of ruling the country# in the th century has been unearthed in a council storage facility on the Royal Mile.A haul of handwritten papers is said to show the doomed monarch “carefully managing the busy commercial le of Edinburgh”, as well as authorising the building of new defences for the city in Leith.The documents, which are set to be the centrepiece of a new exhibition in Edinburgh on Mary’s short-lived rule, have already been conserved and digitised to allow them to be viewed publicly on the council’s online archive. They were discovered by staff in a store at the Museum of Edinburgh, just a few hundred yards away from the Palace of Holyroodhouse, where Mary ruled for six years after ing from France in . The  documents, which are inidually dated, numbered and signed, relate to the rights of deacons and tradesmen in the city, the selling of meat at the Tolbooth and the making of salt in Newhaven.Early conservation work on the documents, which were recently discovered in the Museum of Edinburgh’s own storage facility off the Canongate, has revealed watermarks – one of a goat and another of a flower – which can only been seen when held up to light.It is thought the papers entered the archives of the local authority in the s, but were then “lost” before being rediscovered nearly a century later during conservation work. Intriguingly, some of the documents signed by Mary date from when she was still in France.Experts in the council’s museums and galleries service, which is responsible for the official archives of the city, said the recently unearthed documents revealed an “often overlooked “ aspect of her le.History curator Vicky Garrington said: “Together, the documents shed light on a key part of Scotland’s past. We all know the tragic story of Mary Queen of Scots, her eventful le and eventual execution in , but in these documents we see a dferent side to Mary.“Here, she can be seen carefully managing the everyday affairs of Edinburgh, both from France and Scotland. It’s fascinating to think of her reading through these official papers before carefully applying her signature.“They are staying in storage at the museum for now. But we hope to have them assessed by a conservator and for further research to be done on them by experts on Mary, after which we hope to exhibit them, which will be hugely exciting.”Museums and galleries manager Frank Little said: “We’re constantly reviewing, caring for and researching our collections, and look forward to sharing more of the city’s rich heritage with residents and visitors through our programme of exhibitions and online activities.” Council culture convener Donald Wilson said: “Our museums and galleries hold thousands of historic treasures, many of which are on display in our venues.

They then went on to highlight some of the key tenets underpinning the debate such as trade agreements, law and immigration, before making their concluding statements.In the opening gambit for the pro-Brexit team, S pupil Abbi Morgan argued that leaving the EU #would be a hugely positive thing for the UK# and would allow the country to #take control of borders and create worldwide trade agreements#.She went on to add that it would put the UK in a position to #take back its sovereignty# and make its own decisions on important matters. She stated that as a net contributor to the EU, the UK would be better off by £. billion.In the opening address for the pro-EU team, Lois Langlandssaid that #history and past experience as a member of the EU# gave the UK a more secure position for the future and that, in leaving the European Union, the UK would #enter the unknown# and #walk into the future blindfolded#.She said that outside the EU the UK was a #small fish in a big pond# and asked why any country would be interested in providing a free trade agreement with the UK.#The EU as an organisation is extremely wasteful#, he said. #Every  days the European Parliament moves from Brussels to Strasbourg, where it sits for four days # this is estimated to cost nearly £ million a year.#Touching on the issues of freedom of movement as part of the remain team, Chiara MacLeansaid: #Once the UK leaves the EU, British citizens will become third-party nationals, with no automatic right of admission.# She added that, through the new European travel information and authorisation system, all UK nationals over  years of age #would have to pay money to go somewhere they had a free right to go now#.Seth Bennettook up the reins for the pro-Brexit side, arguing that in terms of laws and immigration the EU could pass any laws they wanted and in by doing so #strip Britain of its sovereignty# # which he described as #one of its driving forces#.He believed that Brexit would offer the UK the chance to #increase its spending in education and housing# which could perhaps lead to a #revival of the nation#s once-thriving industries#.Speaking for the pro-EU team, Gracie Buchan said that leaving the European Union would lead to a trade deficit and result in a shortage of daily supplies such as fruit and vegetables.#Keeping food shop shelves full and prices down will be one of the biggest challenges when Brexit comes around,# she said. #Failure to reach some sort of an agreement could see retailers face an average increase of  per cent, particularly in dairy, meat, veg, and fruit.#Closing for the Brexit side, S pupil Joseph Moller said the EU favoured its own agenda and that in terms of per head of population Maltese citizens had  times more representation than UK nationals.He added that, rather than the , jobs that were cited as potentially being lost due to Brexit, the level of employment had in fact risen by one per cent since the referendum and unemployment was at its lowest level since the s.Summing up for remain, S pupil Innes MacNeil said: #Latest reports suggest that deals have been struck with just seven out of  countries, we have gained a lot more than we have spent on the EU, and multinational companies are threatening to relocate overseas, affecting jobs and investments.#Exiting in less than  days# time without any sound withdrawal agreement and just a few trade relationships will result in uncertainty and chaos.#The judges said they were impressed by how confident and informed the pupils were. They also felt the pupils were cohesive as a team and said that they saw some future MSPs and MPs.In the end, the judges awarded the team speaking against Brexit  points while the side advocating Brexit received  to claim victory.Skye, Lochaber, and Badenoch MSP Kate Forbes and Highland and Islands MSP Edward Mountain both fielded questions on Brexit after the debate and were quick to praise the pupils for their efforts.Ms Forbes said: #I certainly think they could have resolved Brexit faster than some of the politicians today # an absolutely fantastic debate based on fact, evidence, respect for each other, lots of confidence. I think I have left with a few top tips for my next debate in parliament!#Mr Mountain added: #I thought it was quite excellent # there#s obviously a lot of research gone into it. I thought they were extremely confident # I would have been much more nervous than that speaking at their age. As I said to Kate Forbes today, she should be worried because there are a few challenges for her position.#"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/2109-28-September-12-150x150.jpg","title":"lewis and harris womens football team kick off new league in","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine with a barnstorming - away win over Nairn Ladies FC.The long trip to Nairn for their league opener on Saturday proved to be one to remember for the islanders as they enjoyed a resounding victory to get their league campaign up and running in emphatic fashion.Played in freezing conditions on Nairn showfield, the Lewis and Harris club fielded a young side made up largely of - and -year-olds # with just three non-pupil players included in the squad.After missing a penalty, Ann-Mairi Macleod made history by becoming the scorer of the first goal in the newly-formed Highlands and Islands league.Macleod#s goal opened the floodgates as the visitors went on to score five more in the first period # thanks to a goal apiece from Jessica Macleod and Hollie Martin, and a hat-trick from Mary Macleod.Lewis and Harris were in dreamland in the second half as they proceeded to score a further  goals.

Since then emergency repairs have been undertaken as the building had been unoccupied for a number of years following the deaths of Jim and Sally Gillen, Gracehill’s last postmasters. Happily, a full scheme of restoration is now underway. The first phase will see the building of new chimneys, the replacement of the roof and rainwater goods and repairs to the windows. The building is historically very signicant as it was a purpose built shop constructed for the Settlement in . It is two storey with attics and basement and the layout is much as it was when originally constructed. The central shop area still contains many original features including shelving built into the walls, counters and a large wooden winch wheel for drawing stores up to the attic. Speaking about the restoration David Johnston, chairman of the Trust said: The aim is to restore this unique building so visitors can once again experience what le might have been like in the nineteenth century. “Holiday accommodation with a period theme will also be provided and a tea room will complete the scheme to ensure the future of this wonderful and historic building and hopefully the roof will be good for another  years!

From pizza to pasta, Italian food is right up there with so many people’s tastebuds.As a lover of all things Italian, I was hugely excited when the Balmoral Hotel recently started their ‘Italian Night’, available every Tuesday night from -pm. I am no stranger to the thriving Black’s Road establishment and given the quality of food available in the Lady Anne Bistro and the conjoining Stix # Stones, the special-themed night attracted me to pay a visit once again to the Balmoral last Tuesday night.As ever, we were greeted by a polite and accommodating member of staff on arrival and shown to our table. I was immediately drawn by the décor – a number of Italian flags scattered around the restaurant and a huge blazing fire which was the perfect welcoming as Storm Gareth continued to rage outside.The themed-menu consists of a range of dishes sought to bring out the authentic taste of Italy and I couldn’t wait to peruse my choices. From pizzas to lasagne and pasta, there looked to be something for everyone, with gluten-free options also available.Before we had made our choice, we were presented with a large plate of Italian antipasti – basically a mixture of famous Italian nibbles. Much to my surprise, this is a complimentary touch from the Balmoral on the Italian night, designed to delve you into the full authentic Italian experience straight away.I gazed excitedly at my partner across the table. Where would we start  There were sticks of garlic bread, doughballs, pepperoni, olives and a pasta salad. Add in some jalapenos, peppers with a mouth-watering vinaigrette and mozzarella, it was a sublime clash of flavours which made me feel right in… well Italy! It reminded me much like a version of Spanish Tapas or Chinese Dim Sum which allows for iety and quantity of dferent options. With quality too, the night was off to a flyer with this beautul antipasti starter.On to the main course and after the wonderful starter, me and my partner could not wait for it to arrive. We both went for pizza, and to be honest it would be hard not to given the mouth-watering choices on the menu. A superb handcrafted gourmet pizza range, inidually designed with the finest ingredients for your own authentic taste of Italy – it was simply a no-brainer.After much deliberation, I opted for the BBQ Pizza, which consisted of a BBQ sauce base, mozzarella, chorizo, peri-peri chicken, jalapenos, onions and sweetcorn. Drizzled with just amount the peri-peri sauce, it was a concoction of flavours. A thin-base is always a must for me in order to properly enjoy what is actually on the pizza, instead of having to chew excessive amounts of pizza dough and again this pizza ticked all the right boxes. A BBQ-base and chicken on a pizza is nothing out of the ordinary on a pizza menu but this one was unique, given the intense flavour from the peri-peri sauce. This pizza would put some “Italian” pizza takeaways to shame, quite frankly. It was that good.Across the table, my partner, who is a vegetarian is no stranger to a good old pizza, after all it is entirely possible to enjoy the classic Italian dish without any meat at all. The menu includes a fantastic make-your-own option from an ingredient list with everything you can think of on it, allowing you to be as adventurous as you like. She went for a classic tomato base complete with mozzarella and a generous helping of sweetcorn, peppers and jalapenos. The pizza looked like a veggie’s delight and again it could not be faulted. Not too heavy on the stomach and full of flavour, it was little surprise she deliberately wanted to keep a few slices to take home.The pizzas also allow for additional sides, and it wouldn’t be an Italian night without some Garlic Bread. I simply adore anything garlic and this was what garlic bread should be like – oozing with garlic butter as it was torn apart, you could tell it was handcrafted and homemade to perfection. Our additional side of garlic potatoes also trumped the other side options of skinny fries or a tossed salad. It was a carbs heaven evening overall but worth it for the quality and taste of the food we enjoyed.A packed Tuesday night in the Lady Anne Bistro could only mean other diners, like ourselves, were enjoying the authentic Italian-themed menu on offer. It was something very unique and to their credit, the wonderful team of chefs and staff at the Balmoral are pulling it off to perfection. Most of the pizzas are priced around the £ mark which is more than worth it, just think how expensive it can be to order a takeaway from some well-known establishments. The Balmoral Hotel is excelling and the Italian-themed night is just the latest incentive to what is a fantastic establishment. Warm and friendly staff, quality food and best of all, it’s right on your doorstep. I could not recommend the Italian night anymore. Go and check it out for yourself and tell me you don’t feel like you have been to Italy for the night. I cannot wait to plan my next Tuesday nightvisit.Balmoral Hotel,Blacks Road, Dunmurry, Belfast BT NFTel:    balmoralhotelbelfast.co.u"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"butsy was larger than life and loved by many","story":"BORN on September   the late Pat ‘Butsy’ Butler has been described as a “larger than le figure” and“someone who was known and loved by many”.Pat, who passed away on December  , was educated at St Teresa’s Primary School on the Glen Road, before moving to St Malachy’s College where he completed his secondary education. The Glen Road man’s first job was as a compositor printer with Pitman’s University Press. However, during these early working days, he undertook voluntary youth work within the greater West Belfast area and soon realised that this was where his future lay. Eventually Pat left Belfast for Leicester University where he achieved his degree in youth and social care, following this up with a Master’s degree from the Ulster University. Pat eventually became a youth worker in charge at St Michael’s Youth Club, Finaghy Road North, where he spent many happy years. During this time, Pat managed a number of the youth football teams, with home games being played at Woodlands playing fields. Pat’s brothers commented that to say he was “vocerous” in his coaching would be an “understatement”. “In fact the story goes that at this time, house prices in Orchardville depreciated by  per cent!”At a time when West Belfast was often in turmoil, the youth club was a haven for young people a place where parents knew their children would be safe. Pat took this onboard and enabled the young people in his care to reach their full potential. Pat developed an insatiable love for sport from a very early age. He joined Davitt’s GAC for a short time before transferring to St Agnes’ where he spent many happy years as both a player and manager. In the course of his time with the ‘Aggies’ Pat, along with many of the players, made those never to be forgotten trips to the continent and of course Shannon events that proved to be hugely enjoyable and deeply spitural ventures. A serious arm break when he was  curtailed Pat’s playing career but he had much success in his managerial roles. Pat, affectionately known as Butsy, also loved soccer and had a long and enjoyable time playing for and supporting Dominic Savio. During the ’s, Pat embraced the basketball scene and in particular St Gall’s basketball club. Pat was committed totally to this new undertaking. In fact, his brother Gerard remembers ing back to Denewood one day and discovering a very large American making himself a cup of tea. Of course Pat had not told Gerard that ‘Soupy’ Campbell would be staying for a few days – a bit of a shock. As a commentator and administrator Pat gave  per cent to this new venture. His famous commentary during lives games in the Andersonstown Leisure Centre is still talked about.On the sporting front, Pat finally finished up as a member of Falls Bowling Club where he spent many happy years as a player, administrator and advisor to the long suffering groundsman. Pat eventually became the club president, something of which he was particular proud of. He also became president of the private greens – a role which again Pat embraced with diligence and total commitment. A spokesperson for Falls Bowling Club described Pat, their th President, as someone with a personality that “could fill the Waterfront Hall”. “His passing has left a gap that we will not attempt to fill.”Married to Shelia since August  , Pat lived le to the full, had a hugely positive influence on many and ultimately made a dference. He will be sorely missed by all who knew him."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"history man joes lifetime in community","story":"HAVING been involved in community development for the best part of three decades, Joe Baker is a familiar face to many in North Belfast, but he is probably most recognised as one of the city’s leading resident historians.Joe has been involved with the Ashton Community Trust virtually since its inception in the early-s and now sits on its board. It was also during that time that he became involved in the Belfast History Project.Throughout his career, Joe has written, and published, books, magazines and newspaper articles for a range of media outlets during his career but, unlike some historians, his expertise grew outside the confines of traditional academia.By his own admission, he didn’t do too well at school, often “forgetting” to get off the bus at the gate. However, after ing to education at the Belfast College of Business Studies in the late s, he enrolled in history classes, which he would go on to utilise with the fledgling Belfast History Project.“I came back from college and started to get people involved in learning about the history of the area,” he explained.“From that, we discussed a number of dferent ideas. One idea we had worked on before that was cleaning up Clton Street Cemetery – which was where we used to drink our cider. It was all overgrown and wrecked at the time, but we all got together to fix it up. We tied in with people like Enterprise Ulster, and then Belfast City Council took it over and a number of volunteers came on board. Through that we developed this interest in local history.“Once the ball started rolling that was it. We started doing dferent educational projects. One of the things we started to discuss was putting a magazine together, which sounds very easy, but at that time there was this new thing coming out called a computer that you had to learn to use.

Once we go up and running everything just fell into place.”The Belfast History Project has been exemplary in its endeavours, setting up groundbreaking publications and establishing history tours in long-unexplored areas of the city.“One of the good things is that when you look in Belfast city centre now and you see all the tours done here and there – blue badge this, white badge that – we get to look at it and say we did it first,” said Joe with a smile.“We did a walking tour in the Half Bap area and one of the very first tours was cancelled because of a bomb scare – not many tour operators can claim that.”The end of the conflict has ushered in a new age of competition as ious operators compete to sell tours of the ever-developing city of Belfast. While Joe believes the growing interest in local history is “brilliant” he insists branding and profits have often got in the way of fact.“People are trying to put these brands on things,” he said.“At my last count Belfast has nine-quarters. When I was at school,I was asked how many quarters there were andI had said nine I know what would’ve happened.“There is a lot of  stuff like this Tribeca development, which is a lot of nonsense.“They should do the names to reflect the history of the area. It annoys me when people try to put a  history on an area or say things that just aren’t true. We’ve always argued thatyou’re going to do history you should tell the truth. I love to see the tourism industry grow and change, but as long as they stick to a principle of truth.”Having started as a small local initiative, the Belfast History Project has flourished over the years, and now provides tours all over Europe, with their Russian tours booked up for nearly two years in advance. However, with all of its wider triumphs, the Belfast History Project remains a social enterprise, whose key aim is to give back to the community. Local tours and events still run regularly, such as the highly successful historical photographic exhibiton, which recently appeared in the New Lodge – and, as Joe explained, “It’s all about education”.“If we get people into history we can get them into education and guide them along their own path,” he said.“For example, we had a group of kids studying the history of the New Lodge, which grew to Belfast, Ireland and then Europe. They might be kids at the time, and they’ll mess about, but about tenyears later they’ll come back to us and say ‘That was the best project I was ever part of’ and that gives us a buzz.”Joe continued: “I remember years ago that the Barrack area in the New Lodge was just called the Barrack, but younger people didn’t know why it was called that. If you ask them now they’ll tell you it’s because there used to be an army barracks there.“Whenever you do a photographic exhibition and people are learning about their own area, then that’s the start of an educational journey.“As we always say, there is no more fruitful form of education than to raise the interest of people in their own surroundings.“Once you do that it can open up countless other opportunities.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"priceless 1916 artefacts to go on show at opening of new james","story":"AN ORIGINAL  Proclamation along with the printing blocks used to create the document are among the historically invaluable artacts to go on display for the first time ever together when Áras Uí Chonghaile opens its doors next month. The Gaeltacht Quarter-based £. million three-storey building is set to welcome tourists and visitors from Saturday, April  when the centre opens to offer an interactive exhibition, study area, a fascinating library of Connolly’s writings, café and conference facility. The opening of Áras Uí Chonghaile comes three years after a statue of James Connolly was unveiled outside the Falls Community Council to commemorate the th year of the Easter Rising. The bronze statue was unveiled by a great-grandson of the  hero, James Connolly Heron, who described West Belfast as Connolly’s “spiritual home”.The ambitious project, led by Fáilte Feirste Thiar, will host a pageant parade on April , Good Friday, and will leave from Conway Mill, a site where James Connolly organised mill workers during the time he made West Belfast his home. “Aras Uí Chonghaile is designed to celebrate everything James Connolly contributed to Belfast, Ireland and beyond,” explained Fáilte Feirste Director Harry Connolly. “There are five core elements to the centre, starting with the ground floor, world-class visitor exhibition. The first floor of the centre will house the Connolly Library and will consist of the world’s finest collection of writings including books we have secured from when James Connolly spent his time in Kilmainham Gaol. The fourth element of the centre will be an event and conference space, with all the first class facilities you would expect.”Harry told the Andersonstown News that a year-long events programme has also been planned with folk sessions, film club meetings held once a month in conjunction with Sean Murray’s Respect film company, and a series of seminars and lectures.“We are also delighted to announce that Hatch Café will take up residence in the centre as our hospitality partners and will be open to the public,” he said. Áras Uí Chonghaile centre manger Séanna Walsh spoke of how the centre will host a programme of events that will try to emphasise that “It’s not just about Connolly the Irish rebel, it’s as much about Connolly the trade unionist, the guy who organised the mill workers in Conway Street, the guy who went to the States and organised several trade unions there, who all take their lineage right back that far.” Séanna continued: “There will be a major educational element to the centre, we want schools, colleges, universities coming to see the project.“It’s ground-breaking the things we will have on display for the first time: an original Proclamation and also a half Proclamation which was actually produced by the British to use in evidence during the court martial.“Having the seven signatories at the bottom was all they needed, those along with the original printing blocks will be displayed for the first time ever together. “At the end of the day, the centre has to be Connolly in the round. Not the one-dimensional Connolly – the Irish rebel. It’s important to the legacy of the man this centre is seen as a resource by the trade unions right across the island.”Harry said that there is no doubt Áras Uí Chonghaile will become a key part of the city’s tourism trail. “We want to thank our funders Belfast City Council and the wide range of sponsoring trade unions from the States that have pledged and delivered key financial resources which haveallowed the centre to become a reality.” "},{"url":null,"title":"eu leaders offer uk brexit delay until may 22 after","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsLocal Elections NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday Guide March Spring EditionCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

There is no more that we can have.”I hope we can all agree that we are now at the moment of decision and I will make every effort to make sure we can leave with a deal and move our country forward.Theresa MayFacebookTwitterSpeaking at a Brussels press conference after the announcement Mrs May said: \"Firstly I welcome the Councils approval of the legally-binding assurances in relation to the Northern Ireland backstop, which I negotiated with President Juncker last week.\"This should give extra assurance to Parliament that in the unlikely event that the backstop is ever used it will only be temporary and that the UK and EU will begin work immediately to replace the backstop with alternative arrangements by the end of December .\"Mrs May saidParliament does not pass her deal next week the European Council will extend Article  to April  when the UK would have the choice of no deal or to put forward an alternative plan.She saidthis involved another extension then the country will have to take part in the European Parliament elections.Mrs May added: \"I believe strongly it would be wrong to ask people in the UK to participate in these elections three years after voting to leave the EU.\"Mrs May said she would be doing her utmost to ensure her deal was passed next week.\"What the decision today underlines is the importance of the House of Commons passing a Brexit deal next week so that we can bring an end to the uncertainty and leave in a smooth and orderly manner,\" she said.\"Tomorrow morning I will be ing to the UK and working hard to build support for getting the deal through.\"The so-called “flextension” plan was drawn up in a meeting stretching over eight hours at an EU summit in Brussels, as EU leaders wrangled over possible final cut-off dates for Brexit.The format increases pressure on Leave-backing MPs to row in behind Mrs May’s deal, for fear thatit falls the UK could find itself electing new MEPs and remaining for month or years within the EU.But it also creates a breathing space of a fortnightMrs May reaches the end of next week without securing agreement for her package – orSpeaker John Bercow prevents her from tabling a motion which he regards as a repeat of those already defeated by  votes in January and  votes last week.Parliament could use that time to try to take control of the process and force Mrs May towards a softer Brexit stance or second referendum.The bulk of the meeting took place behind closed doors in Mrs May’s absence, after her plea for a longer extension to June  fell on deaf ears.Mrs May had to leave the room after making her case in a -minute presentation to her European counterparts.The Prime Minister was reportedly pressed on what she will doMPs reject her deal for a third time but did not commit herself to a Plan B or rule out a no-deal Brexit."},{"url":null,"title":"alevel northern ireland school league table","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsLocal Elections NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday Guide March Spring EditionCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

We need that issue addressed by the Government and that’s what we are working towards.”Sir Jeffrey said the Government needed to translate “verbal commitments” on the issue into “law”.“Our priority is preserving the Union and getting an outcome that is economically good for Northern Ireland,” he added.“We do not want a no-deal outcome, that is not the preferred outcome of the DUP. It is not what the DUP is working towards.“We are working towards an agreement that we can support that delivers Brexit and is good for Northern Ireland and good for the United Kingdom as a whole.“What’s on the table at the moment is potentially harmful to Northern Ireland, which is why we want the legal assurances that we are seeking in relation to the backstop before we can commit to support this deal.“That is our objective – clear, simply and absolute.”However, Sinn Fein’s Stormont leader has said that Sinn Fein would reject any move to bolster the powers of the devolved administration in relation to the backstop’s operation.Michelle O’Neill made her party’s stance clear on Thursday.“There will not be any situation where there will be a veto handed to this Assembly,” she said.The British Government has already committed to giving Stormont a consultative role before a decision is made to either enter the backstop or extend the implementation period.And,the backstop does come into effect, the Stormont Assembly and Executive would be asked to consent to any new or amended EU laws applying to the region.Mrs O’Neill said: “Of course there can be a consultative role, that was set out in the Withdrawal Agreement as it stands, but there cannot be any veto afforded to the DUP or anybody  in this situation.”The European Council’s conclusions document, agreed by the EU leaders, warns that any unilateral commitment or statement should be compatible with the letter of the Withdrawal Agreement, meaning that any promises made by the Prime Minister to the DUP cannot undermine the backstop."},{"url":null,"title":"frampton print and chinese artwork among mlas donated treasure","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsLocal Elections NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday Guide March Spring EditionCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

While Catholic schools held all top  places in the A-level league table last year, this years results show one non-Catholic school - Friends School Lisburn - made the top .A-level school league table - check out the full list hereThe Quaker school moved up four places from last year to eighth place, with .% of pupils achieving three or more A-level A*-C grades.Read MoreStudents of all abilities have got to be nurturedProud principals say success is because teachers, pupils and parents are united The top-performing grammar school was St Louis Grammar School in Ballymena, a voluntary Catholic grammar where .% of pupils achieved three or more top grades.The best-performing non-grammar was St Brigids College in Londonderry, which came third overall with .% of pupils clinching three or more top grades.The co-educational Catholic maintained secondary school, where nearly % of pupils are entitled to free school meals, made a major leap up the table compared with last year, when it ranked joint rd.Principal of St Louis Grammar Sean Rafferty, whose school also topped last years league table, said he was \"delighted\".St Louis Grammar School’s principal Sean Rafferty\"Its down to the hard work of the young people, the guidance and direction of our staff and the support of parents to make those type of results a reality,\" he said.\"The consistency and the work ethic that the school has cultivated is very pleasing to make sure were not a one-hit wonder, and that year-on-year we can deliver for the young people and hopefully allow them to meet their career aspirations as a result.\"Mr Rafferty said there was \"no secret\" to the schools success, \"just hard work\".\"Its continuously looking at new teaching and learning strategies and implementing those, making sure that we treat every young person in a personalised way,\" he added.\"We see early intervention, areas of their development and academic progress that are not where they should be, and in a non-intimidatory way we try to make sure we make that young person have the self-belief that they can achieve.\"Reflecting on the faith-based ethos of the top  schools, Mr Rafferty said there is a \"certain essence to a faith-based education\".\"There is a sense of collegiate responsibility there that maybe doesnt exist in more secular models,\" he added.\"Its proven, tried and tested across the world that the faith-based models are the most successful, and I think theres something there that people have to take on board.\"Were not only successful academically, but I would argue that our success is in delivering a holistic education profile to young people so they are well equipped for the world of work, university or contribution to society.\"Mr Rafferty hit out at the pressures on school budgets here.\"I think there needs to be a root-and-branch reform of the way that schools are funded,\" he said.\"The results are fantastic and we have consolidated our position. This means that teachers are working twice as hard with less resources, and its just a very unfair playing field that educationalists are working in at the moment.\"Every year we seem to be asked to do more with less. Our government needs to look at how it can continue to expect high outcomes while putting in the minimum amount of money.\"St Dominics in west Belfast, a Catholic voluntary grammar school for girls, was second in the A-level league table with .% of pupils achieving three or more A*-C grades.Principal Carol McCann said their results \"reflect the hard work of the staff and the pupils\" and the partnership with parents.She said the school had \"great support from the community, and that students parents very much value the importance of getting a good education in a very competitive market for jobs\".\"There is a long tradition of doing your very best. The big focus in our school is on values, shared values, and doing what is right and the whole idea that they have a God-given talent and its up to them to make the best and for us to bring out the best in the children,\" she said.\"In our school we have a big focus on girl power, thatyou work hard enough you can be whatever you want to be.\"The Department of Education said that the information contained in the table relating to A-level results \"does not provide a valid basis for comparing performance between schools, since it takes no account of intakes of the schools or of any other factors that may affect pupil performance\".It added: \"No single measurement can constitute a fair or accurate evaluation of a school, and the figures should be considered in the context of other information about schools and their pupils.\"The Belfastobtained data from the Department of Education for A-levels sat in the   academic year and compiled the figures into easy-to-read tables, ordered top to bottom.

Ruth had put out a short video with no sound on Instagram at .am on Sunday and that was the last time she used her phone.\"But on that image there was a picture of a doorway to a small cottage across the road from the entrance to the pier and thats what triggered the whole search in the lough.\"Rachel said alarm bells went off when James Grfin- Ruths fiance and dad to their two sons Tylerand Oliverand a daughter, Lydia- got a call to say she hadnt come home on Saturday night.\"He knew there was something drastically wrong immediately,\" she said. data-dfpadtargeting, Lydiaand Oliver \", Lydiaand Oliver \" title\"Ruth and James with children Tyler , Lydiaand Oliver \" width\"\" \"\"  , Lydiaand Oliver \" title\"Ruth and James with children Tyler , Lydiaand Oliver \" width\"\" \"\"  Ruth and James with children Tyler , Lydiaand Oliver \"She hadnt rang anybody ...

plannersrsquo recommendation to refuse permission to develop Northern Irelandrsquos first woodland graveyard outside Downpatrick.The decision to allow those behind the controversial proposal for a -acre site at Loughmoney more time to provide additional information was taken at last weekrsquos meeting of Newry, Mourne and Down Councilsrsquo Planning Committee.Plans for the graveyard, which has split public opinion, were unveiled in September  by Down to Earth Ltd, which hosted a series of public consultation meetings to outline the detail of its proposal.Those behind the lsquogreen graveyardrsquo project, which would be sited off the Ballyculter Road and contain parking provision for  cars, say they are confident that the proposal would have a low environmental impact and offer an alternative to those seeking an environmentally-friendly approach to burial.They argue there are no designations that would preclude a development of this nature and that the proposal will enhance the location by creating and enhancing shared space, supporting good design and improving the built and natural environment.Supporters of the project also contend that the project will ldquopreserve restore and enhance ecosystems, turning an arable field into a nature reserve.In papers submitted ahead of last weekrsquos meeting, planners confirmed they had representations in support and opposition to the proposal, with the planned burial site having no headstones, with all burials recorded on a map.Signicantly, planners confirmed that while there can be no objections in principle to the proposal, those behind the project had not provided the requested additional information.They revealed that while extra time was allowed to comply with the request, no further extension was being afforded with the recommendation to refuse the application now being made.Planners added: ldquoWhile it is considered that the proposal will not create any unacceptable visual or residential impact due to its nature, it is considered further information is required for the consultees which also encompasses a number of concerns raised from interested parties.Planners confirmed Environment and Rivers Agencies are among those who still require further information to enable them to fully assess the planning application and provide detailed comment.Planners had described the information they required as ldquocrucial and pertinent to the application and that it was most unfortunate that it has not been provided.They said while there may be no objection in principle to the proposal ldquoit

Since then Exploris curator Peter Williams has kept a watchful eye over the  month-old old turtle.Mr Williams said: ldquoThe loggerhead turtle arrived at Exploris Aquarium in a critical condition from a beach near Rosbeg, Co Donegal.ldquoSince then we have been working tirelessly to slowly raise the turtlersquos temperature by a couple of degrees every day. Our veterinary team also decided to administer a course of antibiotics as an increase in temperature heightened the risk of a secondary infection setting in.He added: ldquoI am now happy to report that JC is making slow but great progress and is feeding well on a iety of fish and invertebrates. He is also receiving a gelatin diet, full of calcium, vitamins and minerals, which is important for the development of his shell.ldquoAs JC has taken well to rehabilitation we have decided that it is best for him to be moved to a larger space as he will have more room to swim and e.ldquoLuckily he has responded well to treatment and is currently settling in to his new home where visitors to the aquarium will be able to get a glimpse of the vulnerable species as he continues to recover.The future is looking bright for JC as the team at Exploris will continue to monitor his weight over the coming months.

There will also be a dedicated parking area for coaches.Original plans for the new hotel described finishing the exterior of the building in stone slate, with the accommodation centred around a landscaped courtyard. The proposed hotel development also includes plans to upgrade the Inch Abbey Road junction with the Belfast Road.Lidl submitted plans to secure outline planning permission to redevelop the . acre Shanslieve Drive site in January last year. It plans to bulldoze the existing school to pave the way for the construction of a new , square metre supermarket food store and dedicated centre for the volunteers who run the mountain rescue team.A new entrance via Bryansford Road is proposed, but there will be no access from Shanslieve Drive. The development proposal includes plans for almost  parking spaces, eight of which are reserved for mountain rescue team members.A new pedestrian crossing at the Bryansford Road junction with Shimna Road forms part of the proposal and while planners have received  objections, they have also received five letters in support of the proposal.In papers submitted ahead of last weekrsquos meeting, planners confirmed that none of the statutory consultees including the Department for Infrastructure, Rivers Agency, Environment Agency and the local environmental health department, had lodged any objections to the redevelopment of the former school site.They confirm that roads officials are content that the proposed development will not have any ldquoadverse impact on the existing road infrastructure and is acceptable in terms of road safety.Planners have insisted that the indicative designs of both the new store and mountain rescue centre would be inappropriate in this part of the resort.They say it is acknowledged that there are ldquoobvious restrictions for the redevelopment of the existing Lidl store in Railway Street and that there are no alternative vacant sites in the town centre which could accommodate the supermarketrsquos needs.The supermarket giant says it has been looking for alternative premises in Newcastle town centre for over a decade without success and that while properties have become available, none were suitable because they were too small..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Prenter goals just the ticket  ","story":"ST Patrickrsquos Grammar School produced a sizzling display to get the better of a resolute Cathair Dhoire side in a nailbiting showdown at the Athletic Grounds in Armagh on Monday.The Red High had to show great fortitude and tenacity in one of the most exciting and entertaining MacLarnon Cup finals in years as the Derry amalgamation threatened to ruin St Patrickrsquos day.The Downpatrick lads werenrsquot found wanting when the chips were down and two goals from man of the match Tim Prenter mdash one in each half mdash was the main dference between the sides.Prenter was a deserved recipient of the award as he continually stalked the Cathair Dhoire defence at every opportunity and had them chasing shadows every time he went near the ball.Loughinislandrsquos Brandon Boyd opened the scoring for the Red High after only  seconds. Club mate Peter McMullan fielded the resultant kick out and released Ronan Connor to make it - to - after less than a minutersquos play.However, Cathair Dhoire started pushing up on the Red High kick-outs and this proved an effective tactic with scores flowing from Cahir McMonagle, Fergal Mortimerand Ben McCarronto take a - to - lead after just five minutes of free-flowing football.It could have been even worse for St Patrickrsquos as Cathair Dhoire wasted two excellent goal chances with superb defending from Bryansfordrsquos Jack Harbinson denying McCarron with a timely block.The Red High started gaining possession in and around the middle of the park, but they definitely missed the ball winning ability of Saulrsquos Ruairi OrsquoHare in this sector, although he did start at full forward.OrsquoHare picked up an injury while playing for the Northern Ireland U- team in a Centenary Shield game against Wales on Thursday night, but his switch to leading his sidersquos attack worked a treat.With seven minutes of non-stop football gone Prenter, a senior county hurler, left three defenders trailing in his wake as he cut through the Cathair Dhoire cover before drilling the ball low and hard into the bottom corner of the net.Not a bad goal considering there was absolutely nothing on when the Downpatrick player received the ball out on the left flank.The Red High now had a grip on the game and OrsquoHare plundered the next five points for his side, two from frees, but Cathair Dhoire kept in touch with two points from McCarron, leaving the Downpatrick school with a - to - lead after  minutes.The Derry amalgamation sensed blood and towering midfielder Oran McGrath plucked the ball out of the air and ended a bustling run with an improvised finish to the net.Cathair Dhoire were far from finished and unanswered points from McCarron, McMonagle and Mortimer had the sides level after  minutes with all to play for.It could have been curtains for the Red High at this stage, but lsquokeeper Eoin Maginn saved his sidersquos bacon with two wonderful saves.Ruairi Quinn edged the Red High back in front just minutes after being introduced and the impressive OrsquoHare made it a - to - game  minutes.Prenter then finished Cathair Dhoire off with a second sensational goal. McMullan converted a late free after OrsquoHare had been sent off and McCarron grabbed the last score of the game for a battling Derry side.St Patrickrsquos: E Maginn, J Harbinson, E Rooney, L Guiness, P McMullan, R Murphy, B Boyd , C Watson, R OrsquoHare , T Smyth , O Cunningham, N Laverty, T Prenter , R Connor , T Savage.

That being the case, this council, like many others in Wales, is unable to continue to provide the level of subsidy to outdoor sports provision that it has in the past.ldquoExploring dferent ways of working, including the transfer of responsibilities in appropriate circumstances to community groups is a key element of the councilrsquos strategy moving forward as it addresses dficult budget priorities.ldquoFollowing the successful transfer of responsibilities for five libraries to community-based organisations and looking at a number of successful sports clubs across the Vale of Glamorgan who operate without any subsidy from the Council, it is hoped that the majority of clubs currently using council facilities will be able to continue to provide opportunities for all to participate in sports activities. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

The event ran from Saturday March  to Tuesday March .The Vale brewery Tomos and Lilford produced a special beer called ldquoCarnival - Penarth Pale Ale.Meanwhile the two Penarth butchers, Thompson Family Butchers and David Lush Butchers, both created their own special Penarth carnival sausages.The organisers estimated that more than  people took part in costume in the walk through town on Saturday, which saw the coronation of the lsquoFirst Foolrsquo at am. The procession marched from Sully Terrace through town.At .am in Penarth Library, there was a presentation of the head of Bendigeidfran, from The Mabinogion. The head was made by children from Cogan and Penygarth schools.The lsquoFirst Foolrsquo was then sent by train to the Tower of London to bring news of the Carnival to the traditional resting place of the head of Bendigeidfran, where he met the Raven Master.Long distance cyclist Dave Hann was due to cycle to Harlech, north Wales to raise money for the RNLI Penarth, and bring news to Harlech that Carnival had broken out in Penarth.Unfortunately Mr Hann only got as far as Cardigan before Storm Freya made it too dangerous to continue. Organisers have one barrel of carnival ale left and will take it to Harlech by train in the next few weeks to share it and the storybook of the carnival.On Sunday, two rugby teams took part in a ldquotug-o-sausage to decide which butcherrsquos sausage was better. Congratulations were extended to the winners, Team Thompson.Congratulations were also extended to the traders Ener-chi and Lilypad by the organisers, for having the best-dressed shop windows. Particular praise was singled out for the carnival flowers at Holm House Hotel created by Lilypad.Further nights of partying, songs and dancing were spotted in the Albion, St Faganrsquos Castle, and other pubs, bars and venues across Penarth. There were also celebrations on the Penarth Pier on Tuesday night following a Pancake Day event, while wandering bands of musicians like Wonderbrass kept spirits high.The festival culminated in a grand Mardis Gras party on Tuesday, which saw crowds of costumed residents dance the night away.Richard Parry, one of the carnival organisers, said: ldquoToday is Ash Wednesday, the beginning of Lent. Carnival finished last night on Mardi Gras.ldquoThanks to everyone who took part, contributed, encouraged, sponsored, smiled and partied, especially those people who took a carnival Bank Holiday Monday.ldquoIt was fabulous to hear your Carnival Bank Holiday stories, and to all those people who have had little private carnival moments of joy over the festival, thatrsquos what it has all been about.ldquoAnd some people have already said, lsquosee you next year!rsquoldquoThere were lots of people laughing and smiling on the sidelines, telling me they wanted to take part next year ndash just with a little more notice next time. But now itrsquos established, wersquoll be back next year and ready for even more people to join in the fun! article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

I recognise that there are a number of local and national groups advocating the introduction of such limits on a signicant scale across the Vale of Glamorgan, a number of whom I have personally met, however I am also aware that there are many residents in the Vale who are opposed to the concept.ldquoChanging the minimum speeds in many areas of the Vale from mph to mph as is being suggested by some groups, represents a major decision for this council and one which I feel requires input and guidance from our government due to the lack of evidence available of their success to date, the juxtaposition of our residents, the cost of their introduction, which is estimated at poundk for this council, and the fact that this is a Wales, or even, a UK wide issue.Cardf is the only council to introduce the reduced speed limit in most of its residential streets, compared with more than  in England.Anthony Slaughter, one of the founders of the lsquorsquos Plenty for Penarthrsquo campaign said: ldquoIt is disappointing to see the Vale council avoiding a decision on this vital issue. A Vale wide mph limit on all urban and residential roads would greatly increase the safety, health and well-being of residents. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentsSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a commentOrder byOldest firstNewest firstHighest scoredLowest scoredLoading comments...

I recognise that there are a number of local and national groups advocating the introduction of such limits on a signicant scale across the Vale of Glamorgan, a number of whom I have personally met, however I am also aware that there are many residents in the Vale who are opposed to the concept.ldquoChanging the minimum speeds in many areas of the Vale from mph to mph as is being suggested by some groups, represents a major decision for this council and one which I feel requires input and guidance from our government due to the lack of evidence available of their success to date, the juxtaposition of our residents, the cost of their introduction, which is estimated at poundk for this council, and the fact that this is a Wales, or even, a UK wide issue.Cardf is the only council to introduce the reduced speed limit in most of its residential streets, compared with more than  in England.Anthony Slaughter, one of the founders of the lsquorsquos Plenty for Penarthrsquo campaign said: ldquoIt is disappointing to see the Vale council avoiding a decision on this vital issue. A Vale wide mph limit on all urban and residential roads would greatly increase the safety, health and well-being of residents. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentsSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a commentOrder byOldest firstNewest firstHighest scoredLowest scoredLoading comments...

At the moment it is not very welcoming to pedestrians.ldquoI think it will go some way to transforming this gateway into Penarth and make it a safer environment.Previous plans to make part of Plassey Street one-way to incoming traffic, and removing the roundabout altogether, were dropped following opposition from the public.The committee agreed to endorse the transport scheme but requested regular updates on the wider transport plans for Penarth. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Believe it or not, itrsquos been far too long since wersquove had a debate on this issue in Parliament, and I spoke about the importance of our investments and pensions going into renewable sources, not into fossil fuels.I also pointed out my support for the young people across the UK who went on a climate strike the week before.

The PM was forced into a corner, forced to concede that she might have to rule out No Deal and extend Article , and the Labour Party came out decisively for putting this issue back to the people.And this week we saw the Government attempt to win over MPs with a fund it claims will boost less well-off towns after Brexit ndash but in another shambolic aspect to this hapless attempt to bribe MPs into voting for Theresa Mayrsquos so-called deal, there is no cash for Welsh towns.Another example of the Tories letting Wales down, and yet further reason to support the push for a final say on Brexit for the public through a Peoplersquos Vote. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Last month I met with constituents over disruption to local rail services. I know that many of you will have experienced delays and cancellations to services in the weeks following the handover of the Wales Rail Franchise. I understand and share the frustration that these delays have caused. There has been a shortage of rolling stock as a result of a large maintenance backlog following the handover of the franchise together with planned changes to rail services. This has led to a signicant reduction in services and replacement bus services. I have been in contact with the Minister for Transport and Transport for Wales to raise the concerns of constituents. I have been assured that service levels are now back to normal and they do not anticipate any restrictions to services in the coming year. I will of course maintain my interest to see that those assurances are kept. I will update residents again on future plans to deliver improved station facilities, trains and more regular services.As many of you are aware Cardf Bus has recently announced changes to bus services across Cardf and the Vale. A number of bus routes are at risk as part of these changes. The removal of bus links for work, social links and public services, including hospital routes, would have a signicant impact on my constituents.Cardf Bus are not acting to deliberately hurt our communities. Far from being an uncaring organisation Cardf Bus are stuck with a legal framework that stops them from operating on the same basis as commercial competitors. Competitors can cherry pick and target single profitable routes that undermine the wider social propose that most of us want from local bus services. Cardf Councilrsquos Labour leadership has committed to supporting at risk bus services for  years. Unless the Conservative leadership of the Vale Council agrees to Labour councillors amendments to the budget and protects local bus services in the Vale then bus routes will go. The Vale Council leadership could and should act. If they donrsquot then my constituents will suffer.In future, the regulation of buses is the answer. London was the only part of the UK that was allowed to keep a regulated bus service. It is no mistake that it has the best and most coherent service. We now have the legislative powers to regulate bus services here in Wales. The Welsh Government is currently consulting on proposals to reform bus and taxi services in Wales. More information on the consultation can be found at: https:beta.gov.wales improving-public-transport.

Improvements to public transport and cycling and walking routes are also being considered.The council says it needs to engage with Network Rail to understand the potential costs around building the bypass near a railway tunnel, model improvements to the Merrie Harrier junction, and undertake a public consultation.The council is asking the Welsh Government for pound, to complete theWelltag outline business case butthat funding isnrsquot given the authority would find the money.Emma Reed, the councilrsquos head of neighbourhood services and transport, said at a council meeting on March  that a -week consultation could be launched before the summer break in August.Mrs Reed told the Environment and Regeneration Scrutiny Committee: ldquoWe have made great progress on this project over the last couple of years.ldquoWe still need to do this additional work. I donrsquot have any good news in terms of Welsh Government funding for this.ldquoIrsquove put a number of bids in. Irsquove recently had money for junction  of the M but I donrsquot have additional fundingfor this.Rod Harrod, chairman of the Dinas Powys Bypass Steering Group, said the bypass plans are ldquomore advanced now than at any time in the last  or even  years.Mr Harrod said improvements to the Merrie Harrier junction would benefit staff, patients, and visitors at Llandough Hospital.Councillors said there could be some competition for Welsh Government funding for the bypass from the proposed works on junction  of the M.Cllr Andrew Robertson, who represents Dinas Powys, said he couldnrsquot understand why there had to be competition for funding with the M scheme.ldquoIf the traffic situation in Dinas Powys is resolved it would benefit every community across the South Wales, Vale of Glamorgan corridor, Cllr Robertson said.Cllr Gwyn John urged the campaign to keep going despite the delays.He said: ldquoI can appreciate how frustrated people involved are with the delays.ldquo[The bypass] is a must. With all the development we have got across the Vale of Glamorgan itrsquos chocka-block. Itrsquos getting worse.ldquoDonrsquot give up, get stuck in.

The seniors school can be found on Hickman Road, the juniors and nursery a short distance on in Victoria Road.School facilities include a full gym, a library, an IT suite, a sports hall, science laboratories, and nearby access to local sports facilities including athletics track, Penarth RFCrsquos rugby pitch and the International Sports Village in Cardf Bay.Traditionally the school was strictly boys only.

He was animated and passionate, and had clearly forged a close bond with his teacher.The head of Westbourne Prep School, Joanne Chinnock, said: ldquoOur school is a happy place, and wersquove long held the philosophy happy children learn well.       ,params: .pushldquoOur lsquosecretrsquo is the very close bond between the children, from Nursery and Reception classes all the way to the top of the school and the staff, who know each child very well indeed.There are a huge number of after school clubs on offer. Children have the opportunity to learn a wide range of instruments, including the harp, trumpet, piano, violin, drums, guitar and organ.A large set of sports clubs stake full advantage of the the Welsh coast, with frequent use of Penarth Pier, the beach and natural beauty spot Cosmeston Lakes. Sports on offer include swimming, yoga, basketball, touch rugby, dodge ball, gymnastics, cross country, and football.There are even more opportunities to excel in other areas, with offerings including Young Journalists, Nature Club, Art Club, Chess and ldquoMad Science.Westbourne offers the InternationalDiploma Programme in sixth form and GCSEs and IGCSEs for its secondary pupils.Their IB average is - points, high enough to qualy for Oxford University, with two-thirds of all Higher Level grades being s and s, and two-thirds of students receiving a Bilingual Diploma.The GCSE results are equally impressive with  per cent of all grades being s and s per cent the new, harder, grade  and a further  per cent grade s.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

The Department of the Economy’s Strategic Energy Framework, which was endorsed by the Executive in , has over the last nine years, led to some very positive changes to the energy generation and supply mix, particularly from renewable sources.However the  year framework is nearing its end and needs to be replaced. The Department is making such preparations as it can on a draft Strategic Energy Framework across the areas of heat, electricity, transport and energy efficiency which it aims to make public some time in the spring. Whether or not this region has its Assembly back to adopt such a framework will remain to be seen, but in the meantime it will ensure the subject remains live and high on the agenda.Brexit and I-SEMThe new wholesale electricity market known as the Integrated Single Electricity Marketwent live on October , . It is designed to deliver increased levels of competition which, it is hoped, will help put downward pressure on prices as well as encouraging greater levels of security of supply and transparency. While the island of Ireland is now integrated more closely with European markets, there is a risk that Brexit could halt this integration. British and Irish business groups and energy trade associations such as the CBI, IBEC, Electricity Association of Ireland, RenewableUK, British Irish Chamber of Commerce and EnergyUK all refer to the delivery of I-SEM, or to the UK’s continued access to the IEM, as post-Brexit priorities for security of supply and or consumer protection. I-SEM is clearly a priority that must be preserved.While Brexit may present challenges and continuing uncertainty, there are certainly opportunities for investment and acquisition in the electricity market as more complex, specialist expertise will be required to effectively trade power on the I-SEM. Policy barriers or inaction cannot be allowed to prevent I-SEM from realising its potential of fully integrating the market by efficiently moving energy from producer to demand.Renewable incentive schemesDespite being on track to hit its target of % of electricity generation from renewables, Northern Ireland risks being left behind. The lack of a replacement for the development support mechanism, Renewables Obligations Certicateafter its closure in April , means Northern Ireland is lagging behind Great Britain which has established the Contract for Dference regime and Ireland, which has started work on its Renewable Electricity Support Scheme . While neither scheme is perfect, doing nothing is not an option. The devolution of energy presented Northern Ireland with the opportunity to shape its own policy but without a government, will the sector and the infrastructure be able to remain fit for purpose GasWith its development over the last  years, the gas network in Northern Ireland, with its low population density, must be seen as a success story. Consumers and businesses have been offered greater choice in terms of price and security of supply. Nevertheless there are certainly further opportunities for gas distributors and suppliers to expand the natural gas network, particularly in the west of the country and east Co Down. So despite the apparent obstacles and challenges, there is opportunity for development and progress in Northern Ireland’s energy sector. The benefits for Northern Ireland will be in terms of security of supply, price and environmental sustainability. Cleaver Fulton Rankin,  Bedford Street, Belfast BT FW.

Since I took on the Northern Ireland role six years ago, we’ve doubled the workforce, become the fastest-growing UK region and are now the biggest office outside London with just over , people,” he says. “Our strategy was to be the leading provider of professional services in the Northern Ireland market but there’s no way we’d be the size we are now had we only focused on that.”Instead Paul built on the legacy of his predecessors and accelerated growth in new, technology solutions, while retaining the traditional accounting, tax and consulting services. Today PwC remains the leading provider of advisory services to the region’s family-owned and owner-managed businesses and multinationals, but has also built an impressive portfolio of cutting-edge technologies, opened the door to signicant export markets and is tackling some of society’s most challenging issues. “We’ve grown in many new areas – blockchain, cyber, cloud-based accounting services – but the single biggest impact has come from developing our distinctive ‘Operate’ ision,” Paul says. ”Operate is our service delivery business, which supports and delivers technology and people solutions to large, often regulated organisations. So instead of just advising clients how to solve their problems, we now do the heavy lting for them.”Run by Ian McConnell, a partner who’s been with the firm for  years, Operate is already attracting global attention. “Clients increasingly don’t want a consulting firm just to tell them what to do: they want a problem-solving partnership.” he says. “In its first year of operation, Operate earned over £m, now has , people and is still growing.”Reinforcing Paul’s confidence to invest in Northern Ireland as a strategic location is a  forecast from TheCityUK that it could become the second fastest-growing financial services region outside London by , helping deliver £bn of additional gross value-addedto the UK economy. But that depends on the ability to recruit the right talent, and he says the challenge now is finding and retaining the skills.That’s an issue that particularly concerns Paul as he looks ahead at the economic picture with Brexit and lack of an Assembly to the fore.“The business community wants clarity and certainty. Ideally we want to see a Brexit withdrawal agreement that then gives the scope for a trade deal that offers Northern Ireland the capacity to trade both with the EU and as part of the UK. The potential competitive advantages and ability to attract investment would be terric and the kind of economic accelerator which we have sought for years, but never managed to gain.“However I do worry about the impact of political stalemate on our long term future. Failure to invest, particularly in education and skills, will impair our competitiveness and make this a less attractive place for business.The decreasing effectiveness of health, environment and infrastructure will mean that talented people will opt to make choices to live their lives where.“In my national role, I see other parts of the country fusing partnerships in innovative and exciting ways between business,education and government. Compared to that, we are already getting left behind. We should be moving forward.”Which brings us to Merchant Square, the £m, , sq ft office development which PwC takes over in . “We have great people and one reason why we’re moving to the city centre is because that’s where they want to be. By the time we’re ready to relocate towards the end of , we will have at least , people moving in to the heart of Belfast.“That makes it important for Belfast too and not just because it’s the city’s biggest-ever private sector office deal. As we were making our decision, the whole Bank Buildings issue was at its height, and we wanted to show our support for the city and its future.” The Merchant Square relocation project is led by Kieragh Nelson, a director who joined the firm in . “We’ve got serious ambitions for Merchant Square,” she says. ”There’s a sense of ‘OK, we’ve just opened flagship offices in London, and Manchester – what more can we do in Belfast how can we make it even better ’ And the vast majority of decisions on how it will look, feel and work are made by the team here. Our goal is to create the most technologically-advanced, innovative and collaborative space for ourselves, our clients, and also for the communities around us.”Doing the right thing is a maxim often repeated in PwC, but it gets backed up. On the morning of our interview, a large group of people from the firm, including Paul, took part in one of their regular ‘Darkness Into Light’ walks to raise awareness of mental health. The firm’s commitment to social mobility has seen a number of employment programmes launched, notably the UK’s first technology degree apprenticeships, with Queen’s University one of five universities selected to run the programme. And it’s expanding its Hive Academy programme, which delivers free technology education to primary and secondary schools, to the Channel Islands.This year the firm challenged itself and created a unique charity partnership – the PwC Challenge – to create innovative suicide prevention programmes.“Our purpose is to build trust in society and solve important problems, and it really does feature in how we look at what we do. We strive to celebrate and share our knowledge widely and unselfishly with our people and communities and not be afraid to take a stand and do the right thing. And we put it at the heart of what we do every day. “Take the PwC Challenge: more people in Northern Ireland have died by suicide since the signing of the Good Friday Agreement than from the violence in the years before. This is a crisis, and it’s one which affects our people, and our communities. So we asked local charities in north and west Belfast, the worst affected areas in the UK, to collaborate and devise really innovative approaches programmes to give opportunities to young people and their families through education, technology, sports, and mental health coaching.“As well as the clubs in PwC which fundraise every year for the challenge, our own people are volunteering every week in ious projects – particularly with our Hive Academy. We want to ensure that people, who are high achievers in many dferent fields, are supported to play their fullest part in society.” For Paul, it’s all about the people. Last year PwC invested around £m on staff development here, and this year, a number of people have begun the first Masters in Operation service delivery, run by Ulster University. “It’s important to support people to develop their careers in ways they mightn’t have considered when they joined. That’s a key building block of our purpose – it drives social mobility, equality and ersity.“It’s true thatsomeone decides they want to head off and join PwC Australia or New York, they can. That’s the beauty of working for a global firm – those opportunities are there. But what I really want to make sure is that you don’t have to leave:you want to live and work in Belfast, and have global clients, work with cutting-edge technology and be part of a firm that’s engaged in society, you can do that too.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/eopen_1.jpg","title":"the open its the biggest thing since sliced bread","story":"Posted on Wednesday March  by Ulster Business With just  weeks until Northern Ireland hosts the biggest sporting event in its history, John Mulgrew speaks to the bosses tasked with organising the legendary Open Championship We’ve come a long way in just a short few years. Despite its huge golfing credentials, especially in the modern game, it had been more than  years since Northern Ireland played host to the Irish Open.That all changed in , when it ed north to Royal Portrush. And that, buoyed on a refreshed and renewed interest in both the tournament, and the sport itself.Now, in  weeks, that same links course will see more than , people flock to arguably the world’s greatest golf tournament and the largest sporting event ever hosted on these shores – The Open – transforming a small Co Antrim town for a handful of summer days.“There is a buzz with everyone at the RA,” Johnnie Cole-Hamilton tells Ulster Business. He’s executive director of championships at the RA – the ruling authority of golf throughout the world, aside from areas such as the US, and organisation responsible for organising The Open.“This will be my th Open Championship, and one reason I continue to be involved is that it’s a challenge every time.”It will see Irish golfing greats, including Open winners Rory McIlroy and Darren Clarke, Graeme McDowelland Padraig Harrington – among others – join the biggest name in sport, Tiger Woods.“One of big drivers to ing to Royal Portrush was the success of the Northern Irish and Irish golfers. They have raised the profile of golf immeasurably. “We are absolutely delighted with the response so far – % of tickets sold in  hours, and sold out within a record-breaking eight weeks.”Johnnie says the decision to choose Portrush, bringing it back to the course after a  year hiatus, was the correct one – buoyed by the support from the community, agencies and organisations. The th Open will be held at Royal Portrush from July -.“In my career, we had a similar scenario, ing to Liverpool for the first time in  years, and we had a very similar response. It ed in , and now Royal Liverpool is firmly on the rota, and I hope that Royal Portrush is similar.”Of course, aside from the golf, both the short-term and long-term economic benefits will trickle down and benefit, not on the surrounding areas, but prop Northern Ireland up on yet another global .According to Tourism NI chief executive John McGrillen that longer-term benefit could be worth up to £m for the wider economy.“There will be , tickets sold for championship days, and % of those sold to people out of state, outside Northern Ireland,” he tells Ulster Business.“It allows us to present an extremely positive image for Northern Ireland, and into key markets across the globe. We will never have experienced the opportunity to provide such a positive image of Northern Ireland. Despite what we might think, there are perception issues.“Northern Ireland has a normalised society and some of the most dramatic golf courses, scenery and landscape to see.“More specically, the fact that the Open will have been here, as one of the world’s top golf courses, will drive up the amount of spend, especially from golf tourism.”That alone makes up around % of Northern Ireland’s tourism intake. John says he wants that to grow to £m by . He says golfing visitors spend around four times that of an average tourist.Johnnie says all signs so far suggest that the Open in Portrush is “going to be an enormous” success. But the process hasn’t come without its challenges – namely theIrish Sea.“This is the first Open Championship we have hosted in my time, in which we have a body of water between our base and our contractor base. There’s getting things across water, and an enormous amount of work on the golf course – new holes, a new road system around the course and a tunnel for the players from one of the new greens to tee. You can’t do that without support from the golf club“The members have been hugely supportive, turning the course upside down, but maintaining integrity and enhancing .”He said, along with the blue light services, local authorities, council and tourism groups, the community in and around Portrush “understands that this will bring great benefits” to the area and Northern Ireland as a whole. “You can overcome dficulties with support,” he says.“Royal Portrush has never had more than , people drive to it, or get the train to it, at the same time. It’s a challenge to make sure we deliver a wonderful Open Championship and a spectator experience.”John McGrillen says the triumph in landing the Open itself was down to the success of the Irish Open in the last few years. “You had more than , people turning out at Portrush… visitor numbers had been dwindling.“That allows us to demonstrate that the course can deal with that many people. Everyoneworked very well, collectively, and that gave confidence to the RA that we would have the capacity to deliver it. The risk factors they had were eliminated because of the success of the Irish Open, and that was very critical.”As for boosting many of the hundreds of businesses in and around the area, John said: “It will do, as it’s showing off Northern Ireland… we have seen a big boost in the number of Americans playing golf. We don’t have to wait until after the event. “The visibility the Irish Open has given us. We have Royal County Down, Royal Portrush and Portstewart – that’s increased signicantly. It’s not just those courses which are benefiting – it’s being spread. People will typically stay in Belfast and travel around.”For John, the best outcome is, of course, an Irish winner. Oh, and clear skies. “A local winner would be phenomenal. It would be fantastic to see Rory win, or Tiger Woods.“If Tiger Woods won the Open in Portrush, that would remain in peoples’ memories forever. While we would love Rory or other locals to win, I would not be disappointed in Tiger winning it.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/west.jpg","title":"major ni firms in eleventh hour westminster plea to avoid no deal brexit","story":"Posted on Friday March  by John Mulgrew More than  of Northern Ireland’s biggest businesses – employing tens of thousands of workers here – have written to MPs in an eleventh hour plea to avoid a ‘no deal’ Brexit.

It says that “local businesses believe that the failure to approve a deal with Europe on the UK’s withdrawal from the EU will have signicant repercussions for the local economy\". “Such a scenario will both hinder indigenous and foreign direct investment, it would result in signicant job losses and will stle opportunities for the next generation across Northern Ireland.  “We therefore urge MPs across the UK to consider the damaging impact on Northern Ireland’s economy and political stability in the event of a no-deal Brexit.  “The peace and economic progress that flowed from the Belfast  Good Friday Agreement cannot be overlooked at this critical time in the UK’s history.

For some there will be little or no change to their daily lives after the UK leaves the EU. But for others, Brexit may have an impact on some aspects of their day-to-day lives. To provide as much practical information for people across Northern Ireland that is currently available, a Brexit section has been created on the nidirect website. Useful public information is being published on www.nidirect.gov.uk brexit on a regular basis. You may have also seen some of the digital advertisements across Northern Ireland or on your social media channels asking you to visit the nidirect website for the most up to date information. The nidirect Brexit section also points to information being published by the UK Government to give people as much information as possible. At this stage, it won’t answer every question that people will have. But it serves as a useful tool to get people to start thinking about what they may need to do dferently once the UK leaves the EU. Included in the www.nidirect.gov.uk brexit is a section on travelling, which includes the most up to date information for motorists.
