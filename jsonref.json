For one whole year I was presented as a hermit hiding in Mexico but obviously I made a mistake and it all went wrong.I spoke to them both and I apologised.

I don’t have to, that’s my daughter.\u0027He also spoke about Meghan\u0027s upbringing, and how he and his ex-wife Doria were determined to not let their break-up affect their child.He said: \u0027We didn\u0027t express anger towards each other so she never felt that.

Pictured: Damage to the plane          Warning lights flashed up in the cockpit and the autopilot disconnected, forcing captain Kevin Sullivan, a former US Navy fighter pilot, to take control. Pictured: Damage to the planeThe system was telling him the A330 was in stall and overspeed at the same time - but this is impossible so Sullivan knew there was something seriously wrong. Then the plane suddenly noseed 200 metres in 20 seconds on its own accord, causing 315 passengers and crew to scream in panic. Anyone not buckled in was slammed into the ceiling of the plane. Several suffered broken bones and flight attendant Fuzzy Maiava, who was microwaving food, was knocked out. In an new episode of Air Crash Investigation on Foxtel\u0027s National Geographic channel, Sullivan has explained how he guided the plane to an emergency landing at Learmonth Airport and saved hundreds of lives.          This map shows the journey of plane and where the two nosees occurred before the landing          While the plane was plummeting, Sullivan pulled the control stick to stop the descent but nothing happened.

The 73-year-old (pictured on GMB) described his sorrow about pulling out just three days before he was due to walk his daughter down the aisle because of heart surgery and admitted he was jealous but grateful that Prince Charles stepped inBut after my lengthy interview with him today, conducted with my GMB co-host Susanna Reid, I’ve changed my mind about this rather shy, gentle man whose life was irrevocably changed forever when Meghan fell in love with Harry.First, he fully acknowledged his own reckless stupidity in staging those pictures.‘I realize it was a serious mistake,’ he said. ‘It’s hard to take it back.’Second, it’s almost impossible to comprehend the tsunami of attention that cascaded on the poor guy’s head from the second the engagement was formally announced.His account of how he discovered the identity of Meghan’s new man was both comical and endearing: ‘The first phone calls were, “Daddy, I have a new boyfriend.” And I said, “That’s really nice.” And the next call was like, “He’s British,” and I said, ‘That’s really nice.” And eventually the third time around was like, “He’s a prince.” And at that point, she said, ‘It’s Harry.” And I said, ‘Oh, Harry, OK!’    Markle fully acknowledged his own reckless stupidity in staging pictures in an internet cafeFor a man eking out a quiet retirement of considerable solitude in a remote part of Mexico, this would prove to be a spectacularly inconvenient revelation, though he is far too proud of his daughter to admit it.To their shame, senior Palace officials didn’t immediately put someone on a plane to take care of Thomas Markle.One burly, wily ex Household Cavalry guard sitting outside Mr Markle’s front door all day - and none of the chaos that followed may have happened. Or why not just fly him to London a month early – it’s not like Kensington Palace doesn’t have enough bedrooms?Surely both Harry and Meghan must have known he’d be subjected to intense media scrutiny? Yet they did nothing to help him, leaving the former Hollywood lighting director to face the cameras himself for the first time like the proverbial rabbit in headlights.  Mr Markle revealed that his daughter (pictured together above) cried when he told her that he wasn\u0027t coming to London          Harry and his bride are seen on their wedding day as they leave St George\u0027s Chapel in Windsor CastleI still find this failure to protect him incomprehensible, just as I find it weird that Meghan’s mother Doria had to go to the wedding entirely alone, that Harry STILL hasn’t met his father-in-law, that Meghan STILL hasn’t visited her father since his heart attack, and that Prince Charles has had NO contact with Thomas Markle despite taking his daughter down the aisle.But hey, all families are a bit weird – right?I believe Thomas when he says his motivation to do the staged photos was more about improving his dishevelled image than money.(Just as I believe his motivation for appearing on Good Morning Britain today for his first ever TV interview was more about setting the record straight than the relatively small fee we paid him.)There had been a steady flow of pictures of him looking like an overweight, unshaven, beer-swilling vagrant. Who wouldn’t be tempted to try to create a more positive ‘look’ for themselves in the run-up to starring in the biggest wedding of the year?I also believe him when he says he only wants the best for Meghan and Harry. Thomas Markle strikes me as a man who genuinely loves his daughter, and thinks Harry’s the really lucky one to have landed his ‘little Princess’.Marks \u0026 Meghan!

Thomas Markle said he was \u0027honoured\u0027 that the Prince of Wales took on the job of walking Meghan down the aisle insteadNone of us is perfect, and none of us would survive such intense scrutiny unscathed or without doing a few silly things along the way.I don’t doubt Thomas’s sincerity when he says he did what he thought was the right thing at the time.It wasn’t, and as he freely admits now, he’ll now have to live with that for the rest of his life.But any man who, as Thomas Markle does, travels to Los Angeles each year to place flowers on his ex wife Doria’s doorstep on Mother’s Day is not a bad man.In fact, after today’s interview, I’ve come to the conclusion he’s a thoroughly honourable, decent man who is understandably struggling to make sense of a crazy new existence that was entirely of someone else’s making - albeit someone he loves very dearly.He’s also having to do it with barely any support.I congratulate him on his courageous candour today, and wish him well with his recovery.As for his future as a royal father-in-law, I simply say this: good luck Thomas – you’ll need it!"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/18/14/4D5C0CF100000578-0-image-a-10_1529329982999.jpg","title":"Prince Charles joins Queen annual Garter Day service Windsor Castle","story":"Share this articleLook charming in prints like Sophie in a dress by Emilia WicksteadShop the current collection at MATCHESFASHION.COMIt\u0026#39s been a busy few months for the Royal Family.

She has been working at the Department for Education for eight months.In April 2016, Miss McDermott posted a picture of herself inside No 10 on Instagram, captioned: ‘My office for the day. My job is better than yours.’The former model, who lives with her parents in Essex, attended The Coopers’ Company and Coborn School, a well-performing academy in Upminster, east London, and gained two As and a B at A-level.Arriving on the ITV2 show in Majorca, she told her fellow contestants she ‘works in the government’.          The former model, who lives with her parents in Essex, attended The Coopers’ Company and Coborn School, a well-performing academy in Upminster, east London, and gained two As and a B at A-levelWhen asked if she was responsible for making laws, she replied ‘yeah, in essence’. She is appearing on the show after being granted an unpaid career break by the DfE in line with civil service rules, which state civil servants can have a career break of between three months and two years.It is thought DfE bosses might not necessarily have known she wanted the break in order to appear on Love Island.While the show’s controversial nature may raise eyebrows among Miss McDermott’s employers, her mother Karen insisted she was proud of her. Speaking about her ‘very academic’ daughter, Mrs McDermott, 56, added: ‘We’re behind her 100 per cent. She obviously spoke to us when she was first talking to the show and said she wouldn’t do it if we didn’t want her to.‘We told her to enjoy it and have the best experience of her life. We hope she finds her man.’ She said daughter ‘loves her job’ and is ‘passionate about making a difference’. All civil servants must uphold the civil service code – which says workers must show integrity and professionalism while away from government – while on a career break. If these terms were broken, human resources would be notified and would launch an investigation.However, workers who keep to the terms may return to work as normal. "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/18/21/4D633CF600000578-0-image-a-14_1529355138016.jpg","title":"Now thats royal tea party Meghan Markels dress Queens hat Eugenies frock","story":"    Say cheese, Ma\u0027am: The Queen wears a hat to match a Wedgwood cheddar dish at the polo on Sunday¿I¿ve changed my mind about Meghan¿s dad ¿ he¿s just a shy,...Share this article    Don\u0027t put it in the dishwasher: Meghan in her plate pattern dress at a wedding on Saturday          Spot the inspiration: Kate channels the Polka Dot china collection by Royal Vale          Someone\u0027s blossoming: Pregnant Pippa plumped for the delicate look of a flowery teacup at the Royal Wedding          Saucer sorcery: Camilla\u0027s jacket at yesterday\u0027s Order of the Garter Service nods to the Royal Albert Black Diamond pattern          I\u0027m a little teapot: Princess Eugenie\u0027s poppy outfit is as chintzy as this pot          Roses are red...

Mr Markle (pictured with his daughter) exposed some of his daughter Meghan and Prince Harry\u0027s most intimate secrets          In his interview on ITV\u0027s Good Morning Britain, Mr Markle spoke of his telephone conversations with Harry to Piers Morgan and Susanna Reid (pictured)Four weeks ago, old royal hands were left wondering why more effort hadn\u0027t been taken to ensure that Meghan\u0027s father was properly brought into his daughter\u0027s new world.Instead, aides were left floundering when it emerged that Mr Markle had foolishly participated in the staging of paparazzi pictures. The irony was that this act of invading his own privacy came at the very time Kensington Palace was sending strict warnings to the media not to harass him.It was hard to escape the conclusion that royal advisers had failed to realise that this lonely man — who lives in a run-down, Mexican border town — would struggle to deal with the enormity of his daughter marrying into the Royal Family.Why, they were asked, hadn\u0027t Mr Markle been helped? A consular official from the British embassy in Mexico City could have been sent up to brief him or even one of Prince Charles\u0027s more experienced aides flown out to acclimatise him.Yesterday, as they did a month ago, sources murmured that offers of assistance had been made to the former TV lighting director. Aides were reluctant to say more, but many thought that as soon as the wedding was over steps would have been taken to ensure Mr Markle felt he was part of the family.          Meghan Markle\u0027s mother Doria Ragland (left, with Prince Charles and Camilla) received the warmest of welcomes when she flew in from her LA home for the weddingThis might mean a new home, paid for by his wealthy son-in-law, and with an income to support himself and where he would have no need to give interviews for cash. At the very least one might have expected the newly-weds to have visited him by now – or arranged for him to visit them. His treatment – or rather a lack of it – contrasts wildly with that extended to his ex-wife and Meghan\u0027s mother, Doria Ragland. RICHARD KAY: Bouquet of her favourite forget-me-nots, flash of her dazzling aquamarine ring but most tantalising of all... was empty seat at the royal wedding REALLY for Diana?The boyfriend Meghan would rather forget: How a 22-year-old Miss Markle dated an award winning PORN STAR among a host of other young suitorsHow Prince Louis is named after a colossus of the empire cruelly cut down by the IRA who was implicated in a military plot to overthrow Labour PM Harold Wilson and whose wife was a voracious sexual adventurousRICHARD KAY: Charles still hasn’t seen the newborn prince because he has a difficult relationship with William RICHARD KAY asks the tantalising question: Will Kate copy the Queen with baby No 4? RICHARD KAY: The touching rituals that reveal just how much the Queen loved her corgis...they\u0027re buried at her favourite homes, each with a headstone on which she leaves posies of flowers.

Thomas Markle, thus far, seems to be excluded from it. One can only imagine how frustrating this must be for Prince Harry. Determined to protect his wife in the way he was never able to protect his late mother, Diana, the response of the Palace to Meghan\u0027s father has fallen short.Of one thing we can be sure: he will not be overly embarrassed that his views on Trump and the EU have emerged. One figure who has known the prince since he was a boy, says: \u0027You could say he handled a tricky conversation well. When asked about Brexit he was trying to be non-committal and on Trump he didn\u0027t want to be rude.\u0027A less generous view was being taken elsewhere however. As a young man whose experiences of America come from his time training with the US military and that ill-fated trip to Las Vegas, he might be disposed to thinking positively about Trump.Indeed the royals have followed Trump\u0027s rise closely. At a charity lunch before the 2016 US election, Prince Charles asked an American sitting next to him what Trump was like.          Mr Markle\u0027s assertions about Harry\u0027s views on Donald Trump and Brexit were explosive          Ever since Trump (pictured) became US President, the royals have been scrupulous to avoid revealing any views on the matterThe guest later admitted she was flustered because she didn\u0027t think royals talked about political figures. Perhaps this accounts for the sympathy that exists at Clarence House for this latest imbroglio involving Meghan\u0027s father.\u0027Prince Charles and Camilla like Meghan enormously, but they do feel that the team around her and Harry is rather inexperienced,\u0027 says an insider.Others, though, feel that the duchess herself could have done more to avoid difficulties. It is worth recalling that according to Meghan\u0027s biographer Andrew Morton, the former actress has long become used to compartmentalising her life.When success with TV series Suits arrived, she purged many childhood friends. Some might argue she has done the same with her close family. Her mother, after all, was the solitary representative of blood relatives at her daughter\u0027s wedding. Inevitably, those around the royals were comparing Mr Markle with another royal-in-law, the Duchess of Cambridge\u0027s father Michael Middleton.He has only ever spoken once – and then under strict Palace control – when his daughter became engaged to Prince William. In the near eight years since, he has said nothing.Sadly – with a little more due diligence – this Markle debacle Part 2 might have been wholly avoided. "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/18/22/4D63436200000578-0-image-m-37_1529358371049.jpg","title":"Members orgasmic meditation group claim left deeply debt told sleep clients","story":"    Founder: OneTaste was founded in 2004 by Nicole Daedone (above) and promotes wellness through orgasmic meditation          The act: Members who lived in the group\u0027s communal homes would be stimulated three times a day for 15 minutes each time former members told Bloomberg (a scene of orgasmic meditation from the film Sleeping With Friends)OneTaste students currently pay $499 for a weekend course, $4,000 for a retreat, $12,000 for a spot in the coaching program, and $16,000 for intensives, with an all-inclusive option also offered for $60,000. Nicole Daedone, 50, who founded the company in 2004, stepped away from teaching classes for OneTaste recently. According to 2013 Gawker story, she was introduced at one event as the \u0027Jimi Hendrix of stroking.\u0027She did not comment on the article.  OneTaste has been featured everywhere fromThe New York Times to GOOP, which had an interview with Daedone.She revealed she almost chose to become a celibate Buddhist in that interview before extolling the virtues of her program. \u0027Legends never die\u0027: Asia Argento poses with daughter Anna...Sleeping with the fishes: Ex-wife of Bill Gross says...EXCLUSIVE: Vanessa Trump gets new orce lawyers after she...\u0027Baby Hitler\u0027: Rosie O\u0027Donnell lashes out at Trump adviser...Share this article\u0027OM changes the way we respond to sensation it changes our brain.

It taught employees to work for free or cheap to show devotion.

In OneTaste, I’d done that again and again and again.\u0027Michael also detailed life at the OM house when she was working as a sales person.\u0027Every morning at around 7 a.m., staff convened for two rounds of OM, switching partners midway. Then came an AA-inspired fear inventory, writing out and sharing their worries with a partner,\u0027 reports Bloomberg.\u0027Former staffers say they were encouraged to report to management if they heard others express doubts about OneTaste. They all went to Bikram yoga, cooked, cleaned, then spent several hours making sales calls around a table, tracking their progress with Salesforce.com.

The rest of the things were just be careful.\u0027But they were very emphatic about not giving any information to the press or talking to them, because it just encourages them more. So none the less, that\u0027s what I tried to do.\u0027Despite these conversations however, allegations later surfaced that he had staged photographs with the paparazzi.Footage obtained by The Mail on Sunday showed the 73-year-old former lighting director arriving at an internet cafe with photographer Jeff Rayner.‘It was presented to me as a chance to change my image because for the last year photographs of me were always derogatory,’ he told Piers Morgan and Susanna Reid.‘They would take pictures of me with my hand on a beer, taking the bins out, buying a toilet and making a big deal of it and it all made me look negative.‘I didn’t do it for money, I did it to change my image. For one whole year I was presented as a hermit hiding in Mexico but obviously I made a mistake and it all went wrong.I spoke to them both and I apologised. I realised it was a serious mistake but it’s hard to take it back but again it was to improve my look, I had been seen negatively for an entire year.’   On Prince Charles…\u0027I\u0027m a footnote in one of the greatest moments in history\u0027: Thomas Markle\u0027s regret at not giving Meghan away as he says he was jealous but thankful \u0027handsome\u0027 Prince Charles stepped in          Prince Charles took Meghan Markle to the altar in the absence of her father and symbolically had entered St George\u0027s Chapel alone Mr Markle thanked Prince Charles for stepping in on the big day and giving his daughter away, but added that he was \u0027jealous\u0027 as he watched from the US.Calling the prince \u0027handsome\u0027, he said he could not think of anyone better to walk his daughter down the aisle in his absence.Mr Markle told Good Morning Britain: \u0027It might have been a treat for him as well because he has never had a daughter.\u0027I was honoured. I can’t think of a better replacement then Mr Charles. He looked very handsome. I was jealous, I wish it was me but thank God he was there.\u0027He said he still had not met Prince Charles or spoken to him on the phone but that he looked forward to \u0027thanking him\u0027 when he eventually met the royal face to face.Mr Markle\u0027s absence from the wedding shocked Meghan and was so last minute that his name was still in the Order of Service on the day.He said: \u0027She was beautiful. I cried a little watching her. I was very proud and I couldn\u0027t see a better moment in my life. The whole world was watching my daughter.\u0027The unfortunate thing now is that I\u0027m a footnote in one of the greatest moments in history instead of a dad walking his daughter down the aisle.\u0027It was a very emotional moment. I regretted it because I really wanted to walk her down the aisle. But I\u0027m thankful for how it all went\u0027.  On the Queen…Meghan\u0027s dad reveals he is looking forward to meeting Prince Harry and the Queen in London as he calls Her Majesty \u0027one of the most incredible women in the world\u0027          The Queen insisted Prince Harry was not required for her first engagement with Meghan in Cheshire last week and Mr Markle says he has admired her Majesty since childhoodMr Markle said that he was \u0027on the mend\u0027 following heart surgery and hoped to come to London \u0027soon\u0027 to finally meet his son-in-law and the rest of the royal family, including the Queen.He told Piers Morgan and Susanna Reid that the Duke of Sussex remained the only member of the royal family that he had spoken to so far but he was hoping to be introduced to his \u0027other family\u0027 in the near future.The 73-year-old said he could not give an exact time as to when he would see the couple again but claimed he was happy to wait a little bit longer so they newlyweds could spend some time alone.\u0027I look forward to it,\u0027 he added. \u0027I know they are very busy. Right now they\u0027ve earnt the right to go away on a honeymoon.\u0027Going forward I would certainly love to meet the Queen. I\u0027ve had respect for that woman since I was a child.\u0027I think she\u0027s one of the most incredible women in the world and I\u0027d love to meet her.He said that Harry and Meghan offered to come and visit him after the wedding, but he told them it was \u0027a bad idea as the press would eat them alive\u0027.Speaking about his health and travelling abroad in the future, he added: \u0027I\u0027m on the mend and I\u0027m feeling much better. Doctors are making me lose weight and take care of myself so I\u0027ll be ready to go.\u0027  On becoming a grandfather…\u0027She\u0027s wanted children for a long time\u0027: Thomas Markle talks grandchildren as he says a child \u0027will be in the making soon\u0027 for Harry and MeghanMr Markle said that he expects his daughter and Harry will want to try for children soon.He told the programme: ‘She\u0027s wanted children for a long time and when she met Harry and she spoke about how much she loves him, there\u0027s got to be a child in the making, somewhere soon.’Mr Markle said: ‘As long as they\u0027re happy and they have a great life and have some beautiful children and do good things in the world, I can\u0027t ask for more.’  On pulling out of the royal wedding…Meghan\u0027s father reveals she cried when he told her he couldn\u0027t make royal wedding because of a heart attack as he says both she and Harry told him to \u0027take care\u0027          Mr Markle watched the moment the couple married from a sofa in a Californian B\u0026ampB, he revealed todayThomas Markle Snr choked back tears as he reflected on the royal wedding and revealed how he had planned to attend the big day until he was forced to pull out at the eleventh hour.He broke the news to Meghan about his absence in an emotional phone call just days before she was due to walk down the aisle in Windsor Castle\u0027s St George\u0027s Chapel.He said: ‘They were disappointed. Meghan cried, I\u0027m sure, and they both said: “Take care of yourself, we are really worried about you”.’He added: ‘I was very proud. I was very upset that it wasn\u0027t me (walking her down the aisle) but the whole world was watching my daughter. I was very happy about that.‘The unfortunate thing for me now is I\u0027m a footnote in one of the greatest moments in history rather than the dad walking her down the aisle.

I don’t have to, that’s my daughter.\u0027He also spoke about Meghan\u0027s upbringing, and how he and his ex-wife Doria were determined to not let their break-up affect their child.He said: \u0027We didn\u0027t express anger towards each other so she never felt that. Doria and I have always had a good relationship and she felt loved, there wasn’t a problem with that ever.\u0027Doria and I get along and we talk. I still bring her flowers every mother\u0027s day. We’ve always had a good relationship around our daughter and between the two of us.

The fifth word was the number 152,\u0027 he said at a press conference on Friday.

The 73-year-old (pictured on GMB) described his sorrow about pulling out just three days before he was due to walk his daughter down the aisle because of heart surgery and admitted he was jealous but grateful that Prince Charles stepped inBut after my lengthy interview with him today, conducted with my GMB co-host Susanna Reid, I’ve changed my mind about this rather shy, gentle man whose life was irrevocably changed forever when Meghan fell in love with Harry.First, he fully acknowledged his own reckless stupidity in staging those pictures.‘I realize it was a serious mistake,’ he said. ‘It’s hard to take it back.’Second, it’s almost impossible to comprehend the tsunami of attention that cascaded on the poor guy’s head from the second the engagement was formally announced.His account of how he discovered the identity of Meghan’s new man was both comical and endearing: ‘The first phone calls were, “Daddy, I have a new boyfriend.” And I said, “That’s really nice.” And the next call was like, “He’s British,” and I said, ‘That’s really nice.” And eventually the third time around was like, “He’s a prince.” And at that point, she said, ‘It’s Harry.” And I said, ‘Oh, Harry, OK!’    Markle fully acknowledged his own reckless stupidity in staging pictures in an internet cafeFor a man eking out a quiet retirement of considerable solitude in a remote part of Mexico, this would prove to be a spectacularly inconvenient revelation, though he is far too proud of his daughter to admit it.To their shame, senior Palace officials didn’t immediately put someone on a plane to take care of Thomas Markle.One burly, wily ex Household Cavalry guard sitting outside Mr Markle’s front door all day - and none of the chaos that followed may have happened. Or why not just fly him to London a month early – it’s not like Kensington Palace doesn’t have enough bedrooms?Surely both Harry and Meghan must have known he’d be subjected to intense media scrutiny? Yet they did nothing to help him, leaving the former Hollywood lighting director to face the cameras himself for the first time like the proverbial rabbit in headlights.  Mr Markle revealed that his daughter (pictured together above) cried when he told her that he wasn\u0027t coming to London          Harry and his bride are seen on their wedding day as they leave St George\u0027s Chapel in Windsor CastleI still find this failure to protect him incomprehensible, just as I find it weird that Meghan’s mother Doria had to go to the wedding entirely alone, that Harry STILL hasn’t met his father-in-law, that Meghan STILL hasn’t visited her father since his heart attack, and that Prince Charles has had NO contact with Thomas Markle despite taking his daughter down the aisle.But hey, all families are a bit weird – right?I believe Thomas when he says his motivation to do the staged photos was more about improving his dishevelled image than money.(Just as I believe his motivation for appearing on Good Morning Britain today for his first ever TV interview was more about setting the record straight than the relatively small fee we paid him.)There had been a steady flow of pictures of him looking like an overweight, unshaven, beer-swilling vagrant. Who wouldn’t be tempted to try to create a more positive ‘look’ for themselves in the run-up to starring in the biggest wedding of the year?I also believe him when he says he only wants the best for Meghan and Harry. Thomas Markle strikes me as a man who genuinely loves his daughter, and thinks Harry’s the really lucky one to have landed his ‘little Princess’.Marks \u0026 Meghan!

Thomas Markle said he was \u0027honoured\u0027 that the Prince of Wales took on the job of walking Meghan down the aisle insteadNone of us is perfect, and none of us would survive such intense scrutiny unscathed or without doing a few silly things along the way.I don’t doubt Thomas’s sincerity when he says he did what he thought was the right thing at the time.It wasn’t, and as he freely admits now, he’ll now have to live with that for the rest of his life.But any man who, as Thomas Markle does, travels to Los Angeles each year to place flowers on his ex wife Doria’s doorstep on Mother’s Day is not a bad man.In fact, after today’s interview, I’ve come to the conclusion he’s a thoroughly honourable, decent man who is understandably struggling to make sense of a crazy new existence that was entirely of someone else’s making - albeit someone he loves very dearly.He’s also having to do it with barely any support.I congratulate him on his courageous candour today, and wish him well with his recovery.As for his future as a royal father-in-law, I simply say this: good luck Thomas – you’ll need it!"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/18/14/4D5C0CF100000578-0-image-a-10_1529329982999.jpg","title":"Prince Charles joins Queen annual Garter Day service Windsor Castle","story":"Share this articleLook charming in prints like Sophie in a dress by Emilia WicksteadShop the current collection at MATCHESFASHION.COMIt\u0026#39s been a busy few months for the Royal Family.

The former model, who lives with her parents in Essex, attended The Coopers’ Company and Coborn School, a well-performing academy in Upminster, east London, and gained two As and a B at A-levelWhen asked if she was responsible for making laws, she replied ‘yeah, in essence’. She is appearing on the show after being granted an unpaid career break by the DfE in line with civil service rules, which state civil servants can have a career break of between three months and two years.It is thought DfE bosses might not necessarily have known she wanted the break in order to appear on Love Island.While the show’s controversial nature may raise eyebrows among Miss McDermott’s employers, her mother Karen insisted she was proud of her. Speaking about her ‘very academic’ daughter, Mrs McDermott, 56, added: ‘We’re behind her 100 per cent. She obviously spoke to us when she was first talking to the show and said she wouldn’t do it if we didn’t want her to.‘We told her to enjoy it and have the best experience of her life. We hope she finds her man.’ She said daughter ‘loves her job’ and is ‘passionate about making a difference’. All civil servants must uphold the civil service code – which says workers must show integrity and professionalism while away from government – while on a career break. If these terms were broken, human resources would be notified and would launch an investigation.However, workers who keep to the terms may return to work as normal. "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/18/21/4D633CF600000578-0-image-a-14_1529355138016.jpg","title":"Now thats royal tea party Meghan Markels dress Queens hat Eugenies frock|js slshare link","story":"    Say cheese, Ma\u0027am: The Queen wears a hat to match a Wedgwood cheddar dish at the polo on Sunday¿I¿ve changed my mind about Meghan¿s dad ¿ he¿s just a shy,...Share this article    Don\u0027t put it in the dishwasher: Meghan in her plate pattern dress at a wedding on Saturday          Spot the inspiration: Kate channels the Polka Dot china collection by Royal Vale          Someone\u0027s blossoming: Pregnant Pippa plumped for the delicate look of a flowery teacup at the Royal Wedding          Saucer sorcery: Camilla\u0027s jacket at yesterday\u0027s Order of the Garter Service nods to the Royal Albert Black Diamond pattern          I\u0027m a little teapot: Princess Eugenie\u0027s poppy outfit is as chintzy as this pot          Roses are red...

Mr Markle (pictured with his daughter) exposed some of his daughter Meghan and Prince Harry\u0027s most intimate secrets          In his interview on ITV\u0027s Good Morning Britain, Mr Markle spoke of his telephone conversations with Harry to Piers Morgan and Susanna Reid (pictured)Four weeks ago, old royal hands were left wondering why more effort hadn\u0027t been taken to ensure that Meghan\u0027s father was properly brought into his daughter\u0027s new world.Instead, aides were left floundering when it emerged that Mr Markle had foolishly participated in the staging of paparazzi pictures. The irony was that this act of invading his own privacy came at the very time Kensington Palace was sending strict warnings to the media not to harass him.It was hard to escape the conclusion that royal advisers had failed to realise that this lonely man — who lives in a run-down, Mexican border town — would struggle to deal with the enormity of his daughter marrying into the Royal Family.Why, they were asked, hadn\u0027t Mr Markle been helped? A consular official from the British embassy in Mexico City could have been sent up to brief him or even one of Prince Charles\u0027s more experienced aides flown out to acclimatise him.Yesterday, as they did a month ago, sources murmured that offers of assistance had been made to the former TV lighting director. Aides were reluctant to say more, but many thought that as soon as the wedding was over steps would have been taken to ensure Mr Markle felt he was part of the family.          Meghan Markle\u0027s mother Doria Ragland (left, with Prince Charles and Camilla) received the warmest of welcomes when she flew in from her LA home for the weddingThis might mean a new home, paid for by his wealthy son-in-law, and with an income to support himself and where he would have no need to give interviews for cash. At the very least one might have expected the newly-weds to have visited him by now – or arranged for him to visit them. His treatment – or rather a lack of it – contrasts wildly with that extended to his ex-wife and Meghan\u0027s mother, Doria Ragland. RICHARD KAY: Bouquet of her favourite forget-me-nots, flash of her dazzling aquamarine ring but most tantalising of all... was empty seat at the royal wedding REALLY for Diana?The boyfriend Meghan would rather forget: How a 22-year-old Miss Markle dated an award winning PORN STAR among a host of other young suitorsHow Prince Louis is named after a colossus of the empire cruelly cut down by the IRA who was implicated in a military plot to overthrow Labour PM Harold Wilson and whose wife was a voracious sexual adventurousRICHARD KAY: Charles still hasn’t seen the newborn prince because he has a difficult relationship with William RICHARD KAY asks the tantalising question: Will Kate copy the Queen with baby No 4? RICHARD KAY: The touching rituals that reveal just how much the Queen loved her corgis...they\u0027re buried at her favourite homes, each with a headstone on which she leaves posies of flowers.

Thomas Markle, thus far, seems to be excluded from it. One can only imagine how frustrating this must be for Prince Harry. Determined to protect his wife in the way he was never able to protect his late mother, Diana, the response of the Palace to Meghan\u0027s father has fallen short.Of one thing we can be sure: he will not be overly embarrassed that his views on Trump and the EU have emerged. One figure who has known the prince since he was a boy, says: \u0027You could say he handled a tricky conversation well. When asked about Brexit he was trying to be non-committal and on Trump he didn\u0027t want to be rude.\u0027A less generous view was being taken elsewhere however. As a young man whose experiences of America come from his time training with the US military and that ill-fated trip to Las Vegas, he might be disposed to thinking positively about Trump.Indeed the royals have followed Trump\u0027s rise closely. At a charity lunch before the 2016 US election, Prince Charles asked an American sitting next to him what Trump was like.          Mr Markle\u0027s assertions about Harry\u0027s views on Donald Trump and Brexit were explosive          Ever since Trump (pictured) became US President, the royals have been scrupulous to avoid revealing any views on the matterThe guest later admitted she was flustered because she didn\u0027t think royals talked about political figures. Perhaps this accounts for the sympathy that exists at Clarence House for this latest imbroglio involving Meghan\u0027s father.\u0027Prince Charles and Camilla like Meghan enormously, but they do feel that the team around her and Harry is rather inexperienced,\u0027 says an insider.Others, though, feel that the duchess herself could have done more to avoid difficulties. It is worth recalling that according to Meghan\u0027s biographer Andrew Morton, the former actress has long become used to compartmentalising her life.When success with TV series Suits arrived, she purged many childhood friends. Some might argue she has done the same with her close family. Her mother, after all, was the solitary representative of blood relatives at her daughter\u0027s wedding. Inevitably, those around the royals were comparing Mr Markle with another royal-in-law, the Duchess of Cambridge\u0027s father Michael Middleton.He has only ever spoken once – and then under strict Palace control – when his daughter became engaged to Prince William. In the near eight years since, he has said nothing.Sadly – with a little more due diligence – this Markle debacle Part 2 might have been wholly avoided. "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/17/00/4D50EBE200000578-0-image-a-14_1529192489068.jpg","title":"Childrens books sanitised dumbed says best selling author|js slshare link","story":"    Geraldine McCaughrean, who has written more than 160 books, said there was now a range of topics that are no longer deemed acceptable for young readersShe added: ‘It’s extraordinary because in pre-school you can read fairy tales in their original form and some of them are really scary and dark.‘But you go to junior school and all of a sudden the fairy tales that you read in school have been sanitised and cleaned up.‘And then you go into secondary school and fall off into the deep end of vampire books.

It’s about timeLabour Live was conceived in the spirit of solidarity, optimism, and a playful hubris. The idea behind it presumably went: if you could get all of Glastonbury festival chanting Jeremy Corbyn’s name, who’s to say you couldn’t bring such a crowd to see him headline? Well, there were lots to say it. People at Glastonbury are largely in an incredibly good mood – it would be prim to speculate as to why – and in such conditions, someone you love a bit becomes someone you love a lot. But that doesn’t mean you can be relied upon to chant again.Primed for the fall after such an act of pride, Corbyn critics turned up ready for a soggy English summer’s day with sparse crowds huddled round a single Unite ice-cream van. A friend who went said she saw so many journalists it was like going to Hay. Yet many of the hacks will have been disappointed. Corbyn’s popularity – not by Survation poll or focus group, but by the sheer human warmth he generates – is unmatched by any other British politician. The doggedness and the petulance with which commentators wave away the fact that he could fill a stadium with people who’d actually paid, while Theresa May couldn’t half-fill a factory floor in Leicester where people were at work anyway, is becoming absurd.The faultline among Labour members is not whether this Tory Brexit is a shambles – thinly veiled racism vying with colonialist fantasy to see which can insist more trenchantly that the complicated is simple, a deficit is a idend, black is white. Most would treat that as a matter of established fact. The argument, rather, is whether Corbyn is best served on his route to Downing Street by everyone swallowing their objections and taking his lead, or whether, conversely, the argument on Europe is absolutely central to a socialist government, and that all of its values – from workers’ rights to the environment, from solidarity with the European left to the defence and enhancement of public services – would be kiboshed by even the softest of Brexits.The loyalists point to the MPs who use the remain or soft Brexit agenda as a means of returning the party to centrist hands. Those MPs are pretty transparent about it: Chris Leslie on Sunday launched his vision for centrist politics, which was mainly platitudes and occasionally a straight lift from Corbyn’s existing position – the message being, “Let’s not sweat the practicalities: politics is better when there are normal people like me in charge.” So yes, it’s a hiccup that the loudest anti-Brexit voice within the party also has no respect for its leader.Also, Labour’s soft Brexit proposition – single market membership with a side order of anti-immigration rhetoric to sate their imaginary northerner – is terrible. It serves the interests of capital while casually letting go of the European Union institutions that protected the inidual – the only thing the EU has going for it.However, plenty of leftwing remainers don’t want to be backed into silence by someone else’s agenda. Plenty of us do not swallow this great taboo around respecting a referendum result, when the campaign was built on naked lies (before you even consider Russian troll bots and what other rules were broken). Plenty of us would be savagely critical of the EU, but with the aim of reforming it, not abandoning it. Plenty of us want to see a Corbyn government able to enact its vision without the catastrophic recession that will follow Brexit, the social ision that’s already evident, and oh, tiny thing, the fact we need the closest possible left-European alliance to defeat the fascism that is plainly on the rise.There seems to have been a tacit agreement among pro-Corbyn activists, from constituency parties to Momentum, that respectable people avoid making problems for their leadership, and concentrate on local issues. That argument is starting to unravel, not so much evidenced by that splash of confrontation at Labour Live, but the Momentum petition that launched at the weekend: it called, in much more supportive language, for a conference vote on stopping Tory Brexit.If they get the signatures, the “democracy” aspect of party policy must be observed, and members must vote. It puts a logic bomb under the sense of apathy and inevitability: this is, in the end, a party committed to democratic renewal. It has to be ready for its debates to mean something. Labour in its “New” era was suffused with what psychoanalysts would call hysterical negativity, members having a mutually reinforcing bitch-fest with no prospect of effecting change. What a tragedy it would be if the Corbyn movement, in quashing debate for strategic advantage, became just Blairism with a beard."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9c1345c22d6a3af6eac45f3f3419af210986dfc4/39_252_3950_2370/master/3950.jpg?w=660\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3ac5a64c644ce3db66ac9a915d29ba6a 660w","title":"belgium panama world cup match report","story":"In the end, the gap was too great and reality got in the way. The Panama manager, Hernán Dario “Bolillo” Gómez, had warned there would be four possible outcomes in every game when they reached the World Cup for the first time in history: they could win, they could draw, they could lose, and they could be goleado: roundly defeated.In Sochi, where more than 4,000 fans had travelled 7,200 miles, outnumbering Belgian supporters by four to one – and where the Russians in the stadium were on their side too, Panama resisted for a while, competed too, but succumbed. “Yes we can,” they had chanted but no, no, they couldn’t. A wonderful volley from Dries Mertens and two goals from Romelu Lukaku completed the beating.Gómez suggested the difference between these countries – in talent, history and the teams their footballers represent, even in physical condition – is greater than three goals. “It wasn’t seven,” he noted. “People can see three goals and feel ashamed, embarrassed, but we did not let ourselves down.”Mertens plays for Napoli, while Lukaku is at Manchester United the two players Mertens’ shot flew past, the goalkeeper Jaime Penedo and the centre-back Román Torres, are at Dinamo Bucharest and Seattle Sounders. Other clubs represented by the team ranked 55 in the world, the country with a population of 3.5 million, where baseball is still just about the most popular sport, include Dunajska Streda, Gent, and Bucaramanga.There was disappointment and no recrimination. As Fidel Escobar ran up to hit a free-kick in the final minutes a metallic percussion greeted him. When Armando Cooper dashed through just after, only to be tumbled, they roared. There was pride as Panama sought to take something from this. Bolillo called the occasion “fantastic”. He added: “I told the lads they had played well and no one could point the finger.” Here, at least, they did not.At the end, Belgium clapped their fans in the corner. Panama gathered in a circle and prayed. As they came away the stadium erupted in more applause. They had been goleado but they had been “worthy”, their manager said. Belgium got the win they sought, and ultimately a comfortable one, largely easing their way through the second half. “I couldn’t be prouder of my team,” Roberto Martínez said.It took a while to find a way through. Forty seconds had gone when Lukaku sent the ball over the bar, yet if that seemed to suggest this was going to be ended early it did not happen. Bolillo had described just being at the World Cup as historic but he had expended much energy reminding everyone the most likely scenario was heavy defeat, seeking to reduce pressure and expectation. Asked if Iceland’s draw with Argentina gave them hope, he had been swift to highlight the differences. In summary: Belgium are better than Argentina and Iceland are better than Panama. Hope, though, springs eternal and Mexico had contributed – Germany’s victors had been helped by Panama in qualification.When Yannick Carrasco shot into Penedo’s arms after six minutes a pattern was emerging and it was one they predicted. It was also one Bolillo said was a product of “nerves”, history. A minute later it was Mertens on the other side bringing the 36‑year‑old goalkeeper into action. And when Torres underhit a backpass Eden Hazard could only find the side-netting. Panama were hanging on and sometimes hacking clear, concern showing.Slowly Panama found their feet – and occasionally burst forward, Cooper and Aníbal Godoy swift and direct in midfield, prepared to go at their opponents in straight lines, while Joel Bárcenas ran too, a sharp dash into the box, and Godoy almost got away not long after. After half an hour, Cooper’s neat overhead kick set them up and running again but Blas Pérez did not spot Bárcenas racing up the far side and although Panama got the ball back again and Cooper slipped it into the area for José Luis Rodríguez, he was blocked.Naturally, the chances appeared mostly at the other end – where Penedo was quickly at the centre of this. Mertens hit the side-netting another short corner almost caught Panama out and Torres had to hook away inside his six-yard box. Kevin De\u0026nbspBruyne’s shot went over Hazard sliced wide then dribbled into the area and was denied at the near post by Penedo before the goalkeeper was out quickly to stop Lukaku. At half time, Panama’s players went into a huddle before heading for the tunnel. The message: we’re in this.Soon, they fell behind – although it took something extraordinary. Mertens’s volley from the top right corner of area flew past Torres and Penedo two minutes into the second half. “That gave us breathing space,” Martínez said. “After that I thought we were ourselves. That goal was essential.”De Bruyne’s shot curled just wide but while Panama’s energy dropped, they were not quite done just yet. Michael Amir Murillo was played into the area, almost alone, soon after. This was the moment. He waited a little long, Jan Vertonghen got across and Thibaut Courtois saved. “We saw the size of Courtois there,” Martínez said.Belgium were in control for Panama, the opportunity had gone. De\u0026nbspBruyne bent a wonderful cross with the outside of his foot to Lukaku to e and head home before Hazard slipped a pass through to the striker. Running on to it, he clipped neatly over Penedo. “Panama deserve a huge amount of credit,” Martínez said. “And so do we.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/31f45743a7ec1f2d25bdf98cc480ad77b5733d22/961_500_2962_1777/master/2962.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=07d69abc8b981f4feb78dcdc64456c71","title":"colombia radamel falcao lost time japan world cup","story":"The Monaco striker, at 32, has rediscovered his form and a belated chance to make his mark at the World Cup begins against Japan in SaranskImages from the 2014 World Cup are seared into the mind and from Colombia’s point of view they invariably revolve around James Rodríguez , the poster boy who won the Golden Boot, scored the goal of the tournament with that sumptuous volley against Uruguay and broke down in tears on the pitch after his dream came to an end against Brazil in the quarter-finals.Four years on and Rodríguez and Colombia are strutting back on to the global stage with those garish yellow shirts, only now there is another star in town. Welcome to the World Cup, Radamel Falcao.Aged 32, Falcao is a late entrant to football’s biggest party but better late than never in the eyes of Colombia fans. Rodríguez may have been the star of the show in Brazil, and he was certainly Colombia’s most influential player during their uninspiring World Cup qualification campaign for Russia, yet it is Falcao, the devoted Christian who has the power to win votes as well as score goals, who remains the country’s footballing icon.Falcao’s influence stretches far and wide in Colombia, so much so that when he was coming round from knee surgery in January 2014, after rupturing the anterior cruciate ligament in his left knee while playing for Monaco, the surgeon who carried out the operation received a phone call from Juan Manuel Santos, Colombia’s president. “He told me that if I can get Falcao fit for the World Cup, then I could win him the elections,” José Carlos Noronha said.Santos stayed in power but Falcao, despite being named in José Pekerman’s initial 30-man squad for Brazil and spending 10 one-hour sessions in a hyperbaric chamber to do everything possible to accelerate his recovery, lost his race to be fit for the World Cup finals. Colombia were robbed of their talisman and Falcao was cruelly denied the opportunity to feature for his country in what was their first World Cup appearance for 16 years.As Falcao sat on the outside looking in, watching his teammates light up Brazil with the slick, incisive counterattacking football that delivered four straight victories and 11 goals before they ran into Brazil in Fortaleza, a couple of thoughts came to mind.The first was that if Colombia were this good without Falcao, what would they have been capable of if he were fit? The second was to dare to wonder whether Colombia, whose formation was reconfigured in the absence of Falcao, were possibly a better all-round team without him. Would Rodríguez, for example, have been liberated in quite the same way with Falcao in the side?Either way, there is no getting away from the fact Falcao endured a miserable couple of seasons when he finally did get back on to the pitch. Across 41 largely forgettable appearances for Manchester United and Chelsea between September 2014 and April 2016, after he was loaned by Monaco, Falcao scored only four times. Ivan Mejia, one of Colombia’s leading pundits, went as far as to say Falcao should be described as an “ex-footballer” towards the end of his time in England. Was Falcao finished?Two seasons back in Ligue 1, scoring 51 goals for Monaco, have provided the best possible response to that criticism and saw Falcao re-establish himself as the Colombia No 9 – a role Teófilo Gutiérrez filled in Brazil – before the end of the World Cup qualifiers and making him a mandatory selection for their opening game against Japan in Saransk on Tuesday.Shirts with his name on the back are everywhere. After Russia, Colombia are the third best supported nation at the World Cup based on ticket sales in their own country (65,234) and it promises to be quite an atmosphere inside the Mordovia Arena, where Japan will come up against the team who thumped them 4-1 in the group stage in Brazil, on a night when Pekerman rested the majority of his first-choice players because they were already through to the last 16.Rodríguez came off the bench to set up two goals and score another and it was interesting to listen to Akira Nishino, the Japan coach, talking at length about the Bayern Munich midfielder before this latest meeting. Nishino described Rodríguez as “almost like a symbol of the Colombia team – the mood-maker” and admitted he had given serious consideration to trying to man-mark him. Falcao, Colombia’s all-time leading goalscorer, never got a mention.There are some doubts about just how good Falcao and Rodríguez are together for Colombia and whether it is one of those partnerships and relationships that looks much better on paper than it does on the pitch. Pekerman seems to think otherwise and, reflecting on the make-up of Colombia’s squad compared with the group he had at his disposal in Brazil, spoke about a team “now much richer and much stronger thanks to the skills of our players” and of their “hopes to be at least as good or better than four years ago” when it comes to ambitions for the tournament.Rodríguez, who has been struggling with a calf problem, is a slight doubt for the Japan game, although the expectation is that he will be fit and get the chance to add his name to the select group of players who have scored in six successive World Cup matches. Falcao, in contrast, is just about to get started."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c3227073a2bdb6fe7ece3b99f124f15348a9f1d8/0_137_4123_2473/master/4123.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a1cded7810279a7d96d55e86cd3c3f8d","title":"harry kane talismanic captain two goals tunisia","story":"Oh, Harry. At the end of a fraught, at times puzzling World Cup Group\u0026nbspG opener there was an unfamiliar noise around the Volgograd Arena, an odd feeling of lightness in the air, a feeling of double-take. It took a while to register. Applause. Relief. A skirling of possibilities. England tournament moments: also available in happy.It is fair to say Harry Kane did not just save his England team by heading the winning goal in the last desperate knockings of this 2-1 defeat of Tunisia. In the process he rescued us all from the heavy weather, the unbearable introspection of another slow first‑week World Cup death.Some will call this a lucky win, papering over the same old flaws, those moments when England just shrink, the players lashed to the oars of some invisible Roman slave galley, dawdling the ball tortuously back and forth. But then, good players take those moments. And here Kane did\u0026nbspthe decisive, destiny-shaping thing twice, finding a moment of space and stillness in the most fraught of penalty area scrums.In the process he scored from three yards out at both ends of the game, one with his right foot, the other with his head in injury time. These are the goals strikers love to score, the daily business of\u0026nbspsimply being there, standing still\u0026nbsplong enough to let the game realise that they are in exactly the\u0026nbspright spot.In between times it was an uncomfortable game, a tournament opener that seemed to be speaking in tongues, possessed by the demons of England’s past. They were all here in snatches, from every half-forgotten horror of the last few summer collapses to the pep and brittle new patterns of the Southgate\u0026nbspinterlude.In the opening 20 minutes England should have killed the game. Instead they managed to miss not one, not two but three just‑kill‑me‑now open goals, although the first was flagged offside and would not have counted.That miss was the worst. With three minutes gone a lovely little knot of passes left Raheem Sterling in front of goal, all on his own, ball at his feet. Sterling did not just miss it, he double-missed it. He seemed to be trying to tap dance on top of the ball, to ride it like bicycle, striking it with both feet while haring in at top speed in such a way the ball was left trickling with a sickly, taunting little roll wide of a post.Next was Jesse Lingard who side‑footed an ugly, creepy, ungodly looking thing wide of another open goal. Finally it was the turn of John Stones who wafted at thin air from five yards out.Thank heavens, or indeed Mauricio, for Harry. In the middle of this Kane was a blur of intent, dropping deep, playing as both a No\u0026nbsp10 and a No\u0026nbsp9. Shortly after Sterling’s miss he had a shot deflected for a corner. The kick was headed at goal by Stones, then palmed up into the night air. There was a weird moment of stillness as the ball fell in front of Kane, very slowly, looking unusually white and pristine. And then with snap the day was rushing on again, Kane king the ball home to a great gurgling roar of joy.The Volgograd Arena is a striking thing, rising up suddenly out of the low skyline like a giant, lighted wicker basket at the foot of\u0026nbspMamayev Kurgan, the plateau above the city. Around the bleachers\u0026nbspbefore kick-off there was\u0026nbspthe usual pageantry of these summer mobilisations, a journey around the isles in hand-painted flags, from Rochdale to Southend to Stoke, up the Tyne, Forth and\u0026nbspCromarty.Leading up to this game there had also been a gathering intensity around Kane, who was so poor, and so tired, at Euro 2016 but who is 24 now and who really does need to score if the gears and parts of this England team are to function.Kane will have felt it too, from the\u0026nbspexaggerated reporting of his every statement in the buildup to the sudden nostril-close tunnel shots from the TV camera before kick-off on a hot, heavy night by the Volga, bringing those likeable, agreeably droopy Kane chops into Soviet‑scale close-up for the watching global\u0026nbspaudience.He will have felt it, too, as the game began to slip away, even before Tunisia’s equaliser from the spot. As the second half kicked off a kind of congealment seemed to have settled over England, like a bowl of\u0026nbsplukewarm rice porridge left to glaze in the open air. Suddenly the band were back in the stands, battering away with a horrible deadening throb. England had possession but it was slower now. Kane ran still but he always seemed\u0026nbspto be chasing or being shunted away from goal.He was hugely unlucky not to be awarded a penalty after being grappled to the floor. But it is to be hoped England’s analysis does not focus on the referee or perceived injustice. There is no right to blame anyone but oneself after spurning the chance to score four goals – and not just gilt‑edged invitations to score but scented and vellum‑inscribed, hand-delivered by a unicorn-train of footmen.Then there was England’s shape, that honed five-man defence which\u0026nbspat times in the second half looked absurd with just Wahbi Kazhri puffing around in between them, like sending a swat team to surround a stray dog while at the other end of town there is a robbery going on.Towards the end there was the slow descent into anxious lateral movement and finally that moment of pure, high‑grade Harry that will leave England unexpectedly\u0026nbspbuoyant."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/408ee0061c1c71055232c195078947ce008cb1bd/0_111_2782_1670/master/2782.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e74e86bc7d6c6382edf8e122728ab1db","title":"tunisia england world cup match report","story":"The clock had ticked past 90 minutes. Harry Kane was there and, in that position, Gareth Southgate could not have wished for any other player to be primed inside the penalty area. An old English routine: the corner, the flick-on, the back-post header and, suddenly, England’s opening game of the World Cup had its happy ending.It was deserved, too, bearing in mind the pattern of the game and the long spells when it had been threatening to finish with a churning sense of déjà vu. England, after all, had managed only five wins in their opening fixtures of every World Cup and European Championship since 1950.They had outplayed Tunisia without outscoring them and, at 1-1, a draw would have pained Southgate, to say the least, given the number of chances his team had passed up to make it a more straightforward evening.But when has it ever been straightforward with England? Kane had already scored from one corner and the team had played so thrillingly it was bordering on absurd that\u0026nbspthe game had reached the end of normal time without them being in a winning position.Tunisia’s equaliser had come from a penalty that could be described, at best, as generous – or from England’s perspective, utterly needless – and for a long time it seemed as though Southgate’s players did not have the wit or creativity to turn their superiority into the hard currency of goals.Enter Kane. His late, twisting header means England can qualify for the knockout stages by defeating Panama in Nizhny Novgorod on Sunday and the final game of Group\u0026nbspG against Belgium may not be so relevant. England can therefore leave Volgograd reflecting on a hugely satisfying evening, full of drama and incident, and nobody can possibly argue the result was unjust. England were the better team by some distance, even if they did play with everyone’s\u0026nbspnerves.Mouez Hassen Denied Lingard and was unlucky after his save from Stones rebounded to Kane, before injury forced him off early. 6Dylan Bronn Good marauding runs down the right flank by the wing back but sloppy defending. 6Yassine Meriah Couple of decent tackles in first half overshadowed by a hopeless backpass and manhandling of Kane. 5Syam Ben Youssef Excellent tackle to deny Kane in the second half but could not keep hold of the striker in the end. 6Ali Maâloul Coped well with England’s wide men, not much opportunity to show his set‑piece ability. 6Fakhreddine Ben Youssef Made the most of being hit by Walker’s flailing arm for the penalty but his manager will not have minded the theatrics. 6Ellyes Skhiri The French-born defensive midfielder a recent recruit to starting XI, struggled to assert himself. 5Ferjani Sassi Good penalty to even things up but lucky to get away with a rugby tackle on Kane in the box. 6Naïm Sliti Tunisia’s most naturally talented attacker did well with ball at his feet, frustrating England with inventive play. 7Anice Badri Quick feet, did not get much service and caught in possession several times. 6Wahbi Khazri Squandered the chances he had, hitting one so high it may have flown over the Motherland Calls statue. 5Ratings by Martha Kelner.Southgate certainly kept to his word that his players would deliver fluid, energetic performances with an emphasis on attack. They were quick to the ball, slick with their passing and attacked with so much adventure, particularly in the first half, that there were countless occasions when they outnumbered their opponents at the back.The pressure on Tunisia was almost unremitting and, even ignoring for a moment Kane’s goals, it must have been hugely encouraging for Southgate to see the vibrancy of his team, the number of chances they concocted and the desire of the midfieldersto break into the opposition penalty area.Unfortunately for Southgate, there was also a reminder here of England’s recurring ability to make life more difficult for themselves than necessary. On that front nothing has changed. It was difficult to keep a count of the number of chances – not just half-chances but wonderful openings – England totted up throughout the night.How much less stressful everything might have been, for instance, if England had been more ruthless inside the opening few minutes.Jordan Pickford Only real test for the 24‑year‑old was penalty on 35 minutes to which he got fingertips. 6Kyle Walker At fault for the penalty, with foul on Fakhreddine Ben Youssef. A soft decision but naive defending. Booked. 5\u0026nbspJohn Stones Should have scored with a header in first half and lost concentration at key\u0026nbspmoments. 6Harry Maguire Assured passing but lost ball in dangerous areas and would have been punished by a better side. 6Kieran Trippier Lovely balls whipped in from the right and caused Tunisia problems with pinpoint delivery from set pieces. 8Jordan Henderson Preferred to Eric Dier and gave a good account of himself in so‑called midfield pivot\u0026nbsprole. 7\u0026nbspAshley Young A few incisive deliveries into the box and oldest player in England squad set up the first goal. 7Jesse Lingard A litany of missed chances as he failed to make Tunisia pay for England’s early dominance. 6Dele Alli Tottenham forward looked lethargic at times, whether through injury or lack of fitness. 6Raheem Sterling Sparky in the first half but the question mark over his finishing ability remains. 6\u0026nbspHarry Kane Kept cool to head in England’s winner – his second goal – and composed despite being repeatedly fouled in the area. 8\u0026nbspRatings by Martha Kelner.An offside flag spared Sterling’s embarrassment with an open-goal miss after four minutes. It was a fairly staggering moment, all the same. Yet in fairness to Sterling he was not the only England player to be guilty of poor finishing during a wild, breathless opening half.One by one, the chances came and went. Jesse Lingard had a golden opportunity, at 1-0, to double England’s lead and, later on, prodded a shot against a post.John Stones wasted a gilt-edged chance shortly after Tunisia’s penalty, with Dele Alli’s looping back-header being turned against the crossbar moments earlier, and there was some splendid goalkeeping from Mouez Hassen before he was forced off with a shoulder injury.Hassen had stopped Lingard from giving England the lead after only two\u0026nbspminutes and Tunisia’s goalkeeper was unlucky for Kane’s first goal, 11 minutes in, when Ashley Young delivered the corner and Stones showed great desire to get to the ball first. Hassen clawed away Stones’ header but the ball fell kindly for Kane and he turned in the rebound from close range.All of this seemed a far cry from the last time England were seen in a major competition, namely the ordeal against Iceland in Euro 2016. Southgate’s men\u0026nbspset off like a team in a hurry. They have had to be patient, with six of the other World Cup groups already under way,\u0026nbspand it quickly became apparent they were determined to make a favourable impression.Once they had the lead, however, they were far too slack in letting Tunisia back into the match through a combination of penalty-box misses, some bad luck and the penalty that Kyle Walker gave away for blocking off Fakhredinne Ben Youssef in the 34th minute.England are entitled to be aggrieved by the decision of the Colombian referee, Wilmar Roldán, and the exaggerated agony of the Tunisia player to create the deception. Equally it should be a lesson for Walker that in the modern international game it is taking a risk to jut out a trailing arm when an opponent is in close proximity.Walker has a habit of disrupting players this way and on this occasion it backfired. Ferjani Sassi took the penalty, beating Jordan Pickford to the goalkeeper’s right. And England were back level again in a game they had been controlling.They should have won a penalty of their own when Kane was pulled to the floor in the same incident that led to Stones firing wide and, after the interval, England continued to press\u0026nbspforward.Sterling, with only two goals now in 38 England appearances, was taken off in that period and his replacement, Marcus Rashford, quickly started to threaten. Ruben Loftus-Cheek, who came on after Alli complained about soreness in a thigh, also had a positive impact and, importantly, England kept going.Even when the ball was not running for them, they persevered. And then, finally, came the decisive corner in the first minute of stoppage time. Kieran Trippier put the ball into the penalty area. Harry Maguire won the first header. And Kane was there."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c9c0dedcd130fedebc5b6e9dfad3a8b6a6a244c7/0_0_4719_2831/master/4719.jpg?w=1140\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2e51e7e1b76f983534ac6b5e850f90d9 1140w","title":"tunisia v england world cup 2018 live updates","story":"Harry Kane’s double secured a last-gasp win as England got their World Cup campaign off to a flyer in Group GLet’s wrap it up here.

I doubt it’s coincidence that the players remained calm and didn’t panic as the time ebbed away, like they have done in the past.”On the website tomorrow:It’s such an important win for England. A draw would have opened up the possibility of them needing something against Belgium in their third game. Instead there’s a chance for them to qualify by beating Panama in Nizhy Novgorod on Sunday. It does look like they’re in a race with Belgium to finish first.The match report has now been updated with Daniel Taylor’s on-the-whistle take. We’ll have more news and comment on the site soon.I suspect there’s going to be a lot of discussion about Raheem Sterling’s place before the Panama game and many calls for either Ruben Loftus-Cheek or Marcus Rashford to start on Sunday. But wouldn’t it be great to see Sterling answer his critics with a match-winning display?From one captain to another.Have a look at the Golden Boot standings. Harry Kane is level on two goals with Denis Cheryshev, Diego Costa and Romelu Lukaku. Cristiano Ronaldo is top after his hat-trick against Spain.Kyle Walker says he got a shout from Kieran Trippier on the Tunisia penalty. “I’ve just tried to shield the ball. In the future I’d probably head it away.”The situation in Group G is that Belgium and England are level on three points after the first game. Belgium are top on goal difference after their 3-0 win over Panama. Top spot is likely to come down England v Belgium on 28 June. Next up it’s Belgium v Tunisia on 23 June and England v Panama on 24 JuneEngland should feel cautiously optimistic. For a start, it’s a game they probably wouldn’t have won in the past. They might even have found a way to lose it. But while they were a bit stale in the second half, they were completely dominant and kept pressing for the winning goal. Harry Kane delivered in the nick of time, which is so important - they’ll need him to keep scoring and he’s taken a bit of the pressure off his shoulders. The substitutes, Marcus Rashford and Ruben Loftus-Cheek, also impressed and England’s attacking play caught the eye in the first half. But it wasn’t a perfect night. Kyle Walker’s defensive frailties were exposed when he gave away the penalty, the second half was a slog and there were times when England lacked creativity. Still, they’ve won. It’s an open tournament and there haven’t been many convincing performances yet. There are a few teams who’d like to be in England’s position.Gareth Southgate speaks! “Even though the clock was running down, we stayed patient. We waited for opportunities. We made so many clearcut chances in the first half. We were strong on set plays in the second half. Even if we had drawn the game I would have been proud of us. We’ll do well to make as many in a game in this tournament. Good teams score late goals. If you pass like that the opposition tire. It’s a night where it’s difficult to highlight iniduals because it was a collective. The squad has been brilliant. The subs came on and it was great to have the impact they did. We felt that Raheem and Dele had caused huge problems for the opposition but maybe it was a good moment to put on a different threat. We’ve given ourselves a great platform to build from. There’s so much to be pleased about. But there’s a lot to work on. Panama will be a tough test in a different way. We’ve got to keep performing. Harry’s a top, top striker. I’m delighted for him because if he doesn’t score tonight it’d be questions about him not scoring in tournaments.”This is what happens when Harry Kane isn’t on corners. Harry Maguire speaks! “It was tough out there. The first half, we should have been out of sight. We gave away a soft goal. But we stuck to our shape and H has done it again.”Yes, he called him H.It’s England’s sixth win in their opening World Cup game. Celebrate it by looking at some pictures.Jordan Henderson speaks! “It’s a massive boost for us in the end. We kept going. We always said we’d keep going and fighting. Thankfully that paid off for us tonight with a big goal and a big win. Maybe we were thinking about the chances we missed. You can’t do that in a World Cup. The second half we kept going but we didn’t keep creating chances. They defended deeper. But we got the goal.”Harry Kane, England’s two-goal hero, speaks! “It’s massive. So proud of the lads. I thought we played well, especially in the first half. I’ve not seen the penalty back but it didn’t look like one. Credit to the lads, we kept going. We’ve spoken a lot about togetherness. It’s nice to see it working on the pitch. We’ll be happy on the pitch tonight. There could have been a couple of penalties. We had so much joy from corners. They were trying to grab hold and stop us running. Maybe a bit of justice at the end. We’re just itching to play. The World Cup is tough. I thought we’ve done really well.”That was a really smart header from Kane. He wasn’t far out but he had to swivel and use those neck muscles to power the ball past Ben Mustapha.Tunisia’s players look gutted. Understandably so. They worked so hard to get back into the game after a dire start and looked like they’d held England. Yet it’s going to be very difficult for them to qualify now. They’ll need to get something from their next game against Belgium to stand any chance.Gareth Southgate gives Harry Kane a big hug. England’s manager owes his captain. That had turned into a very awkward evening.England have won their opening game at a major tournament for the first time since 2006 thanks to Harry Kane’s double!

I have never won the lottery, or even found a fiver in an old coat pocket. But there is one aspect in life where fortune has smiled on me: I am eight months pregnant with my first child – the result of IVF treatment.The outcome amazes me still: the first implantation attempt was successful. But, now that the dust has settled, my experience in the private sector has left me feeling discombobulated and angry. According to a recent report by healthcare researcher LaingBuisson, the UK fertility market was worth £320m in 2016, with private investors increasingly interested in the sector. When I heard this, it struck a nerve. Surely infertile patients are the losers when healthcare is run to make profits for investors?IVF is expensive. And what makes it worse, says Hugh Risebrow, the report’s author, is the lack of pricing transparency. “The headline prices quoted may be, say, £3,500, but you end up with a bill of £7,000,” he says. “This is because there are things not included that you need – and then things that are offered, but are not evidence-based.”Those “things” are the add-ons – tests, drugs, equipment, procedures – offered on top of a cycle of IVF and charged for separately. And private fertility clinics sell patients add-ons that have no evidence behind them – in other words, they don’t work.I still ended up with a bill well over £3,000. The price listed for frozen embryo transfer was £1,500. One cycle was cancelled before the implantation stage – costing me £775. Some extra charges were, as Risebrow notes, unavoidable, if not transparent, such as drugs – but some were avoidable. A thyroid function test was recommended – presented as necessary before treatment could begin – but I have since discovered the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (Nice) recommends this should be offered only to women with symptoms of thyroid disease.This is not unusual. Information about the efficacy of add-ons and extras is not presented in a clear and coherent manner by all clinics. Often, the treatments or technologies are new and evidence is not yet clear, or available. I am kicking myself that I didn’t question things more at the time – I have a master’s in science journalism. But once through the doors of the clinic, I just wanted to get pregnant.Still, I got off lightly. Author and fertility campaigner Jessica Hepburn had 11 cycles of IVF – all unsuccessful – spending more than £70,000 over eight years. Hepburn says she “had everything going”, including controversial lymphocyte immunisation therapy, which involved being injected with her partner’s and a stranger’s white blood cells. “Patients do want add-ons – they will try anything because they are so desperate,” she says.In 2016, add-ons were investigated by the BBC’s Panorama programme, based on research from the University of Oxford’s Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine. They found that 26 out of 27 add-ons were not supported by high-quality evidence. But has anything changed since then? Prof Carl Heneghan, the centre’s director, cites the HFEA’s traffic light scheme – something I heard about numerous times while researching this piece, but which not one person mentioned during the many months I spent having treatment. Launched in July 2017, the HFEA website lists the 10 most commonly offered supplementary treatments. They are graded as either green (more than one good quality study that shows the procedure is effective and safe) amber (a growing body of evidence shows promising results, but further research is still required) and red (no evidence to show it is effective and safe). None are green, six are amber and four are red.Heneghan says it’s a step forward, but he wants to see more randomised controlled trials. “This is not a difficult area to reduce uncertainty … you want to know live birthrates, and you can do that systematically. But because this is the private sector there’s no incentive to reduce uncertainty.”Heneghan has no truck with the argument that trials are difficult to do. This, he says, has “always been the answer.” “It’s almost like you’re dragging people into an evidence-based world. It’s 2018.”Dr Jane Stewart is chair of the British Fertility Society, a body endeavouring to ensure patients are well educated. She is also an NHS consultant in reproductive medicine and gynaecology, heading up the Newcastle Fertility Centre. When I say the words “fertility market” to her, she sighs. What has happened, she says, is the “regrettable” practice of couples choosing treatments “like from a shop”.“Straightforward IVF is a good treatment, it doesn’t need a whole lot of extra help,” she says. The answer, for those struggling with infertility, is simple: “People should have a consultation and have treatment that is good for them. It’s about taking the pressure off patients who feel that they need to buy everything.”I am slightly baffled, as I am looking at a price list from her private clinic, where add-ons include assisted hatching (red on the HFEA’s list), embryo glue, (amber) and endometrial receptivity array (ERA) for £1,200.I point this out. “We positively discourage assisted hatching,” says Nargund. Embryo glue? “It’s a fantastic name, but it’s a joke.” ERA? “We have used it in the past, but now we have completely stopped.” So why list them, if she does not agree with their use? “Good question,” she says.

But look to social media and it is “Dr” that is making waves.Defending using her academic title for her Twitter account, historian Dr Fern Riddell tweeted: “My title is Dr Fern Riddell, not Ms or Miss Riddell. I have it because I am an expert … I worked hard to earn my authority, and I will not give it up to anyone.” Her replies were promptly filled with men objecting, from checking if she wasn’t imagining her doctorate (“Are you self-certified or do you have accredited qualifications?” asked one) to telling her she was coming across as rude. In solidarity, women with doctorates are now adding Dr to their usernames with the hashtag #immodestwomen.Mansplaining is firmly rooted in the modern sexism lexicon. But as the #immodestwomen trend shows, the world of gender and qualifications goes beyond this: it is not simply that some men who have no knowledge of a subject assume they do, it is that women who actually do have the expertise are told they must act as if they do not. This starts early and persists. How many of us were taught not to “show off” as children? Research shows girls as young as six years old believe that brilliance is a male trait, while boys are more likely to speak up in class even if they do not know as much about the topic as others – a trait that continues into the workplace. I have a PhD in politics and I never use the title for work except when giving lectures at university. My bankcards say “Ms”. I put “Dr” in my Twitter username because I joined the site too late to get any other combination of my name – and felt awkward about it for months afterwards. I always thought this was because I am against hierarchal titles – why do we need titles anyway? – but I know it is as much a case of embarrassed self-deprecation.It is easy to dismiss women using Dr as an insignificant issue, but it speaks to a bid to undermine and belittle female expertise and power, and to keep gendered social roles (strangely, women who put “wife” or “mum” in their Twitter bio rarely report strangers chastising them for that). Tellingly, there is now even a parody account created to mock Dr Riddell, as if to warn other women to “know your place”. Be it a PhD or any skill, there’s something quite satisfying about stopping this downplaying of our talents and hard work – to refuse to conform to the inoffensive and subordinate box some men would still put us in. #Immodestwomen are breaking out."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/405f880fcf9ef7b04a550f49c13d35725c69f208/12_162_2897_1737/master/2897.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2203f2b99f29d6371128c33b3477273e","title":"upskirting government confirms plan to introduce ban","story":"Ministers will introduce legislation after Conservative backbencher blocked private member’s billThe government has confirmed it will introduce legislation to ban upskirting after a Conservative backbencher was berated by party colleagues for blocking a bill to make the practice a specific criminal offence.Downing Street said ministers would adopt the private member’s bill so that the surreptitious taking of sexually intrusive images would be outlawed before the summer recess. Theresa May has come under intense pressure from MPs and the public to push through the law after Tory MP Sir Christopher Chope blocked the bill, which was put forward by the Liberal Democrat MP Wera Hobhouse, last Friday. The prime minister promised on Sunday that the government would take on the legislation, which would create a new criminal offence punishable by up to two years in prison. It followed a campaign by the freelance writer Gina Martin after police declined to prosecute a man accused of taking pictures up her skirt at a music festival in London last summer. May tweeted on Sunday: “Upskirting is an invasion of privacy which leaves victims feeling degraded and distressed. I am disappointed the bill didn’t make progress in the Commons today, and I want to see these measures pass through parliament - with government support – soon.”Cabinet ministers were among those who publicly criticised the move by Chope, whose Commons office door was adorned with a string of knickers on Monday. Homemade knicker bunting was also said to have been hung outside his constituency office in protest. The home secretary, Sajid Javid, had revealed that his daughters would be disappointed and said the law needed to be reformed. The equalities minister, Penny Mordaunt, and the justice secretary, David Gauke, said change would come regardless, while Tory backbenchers were furious at the damage done to the party’s reputation.The Tory MP Simon Clarke said Chope had “embarrassed himself” and “does not speak for me or Conservatives” on the issue, while fellow Dorset MP and defence minister Tobias Ellwood branded him “a dinosaur”. The cabinet on Monday discussed the issue, which typically involves taking a picture of a person’s underwear without their knowledge. However, there was no specific mention of Chope or the potential reform of private members’ bills. The prime minister’s official spokesman said: “The cabinet discussed upskirting, which the prime minister said is an invasion of privacy which leaves victims feeling degraded and distressed.”The Commons leader, Andrea Leadsom, had told colleagues “the measure is one the government supports and has received extensive support both within and outside parliament”.The PM”s spokesman added: “She was pleased to confirm that we will adopt this as a government bill. The aim is to secure second reading as soon as possible and before the summer recess”. Chope, who has regularly obstructed private members’ bills in the past, delayed the voyeurism (offences) bill on upskirting by shouting “object” during its second reading in the Commons, meaning it could not be put through to the next stage without debate and a vote, which will not happen for weeks.The MP for Christchurch said he backed the intent of the bill, and objected to it because he does not support the principle of legislation being passed without debate at second reading. He said he hoped the government would now adopt it.In an interview with his local newspaper, he admitted to being “a bit sore about being scapegoated” over the bill. “The suggestion that I am some kind of pervert is a complete travesty of the truth,” he told the Bournemouth Echo.Chope has also asked why, if the issue was such a priority, ministers had not allowed government time for legislation, rather than in effect squeezing the time available for other backbench bills."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e9b10da30a61f9552a72ee90eb78ba881d10513f/1714_373_1838_1103/master/1838.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c3daf91591425da60ad08c9c0e1a5b92","title":"daily mail poaches new mailonline editor from murdochs fox","story":"Noah Kotch recruited from Fox News Digital to run websiteThe publisher of the Daily Mail has turned to Rupert Murdoch’s Fox News to poach a new chief editor for its websites.Noah Kotch, the editor-in-chief of Fox News Digital, has been named the new editor-in-chief of DailyMail and MailOnline.

How worried should we be? Water seems the most renewable of all the Earth’s resources. It falls from the sky as rain, it surrounds us in the oceans that cover nearly three-quarters of the planet’s surface, and in the polar ice caps and mountain glaciers. It is the source of life on Earth and quite possibly beyond – the discovery of traces of water on Mars aroused excitement because it was the first indication that life may have existed there.The problem is that most of the Earth’s water resources are as inaccessible as if they were on Mars, and those that are accessible are unevenly distributed across the planet. Water is hard to transport over long distances, and our needs are growing, both for food and industry. Everything we do requires water, for drinking, washing, growing food, and for industry, construction and manufacturing. With more than 7.5 billion people on the planet, and the population projected to top 10 billion by 2050, the situation is set to grow more urgent.Currently, 844 million people – about one in nine of the planet’s population – lack access to clean, affordable water within half an hour of their homes, and every year nearly 300,000 children under five die of diarrhoea, linked to dirty water and poor sanitation. Providing water to those who need it is not only vital to human safety and security, but has huge social and economic benefits too. Children lose out on education and adults on work when they are sick from easily preventable diseases. Girls in developing countries are worst off, as they frequently stop going to school at puberty because of a lack of sanitation, and girls and women travelling miles to fetch water or forced to defecate in the open are vulnerable to violence. Providing affordable water saves lives and reduces the burden on healthcare, as well as freeing up economic resources. Every £1 invested in clean water yields at least £4 in economic returns, according to the charity WaterAid.Climate change is bringing droughts and heatwaves across the globe, as well as floods and sea level rises. Pollution is growing, both of freshwater supplies and underground aquifers. The depletion of those aquifers can also make the remaining water more saline. Fertilisers leaching nitrates into the supplies can also make water unsuitable for drinking or irrigation.Cape Town in South Africa provided a stark example of what can happen when water supplies come under threat. For years the city was using more water than it could sustainably supply, and attempts to curb wastage and distribute water supplies more equitably to rich and poor had fallen short of what was needed. By late last year, a crisis point had been reached. The city’s government warned of an imminent day zero, when the water supply would simply run out. Taps would run dry. There would be no more water.In the event, day zero was narrowly averted, in part by public exhortations to use water more efficiently, rationing, changes in practices such as irrigating by night and reusing “grey” water from washing machines or showers, and eventually a new desalination plant.The poor are worst hit. Jonathan Farr, senior policy analyst at WaterAid, says: “Competing demands for water means that those who are poorer or marginalised find it more difficult to get water than the rich and powerful.” Many governments and privatised water companies concentrate their provision on wealthy districts, and prioritise agriculture and industry over poorer people, while turning a blind eye to polluters and those who over-extract water from underground sources. Sharing access to water equitably requires good governance, tight regulation, investment and enforcement, all qualities in short supply in some of the world’s poorest and most water-scarce areas.The number of water-scarce areas is increasing: Cape Town is just the beginning. A ground-breaking new study based on data from the Nasa Grace – Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment – satellites over a 14-year period discovered 19 hotspots around the world where water resources are being rapidly depleted, with potentially disastrous results. They include areas of California, north-western China, northern and eastern India, and the Middle East. Overall, as climate change scientists had predicted, areas of the world already prone to drought were found to be getting drier, and areas that were already wet getting wetter. The authors were uncompromising: the results showed that “water is the key environmental issue of the century,” they said. For instance, he notes, in many remote parts of sub-Saharan Africa, “there may be sufficient supplies of groundwater but there has not been enough investment in service delivery and service management to ensure that people can access this water”.Some of the most effective ways of managing water resources are also the simplest. Plugging leaks in pipes is a good example – ageing or poorly maintained infrastructure wastes vast quantities of water. A dripping tap can leak 300 litres a year. In the UK, the Environment Agency has warned of water shortages across the south-east of the country within a few years, if the 3bn litres a day wasted through leaks – enough for the needs of 20 million people – continues.Water meters for domestic users in developed countries have been controversial, because they can penalise large families which have greater needs. But they provide a readily recognisable gauge to give households more information on their usage, and encourage them not to waste water, particularly as there are readily available technical fixes, from short flush toilets to spray taps and shower heads. Irrigation has enabled farmers even in arid regions to grow a wider variety of crops. Some methods of irrigation are highly inefficient – in hot countries, water sprayed on crops evaporates before it can reach the roots. An alternative is drip irrigation, a system of pipes that delivers water directly to the roots of each plant, but this is also prone to wastage.Traditional methods can also be usefully restored in many regions, adds Marc Stutter, of the James Hutton Institute. He notes that in Rajasthan, in India, restoring traditional small dams called johads enabled the periodic rains to be held before they dissipated across the land. The johads led to “the miraculous revitalisation to a green landscape and the surface water returning”.Advances in sensor technology offer a new way forward. Field sensors, available for as little as $2 a year, can monitor the moisture content in soil, letting farmers know whether irrigation is needed and allowing them to calibrate the irrigation more finely than has previously been possible.Science is also being brought to bear on the crops themselves. Plant biologists are breeding varieties less prone to drought, through natural selection, and in some cases using genetic modification.But science and technology can only go so far. As with most water issues, the biggest problem is still governance and equity. Farmers will grow what they can to turn a profit, and many have little alternative than to use scarce groundwater resources. Without strong governance, this can lead to disaster as the depletion has a widespread effect on the whole local community.Climate change will not only mean more droughts, but also more frequent floods. These can be devastating to agriculture and cities, especially coastal cities already under threat from rising sea levels and stronger storm surges.The World Bank estimates that the damage to cities from flooding will top $1tn by 2050 if strong action is not taken to equip cities to cope with the consequences.Making the world more resilient to flooding involves more than just building walls and barriers such as London’s Thames Barrier, though these are still used. Increasingly, planners are finding ways to “make space for water”, and return to natural protections.For instance, in tropical areas more than a fifth of the mangrove swamps that used to cling to the coastline have been destroyed, cut down to make way for agriculture and aquaculture. Restoring mangroves yields many benefits: they protect inland areas from sea level rises and storm flooding, and provide nurseries for fish, increasing fishing yields. Mangrove restoration projects are now operating in countries from Bangladesh and Indonesia, to Cote d’Ivoire and Suriname.Flood plains and water meadows also provide natural water storage, with land that acts like a sponge to soak up water, releasing it gradually over time. This can prove unpopular with farmers who want to grow crops on such land, but payments from the public purse can offset the cost to them. In the UK, for instance, projects are under way from Historic England and the National Trust.Floating houses are another idea that is taking off, from the Netherlands to south-east Asia. The houses are built on floating platforms instead of foundations, but anchored to the sea or river bed, and a wide variety of modern designs are now available. Projects are already under way as far afield as Lagos and London’s Docklands.Sustainable development goal six from the UN concerns water, stating that safe water and sanitation should be provided to all by 2030. But WaterAid’s Farr notes that at current rates, some countries will miss the deadline by centuries. World governments will meet at the UN this summer to discuss the progress.According to James Famiglietti, co-author of the Nasa Grace study, some of the areas most vulnerable are “already past sustainability tipping points” as their major aquifers are being rapidly depleted, in particular the Arabian peninsula, the north China plain, the Ogallala aquifer under the great plains of the US, the Guarani aquifer in south America, the north-west Sahara aquifer system and others. “When those aquifers can no longer supply water – and some, like the southern half of the Ogallala, may run out by 2050 – where will we be producing our food and where will the water come from?” he asks."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/64003b1c7db0e3fefa3ce81aace1842a19a6e18e/0_0_3500_2518/master/3500.jpg?w=300\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=05813e75fc12ebbe155c024681498684","title":"new lords defeat for government on brexit meaningful vote amendment","story":"Landslide vote by peers, including 22 Tory rebels, sets up another Commons showdownThe government has been defeated in a landslide Lords vote which will set up another Commons showdown over an amendment to give MPs a “meaningful vote” even if the government fails to reach a Brexit deal.The House of Lords voted in favour of a new amendment, devised by Tory MP and pro-EU rebel Dominic Grieve and tabled by Viscount Hailsham, by a significantly bigger margin than the last time the issue was debated. The amendment was passed by 354 votes to 235 – a majority of 119.Michael Heseltine, Chris Patten and Sayeeda Warsi were among the 22 Tory peers who rebelled and backed the amendment.Hailsham, the former Conservative cabinet minister Douglas Hogg, tabled the last-minute amendment on Monday morning, based on the deal Grieve believed he had struck with the solicitor general, Robert Buckland, in order to avert a government defeat in the Commons by pro-EU Tories.Grieve said later he was double-crossed and the government went back on the agreement they had reached. Ministers tabled an amendment that would mean a vote only on a neutral motion, which would give MPs no power to halt a cliff-edge Brexit – a change that Grieve said meant the compromise was unacceptable.Hailsham tabled an amendment which he said was based on the original deal, dubbed “Grieve 2”, which he said would give MPs the chance to vote in parliament, even in the event of “no deal”. Speaking in the House of Lords, Hailsham said: “I am asking your lordships to make a decision to enable a House of Commons to vote on what Mr Grieve believes was agreed with the government.”Hailsham said Grieve was a man “of the utmost personal and professional integrity” and said he accepted his version of events “without reservation”. He said the government’s offer “not only fails to deliver a promised ‘meaningful vote’... but is far worse. It is seeking to make it impossible. It deliberately removes the possibility.”Under the new amendment, ministers must update parliament by 21 January 2019 if there is no prospect of a deal with the EU and then have two weeks to return to the House of Commons with a statement on how the government plans to proceed. MPs would then be given a vote on whether to approve the action in statement.The Commons will vote on the revised amendment on Wednesday, though government sources have said they are confident Tory rebels do not have the numbers for it to pass.The House of Lords leader, Natalie Evans, had urged peers to reject the amendment. “It is not right that your lordships’ house could have a veto on the deal simply by refusing to consider a motion,” she said, saying the alternative amendment by Hailsham contained “major flaws”.Several former Tory cabinet ministers also spoke out against the amendment. Former party leader Michael Howard said the amendment “would be to confer upon parliament a negotiation power which has always resided in the hands of the executive in our country”. Former chancellor Norman Lamont said the amendment was unnecessary because parliament would always have the power to act in the event of no deal. “Obviously it would come to parliament, obviously it would be a major event,” he said. “Do we really have to write it down with all these complicated provisions?”The meaningful vote is now the only unresolved issue after peers agreed not to pursue further challenges on other key issues such as membership of a customs union. At the report stage of the bill, peers inflicted 15 defeats on the government.Angela Smith, Labour’s leader in the House of Lords, defended the scrutiny that the EU withdrawal bill had come under, calling the original legislation “deeply flawed and isive”.“We’ve seen a fair bit of sabre rattling from some of the most enthusiastic of Brexiteers and supporters,” she said, saying the drama did “nothing to improve the quality of debate or journalistic integrity”.Smith said she did not believe the Lords should engage in extensive “ping pong” between the Lords and the Commons lightly, but said matters are “clearly and obviously unresolved in the House of Commons”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fb5f4e4db7d5f1941d1dc57315f5ac0480fd9e4f/0_0_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6c52340ab6664dfe2a10cff2f6869675","title":"uk to unveil details of plans for eu citizens who wish to remain","story":"Ministers planning to publish ‘statement of intent’ on settled status scheme for UK’s 3.4 million EU citizensThe UK government will this week unveil the first details of the “settled status” immigration scheme that will apply to Britain’s 3.4 million EU citizens if they want to stay in the country after Brexit.It is planning to publish a “statement of intent” on Thursday, which will be the first sight of the registration system that the former home secretary Amber Rudd has previously said would be “as easy as setting up an online account at LK Bennett”.“After two years and five months before they are supposed to launch the registration process, it is good that we are finally going to find out the details of settled status,” said Nicolas Hatton, the co-founder of the3million, the campaign group lobbying on behalf of EU citizens. The statement of intent will list some of the evidence EU citizens will need to provide the Home Office to prove they are eligible to stay in the UK after it exits the EU but it will not be the final blueprint.“It will be like a consultation paper. It will say this is the law, this is what we think it will do and how it might change post-Brexit and it will invite people to consult with it to tell if it has got some things wrong or has left gaps,” said an informed source. Last year Theresa May issued a direct appeal to EU citizens living in the UK to stay in the country, saying: “I couldn’t be clearer: EU citizens living lawfully in the UK today will be able to stay.”Despite her assurances activists campaigning for the retention of all rights for EU citizens in the country have warned that the settled status immigration category created by the government to cover them still contains flaws and reduces the number of rights they currently have.“We will of course comment on it, but our main message to the government is that if they genuinely want EU citizens to stay they must remove all barriers in the registration process and make it free,” added Hatton.The government has promised that the new system will be “streamlined” and “light touch” and will draw on existing HMRC and national insurance records. But there are major concerns that the scheme is being run by the Home Office, which campaign groups say they do not trust, particularly after a series of mistakes last year which resulted in EU citizens being threatened with deportation and the more recent Windrush debacle.

The charity wants the government to create a £200m-a-year community ownership fund for the next five years to help preserve the buildings and spaces for the use of local people. Tony Armstrong, its chief executive, said: “This is a sell-off on a massive scale. We know that many of the buildings being lost have valuable community uses. “Everyone of us can think of a local public building or outside space we love and use, from libraries to lidos and town halls to youth centres. They are owned by the public and they’re being sold off for short-term gain to fill holes in council budgets. “Many hundreds of local community groups are stepping up and fighting for community ownership. But they urgently need support and help with startup costs if they are to compete with the commercial developers.” Faced with the need to make savings of £90m over the next three years, Liverpool city council has decided to sell the Grade II*-listed Municipal Buildings, having deemed the 150-year-old structure “surplus to requirements”. One bidder wants to turn it into a five-star hotel.The council has approved a deal with developer Mastcraft to turn the Grade II-listed building into a 140-bed boutique hotel. The deal is for a 245-year lease but the council will retain the east wing for civic use.A plan for the Far East Consortium to redevelop the 1935 Grade II*-listed building, reputed to be the venue where in 1971 Queen played their first\u0026nbsp​concert, was approved in October. Despite a petition signed by nearly 7,000 people, the £27m sale is due to be confirmed next month.The Victorian baths, dating from 1904, have been sold to private-equity firm Castleforge Partners, which says the building will house an art gallery, offices, affordable workspaces, pop-ups, shops, cafés, a health centre and food stalls.The historic Grade II-listed former theatre, where Laurel\u0026nbsp​and Hardy, Nina Simone and George Formby performed, was sold at auction for £325,000 last year after an attempt by the Friends of Hulme Hippodrome to get it listed as an asset of community value was rejected by the council.Built in 1891, the Victorian building fell into disrepair and was empty. A group of residents came together to save the institute in 2014 when Kirklees council was selling off publicly owned buildings. It now includes a library, a fully accessible post office, an office for Meltham town council, offices for local firms and start-ups and a school of dance, as well as three large spaces used by community groups.The oldest Grade II-listed baths still open for public swimming in the UK were set to close in July 2017 but the Edwardian building has remained open as a communit-run venue.The 650-foot Victorian pier used to ferry passengers to the opposite bay was left unused and in disrepair for many years. Thanks to local people buying shares for £25 each, £62,000 was raised and the pier was saved in February this year.Horton Chapel, a Grade II-listed Edwardian chapel built as part of the then new Horton Asylum and designed to accommodate hundreds of patients and staff, stood vacant for many years. In 2016, the Horton Chapel Arts and Heritage Society came together to save it as a not-for-profit art centre.The 1930s Grade II-listed swimming pool complex was closed by the council in 2009 but it has since agreed to give community ownership to a group of local residents, the Byrne Avenue Trust.The Great British Sell Off report is published on Tuesday and is based on freedom of information requests sent to all 353 local authorities in England. Locality received 55 responses on the number of buildings and spaces sold between the financial years 2012-13 and 2016-17, as well as 127 replies about sites identified as surplus over the next five years, extrapolating the results to obtain national totals. Only two fifths of councils (based on 233 responses) said they had a strategy to support community ownership, known as a community asset transfer policy. Locality wants all councils to have one of these policies, giving community groups first right of refusal to buy public buildings and for them to have a year, rather than six months, to draw up a proposal.In Hastings residents were left furious on Saturday after it was confirmed the town’s pier had been sold to a businessman for a fraction of what it cost to rebuild. Sheikh Abid Gulzar reportedly paid £50,000, while the Friends of Hastings Pier group had raised £477,000 of its £500,000 target to buy it.In West Yorkshire, residents are trying to save the former Dewsbury Museum, closed by the council in 2016 after 120 years owing to financial pressures. Jax Lovelock, who chairs the Dewsbury Park Mansion community hub, said the aim was for the building to be used for health and wellbeing services, as well as space for startups and community events. “Over the last 10 to 15 years, our town as well as towns all over the country have had their civic hearts stripped out of them,” she said. “Communities will get off their backsides and do things for themselves but they need that guidance and support to be able to do that.”Locality said austerity was to blame for the sell-off, a view shared by the Local Government Association. Richard Watts, who chairs the LGA’s resources board, said: “Local councillors, elected by local people, understand the deep connection communities have with their public spaces and buildings. If we are to be able to maintain them and fund frontline services, the government must address our funding shortfall of over £5bn a year by 2020 as soon as possible.”A spokesman for the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government said councils had £90.7bn to spend on local services over the next two years, which they were responsible for spending wisely. He added: “All local authorities must properly consider the risks and opportunities before making commercial decisions.“We are working with local government to develop a funding system for the future based on the needs of different areas.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/16ae164981315e91a15528142794c75c7ce8e983/9_142_3854_2313/master/3854.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=862c854a2598df65cf4f832a0d1bbb4c","title":"alex hales england australia third odi trent bridge preview","story":"• ‘I’m the one who drops out once Stokes comes back’• Australia will welcome back pace bowler Billy StanlakeAlex Hales has scored more hundreds since the last World Cup than any Australian batsman touring England this summer and yet heads into Tuesday’s third one-dayer, on his home ground of Trent Bridge, knowing big runs are needed from him and fast.It is telling of the relative strengths of the two sides in this series, one England can now wrap up at the earliest opportunity, that Hales would likely stroll into the visiting XI and yet will be fall guy for the hosts when Ben Stokes returns from a hamstring injury next month.Hales has scored five centuries in the past three years but, having relinquished his opening spot last summer following the Bristol nightclub incident and with Jason Roy and Jonny Bairstow blazing a trail as the first-choice pairing, he knows it is time to deliver.“I’m on the fringes and any chance I can get it’s up to me to convert big runs and put some pressure on Jason Roy and Jonny Bairstow,” said Hales, who has one half-century in three innings at No 3 this summer. While Eoin Morgan is due to return after the back spasm that meant he missed Saturday’s win in Cardiff, Stokes will train with the team in Durham and Manchester this week with a view to playing in July’s Twenty20s and one-dayers against India. The prognosis for England’s second casualty, Chris Woakes, is less positive.The Warwickshire seamer is recovering from a torn quad muscle suffered in the second Test against Pakistan but a longstanding issue in his right knee has flared up since. As it stands, Woakes is battling to face India with the white ball and may well see the target for his return shifted to the Test series in August.That England have coped so far without the pair (a mauling by Scotland’s batsmen notwithstanding) is telling of their strength and Australia’s clear weakness. Tim Paine’s confused-looking side pitch up after 13 defeats from their past 15 completed one-day matches and having plunged to a 34-year low ranking of sixth in the world.Without the suspended David Warner, Aaron Finch is their most successful batsman since they lifted the World Cup at home in March 2015 with four centuries. Despite significant success from opener – not least versus England, against whom he averages 50 – the right-hander was stationed at No 5 in Cardiff for the first time and duly returned a duck.Should England, ranked No 1 in the world, be the template? “They play their own way. They go ultra-hard up top, rely on their spin a lot through the middle overs. If we tried to copy that, it would be foolish because we play in a different style.“But we’ve won a lot of World Cups – we’ve got some guys in our changing room that have won them. What we do is right. We know it’s right. But time will tell.”Australia are expected to welcome back the 6ft 8in Billy Stanlake to their attack after missing out on Saturday with a cut toe and Paine has been cleared to play by a dentist following the gory dislodged tooth suffered when struck by a ball during the 38-run defeat.Trent Bridge is the scene of Paine’s only one-day international century, back in 2009 when, from opener, he struck 111 during what eventually became a 6-1 series victory for the tourists. How the tables have turned since."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/12c2def368deb53ba1d41e967f0c8b1888face3a/0_109_3314_1988/master/3314.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=77a5d9386ed8774a25c08e7fc3b1614c","title":"andy murray comeback nick kyrgios queens","story":"• Former World No 1 confident he will not re-injure hip• ‘I didn’t want to get back on court until I could compete’Nick Kyrgios says he regards Andy Murray as “one of my better mates on tour” and the feeling is undoubtedly mutual but the Australian arrives here in the sort of form that could destroy the former world No 1 when he makes his comeback on Tuesday.Kyrgios, who frightened the life out of Roger Federer in a thrilling three-set semi-final in Stuttgart on Saturday, said of Murray’s absence since Wimbledon last year: “It’s been pretty shitty without him. I’m looking forward to going out there and playing. But to see him healthy is obviously the main thing. He’s awesome for the sport.”They have both struggled with injuries over the past year, Murray risking surgery on his hip in January to save his career, Kyrgios dealing with a recurring elbow problem that seems to have finally left him in peace – as he has done with Murray.“We kept in touch a little bit but he’s a busy man,” Kyrgios said. “The last thing he wants is to see me blowing up his phone. Probably can’t take me seriously. My elbow is fine. I have zero pain now and I played three quality matches in Stuttgart. Obviously I was pretty disappointed I didn’t win against Roger but it was a good match. I was in complete control in the third-set tie-break at one stage. I’m feeling good. My level is still there.“I know he’s going to make a lot of balls. He loves playing on grass. I know how he plays. I watched a little of him today in practice. He looked fine.”Murray, who has won this title five times, returns after 11 months away hoping just to be competitive. “There’s never a time when you feel perfect,” he told the BBC. “It’s not a gamble in terms that I’m going to re-injure my hip. But if I missed the grasscourt season and tried to play in five weeks’ time the same doubts would be there.“You re-evaluate. You find that out by being out there. It’s very different from the controlled environment of the practice court. I didn’t want to get back on the match court until I felt I could compete. Hopefully the body responds well. I expect to be a bit stiff and sore after it.He said the medical feedback after his operation in January has been, “really positive” but no surgeon could assess his match fitness.Earlier Stan Wawrinka, one of a slew of leading players trying to keep their bodies in one piece for Wimbledon in a fortnight, looked as strong as ever when he thrashed Britain’s Cameron Norrie on the Queen’s grass in less than an hour, 6-2, 6-3.Norrie, who has risen to 80 in the world in his first full season on Tour, struggled to cope with Wawrinka’s power from hand and off the ground in the first set, and never properly got into the contest in the first round of the Fever-Tree Championships.Wawrinka, a three-times grand slam winner, quickly reminded Norrie of his pedigree when he broke for 3-1 and held as the second set slipped quickly from the Briton’s grasp.Norrie served through deuce in the seventh game to stay alive, calmly putting away a forehand volley, but there was not a lot he could do about the Swiss’s serve, as Wawrinka held to love with his 13th ace of the match. It was a chastening experience for the British No 2.“He managed his serve very well,” Norrie said. “It was tough for me to get into the rallies. I didn’t serve that great. I didn’t really feel comfortable on my feet. I felt like out on the corners I was going to slip and I didn’t really want to tear up my hip or anything.”That could be a warning for Murray on the lush grass that has often upended players early in the tournament. Wawrinka, who had two knee operations last year, said courtside: “In general it has been improving week after week. I feel strong physically but you need to be patient, ready to accept the frustration of not playing your best tennis. It’s never easy on the grass. But today was great.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/40d85bc70ddab20ab2247420bf3cfeef42b1b2da/0_161_4656_2794/master/4656.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6e0c9c49bf11f87b61b1ca337c230cbf","title":"romanised st james palace stakes royal ascot","story":"• Winner of Irish 2,000 Guineas looks a good bet at 5-1• Without Parole is too short-priced and best avoidedThere is a lot to be said for latching on to a star horse before every other punter has spotted his talent but an excess of faith can be expensive, a lesson which possibly awaits those who have made Without Parole favourite for the St James’s Palace Stakes. The highlight race on day one of Royal Ascot generally features a clash between Classic winners but this colt is stepping straight up from Listed company and, while he might be able to manage it with John Gosden’s help, odds of 11-4 make no appeal.A more orthodox favourite would be Romanised (4.20), winner of the Irish 2,000 Guineas and beaten by only Masar, the Derby winner, when he last came to Britain in September. I don’t think there was any fluke about his Curragh win last month, when he produced a really strong finish to reel in U S Navy Flag.On a fast surface here that rival could pinch a handy lead off the home turn but Romanised is the way to bet at 5-1. Tip Two Win can go well again but might lack the necessary finishing kick.2.30 Queen Anne Stakes Few trainers would be more grateful for a big win at this Royal Ascot than Saeed bin Suroor, who has made a quiet start to the European flat‑racing season, while Godolphin’s other Newmarket yard produced the goods in the Derby. Bin Suroor fields Benbatl, whose Dubai Turf success in March is just about the best form on offer. But horses who have a busy Dubai campaign early in the year cannot always be relied on in midsummer, so a better option might be the progressive French raider Recoletos. From an in-form yard he delivered a career‑best performance to win the Ispahan last month and he travelled well for a long way behind Cracksman in the Champion Stakes before failing to stay. Rhododendron had everything fall right for her in the Lockinge.3.05 Coventry Stakes Calyx is the sexy one but his killer pace might not play so well in a strongly run race. Sergei Prokofiev is a short price for a horse stepping up in distance, so the suggestion is the imposing Cosmic Law, who showed a lot of improvement to land the Woodcote.3.40 King’s Stand Stakes Possibly continuing a good day for French raiders, Finsbury Square could outrun big odds. He produced a career best on his first run since joining Mauricio Delcher Sanchez, who won this race 10 years ago with Equiano. Whether Finsbury Square can repeat that effort to score at Chantilly a fortnight ago is one question that must be answered but he was beaten only three lengths in the Diamond Jubilee last year and any improvement would make him very dangerous.Tips by Chris Cook.5.00 Ascot Handicap Place prize money has been Coeur De Lion’s speciality in marathon Flat handicaps but he was a shade unlucky when a rival got first run on him at Chester last time and the cheekpieces fitted that day can help him again.5.35 Wolferton Stakes Beaten just half a length in a strong handicap last month, Sharja Bridge was well clear of the third and is ready for this step up into Listed company."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ed2314c9391b5aded4646c4645f1f748e8f23f36/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=628229e9842bf4223dcb16dc895afde3","title":"david dimbleby question time host a look at the candidates","story":"Kirsty Wark is the bookies’ favourite, but there is a long list of contenders to take over the coveted BBC hosting jobFor the first time in a quarter of a century, Question Time is hunting for a new host – or chairman, to give it its proper title – with David Dimbleby announcing he will step down from the role later this year. Given that the job is arguably the most high-profile hosting gig in British political TV, the hunt to find Dimbleby’s replacement is already the subject of rampant speculation, with the great and good of news broadcasting being tipped for the role.What is certain is that whoever takes on the job will follow formidable footsteps: Dimbleby is widely considered to have revived the fortunes of Question Time, which was considered a lame duck when he was appointed in 1994, and the broadcaster has attained a cross-generational cult status in his 25 years at the helm. Here are the runners and riders to replace him.Ahmed has already issued a forthright come-and-get-me plea to the Question Time higher-ups via Twitter, one that does a robust job of pointing out her credentials. “I have 2 awards for journalism, 28 years in the broadcast news biz, including 11 at C4 News, currently presenting @newswatchbbc \u0026amp @BBCFrontRow \u0026amp an honorary fellow of St Edmund Hall, Oxford. I’m v well qualified to present @bbcquestiontime \u0026amp I’d like to be seriously considered,” she wrote. Ahmed has since tweeted that she has been assured she is under consideration, although you suspect that a lack of a blue-chip presenting gig at the BBC might count against her.Arguably the least recognisable figure among the frontrunners, Barnett makes up for her lack of name recognition with a growing reputation as a tough moderator. A former women’s editor at the Daily , she has spent recent years gaining a broadcast education in the bruising world of talk radio, first on LBC and most recently on the mid-morning show on BBC Radio 5 Live. She received rave reviews for her tough interviewing of guests on both sides of the political ide while covering as host of The Andrew Marr Show earlier this year. The former 5 Live host’s transition from radio to television in 2015 was not the easiest. Her daytime show, described by the BBC News chief, James Harding, as the “centrepiece of domestic daytime TV news” before it aired, drew in a paltry 73,000 viewers in its first 10 shows. But since then she has established herself as a daytime alternative to the Jeremy Kyle ratings grabbers. From her background in lifestyle journalism, Derbyshire shifted gears with fearless interviewing (like her set-to with Ken Clarke), which could mean the Question Time bosses see her as authoritative and dogged enough for the BBC’s flagship political debate programme.Could the Channel 4 anchor make the switch back to the beeb? It might not be that much of a leap. Guru-Murthy started his professional life as a host of a debate show on the BBC, but he has a bit of previous when it comes to upsetting Auntie. He was criticised for his grilling of the then BBC One controller Charlotte Moore at the Edinburgh festival in 2014 and his reputation as an aggressive and sometimes ruthless interviewer may not be quite what the Question Time bosses want as they look to transition from an ever-dependable like Dimbleby.Now firmly established as a lead presenter on the Today programme, Husain was promoted to Dimbleby’s main presenting team for the 2017 general election coverage and handed the plum role of conducting the first joint interview with Prince Harry and Meghan Markle late last year. She would undoubtedly be a progressive choice for a hosting gig that has been exclusively white and male she is currently the 101 joint-third-favourite for the job with Ladbrokes. She has proved adept at keeping politicians in check, too: witness her still impressive shushing of Boris Johnson (“Please stop talking!”) in 2017. Maitlis hit the headlines last summer after interviewing the prime minister in the aftermath of the Grenfell Tower disaster and suggesting that she had misread the public anger over the incident. Maitlis had previously spent time at the site sorting donations from members of the public before being told, at short notice, that the prime minister was heading to the BBC for an interview. She has since said her anger was because it “was no longer an intellectual exercise”. A Newsnight host since 2005, Maitlis spent weeks on the road in the US covering the last presidential election and the subsequent fallout after Donald Trump won. At one point, she managed to convince short-lived White House communications director Anthony Scaramucci to appear on the programme by grabbing him as he walked up to the building. A frontrunner for the Question Time job, she has broad name recognition and is not afraid to take controls of a fierce debate.The famously aggressive interviewer quit Newsnight in 2014, but he remains one of the most recognisable current affairs presenters in the UK. Since then, he has dabbled with political programmes on Channel 4 to mixed reviews and continued to present University Challenge on the BBC. However, he also become increasingly critical of the corporation, saying such organisations “are vulnerable to consultants and other snake-oil vendors when the top management hasn’t much clue what day of the week it is”. Paxman lost out to Dimbleby in 1993, the last time the job was up for grabs, and he has made no secret of his desire to do the job. If the corporation decides to go for an established male presenter, it is possible they would consider Andrew Neil, who currently hosts the surreal politics show This Week, which airs after Question Time on Thursday nights.The Newsnight veteran is the clear frontrunner with the bookies to replace Dimbleby. Authoritative, combative when necessary and comfortable interviewing Quentin Tarantino or a world leader, Wark has been one of the BBC’s premier interviewers for more than two decades. A prominent voice in the wage equality debate, she recently spoke about the marginalisation of older women in the media. “Why shouldn’t there be representation of women well into their 70s and beyond?” she asked in 2015. “David Dimbleby is a fine broadcaster, but he’s heading in that direction. So why can’t we have women on television who are also heading in that direction?” There have been loud calls for Dimbleby’s replacement to be a woman and it is hard to see past Wark as the ideal candidate. Who would your choice be?

The man sitting next to me was spouting off whatever he believes, which I don’t agree with, and I was trying to stand up for my views, and the right for women to march.”She suggested men who believed they had a right to give her instructions on her politics should reconsider. “I had men telling me it was my fault he was saying this,” she said. “And I was just like, I’ve had enough of men telling me how I should be a feminist. I’ve had enough of it.”In the interview, Reid also talked about how she considered the presenters on BBC Breakfast – which she quit for the ITV show – more lovable than Morgan. She said: “For me it’s not all about ‘we’ve got to beat them’. I’m quite nervous of conflict, I don’t like it.“I don’t think everybody necessarily wants a double espresso shot straight into their veins in the morning. Some people want a nice cup of tea. And there is absolutely a role for both.”Reid said she had a “constant battle for airtime” with Morgan, because “sometimes I open my mouth to ask a question and hear Piers’s voice come out”.Reid has previously said her outspoken co-host “reduces me to tears”.She told the magazine that when he joined the show “I was like … Arghhh! … sitting next to a hedgehog,” and she struggled with their relationship until early last year.She said she “felt kind of responsible for what he thought” but now realised “he can say anything he likes. I don’t have to pick up the pieces.”Reid said she did not know how much Morgan was paid. He is said to have a bigger salary. “I have no reason to be complaining about my pay. I’m well paid,” Reid said.

Music can provide handy shortcuts in sound to these locations, too. A wobble of surf guitar – wham – you’re in a Pacific picture postcard. A swagger of slow, southern rap – you’re cruising down Ocean Drive. Alongside the tons of sun-spun US classics, there are lesser-known scorchers too, so let’s wind down the windows for all of them, and let the speakers run hot.Let’s begin with the “king of the surf guitar” himself, Dick Dale, who was born in the entirely inappropriate northern outpost of Boston, Massachusetts. Misirlou began life as a slow, Arabic song from the Mediterranean, first released in the US by Turkish singer Theodotos “Tetos” Demetriades in 1927. Dale sped up the track like a Cadillac bombing down an ocean highway. Next up are the Beach Boys – of course – introducing us to the Californian dreams that they made in pop’s early days. Instead of Surfin’ USA and Surfer Girl, enjoy this gorgeous 1963 album track, which summons up the magical aura of American beach life: “Smell the warm and salty air  See a wave reflect a beam ... Make it real your summer dream.”Then let’s have Marlena Shaw, and the west coast’s own surfside creation myth. “And if you listen carefully  The winds that ride  On the high tide  Whistle a melody,” Shaw explains. “So the people started to sing  And that’s how the surf gave birth untold  To California soul.” A dubious theory, Marlena, but when you’re wearing sunglasses, it’s totally convincing. After that euphoric rush, let’s go for full American heat with Jan Hammer’s Miami Vice Theme, guitars forcing balmy winds through your lustrous 80s hair, and hot, shiny synths rolling up your jacket sleeves.Catch your breath with the Thrills – whose Deckchairs and Cigarettes is an ode to the slowed-down loveliness of San Diego and the soft glow of youth – and the beauty of Through My Sails from Neil Young and Crazy Horse’s Zuma. Named after LA’s long, sandy beach, the album ends on this beautiful, seaside song: “I’m standing on the shoreline  It’s so fine out there,” they sing. We hear more of these feelings in Miley Cyrus’s Malibu, from her latest album Younger Now, where peace comes from the ocean, literally and metaphorically: “Next to you  The sky is so blue  In Malibu.”Now it’s time to wind down as the sun slowly sets. Before we do, let’s remember that the biggest summer hit of recent years was made in Miami. The earwormy Spanish guitars and sweet nothings of Luis Fonsi and Daddy Yankee’s Despacito took it to No 1 for a record-breaking 16 weeks in the US. Then we fade out with two more beachside classics, all about the memories and promises the golden shores of America give us: Don Henley’s the Boys of Summer and the Mamas and Papas’ California Dreamin’. Even when the sun goes down, we’ll be safe and warm with these songs. Our love for them will still be strong.For more inspiration and to book your trip to the US, visit bausa"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dd84e2e39b4ac5870c61a1ab52055bd6cbfb7517/0_384_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=10472673534ba47aa11bdcedb6d38955","title":"pacific hymns the definitive hipster playlist","story":"Seattle, Portland and San Fran aren’t just cities – they’re states of mind, man. So if you’re looking for counterculture sounds, it’s here you’ll find songs that spoke for a generationImmersion in Seattle’s music scene begins minutes after disembarking at Sea-Tac, the city’s international airport, which houses a store devoted to the record company Sub Pop. In 1988, the then shoestring Sub Pop Records released Nirvana’s debut single it subsequently became as synonymous with Seattle as Motown is with Detroit. Opening our hipster playlist is Nirvana’s fourth single, Smells Like Teen Spirit, released three years later. It became a massive hit across the world, igniting the rock phenomenon that would transform Seattle, a hitherto obscure enclave in America’s far north-west, into an epicentre of cool.Previous generations of Seattle musicians took for granted that they would have to leave their hometown if they wanted a successful career. Arguably the greatest electric guitarist of all-time, Jimi Hendrix is up next – he was born and raised in Seattle, although only found fame after moving to London.Right now, Seattle’s music has never been so rich or erse. Witness the contrast of Fleet Foxes’ Sun it Rises, a yearning choral-Americana hymn to frontier spirits, with avant-hip-hop duo Shabazz Palaces. Shine a Light hails from their futuristic twin Quazarz album – released in 2017 by a certain indie record label with its own airport shop.Portland has become renowned in recent years for its ultra-progressive attitudes – as satirised by the comedy series Portlandia – but the city’s hippy roots have long attracted free-thinkers from all over America. Emerging from the city’s early 90s underground rock scene with his disarmingly catchy dark-folk confessionals was Elliott Smith. Here, we trace the Texan native’s troubled quest around Portland in Needle in the Hay.Other musicians who rocked up in Portland included feminist trio Sleater-Kinney, formed in the Washington state capital Olympia during the mid-90s, by guitarists Corin Tucker and Carrie Brownstein, alongside drummer Janet Weiss. From their 2015 comeback album, No Cities to Love confounds the adage that radical voices mellow with age – or, in the case of Portlandia co-creator Brownstein, fame.Next up, we have the Shins, who formed in New Mexico but became Portland residents following their 2002 breakthrough hit New Slang (as featured in the film Garden State). Then, Laura Veirs – who was called to the city via Colorado and the midwest to craft her contemplative modern-folk tapestries – offers a revelatory version of the Grateful Dead song Mountains of the Moon, from her latest album the Lookout.The Grateful Dead were, of course, a flagship band for 60s counterculture. From San Fran, tremors from the Summer of Love rippled up the west coast of the US – and then around the world. While the Dead were busy soundtracking Ken Kesey’s Acid Tests, the 1967 Haight-Ashbury scene’s commercial powerhouse was Jefferson Airplane, a relatively straightforward folk-rock band until the recruitment of siren vocalist Grace Slick. Her vocals on White Rabbit – with its exhortation to “feed your head” – alongside other songs, such as Somebody to Love, helped the tracks become anthems for the ages.A decade later, the punk revolution was under way, and San Francisco’s North Beach district harboured the latest manifestation of the city’s nonconformist heritage: the Dead Kennedys. They deployed caustic satire in songs like California Über Alles to debunk mainstream American culture and politics.Our penultimate track is Why Won’t You Stay, by one of San Francisco’s greatest songwriters, Mark Eitzel, chronicler of the city’s luckless and heartbroken for the past 30 years – both with legendary band American Music Club, notably on Everclear (Rolling Stone’s Best Album of 1991), and in his more recent solo work. Eitzel’s lachrymose voice is the perfect accompaniment to a Mission bar crawl.Carrying the city’s freak flag proudly into the present day to round off our playlist are Thee Oh Sees, a twin-drummer psychedelic juggernaut led by wild-eyed John Dwyer – proof that San Fran isn’t merely a place, it’s also a state of mind.For more inspiration and to book your trip to the US, visit bausa"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d3b0a3ad9763f7ca9ffc8f8b40a531c36319d954/0_0_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=05ab5db47aa2c03110c0c1affd8e0257","title":"why are families being separated at the us border explainer","story":"The Trump administration’s ‘zero-tolerance’ policy has led to almost 2,000 children being separated from their familiesIn April, the US attorney general, Jeff Sessions, announced a “zero-tolerance” policy, stating “our goal is to prosecute every case that is brought to us”. Under the Trump administration’s new enforcement policy, every migrant who crosses the border illegally – even those seeking asylum in the US – is subject to criminal prosecution.Since children are not allowed to be held in a federal jail, they are taken from their parents and placed in the care of the Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR).Almost 2,000 children have been separated from their families at the US southern border over a six-week period during a crackdown on illegal entries, according to the Department of Homeland Security. A DHS spokesman told reporters last week that 1,995 minors were separated from 1,940 adults between 19 April and 31 May 2018. Immigrant advocacy groups, however, say hundreds more have been separated since at least July 2017.After being separated from their parents, the children – some as young as 18 months – are then treated as “unaccompanied alien children”, a category which exists primarily to serve children who voluntarily arrive at the border on their own. Unaccompanied alien children are placed in the custody of ORR within 72 hours of being apprehended by border agents. They then wait, in government-run facilities, for weeks or months while agency officials search for relatives or sponsors to care for the child while their immigration case is pending.Reporters who have toured the facilities where families are separated by border patrol officers describe hundreds of children waiting in cages with concrete floors, kept away from their families. One immigration advocate told the Associated Press that a teenager helped care for a young child she didn’t know because the child’s aunt was somewhere else in the facility. The teen said she had to show others in her cell how to change the girl’s diaper.In the shelters, children are offered toys and books. But Colleen Kraft, the president, American Academy of Pediatrics, who toured a shelter in a border town in Texas, described children in distress. “Separating children from their parents contradicts everything we stand for as pediatricians – protecting and promoting children’s health,” she wrote after her visit. “In fact, highly stressful experiences, like family separation, can cause irreparable harm, disrupting a child’s brain architecture and affecting his or her short and long-term health.”The system is already overburdened, dating back to 2014 when tens of thousands of Central American “unaccompanied minors” fleeing violence and poverty in their home countries arrived at the Texas border. Advocates for children have said they do not know how to find parents, who are more likely to have important information about why the family is fleeing its home country. And if, for instance, a parent is deported, there is no clear way for them to ensure their child is deported with them.When an influx of families and unaccompanied children from Central America arrived at the border in 2014, Barack Obama’s administration detained families.This was harshly criticized and a federal court in 2015 stopped the government from holding families for months without explanation. Instead, they were released while they waited for their immigration cases to be heard in court. Not everyone shows up for those court dates, leading the Trump administration to condemn what it calls a “catch and release” program.Donald Trump has repeatedly and falsely blamed the widely condemned practice on Democrats – even though officials in his administration have publicly advocated for it.Sessions, the attorney general, has argued that family separation is necessary to deter migrants from trying to cross the border illegally. John Kelly, Trump’s chief of staff, defended the practice in an interview, arguing that the “name of the game is deterrence”. In a rare statement on policy, Melania Trump said she “hates to see children separated from their families”. But she also blamed “both sides” for the current situation, echoing her husband’s inaccurate claim that Democrats are responsible for her husband’s policy.The administration is facing increasing pressure from prominent lawmakers in both parties as well as human rights groups, religions leaders and immigration advocates to halt the practice of separating families. In a scathing op-ed in the Washington Post, Laura Bush, the wife of former president George W Bush, wrote that the zero-tolerance policy was “cruel” and “immoral”.“These images are eerily reminiscent of the Japanese American internment camps of World War II, now considered to have been one of the most shameful episodes in US history,” she wrote. Republican lawmakers say they want to address the practice of family separation in a wider immigration bill but its prospects of passing are unlikely.

Second were controllers in Greece, with 46 days, followed by Italy, with 37 days and Germany, with four days.For several months, France’s 4,000 air traffic controllers have been engaged in a series of strikes to protest against staff cuts and a lack of up-to-date technology, blamed on a “lack of investment”.French controllers are trained at the National Civil Aviation School where the state pays them just under the minimum wage while studying on condition that they sign up for at least 10 years on graduating. They can earn about €5,000 a month and generally work a three-days-on, three-days-off rota. “Everything suggests the situation will only become worse in the years to come and strong solutions must be put in place right away to bring things up to scratch as soon as possible,” Capo-Canellas said.The good news, he added, was that safety was still given total priority.

Since last year, as an experiment to reach more male customers, the store has been home to The Huddle, a male bonding group which meets Tuesday nights after closing to work out, run, or meditate.But once a month, the men circle up to talk about, well, their feelings.Downtempo jazz and cartons of maple sap water greeted me as I plunked myself down next to a young man who recently quit his job to become a freelance cinematographer. The evening’s facilitator, Alex Cameron, a man with hulking, tattoo-plastered arms and slicked-back salt-and-pepper hair, told us the theme for this session: emotional literacy. Cameron, who is 40, runs a psychotherapy practice nearby.To start off, Joe, a slight man in a hoodie, volunteered a story about how he came to realize that vulnerability was a strength rather than weakness. “I’ve never shared this in front of a group before,” said Joe, 34, who told us the story of his mother passing away when he was three how his dad became hardened and distant and how, at the age of 27, he found himself in deep depression.“I was single, in a job I hated, with very few friends I could count on. I felt like we are all going to die anyways, so what’s the purpose of trying?”Uncovering blocked emotions, Joe told us, saved his life. “I realized if I wasn’t going to take my life, I had to go back in time and work through my feelings. I was a 27-year-old living in a little boy’s trauma. I needed to prove to myself that it was safe to feel again.”We went around the circle sharing whatever came to mind about manhood, emotions, relationships, Donald Trump, Justin Trudeau, Jordan Peterson, the fact that most mass shootings are committed by socially isolated white men.“Conversations with other men are usually very superficial,” said Marvin, a transplant from Germany who works at an ad agency.“It’s always about sex and money,” the man next to him added. (Some of the participants declined to be named for this story.) “Like, ‘Oh, I got laid last night’. It gets boring.”“It’s not only fucking boring, it’s unhealthy,” said Marvin. “Most men suffer alone.”The discussion shifted to the meaning of anger.“I played football growing up and I learned that, as a man, you kept things inside so you could use them as a weapon. But emotions are energy and they have to move, they have to be released,” said Chris, who recently returned from a chakra retreat in Belize. Many men never learn “how to release that energy without using force”.“Anger is like an iceberg,” Alex Cameron, the therapist leading the session, told us. “Anger is what you see, but it comes from everything else below the surface – shame, fear, guilt. For most men, it feels safer to get angry than express sadness or vulnerability.”He wrapped up on a more personal note. “When I feel vulnerable, I cry. It looks like sadness on the outside, but it feels powerful.”I’ve dropped in on The Huddle several times over the past six months. One meeting focused on mental health and substance abuse a former drug addict shared the story of his attempted suicide and recent recovery. Another served as a #MeToo confessional. “I bet every man in here has a story about how they’ve mistreated a woman,” the facilitator prodded. After a deafening silence, one man threw up his hands. “I know I’ve done some foul shit.” Lululemon’s e into the murk of modern masculinity is a hipster-approved strand in a longer lineage of male reckoning.Alongside the din of women’s lib in the late 1960s was the lesser known men’s liberation movement. “Male liberation calls for men to free themselves from the sex role stereotypes that limit their ability to be human,” wrote psychologist Jack Sawyer, an early proponent, in a 1970 issue of Liberation magazine. “The battle of women to be free need not be a battle against men as oppressors. The choice about whether men are the enemy is up to men themselves.” Today the pro-feminist men’s movement champions causes ranging from reducing violence against women to raising awareness about male suicide and prostate cancer. Adherents dwell in gender studies programs, social justice groups, and mental health organizations—and in small groups of men who gather in coffee shops and living rooms for heartfelt talk. Pro-feminist masculinity has remained relatively obscure, though #MeToo may be changing that.“It’s allowed male feminists like myself to come out of the shadows,” Michael Kehler, a University of Calgary masculinities studies professor, told me by phone. His career, after two decades of “quiet, diligent work to move this agenda forward,” has flowered with media requests and speaking engagements. In January, Kehler became North America’s first masculinities studies research chair. Kehler believes this older breed of masculinity is dying. Some evidence, however, suggests otherwise.Pro-feminist men feel that by modulating hypermasculinity, and ceding a wider wedge of societal power to women, they can clear a path to male enlightenment – something good for men and women. Known as the men’s rights movement, these ad-hoc, mainly internet-based activists are resistant to policies promoting women’s equality and to the men-as-oppressors narrative generally. Oddly enough, the movement’s ideological godfather, Warren Farrell, was a well-known male feminist in the seventies who marched alongside Betty Friedan and Gloria Steinem. By the time Farrell’s 1993 book The Myth of Male Power arrived on shelves, his metamorphosis was complete: “What we, as feminists, did is put men into the oppressor class and called it patriarchy,” he once said of his previous self.While some strands of the men’s rights movement tout their efforts to provide men’s shelters, male-centric mental health services, and legal support in paternity cases, others are openly misogynist.“Pussy is the only real empowerment women will ever know,” wrote Paul Elam, the founder of AVoiceForMen, to promote the website’s “slap-a-violent-bitch month” in 2017. “Put all the hopelessly wishful thinking of feminist ideology aside and what remains is the fact that it is men and pretty much men only who draw power from accomplishment, who invent technology, build nations, cure disease, create empires and generally advance civilization.” Elam’s online community has been deemed a hate group by the Southern Poverty Law Center.ReturnOfKings, a blog for “pickup artists” (men focused on manipulating women into sex), has also earned this distinction. The website’s founder, Daryush Valizadeh, even suggested rape should be legal “if done on private property”. Also in the constellation of men’s rights groups are “incels” – men who blame women for their inability to attract a mate. (The word is a contraction of “involuntary celibate”.) The online subculture reached notoriety in April when 25-year-old Alek Minassian drove into two dozen pedestrians in Toronto. Eight of the 10 killed were women. “The Incel Rebellion has already begun,” Minassian posted on Facebook moments before he rammed his rental van into a Yonge Street sidewalk.Jahmal Padmore, one of the organizers of The Huddle, believes that blaming women, or anyone, does not dissolve one’s woes so much as harden them. The bespectacled, well-muscled 34-year-old gently badgers his male friends to show up for The Huddle because he knows firsthand how difficult it is to reach out for support. “Black kids can’t afford therapy – if we’re going to get fixed, we have to do it ourselves,” Padmore, the son of Antiguan immigrants, told me. “So I just went on YouTube and watched a lot of personal development videos.” Padmore’s craving for self-discovery accelerated as he approached his 30th birthday. He was drinking heavily and had some brushes with mental illness. One day he came across a series of videos by the University of Toronto psychology professor Jordan Peterson, focused on men’s pain. Padmore was hooked – briefly. “Peterson talked about finding your personal capacity within. I love that, that’s real, that’s what a lot of young men are looking for. When guys are maturing and coming to terms with the fact that they’re not going to be an NBA star, or whatever dreams or expectations they had aren’t being fulfilled, it can be painful. And because we’re men, we’re socialized to not express those feelings of frustration in a healthy way.”In the early 2010s, the eccentric professor was known for TedX talks with innocuous, New Age titles like “Potential” and “Redefining Reality”. But Peterson also had a reputation for blistering attacks on male laziness – “Clean up your room!” he often barks at his young followers – and criticizing political correctness.In 2016 Peterson’s viral popularity exploded after he protested Bill C-16, legislation adding gender identity to the characteristics protected by Canadian anti-discrimination law. The publication of his book 12 Rules for Life: An Antidote to Chaos in January this year vaulted Peterson into international stardom.While Peterson maintains the persona of a self-help guru styled as a stern but loving father figure – “To stand up straight with your shoulders back is to accept the terrible responsibility of life,” he writes – the threads of intolerance in his work, and the rhetoric of some of his followers, teeter toward hate.In a recent New York Times profile, Peterson surmised that the Toronto van attacker “was angry at God because women were rejecting him”. He suggested “enforced monogamy” as a societal cure for incels and other disgruntled young men. Peterson has never hidden his view that women should submit to conventional gender roles, but in May he published a chummy 90-minute interview with Warren Farrell, cementing his affinity with the men’s rights movement.Another reason he quickly fell from the orbit of Peterson’s charisma: “I’m black.”Doing pro-feminist men’s work under corporate auspices comes with certain pitfalls. The Huddle is free of charge, but when Padmore shouts “Hit me up if you want a discount on some stretchy pants,” one can’t but feel like the target of a sophisticated marketing scheme.The corporation in question also has some skeletons in its closet.Lululemon’s founder, Chip Wilson, once suggested that breast cancer rates rose in the nineties because of “cigarette-smoking Power Women who were on the pill…and taking on the stress previously left to men in the working world”. He said that Lululemon clothing was not for plus-sized or even average-sized women. In 2015, after being forced to recall a number of yoga pants with a conspicuous defect – they became see-through in the crotch after a short period of use – Wilson resigned.In 2016, a supervisor at a Lululemon in California was accused of raping a female co-worker. The victim’s lawsuit painted the company as a haven for sexual predators – a place, BuzzFeed wrote, “where women are encouraged to wear tight clothes to work, lewd comments go unchecked, and hookups between bosses and subordinates are accepted as par for the course after a wild night of drinking”.This February, Wilson’s replacement as CEO, Laurent Potdevin, was also forced out for misconduct, possibly because of a relationship with a subordinate. (Further details have not yet emerged.)When I contacted Lululemon headquarters to ask how the company reconciled its brand identity as a beacon of yogic enlightenment with its reputation as a bastion of toxic masculinity, a PR rep supplied me with a statement attributed to Ben Stubbington, senior vice president of men’s design:Padmore, unwilling to defend the company, took a more prosaic stance. “I’m not particularly concerned with Lululemon’s past, present, or future image I’m concerned with showing up and doing things that impact people’s lives in a positive way.” He said he hasn’t seen any signs of a culture of toxic masculinity at the company since being hired a year ago.The righteous aren’t immune to hypocrisy, he added. “I think a lot of liberal white folks get caught up in perfection. You’re going to make mistakes, you’re going to fuck up. But I think you have to be okay with that and keep pushing forward.”If the various men’s movement subcultures are in competition for followers, the pro-feminist folks are losing badly. Jordan Peterson has 1.2 million followers on YouTube and more than 700,000 on Twitter. Prominent pro-feminist male personalities count four or five digits at most.Jeff Perera, a figure in Toronto’s pro-feminist men’s community, told me he hasn’t won any converts from the Peterson camp, but has occasionally lost friends who “converted to the other side”.“We put out a lot of statistics about the unfortunate realities women go through, which are important for men to hear,” Perera said. “The problem is a lot of men don’t want to hear some expert telling them what a shitty person they are. They’re like, ‘Yeah, I wasn’t planning on raping anyone today, so peace out’.”Around the time Trump was elected, Perera, 42, worked part-time for Next Gen Men, a non-profit that works with teenage boys to get them thinking outside the gender box. During one afterschool program at an elite prep school outside Toronto, the conversation, Perera recalled, turned to the new US president.“I described him as the ‘televangelist of toxic masculinity’. I said to the guys, ‘He’s like Cobra Commander from GI Joe – he has to have his supervillain logo on everything from his helicopter to his evil headquarters at Trump Tower’. One of the boys looked at me with kind of a deadpan stare, and was like, ‘That’s actually kind of cool’. It was this moment where I had a crisis of faith. I realized that the movement is failing.”The coolness quotient of the pro-feminist men’s world, at least in the eyes of the average adolescent male, is rather low. Attendees of the annual conference put on by the National Organization of Men Against Sexism are likely to be treated to rousing renditions of songs like “Let the Woman In You Come Through” or “Womb Envy”. One can imagine howls of laughter from 16-year-olds forced to sing along to “It’s Only A Wee-Wee, So What’s the Big Deal?”Which is why it may not be a bad thing for a trendy, globally recognized brand, however imperfect, to take up the torch.Jian Pablico, who originated The Huddle at Lululemon’s Vancouver headquarters, told me his role as a “mindful performance manager” is to “curate” non-traditional masculinity for “men who may not be part of that culture yet”. That’s why the touchy-feely talks are held only one day a month.“We wanted to find a way to bring people together who might be hesitant about showing up for a conversation on vulnerability,” Pablico said. “Sweating together first helps it come naturally. Once you suffer together in a workout, you begin to bond and a layer of the mask comes off. It’s then a little easier to chat afterwards over a beer. Or a kombucha.”Jordan Peterson views feminism as an emasculating force. He believes men ought to be allowed to be unapologetically tough, ambitious, competitive, and forceful.But no one in the pro-feminist camp has really suggested that men can’t be tough, ambitious, competitive, or forceful – only that it is unhealthy to suppress other ways of being.After his Huddle session on emotional literacy, Alex Cameron, the therapist, showed me his tattoos. I’d assumed they were a relic from some previous life as a bouncer or lumberjack. It turns out he got them on graduating his master’s in social work. One arm depicts a dragon, symbol of virility the other, a phoenix, which in Chinese mythology signifies feminine grace.“We have opposing sides within us,” Cameron said. Harmony, he believes, must come from “embracing our entire self”."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3535108.1529343715!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"hse spent 207 000 on male breast reduction surgery over four years","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t‘Up to 30 per cent of men have enlarged breasts and many of them are extremely bothered by their appearance,’ says Dr Peter Prendergast of Venus Medical in Dublin. Photograph: iStockThe Health Service Executive (HSE) has spent an estimated €207,000 on male breast reduction operations over the past four years.Gynaecomastia – colloquially known as “man boobs” – is swelling of the breast tissue in men or boys, caused by an imbalance between estrogen and testosterone.Figures provided by the HSE in response to a written Dáil question by Fianna Fáil’s Robert Troy TD on the issue show that between 2014 and the end of August last, the HSE had carried out 46 gynaecomastia operations.The figures show that between January and August last year, the HSE performed nine elective procedures 12 elective and one emergency procedure in 2016 10 elective procedures in 2015 and 14 elective procedures in 2014.In its written reply to Mr Troy, the HSE said those who underwent surgery were usually treated by a general breast surgeon or plastic surgeon.According to Dr Peter Prendergast, medical director at the privately owned Venus Medical in Dublin, he performs 20-30 cases of male breast reduction annually and the number is growing.“I meet several men every week who are extremely concerned about the appearance of their breasts. They wear loose, baggy clothes to conceal the contour of their chest. They avoid beaches,” he said.“They are embarrassed when they are with their partners or even children, who often, innocently, pass remarks. Surgery on these patients, whether excisional surgery or liposuction, is often indicated and can be life-changing for them.”Dr Prendergast said men continued to be “extremely” embarrassed by their gynaecomastia.“The number is growing in my practice as more men become aware of the possibility of improving the appearance of their chests without the need for surgery that requires general anaesthesia. Men also realise that it is a very common concern, and nothing to be ashamed about.”Dr Prendergast said: “Up to 30 per cent of men have enlarged breasts and many of them are extremely bothered by their appearance. For some, it is true gynaecomastia, where the actual breast gland is enlarged. Others have so-called pseudogynaecomastia where there is simply excessive fatty tissue in the chest. It is often very resistant to diet and exercise, and the only remedy for aesthetically acceptable results is surgery.”Dr Prendergast said the cost of each procedure, which takes an hour, was about €4,500. “Apart from wearing a special compression garment and taking mild pain relief, the recovery is quick and most men return to work within two or three days.”"},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Charlie Flanagan also seeking approval for referendum on issue of blasphemyIf an internal Garda candidate is chosen, appointment likely to go ahead in AugustSiofra Coffey\u0026rsquos husband died of a brain tumour less than three years agoSeparating children from parents as part of border controls \u0026lsquoimmoral and shocking\u0026rsquoCriminal Law Act 1993 that criminalised gay men was \u0026lsquocontrary to human dignity\u0026rsquoSpiritans, founders of Blackrock College and Rockwell, to shut Marian House in DublinScout body prepares for redundancies and creditors calling in loans as fund crisis loomsThink-tank urges Coalition to avoid overheating economy but plays down fears of house-price bubble\u0026lsquoI want to genuinely reach out to our minority communities and show them the hand of friendship\u0026rsquo says DUP leaderThe number of physical attacks reported on trains increased from nine to 43 last yearDublin man apologises for his actions and has since repaid the money to the storeReaching climate targets is at the top of the policy agenda for Government, says MinisterThe commitments, how we rate on efforts to curb this rolling disaster and the carbon taxDocument outlines Karen Bradley\u0026rsquos responses to media questionsNew facility will cater for larger container ships than are currently accommodated at Tivoli when it opens in 2020Researchers call for marital status to be included as risk factor in its own rightRobin Walker said he hoped a new security partnership with the EU would ensure the Garda and the PSNI continue to co-operateGynaecomastia is swelling of the breast tissue in men or boysGarda\u0026iacute speak to teenager about incident on Sunday morning and examine car"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3535317.1529357633!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"five have taken part in final interviews for garda commissioner","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tFive people have participated in the final round of interviews to become the next Garda commissioner.

Photograph:  Niall CarsonPA WireThe Government will on Tuesday apologise to gay men for the “improperly discriminatory” laws which criminalised them because of their sexuality.Minister for Justice Charlie Flanagan will seek Cabinet approval on Tuesday to offer a formal apology to the men, who were criminalised prior to 1993 for consensual same-sex activities.Mr Flanagan and Taoiseach Leo Varadkar are to make statements in the Dáil responding to the all-party motion, initiated by Labour Senator Ged Nash, on the matter.Both Houses of the Oireachtas will acknowledge the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act 1993 that criminalised gay men was “contrary to human dignity and an infringement of personal privacy and autonomy”.It “caused multiple harms to those directly and indirectly affected, namely men who engaged in consensual same-sex activities and their families and friends” and “had a significant chilling effect on progress towards equality for the LGBTI community, acknowledging in particular the legacy of HIVAids within the context of criminalisation”, the motion states.The Oireachtas and the State acknowledge the hurt and the harm caused to those who were deterred by those laws from being open and honest about their identity with their family and in society.Each inidual convicted of same-sex sexual activity will be offered an apology.The move to make homosexual acts no longer illegal followed a 16-year-old legal battle by Senator David Norris.Taoiseach Leo Varadkar is also set to host a Government reception in Dublin Castle on Sunday evening to mark the 25th anniversary of decriminalisation.More than 700 people are expected to attend including LGBT advocacy groups, members of the judiciary, faith groups and a number of politicians.It is estimated up to 2,000 Irish gay men might have been convicted on such charges.There have been calls to legally set aside or disregard the convictions received by men for engaging in sexual activities which are no longer offences.Speaking last week, Mr Varadkar said there were complications in offering a pardon to all those convicted as it was “ not always possible to distinguish one conviction from another”.“In some cases, the convictions involve minors and it is not necessarily possible in all cases to distinguish whether the offence involved a minor, a point that makes things a little trickier in Ireland.”-the-  each Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3535178.1529348736!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"may faces another showdown after lords backs meaningful vote amendment","story":"The UK\u0027s  upper chamber started a debate on  June 18 over the final wording of the legislation for Brexit.

Photograph: Will OliverEPA Theresa May faces another showdown with pro-European Conservative MPs on Wednesday after the House of Lords approved an amendment that would give parliament a meaningful vote in the event of a no-deal Brexit. Twenty-two Conservative peers voted against the government to back the amendment by 354 to 235, a bigger margin than in April when a similar amendment was debated.During an unusually heated debate, former Conservative cabinet minister Douglas Hogg, now Viscount Hailsham, defended the rebels’ action in co-operating with other parties on amendments to the EU withdrawal Bill.“We are the High Court of Parliament. We are not party hacks,” he said.The House of Commons last week rejected a Lords amendment on the issue after the prime minister promised Tory rebels led by former attorney general Dominic Grieve that she would introduce an amendment in the Lords reflecting their concerns. Mr Grieve withdrew his own amendment and believed he had agreed the wording of a new amendment with the government last Thursday before ministers made a last-minute change.The government’s amendment promised MPs a vote if Ms May failed to agree a Brexit deal by January 21st, 2019, but only on a neutral motion that could not be amended.Lord Hailsham introduced an amendment based on the deal Mr Grieve was close to agreeing with the government last week, promising MPs a vote on a “motion to approve” in the event of a no-deal scenario. Conservative, pro-Brexit peer Nicholas True accused Lord Hailsham and Mr Grieve of seeking to use parliamentary stratagems to stop Britain leaving the EU.“People outside are getting a little bit tired of the parliamentary games. They actually want to know when they are going to get Brexit, when it will be delivered and when it will be done,” he said.The amendment will now return to the Commons on Wednesday and Labour’s shadow Brexit minister Matthew Pennycook said a defeat for the government there could finally take a no-deal Brexit off the table.“Labour has always maintained that parliament should have the right to a genuinely meaningful vote on the terms of our exit from the EU. If the prime minister’s final Brexit deal is voted down, that cannot give her licence to crash the UK out of the EU without an agreement,” he said.“MPs now face a decisive vote on Wednesday to guarantee parliament has a proper role in the Brexit negotiations and to take the threat of no deal off the table once and for all.”The Liberal Democrats’ leader in the Lords, Dick Newby, said the prime minister should now acknowledge that she cannot avoid giving MPs a meaningful vote on the Brexit deal.“If the Tories are still confident they can get a good Brexit deal, then they should be more than happy to give parliament this vote. Parliament must be able to decide amongst all the options – including giving the people a final say on the Brexit deal and a chance to exit from Brexit,” he said."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3534560.1529311593!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"i begged please don t take him families split up by us border control","story":"Several Democratic lawmakers from New York and New Jersey have visited a detention center in Elizabeth, New Jersey, to meet with detainees who were separated from their children at at the southwest border in the US. Video: Reuters\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tElsa Johana Ortiz Enriquez, who was deported to Guatemala from the United States on June 5th without her son Anthony, 8, speaks to a social worker in San Mauricio, Guatemala. Photograph: Marian CarrasqueroThe New York TimesThey’d had a plan: Elsa Johana Ortiz Enriquez packed up what little she had in Guatemala and travelled across Mexico with her 8-year-old son, Anthony. In a group, they rafted across the Rio Grande into Texas. From there, they intended to join her boyfriend, Edgar, who had found a construction job in the United States.Except it all went wrong. US border patrol was waiting as they made their way from the border on May 26th, and soon mother and son were in a teeming detention centre in southern Texas. The next part unfolded so swiftly that, even now, Ortiz cannot grasp it: Anthony was sent to a shelter for migrant children. And she was put on a plane back to Guatemala.“I am completely devastated,” Ortiz (25) said in one of a series of video interviews last week from her family home in Guatemala. Her eyes swollen from weeping and her voice subdued, she said she had no idea when or how she would see her son again.As the US government continues to separate families as part of a stepped-up enforcement programme against those who cross the border illegally, authorities say that parents are not supposed to be deported without their children. But immigration lawyers say that has happened in several cases. And the separations can be traumatic for parents who now have no clear path to recovering their children.“From our work on the border, we have seen a significant increase in the number of moms separated from their children, and many of them have reported they didn’t even have a chance to say goodbye before the separation,” said Laura Tuell, the global pro bono counsel at Jones Day, an international law firm providing assistance to refugees in Texas, whose lawyers spoke with Ortiz.“Some of the women we have encountered in detention at the border have reported facing pressure to deport voluntarily in order to be reunified with their children,” she said.Critics say that Ortiz’s saga is the latest indication that the administration’s new enforcement strategy was rolled out without adequate planning. The processing and detention of migrant families can involve three Homeland Security agencies - Customs and Border Protection, Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Citizenship and Immigration Services - as well as the departments of justice and health and human services. Poor co-ordination among them has made it hard to track children and parents once their paths erge in the labyrinthine system.“I cannot convey enough how much utter chaos there is,” said Michelle Bran, director of migrant rights and justice at the Women’s Refugee Commission, a research and advocacy organisation that monitors immigration issues. “The government does not have a proper system in place to track families and co-ordinate.”In some cases, parents and children have gone weeks without being able to communicate with one another and without knowing each others’ whereabouts. From April 19th to May 31st, a total of 1,995 children who arrived with 1,940 adults were separated from their parents, according to administration officials.Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced the policy in early May to stanch the flow of migrants, mainly from Central American countries like Guatemala. It calls for prosecuting nearly all of those who are found to have entered the United States illegally. Previously, most border-crossers who were caught would have faced deportation but not criminal charges, and would not have been separated from their children.Children whose parents have been arrested are transferred to the custody of the health and human services department, whose staff screens them, finds housing and remains responsible for them. From that point, migrant parents and children become separate legal cases in the maze of government bureaucracy, and keeping them linked has proved challenging. Different legal protections are afforded to juveniles and adults in the immigration system, and as a result, reuniting families can take months or longer, several legal experts said.In federal court, parents typically plead guilty to the misdemeanour offence of illegal entry. Many are then likely to accept “expedited removal” from the country, in the hope of being reunited quickly with their children. But children cannot be subject to expedited removal they are automatically entitled to a full hearing before an immigration judge, and their cases take longer to resolve.“Once the parent and child are apart, they are on separate legal tracks,” said John Sandweg, who was acting director of ICE during the Obama administration. Reunification becomes particularly difficult when a parent is deported without the child and is no longer on US soil, Sandweg said: in those cases, “there is a very high risk that parents and children will be permanently separated.”ICE officials said there are ways they can help. The agency may seek to speed up deportation proceedings for a child if a parent accepts expedited removal. When a parent is being deported and has requested that a child accompany them, the agency works with the department of health and human services to try to make that happen, the officials said. A government hotline has been set up to help parents locate their children.Ortiz’s greatest fear is that she won’t be able to return to the United States to claim custody of her son, and that without her intervention, he won’t be returned to her. Ortiz provided detailed accounts and documents that attest to her detention, criminal prosecution and separation from her son. The story of how the two of them came to be in the United States involves years of difficult single parenthood in Guatemala, with both economic setbacks and threats of violence from the rising lawlessness in her community.She gave birth to Anthony David Tobar Ortiz on August 8th, 2009, in a village in the northeastern part of the country, she said, and his father abandoned them eight months later. “I did whatever job I could to raise him, “ said Ortiz, who worked at a bakery and lived with her mother. A few years ago, Ortiz fell in love with a “good man,” she said, who treated her son as his own child. The man, named Edgar, moved to the United States to work in construction and had been sending money to help support them. He asked that his last name not be disclosed because he fears repercussions from federal authorities.This year, Ortiz, fearful of the thugs who were increasingly preying on people in her neighbourhood, decided it would be best to take her son and join Edgar in the United States. Edgar said he paid more than $1,000 (€863) to a smuggler who took Ortiz and Anthony with a group of seven other people to the border and put them on a raft for the river crossing.They made it to Texas safely, but shortly afterward, as they walked along a road, they were intercepted by border agents, arrested and taken to a station. They spent the night in a processing centre that the detainees called the “hielera”, Spanish for “freezer”.“It was packed with women and children,” Ortiz recalled. “We could hardly find a spot.” Ortiz said she was interviewed the next day by border officials, and that is when she was told her son would be separated from her. “I started to weep and weep,” she said. “I begged, please don’t do this. Don’t take him.” The officer asked her if she had any family in the United States, and she told him about Edgar. “He told me, your partner is not his blood relative, we can’t give the child to him,” Ortiz recalled, her voice shaking over the sound of clucking of chickens in the yard.About an hour after the officer spoke to her at the detention centre, her son’s name was called. Mother and son stood up, and over Ortiz’s loud protests, Anthony was led away. A 12-year-old girl went with him. A few days later, Ortiz said, she boarded a bus filled with migrants and was taken to a federal court in South Texas, where she pleaded guilty to illegal entry. “There were so many of us, and everyone agreed with what the judge said,” she recalled of the mass hearing.After the hearing, Ortiz was transferred to another detention centre, she said she did not know its location where she bonded with other mothers whose children had been taken away from them. Then she was transferred again, to a facility in Laredo, where she was finally able to make telephone calls.She contacted Edgar to tell him that their plan had gone awry, and that she and her son had been arrested and then separated. “She was crying desperately,” Edgar recalled in a telephone interview. Ortiz contacted a Guatemalan consular official, who was reassuring. “He told me, if they deport you, you will go with your son,” she said. “I believed him. I believed that they would give me my son.” By this time, it had been more than a week since she had seen Anthony, and she still had no idea where he was. At one point, an immigration officer handed her a handwritten note on a pink slip of paper with the words, “Call Shelter Son” and a telephone number. But before Ortiz could get access to a phone to make the call, she said, another officer summoned her and several other women to inform them that they were booked on a deportation flight that was leaving shortly.What about Anthony? No one would listen, she said.Ortiz recalled sobbing heavily as she reluctantly climbed the steps to the plane that would take her and dozens of other deported migrants back to Guatemala early in June. She said she was the last to board. “Please don’t put me on the plane,” she remembered pleading over and over in Spanish. “I can’t go without my son.” “I was shaking, I could barely walk,” Ortiz recalled. She said that a US immigration officer escorting her across the tarmac was also in tears.“She told me to talk to the boss when I got inside the plane,” Ortiz said. But he did not listen. “I cried the entire flight,” she said. “When I arrived at the airport in Guatemala, I was almost fainting. They gave me a tranquilliser.” She phoned Edgar from Guatemala the next day. “She was devastated, destroyed,” he recalled. “Crying that the child was left behind.” He reached out to a Jones Day attorney, who provided him with the government hotline number. After several attempts, Edgar got a woman on the line who asked for the boy’s name and date of birth. “She told me he is fine, he has clothes, shoes and his own bed, we are taking good care of him,” Edgar recalled.Later that day, a caseworker from the shelter called the cellphone number of the boy’s grandfather, José Ortiz, in Guatemala, the only telephone number the boy had memorized. She put Anthony on the phone, and his grandfather said he seemed cheerful.“He shared how he was learning English, playing games and being well treated,” Ortiz said. Finally, on Thursday, she got to speak to Anthony herself. She told him to be good. They joked about an imaginary character “the clown” who they always pretended slept between them in the bed they shared. But she said Anthony seemed worried about her.“Mammy, are they treating you well in the house where you are at?” Anthony asked. “Yes,” she said, knowing that he would not know not until the shelter workers told him, and she dreaded how he’d respond when they did, that the house was in Guatemala.–New York Times"},{"url":null,"title":"magnum freedom project pictures","story":"1968 was a seismic year of deep societal and political shifts.

A troupe of scantily clad dancers is then seen swaying sensually in front of The Coronation of Napoleon.It quickly becomes apparent that the two most prominent African Americans in pop culture are also making a deliberate statement on the marginalisation of black figures in predominantly white Western art.Close-ups single out black figures in Veronese’s Wedding at Cana, as well as Géricaults The Raft of the Medusa and Marie-Guillemine Benoist’s Portrait of a Negress painted between French revolutionaries’ abolition of slavery in 1794 and Napoleon’s restoration of it in 1802.The Louvre said it was happy to hire out the museum to the music megastars Beyonce and Jay-Z as they were genuine fans of the museumThe clip features scenes of a woman combing a man’s hair with an afro pick in front of the Mona Lisa, while Beyoncé sings “can’t believe we made it”, serenely seated in a long cream dress before the Winged Victory.As critic Jason Farago put it: “As so often, the couple here present themselves as both outsiders in an elite institution and as heirs to it as people excluded from its narratives but now possessors of it by virtue of their talent, their taste and, well, their money.”“It’s a political clip,” Gert Van Overloop, manager of the video’s choreographer, Sidi Larbi Cherkaoui. “All the dancers are black, most of the Louvre works are seen through this prism. It’s not a clip against, in the sense of revenge, but a clip to affirm the equality between Afro-American culture and more generally black, with white culture.”Most French critics were wowed. “Breathtaking,” wrote Le Parisien, the capital’s daily, even if it questioned whether the video verged on “megalomania”. “Grandiose,” wrote conservative Le Figaro. Totally sublime, said Europe 1 radio. Libération suggested the pair had even outdone in hutspah other famous pop couples John Lennon and Yoko Ono or June Carter and Johnny Cash.The Louvre has been the scene of many music clips and films, including The Smurfs 2Quizzed on its decision to hire out the museum for the clip, Louvre management said the singers were real art fans. “Beyonce and Jay-Z have visited the Louvre four times in the past ten years. During their last visit in May, they raised this idea of a shoot, it wrote. The timing was tight, but the project quickly won us over, because the synopsis showed a real attachment to the museum and its works, which made a mark on them.Even the normally stuffy La Tribune de L’Art saw nothing wrong with the Carters taking over the Louvre, as long, it said, as the museum wasn’t specifically shut for the occasion or the works “placed under threat” - neither the case.Beyonce and Jay-Z\u0026#39s video Apeshit homes in on black figures in the Louvre\u0026#39s art worksThe art blog pointed out that the Louvre has long been open to music and film shoots, such as the Da Vinci Code, Wonder Woman, and even The Smurfs 2.

It’s utterly liberating to see,” and Sue Perkins, the television presenter, saying: “Yes! You’d be an excellent choice.”Ahmed, 50, certainly has the credentials to present a current affairs show. After leaving Channel 4 News she has worked as a freelance journalist and presenter, reporting for the BBC on general elections and presenting Radio 4’s The World Tonight, PM and Woman’s Hour.David Dimbleby announced this week that he is to step down from Question Time after 25 years, triggering a race to secure the coveted job.BBC presenter jobs are rarely advertised, prompting Ahmed to make her public declaration in the hope of bringing some transparency to the process.Question Time is made by an independent production company but the high profile nature of the programme means the appointment of a new presenter will be signed off by Lord Hall, the director-general.The corporation is under pressure to appoint a woman, following a slew of negative headlines about its gender pay gap.Emily Maitlis, Mishal Husain, Victoria Derbyshire and Kirsty Young are also in the frame. Eddie Mair and Huw Edwards are contenders but their high salaries - Mair on £300,000-350,000 and Edwards on £550,000-599,999, although Edwards has accepted a pay cut and Mair is said to be discussing one - were the cause of many raised eyebrows when BBC pay was disclosed last year.One dead, five wounded in Malmo shootingDonald Trump defends \u0026#39zero-tolerance\u0026#39 immigration policy amid fury over children separated from parentsFormer mayor jailed for sex with girl aged 13 asked police: \u0026#39Do you know who I am?\u0026#39Loughborough Junction: Three \u0026#39graffiti artists\u0026#39 killed by train as spray cans are found near their bodiesChildren face curfew on night-time social media use under new codeComment: The war on cannabis has failed utterly.

At the Serpentine Swimming Club, where members must now swim down a narrow channel and avoid bumping into the platform that keeps the 600-tonne structure afloat, there were plenty of both.“It casts a shadow on the water. We’re swimming in gloom,” complained one regular.“It’s an affront to nature,” said another, referring to the red, blue and mauve colour scheme that Christo said he had carefully chosen in relationship to the surroundings.Christo says his 600-tonne work is designed \u0026#39to make us think\u0026#39The Bulgarian-American artist has positioned the sculpture directly opposite the bank where the swimmers enter the water because there it can be seen from the maximum number of viewing points within the park.For every swimmer who described it as “hideous”, “intrusive” and an “ego trip” for the artist, there was another who loved it.“It makes a change from the wildlife. I’m all in support of good art,” said one, while a friend said: “There was a beautiful colour to the water this morning from the reflection.”A passing dog-walker said the structure was a hit with her cockapoo “because it keeps the ducks away and she can go in the water”.Christo, 83, has given no explanation for his work, simply saying it is designed to make people think. “To think - that is what makes us human,” he said.This is his first large-scale work on Britain. He has previously wrapped Berlin’s Reichstag and Paris’s Pont-Neuf in fabric.The temporary work is in place over the course of the summer Michael Bloomberg, the former mayor of New York who now chairs the Serpentine Gallery, said: “The London Mastaba will bring all the benefits that come with great public art. It will add new energy to the city, it will help people see the familiar in a new light and provoke conversation and debate.“I think it’s fair to say that no two people will have the same reaction to it, and that’s exactly how great art should be.”Mr Bloomberg claimed that, according to one estimate from the London School of Economics, the sculpture could generate £150 million for the economy through increased tourism.Loyd Grossman, chairman of the Royal Parks, said the sculpture will bring “an immense amount of joy and inspiration” to visitors.It is in place for three months, and people can rent a boat on the lake to take a closer look.Christo - who long ago discarded his full name, Christo Vladimirov Javacheff - self-funds his projects through the sale of his work. No public money is used and he does not accept sponsorship.While The London Mastaba is one of the biggest sculptures to appear in London, for Christo it will soon be small fry. His next mastaba will be 10 times larger, sited in Abu Dhabi and dwarfing the largest Egyptian pyramid.One dead, five wounded in Malmo shootingDonald Trump defends \u0026#39zero-tolerance\u0026#39 immigration policy amid fury over children separated from parentsFormer mayor jailed for sex with girl aged 13 asked police: \u0026#39Do you know who I am?\u0026#39Loughborough Junction: Three \u0026#39graffiti artists\u0026#39 killed by train as spray cans are found near their bodiesChildren face curfew on night-time social media use under new codeComment: The war on cannabis has failed utterly.

The initiative claims graphene applications like Earthdas\u0027 will generate economic growth, new jobs and new opportunities for Europeans.The Independent\u0027s bitcoin group on Facebook is the best place to follow the latest discussions and developments in cryptocurrency.

Flat desert on either side, a few lights.\u0026nbspThe Moroccan traveller Ibn Battuta passed this way on camel back in 1326, and wrote of its emphatic wilderness: “He who enters it is lost and he who leaves it is born.”Before mass tourism ruined them for a second time, I’d travelled to the so-called “lost” cities of Petra, Machu Picchu and Angkor Wat.\u0026nbspMy destination tonight was the isolated sandstone valley eulogised by Charles Doughty, the first European to enter it\u0026nbspin 1876, as “the fabulous Mada’in Saleh\u0026nbspwhich I was come from far countries to seek in Arabia”.The prospect of following in Doughty’s flapping shadow gave me a jolt of anticipation that I hadn’t experienced since my twenties.\u0026nbspDoughty’s classic book Arabia Deserta was championed by his friend TE\u0026nbspLawrence, who later used it as a military textbook, as the greatest record of adventure and travel in our language.It begins with Doughty trying to smuggle himself into Mada’in Saleh in the guise of a poor Syrian pilgrim.\u0026nbspEven up until recently few Europeans have visited this cradle of forgotten civilisations, which, though designated a World Heritage Site in 2008, remains a blank page on the archaeological record, closed off by geography, politics, religion.“Visitors last year from abroad? I can say zero,” my guide Ahmed tells me.Mada\u0027in\u0026nbspSaleh\u0026nbspnear Al-Ula\u0026nbsphave survived for 2,000 yearsThis is set to change. Last July, under the impetus of Saudi Arabia’s progressive new Crown Prince, Mohammed Bin Salman, or “MBS” as he is popularly known, a Royal Commission took charge of Mada’in Saleh and its surrounds – “the only crown jewel of a site the country possesses,” says one of the archaeologists recruited to excavate it.In December, public access was halted first in order to survey what actually is there, next to develop a strategy for protecting it, and then to open up Mada’in Saleh to the outside world. My advance visit is aimed at providing an amuse-bouche, as it were.In the bright morning sunlight, Ahmed escorts me through locked gates, past the German-built railway-line linking Damascus with Medina, which Lawrence bombed (“there are still local tribes which call their sons Al-Orans”), to the celebrated Nabatean rock tombs.Doughty first heard about these in Petra, 300 miles north. Fifty years earlier, an awe-struck British naval commander had gazed in disbelief at Petra’s imperishable Treasury, murmuring, as many continue to do: “There is nothing in the world that resembles it.” He was wrong.If a little less rosier than her sister city, Mada’in Saleh shares her capacity to stagger.\u0026nbspOut of the flat desert, one after another, the ornate facades rise into sight, 111 of them, carved into perpendicular cliffs up to four storeys high, their low doorways decorated by Alexandrian masons in the first century AD, with Greek triangles, Roman pilasters, Persian flowers, Egyptian sphinxes, birds.“This is a twin to Petra,” Ahmed says. Except that in Petra we would be bobbing among crowds.Ahmed\u0026nbspis descended from a long line of imamsStanding in reverent silence, with the valley to ourselves, I recall how the Victorian artist who supplied the first images of Petra to the world, David Roberts, responded to that other city. “I turned from it at length with an impression which will be effaced only by death.”These tombs were carved for the Nabatean tribes who ruled this region for 300 years until the Romans annexed them in 106AD. Nomads who had settled and grown wealthy, the Nabateans controlled the lucrative spice route from the Mediterranean to the Red Sea.Then, like the civilisations they’d replaced, the Dedanites, the Lihyanites, the Thamuds, they galloped off into obscurity. Their tombs were looted: the acacia doors plundered for firewood, the marble statues melted to make lime for plaster, the porphyry urns smashed.All that survives of their caravan city, Hegra, is a flat expanse behind a wire fence: “her clay-built streets are again the blown dust in the wilderness,” Doughty wrote.The same desolation holds true for the still more ancient Biblical city of Dedan, situated on the lip of an oasis a few minutes drive way. To visit both sites is to gain the sense of a narrative even now being worked out.\u0026nbspUntil the 20th\u0026nbspcentury the story of these civilisations was scrawled on the rocks in Nabatean or Thamudic script. Ahmed leads me between two steep cliffs to the oldest inscription, written 6,000 years ago.Tombs in Mada\u0027in Saleh were decorated by Alexandrian masons in the first century with Greek, Roman and Persian symbolsThe ancient Biblical city of Dedan is situated on the lip of an oasisCliffs formed out of red and black sandstone have eroded into crazy, hallucinatory shapes such as elephants, mushrooms, and sealsAncient Dedan inscriptions.

Ahmed could be speaking of the cavity in the historical record when he says, “They were making sacrifices to one god, Dhu-Ghaibat, which means ‘the one who is absent’.”Out in the desert, the wind has chiselled its own mysterious deities and hieroglyphs. The scene is stunning. In Petra, which forms part of the same massif, David Roberts threw away his pencil in despair at being able to convey it, believing that the ruins “sink into insignificance when compared with these stupendous rocks”.It’s hard to disagree. Cliffs formed out of red and black sandstone have eroded into crazy, hallucinatory shapes: elephants, mushrooms, braying seals. If they were transcribed into music, it would be Wagnerian.They make you believe in mountain gods, I tell Ahmed, who smiles. “I never try smoking weed, but when I hear someone react, I feel like that. It makes you high, naturally.”For sheer high spirits, no one yields to the British archaeologist I meet that night. Jamie Quartermain is part of an international team employed since March to survey these sites.A surveyor who pioneered the use of drones, Quartermain says: “We’ve been wanting to get involved here, but Saudi has been a closed shop, a completely untapped reserve.The perception is that it’s big, open desert. When I tried to find out anything about it, there was essentially one book. The discovery that there are so many archaeological sites is a big shock for most people. It was a big shock for me.”Advised by the Royal Commission to expect 450 unexcavated sites, Quartermain estimates the truer number between 6,000-10,000.\u0026nbsp“The survival of the archaeology is remarkable, some of the best condition remains I’ve ever seen. We’re not finding it close to the surface, it’s above surface, well and truly visible.”Dedan\u0026nbspinscriptions. Holes in the rock floor denote a sacrificial spot from the time of the DedanitesDeploying a drone, he has begun creating a three-dimensional textural surface of the area. Already, what he has found is ground-breaking. “You can see all the archaeology jumping out and biting you on the bottom.”When, aged 20, I visited Petra, sleeping in one of the caves, I talked to the head of the Bdoul tribe, allegedly descendants of the Nabateans, who told me: “We have a saying that the more wealth you have, the more brain cells you need to be able to cope with it.What impresses about MBS’s plan for Mada’in Saleh is his determination to use his nation’s resources to avoid the pitfalls of Petra.“Wadi Rum is pretty disastrous,” says Chris Tuttle, an American archaeologist seconded to the project. Tuttle spent many years excavating in Petra. He saw at first hand the ruinous impact of tourism, both on the ruins and the local community.By contrast, in Al-Ula, the local town for Mada’in Saleh, there has been a concerted drive to educate the locals, giving scholarships to 150 children, but also to attract experts armed with the latest methodolOne reason for the blankness on Saudi Arabia’s archaeological map, says Tuttle, has been the resistance of conservative religious leaders to question their history. “You don’t need to study the past when you’ve been given a manual from God.”Suddenly, a multi-thousand-year-old story has become an open book, not a closed one, and the revelation it contains could be a complex of sites more significant even than Petra.\u0026nbspMy guide Ahmed Alimam is a perfect representative of Al-Ula’s past and future. He comes from a long line of imams descended from a grand tribal judge who arrived c1400 in Al Ula’s “old town”Abandoned in 1983, the year of Ahmed’s birth, this haunting labyrinth of mud houses and twisting streets replaced Dedan and Hegra. It was built using stones from those cities. They can be seen fortifying the occasional doorway.Ahmed leads the way down an empty street to the house where his parents used to live – collapsed beams, upturned crates. He shows me the mosque, erected over the spot where the Prophet Mohammed stopped in 630AD, and with a goat bone drew in the sand the direction of Medina Ahmed’s uncle was the last imam.Iranians are angry with Israel and Saudi Arabia, not just TrumpSaudi Arabia to build giant $9bn oil complex with French company TotalSaudis \u0027to cut off Qatar\u0027 with canal, nuclear dump and military baseSaudi Arabian Prince toured Hollywood and Harvard on trip to USAnd a modern inscription: the name “Charles”, scratched on the oat-coloured mud wall not, as momentarily I’d hoped, by Charles Doughty, but by Prince Charles (in 2015, with his key), and below it the Islamic translation.During the Islamic period, Al-Ula, or El-Ally as Doughty knew it, became an important station on the haj road south, and marked the last place where Christians were permitted to travel.\u0026nbspIbn Battuta described how pilgrim caravans paused here for four days to resupply and wash, and to leave any excess baggage with the townspeople “who are known for their trustworthiness”.“I hope we are still doing our best to be like that,” Ahmed says. “You can try, if you want, to leave something.”The only thing I left behind after my four days here was an urge to come back.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Every one of us can think of a local public building or outside space we love and use – from libraries to lidos and town halls to youth centres.“Many hundreds of local community groups are stepping up and fighting for community ownership, but they urgently need support and help with startup costs if they are to compete with the commercial developers.”Airbnb\u0027s European headquarters in Dublin won best office interior.

We want to see community ownership prioritised.“Selling these buildings and spaces on the open-market to the highest bidder means they are often lost to the community forever, and that the deeper value to local people will never be realised.“In these circumstances the community have no real influence over what the space will be used for, and so-called ‘fire sales’ of public assets to remote private owners can mean empty, boarded-up properties, which can lead to social, economic and environmental decline.”Councils face ‘decades more austerity’ amid social care costsVulnerable children ‘paying the price of Tory austerity’Councils at financial breaking point due to austerity warns NAOThe report added: “It is often the poorest places that are most reliant on these types of spaces. Losing them can have a devastating impact on local people and communities. Years of austerity and lack of investment have decimated local services and left many of the places people rely on shuttered up, under threat or falling into disrepair.”In calling for national government money to help keep local buildings and spaces in community ownership, the charity stressed: “This isn’t about buildings of historical or architectural value, although many of them are, and it isn’t about protecting green space for the sake of it.\u0026nbsp“This is about people – all of us – and our local communities. These buildings and spaces are often at the heart of the community, where local people meet, access services and find support. They are where we can connect with our neighbours, give help and be supported by others, and where we can come together to shape our own areas.\u0026nbsp“They are spaces where everyone belongs and where lives are transformed.”\u0026nbspA spokesman for the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government said:\u0026nbsp“Councils will have £90.7bn to spend on local services over the next two years.“They are responsible for managing their own finances and making the right decisions for the communities they serve.“All local authorities must properly consider the risks and opportunities before making commercial decisions.“We are working with local government to develop a funding system for the future based on the needs of different areas.”Enter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

It can range from seeing a child wearing the same shirt for a few days, or noticing that they haven’t washed when they get changed for PE. We won’t stand by if we know people are in need,” she said.“It’s not always an impact on families that are on benefits – it can be self-employed families or those made redundant.

Responding to the findings, Dr Richard Woolfson, a child psychologist, said: “Children’s self-esteem is greatly affected by the reaction of those around them – and if they are stigmatised, ridiculed or rejected by their peers because of poor basic hygiene, their sense of self-worth will quickly nose-e.\u0026nbsp“That’s why hygiene poverty has such a devastatingly negative effect on a child’s psychological development, not just on their health but also on their confidence, self-esteem, social relationships and class work.”Government figures published earlier this year\u0026nbspshowed the number of children in poverty across the UK had surged by 100,000 in 12 months, with 4.1 million children\u0026nbspliving in relative poverty after household costs -\u0026nbspthe worst figures since the financial crisis.A Government spokesman said: “We want all children to have the very best chances in life. We know that the best route out of poverty is through employment, and since 2010 an extra three million people are now in work and 300,000 fewer children are living in absolute poverty. Meanwhile, we spend around £90bn a year on working-age benefits, including for those on low incomes.“We continue to support the country’s most disadvantaged children through free school meals. Additionally, £2.5billion funding is given to schools through the Pupil Premium to support their education.”Enter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

While thousands were asked to come to UK to help rebuild after the war, the Home Office is showing them nothing but disdain when they are heroes. I want this government to show respect for those who helped the UK off its knees and an amnesty for the Windrush generation, whichever country they are from.”\u0026nbspIn one case, 73-year-old Indian grandmother Raj Rani Bhanote, who has lived in the UK for 55 years, was stranded in the US for four days after being blocked from boarding a plane back to Britain.Ms\u0026nbspBhanote was questioned by British Airways check-in staff as she tried to board a flight from Arizona after visiting relatives. They claimed not to recognise the stamp on her Indian passport, designed to prove her right to remain in the UK.Staff contacted the Home Office, which claimed she was not a British resident, and she was not allowed to board the aircraft. It took four days for the government’s\u0026nbspWindrush\u0026nbsptaskforce to intervene so she could return home.\u0026nbspMs Bhanote, who has three children and four grandchildren in the UK and worked as a\u0026nbsppost office assistant, told The Independent she felt “terrible”, adding: “I spoke to someone on the phone who refused to speak to my family and could not understand why they were behaving in such a disrespectful manner towards me.”Her son,\u0026nbspArun\u0026nbspBhanote, has since written to his MP to request an investigation by the Home Office into what he described as “racist maladministration and xenophobic calamity”.Satbir\u0026nbspSingh, chief executive of the Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants (JCWI), said the case was a “disturbing but sadly all-too-common occurrence”.“Cases like this show just how incredibly complicated, rigid and inhumane our immigration system has become,” he said.\u0026nbsp“It’s a relief that the\u0026nbspWindrush\u0026nbsptaskforce was able to help in this case, but it also shows the need for such remedies to be available to everybody who faces poor decision-making either at the Home Office or at the border.”It comes as the government announced that a\u0026nbspday celebrating the Windrush generation and their descendants was\u0026nbspto be held annually, after it emerged a large number of\u0026nbspBritish\u0026nbspCaribbean\u0026nbspnationals had been wrongly targeted by immigration officials in the UK.But Alessandra\u0026nbspSciarra, from Lewisham Refugee and Migrant Centre, which supports migrants and refugees in south London, said they had seen at least a dozen cases of non-Caribbean Commonwealth citizens encountering\u0026nbspsimilar issues\u0026nbspin the past six months.“They extend to people from different countries it’s much more widespread.\u0026nbspWindrush\u0026nbspis just the tip of the iceberg,” she said.Ms Sciarra\u0026nbspsaid one of their cases involved a 65-year-old Indian man who was born in Uganda and became a British protected person after fleeing persecution to the UK in 1972.\u0026nbspDespite living here since, working and building a family, and never encountering any issues with his immigration status, he has recently been unable to find work due to issues with his documents.“In the 46 years he has been living in the UK, he has integrated successfully into his community in Lewisham. His wife and adult children were all recognised as British citizens,” she\u0026nbspsaid.“But recently Mr Khan lost his job and began looking for employment again just prior to retirement. He faced numerous issues in this process, as many employers asked him for a proof of his right to reside and work in the country.”Shadow home secretary Diane Abbott said one of her constituents, of Ghanaian descent who has been in Britain for over 50 years, had recently contacted her after had been threatened with deportation.The Labour MP said: “The Windrush scandal goes way beyond the people that stepped off Empire Windrush or even all those from the Caribbean. Everyone from the Commonwealth who came here before 1973 could get caught up in the scandal, including deportation or detention.“These are not isolated mistakes. They are a product of the government’s ‘hostile environment’ policy, and Theresa May’s instruction to ‘deport first, appeal later’. Until these end, the scandal will not go away.”The Home Office declined to disclose the exact number of non-Caribbean cases​​ the taskforce was dealing with.Keith Vaz, Labour MP for Leicester East, said his office received on average three cases a week – or around 150 a year – from Indian nationals who have lived in the UK for more than a decade but are now denied their rights and in some cases threatened with deportation.“It is not just Windrush cases,” he said.\u0026nbsp“There is a systemic failure on the part of the Home Office to deal with cases promptly. Delay is being used as a substitute for decision-making.“There are a lot of people who are from India who have been in this country for 20 years, but are being held in a long queue being made to sign on and\u0026nbspcannot work, but are actually entitled to stay here.“As a result, people can stay for a very long time – as long as 20 years – and still not know precisely where they stand. Some inevitably\u0026nbspget removed without anyone intervening. They live in a subculture of society\u0026nbspand so are reluctant to come forward, but actually they do have the right to stay.”Mr Vaz raised concerns that the Home Office had “erted resources” from dealing with immigration cases from the Indian subcontinent in order to set up the Windrush\u0026nbsptaskforce.Windrush generation: threat of deportation from UKThe ex-troopship \u0027Empire Windrush\u0027 arriving at Tilbury Docks from Jamaica, with 482 Jamaicans on board, emigrating to Britain.Jamaican immigrants being welcomed by RAF officials from the Colonial Office after the ex-troopship \u0027Empire Windrush\u0027 landed them at Tilbury.

But the decision set off a nightmare that saw him lose his job, detained twice and almost deported to Jamaica. Jamaica-born Anthony Bryan poses outside his home in Edmonton, north London. Now 60 and a grandfather, Bryan thought the issue could be resolved swiftly, as he legally moved to Britain with his family as part of the Windrush generation of Caribbean migrants after World War II. In 1948, the ship Windrush brought the first group of migrants from the West Indies to help rebuild post-war Britain, and many others followed from around the Commonwealth. A 1971 law gave them indefinite leave to remain, but many never formalised their status, often because they were children who came over on their parents\u0027 passports and then never applied for their own.

So we rebooked her for travel a few days later, at which point the Home Office had provided an approval letter.”The Home Office said\u0026nbspMr Bhanote\u0026nbsphad indefinite leave\u0026nbspbut that it had not been possible to determine her status in time for her to board the flight, and that\u0026nbspit\u0026nbsphad worked closely with her son to determine her status.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

I want to ensure that parliament does have a meaningful vote and I don’t want to see that left to chance,” he added.\u0026nbspBrexit so far: in picturesBoris Johnson MP, Labour MP Gisela Stuart and UKIP MP Douglas Carswell address the people of Stafford in Market Square during the Vote Leave Brexit Battle Bus tour on 17 May 2016.

He finished more than 12 points ahead of former guerrilla Gustavo Petro, though the runner-up\u0027s performance at the ballot box was the best ever for the left in one of Latin America\u0027s most conservative nations.\u0026nbspWhen Mr Duque, of the Democratic Centre\u0026nbspparty, takes office in August at age 42\u0026nbsphe will be Colombia\u0027s youngest president in more than a century and in his first remarks as president-elect he vowed to work tirelessly to heal isions and govern on behalf of all Colombians.He also promised a frontal attack on corruption while addressing a surge in cocaine production that he called a threat to national security.\u0026nbspThis is the opportunity that we have been waiting for – to turn the page on the politics of polarisation, insults and venom, Mr Duque told jubilant supporters Sunday night, joined by his young family.\u0026nbspThe election was the first since outgoing President Juan Manuel Santos signed the 2016 peace agreement with the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia and the race ultimately ended up being defined by the isive accord.\u0026nbspMr Duque\u0027s promise to heal the scars from five decades of bloody conflict will demand a quick response. The FARC rebels who demobilized under the accord are struggling to reinsert themselves into civilian life in a nation where many people are hesitant to forgive. Vast swaths of remote territory remain under the control of violent drug mafias and residual rebel bands.\u0026nbspPeople stare at damages caused by mudslides following heavy rains in Mocoa, Putumayo department, southern Colombia.

Although with this result, it\u0027s proven that Colombia is still a right-wing country.\u0026nbspMr Petro took his loss in stride, refusing to call it a defeat. In a concession speech that at times sounded celebratory, he challenged Mr Duque to break with his hard-line allies, and Mr\u0026nbspUribe in particular. He also promised to mobilise his considerable following into a combative opposition that will fight for social reforms and defend the peace accord.\u0026nbspThose eight million Colombians are not going to let Colombia return to war, Mr Petro said to a thunderous applause from supporters chanting Resistance!\u0026nbspColombia\u0027s peace process to end a conflict that caused more than 250,000 deaths is considered largely irreversible. Most of the more than 7,000 rebels who have surrendered their weapons have started new lives as farmers, community leaders and journalists. Last year the rebels launched a new political party and will soon occupy 10 seats in congress.\u0026nbspBut the accord remains contentious and Mr Duque pledged throughout his campaign to make changes that would deliver peace with justice. Through constitutional reform or by decree, he could proceed with proposals such as not allowing ex-combatants behind grave human rights abuses to take political office until they have confessed their war crimes and compensated victims.\u0026nbspThe current agreement allows most rebels to avoid jail, a sore point for many.\u0026nbspMr Duque\u0027s detractors warn that his victory could throw an already delicate peace process into disarray.\u0026nbspI think it will set up a big constitutional battle, said Cynthia Arnson, director of the Latin America programme at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars in Washington.\u0026nbspFARC leaders apologise for war crimesMr Duque is the son of a former governor and energy minister who friends say has harboured presidential aspirations since he was a child. The father-of-three entered public service almost two decades ago as an adviser to the man he will succeed a president, Mr Santos, who was then Colombia\u0027s finance minister.\u0026nbspHe later moved to Washington, where he spent more than a decade at the Inter-American Development Bank, first as an adviser for three Andean countries and later as chief of the cultural ision.\u0026nbspIt was during that time that Mr Duque forged a close relationship with Mr Uribe, the torchbearer of conservatives who is both adored and detested by legions of Colombians.\u0026nbspWith Mr Uribe\u0027s backing,\u0026nbspMr Duque was elected to Colombia\u0027s Senate in 2014. He earned a reputation as a like-minded security hawk who did his homework and earned the respect of colleagues across the political spectrum.\u0026nbspThroughout his campaign, Mr Duque was dogged by accusations he would be little more than a puppet for Mr Uribe, who is constitutionally barred from seeking a third term. Though praised for weakening the FARC and drawing record foreign investment, the former president\u0026nbsphas also been blamed for the military\u0027s killing of thousands of civilians who were falsely portrayed as rebels to inflate body counts.\u0026nbspTowards the end of his victory speech, Mr Duque thanked Mr Uribe but said he would strive to bridge Colombia\u0027s isions. He stuck to his message of peace, saying\u0026nbsphe wants to see rank-and-file guerrilla members succeed in civilian life and become part of a growing Colombian economy.\u0026nbspI\u0027m not going to govern with hatred, he said. Neither in my mind nor my heart is there a desire for revenge and retaliation.\u0026nbspEnter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Working mothers are often the most motivated and dynamic workers in the room.And yet working mothers still get seriously bad press.The comments by Kelly Brook this week are a case in point.She said on TV’s Loose Women some working mothers use their children as an “excuse” to skip deadlines or miss work.She also said it’s unprofessional for women to talk about children in the workplace and that “professional” women never do so.Kelly — who doesn’t have any children — made the remarks during a discussion about whether it is a mother’s job to look after her sick children.I honestly wonder what her views are founded on.Since she started modelling when she was still a teenager, it’s hard to imagine she has ever worked any kind of nine-to-five job in an office.And has she ever employed any working mums? I don’t know for sure but I somehow doubt it.I think Kelly’s comments are just founded on prejudice.I also wonder why she didn’t include men in her evaluation of working ­parents.Funnily enough men, in my experience, are way more comfortable than many women about citing ­childcare or a sick child as the reason for their absence or lateness.And most working women I know would go to extraordinary lengths to avoid “blaming” their absence on their children.Either way, Kelly’s suggestion that it’s more professional for women not to mention their children is crazy.But with views like that flying around — from other women — is it any surprise that some women worry that if they mention their children at work they will be discriminated against?I certainly know women who go to work and feel like they have to “present” as being someone without children — for fear of losing out on promotion.But if we all pretend we don’t have kids we will never change people’s opinion.So the more women talk about the fact they are working mothers — and proud — the more perceptions will change.It’s important people realise there IS pressure on a working parent — and particularly on working mums.But that’s very different to assuming the pressure makes them unreliable.No doubt when Kelly Brook has children herself, she will realise all this.And I really hope she does have kids.Unlike Luisa Zissman, who said in retaliation to her comments that Kelly will “never have children” because of her “track record with men”.That’s mean-spirited and unfair.I am sure motherhood will be the making of Kelly, just as it is for so many other women.Having said all of the above though, I will say this: There is a difference between acknowledging that you are a working mother and banging on about your kids and their achievements to anyone who will listen.Don’t get me wrong.I often talk to other working mums whose kids are at the same stage as mine about whatever issues we are particularly grappling with.But no matter how wonderful your kids are, there is nothing more boring to most people than being shown pictures of kids they’ve never met and don’t know.In other words, it’s one thing being proud to be a working mother — but we should all avoid being baby bores.The fact is, breastfeeding is not for everyone. Nor does it necessarily come down to choice – sometimes it just ain’t going to happen, for a variety of reasons.If that’s the case women should be supported, not vilified and pressured.For what it’s worth, I tried breastfeeding – for about five minutes. It didn’t work for me and, having just given birth to another human being, I didn’t feel bad about that one little bit.After all, it’s my body and I’ll do what I like, thanks very much. No one was going to tell me I was letting my kids down by giving them formula and – guess what – they’ve turned out fine. ONE of the highlights of my year was attending a private lunch with the Queen at Buckingham Palace last Wednesday.I left feeling bowled over by how incredible she is, so engaging and knowledgeable on so many subjects, from working mothers to football.The other thing that struck me is how very human and down to earth she is.When we were comparing notes about our various family members and how quickly they grow up, I realised we were just talking woman to woman.It really was an extraordinary lunch with an extraordinary person. IN the wake of the allegations against Harvey Weinstein it is no surprise that large companies – especially those in the film industry – are absolutely terrified their staff might behave inappropriately.But the news that Netflix has banned flirting is pretty unbelievable.It has issued a series of guidelines for employees about how to behave at work.That includes a ban on film crews looking at anyone for more than five seconds and the suggestion that anyone who feels pestered at work yells: “Stop! Don’t do that again!”Employees are also not allowed to touch or hug people for too long.It’s not that I disagree with those guidelines – try locking eyes with someone for five seconds and you’ll realise it’s creepy.It’s the fact that Netflix feels the need to issue them.I guess the company executives think their employees are in need of guidance.But the rules they have set out look, to any right-minded person, like common sense.After all, most of us know if our attention is unwanted or if someone feels uncomfortable – we stop whatever is causing the issue.And if you need a set of rules like this to tell you how to behave then there is a problem.The fact Netflix has decided it needs to do this is, frankly, a terrible state of affairs.It’s also a bit ironic given how many of the shows it makes and airs are about rape, murder and other violence against women.I guess there’s an element here of Netflix wanting to be seen to be doing the right thing.But to my mind it’s a bit holier than thou – and the company has taken it too far.CAN it really be true that Niall Aslam quit Love Island because he is insecure about his ears?If so, that is so sad. What is wrong with our young people? Actually, I know the answer to that.I can honestly say that I was never worried about body issues and none of my friends were either – it simply wouldn’t have occurred to us to compare ourselves unfavourably to everyone else.I’m pretty sure this kind of insecurity, which is rife among our young people and getting worse, is a direct result of reality TV and social media. IN the same week it was revealed that a young girl wet herself rather than interrupt her gaming, new research has proved that video games are addictive in the same way as drugs and alcohol.So what can we do about this new epidemic?There is usually an age limit for these games – and that is often ignored.But the fact is, you can’t expect the Government to sort this out: It is a parenting issue.Technology has given us many positives over the years – but it’s also caused problems that didn’t exist a decade or two ago.And this is one of them.Parents, listen up.If you want to avoid children getting addicted to games, don’t buy them.Limit the time your children have on technology.Get involved with what they are doing online and don’t just turn a blind eye.The best thing you can do is get kids out of the house – active, busy and involved in sport.Also bear in mind that if you are lazy, they will be lazy.And if you spend all day, every day, looking at your phone, so will they.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Goods were left scattered throughout shops from the tremor.It also cracked roads and broke water pipes, leaving homes without water.Many homes and buildings, including a major hospital, were temporarily left without power.The initial strength of the quake was measured at 5.9 and the strongest shaking was north of Osaka.Live footage showed burst water mains and a house on fire after the quake hit Japans second-biggest metropolis as commuters were heading to work.The morning commute was disrupted, as dozens of domestic flights in and out of Osaka were grounded, while train and subway service in the Osaka area including the bullet train were suspended to check for damage.Passengers were seen exiting trains on the tracks between stations. Some subway services started to resume in the afternoon.Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said the government was assessing damage and that its top priority was the safety of residents.Kansai Electric Power said no irregularities had been detected at the Mihama, Takahama and Ohi nuclear plants after the quake.Kansai also said more than 170,000 households were without power in Osaka and neighbouring Hyogo prefecture.Daihatsu Motor Co, an Osaka-based unit of Toyota Motor Corp, said it had suspended production at its factories in Osaka and Kyoto while they check for damage.Sharp Corp said its directly owned plants in the area were operating as usual, but a joint venture plant with parent Hon Hai Precision Industry said it had halted operations for safety checks.Kate Kilpatrick, 19, who was staying in a hotel in Osaka when the quake hit, said: We were sleeping and it woke us up abruptly.It was so terrifying because this is my first earthquake. I thought it was a nightmare because I was so confused. The whole world was aggressively shaking.Ms Kilpatrick, visiting Japan for the first time from the United States, said alarms went off almost immediately in the hotel and a loudspeaker told guests to stay away from windows.Osaka is to host next years Group of 20 summit.A massive magnitude 9.0 quake hit northeastern Japan on March 11, 2011, triggering a huge tsunami that killed some 18,000 people and triggered the worlds worst nuclear disaster in a quarter of a century at Tokyo Electric Powers Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/nintchdbpict000407667863.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"thomas markle meghan harry good morning britain","story":"In his first interview since missing Meghan Markle and Harrys wedding he said: I said to him, youre a gentleman, promise me youll never raise your hand against my daughter and I gave my permission.The 73-year-old revealed today on Good Morning Britain: Meghan told me first and then a few times after that Harry got on the phone with Meghan, they got on the phone together, and Harry asked for her hand on the phone.He told hosts Piers Morgan and Susanna Reid he wished he had been the one to walk Meghan into St Georges Chapel, and revealed he cried as he watched Prince Charles step in on May 19.The former lighting director, who lives in Mexico, was forced to pull out of the royal wedding with just days to go for a heart operation.In the week running up to the big day he changed his mind several times over if he would be attending, before finally deciding he wouldnt be able to fly to the UK - after it was revealed he worked with paparazzi to stage pictures.The Duchess of Sussexs dad said Meghan cried at the news, adding: The unfortunate thing for me now is Im a footnote in one of the greatest moments in history rather than the dad walking her down the aisle.But said: I was honoured. I cant think of a better replacement than someone like Prince Charles.It might have been a treat for him as well because he didnt have a daughter.Mr Markle revealed he had been working on a speech for the wedding, he said: I worked on a little speech, whether I got to say it or not and the little speech had the phone calls in when I talked to Harry and how Meghan introduced him as this nice guy from England, this prince, and then we go on to thank the royal family for opening up to my child.He also shared details on his first chat with his new royal son-in-law: He said hello Thomas and I said hi Harry and it became a conversation back and forth mostly about politics he was asking me how I was feeling that day and I said how unhappy I was with the president Donald Trump, and thats how it began.We talked a little about how they met and how happy they were with each other.Hes quite easy to talk to, hes quite a comfortable person to talk to.

This is the chicken theyre selling at Coles. As it turns out, the bizarre colour change is rather common and caused by intense contractions of the breast fillet and tender, the parts responsible for flapping the wings.The tender is more vulnerable to the condition because it is surrounded by a tough inelastic muscle, according to an academic report.It said the initial damage turns the muscle red at first as the ruptured blood vessels in the tender haemorrhage.The Mississippi study added: Over the next few days, the tender gradually begins to take on a bruised or discoloured look associated with necrosis.As time passes (perhaps a week or even longer after the initial event), the tender takes on the characteristic green colour for which the condition is named.A spokeswoman for Coles told news.au they had contacted Ferguson and offered her a full refund or replacement.She said the quality of the supermarket’s products is very important and encouraged anyone who encountered an item they were not 100 per cent happy with to return it.It’s not the first time a chicken from Coles was cut open and dinner immediately ruined. In 2016, social media blew up over claims a chicken appears to have gangrene.A Coles spokesman reassured those concerned that it was DPM.Researchers have noted that cases of DPM are increasing but “the lesion does not impair the general health of birds and is generally found during cut-up and deboning”.A version of this story first appeared on news.au"},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/NINTCHDBPICT000414269547.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"frankies new world order brings me out in noyles","story":"Probably not.But the answer’s there for you anyway, if you want to see, at 10pm, BBC2, Friday.It’s called Frankie Boyle’s New World Order and is officially classed, by listings, as a “comedy”, even though it’s nothing of the sort.That’s just a Get Out Of Jail card for BBC2, because New World Order is very obviously a political discussion show featuring a host and four guests who represent every possible shade of opinion, from the hard left to the extreme left.Typically, these will be Sara Pascoe, Katherine Ryan,  statistics expert Mona Chalabi, who’s as funny as her job suggests, and a token male in Miles Jupp or David Baddiel, whose purpose is to sit there, furiously agreeing with everything the women say.Starting point here will be a “light-hearted” subject that plays to the collective bias.One week, for instance, it was “Donald Trump will be the first crowd-funded assassination”.A move the panel eventually seemed to rule out, not on the grounds it’s morally wrong, but that it would: “Make him a martyr.”On the eve of Harry and Meghan’s wedding it was “We have 12 hours to abolish the monarchy”, which ended with a huge round of applause for Frankie’s suggestion of “executing them”.If you’re waiting for me here to tell you one person demurred or looked a bit ashamed, you haven’t been watching BBC comedy recently.There is no shame or opposition these days, least of all from the host, who’s made one of the more remarkable transformations of recent times.Just eight years ago, Frankie was telling jokes about disabled children, now here he is, via a column in , preaching about “the inhumanity of the Tories” and parading his apparent concerns for the children of Palestine.Remarkable, but I guess that’s what happens if the BBC decide you’re “One of us”.You get your own show and a stand-up slot at the beginning of each episode, where Frankie settles scores in his usual gear-crunching style.Targets may be Brexit, the Tories, America and Israel one week. Israel, America, the Tories and Brexit the next.Corbyn’s off limits, obviously, as Frankie thinks he’s “a real person”, but there’s a regular cast of soft targets, including Donald Trump, Richard Branson (“a c***”), Boris, Michael Gove, Ruth Davidson (“a bastard”) and usually a joke about Prince Philip dying, which I think we can put down to the host’s very obvious and well-deserved self-loathing.Prince Philip, after all, was mentioned in dispatches fighting real Nazis in World War Two, instead of just ranting about them to a couple of hundred students at the Edinburgh Fringe.At the age of 97, The Duke is also still a thousand times more unpredictable, off-message, edgy and funny than any of the people on NWO and, unlike Frankie, who has 11 scriptwriters, also comes up with his own material.The hatred and abuse of Israel is slightly harder to explain, though. Frankie claims it’s because “They break international law”, but then so do a lot of countries, including Russia, which even shoots down passenger aircraft.A stroke of luck then, you might think, that the BBC’s just screened Frankie’s two-part, pre-World Cup travelogue, Frankie Goes To Russia, where, unfortunately, he didn’t have time to raise the issue of the aircraft, but he did go on Moscow radio to denounce the British Empire (topical or what!).If you were expecting anything else, of course, you give Frankie Boyle more credit than his apparent cowardice and hypocrisy deserves.If you were also expecting laughter, then I applaud your optimism, but you’ll no more get it on NWO than on Have I Got News For You, or The Mash Report, or any of those other shows that have decided the right-on part of the world is untouchable and their own left-wing agenda is far more important than being funny.The BBC’s continuing claims of impartiality, on the other hand? Well, forgive me if I let out the hollowest laugh of my life, but they are really, darkly funny.Ha . . .— GIVEN the BBC’s endless, self-serving and grovelling tributes to the NHS are still very much ongoing, I feel it would be wrong, at this point, if I didn’t join in the birthday celebrations.For though it has its faults and is often criticised, it’s been there for us, healing the lame, curing the sick, becoming the envy of the world, a shining beacon to the entire universe, which makes me fall to my knees and give thanks for seven decades’ service at the mere mention of its sacred initials.Happy 71st, Bupa.All those liars who say they want fat, unattractive people on Love Island. The disturbing Trouble With Women revelation that Anne Robinson keeps a scrapbook of her old newspaper columns, when so many hamsters still go without decent bedding every night.And The X Factor giving a job not just to Robbie Williams, who’s won 18 Brit awards and five Ivor Novello awards, but also his wife, Ayda Field, who handed Emmerdale the NTA’s 2017 Best Soap award. There on merit . . .IF you have ever wondered why some people are so dementedly pleased to see the World Cup arrive, try watching daytime TV just before the ball-kicking tournament starts.I did last Wednesday and quickly fell down a QVC rabbit hole, where I discovered Amanda Holden has a neat line in selling stuff nobody actually needs but everyone seems to want.Suitcases that aren’t really suitcases, string chairs designed to look like a cat’s sphincter, rugs that would make a Moroccan fez salesman blush, machine-woven toilet roll baskets, lamp-shades so taut and expressionless they could sit on the Britain’s Got Talent panel, if you just pre-programmed them with a dirty laugh.Amanda’s exclusive landfill range has the lot. Piece de resistance, though, has to be her “glass infinity spheres”, which defy any sort of purpose or description, but she had a crack anyway.“They’re, uhm, a bit like those things in the ’80s and ’90s you put fingers and hands on.”Lava lamps? Tamagotchis? Les Dennis? Sadly, we may never know.The afternoon’s real curve ball, though, was introduced by QVC’s endlessly enthusiastic host Pipa Gordon, vis-a-vis lightbulbs: “Amanda, bayonet or screw?”Get back to you, Pipa. I’m just emailing a format idea to ITVBe.Sophie and Sadie both switching their lights off the moment 5ive’s Ritchie Neville burst into song on a celebrity version of Take Me Out.The One Show’s Alex Jones telling David Walliams: “You’re handsome . . . in a different way.”And a dreadful opening to the World Cup being elevated by the brilliant Spain versus Ronaldo game, ITV’s superior selection of pundits and Wrighty, very solemnly assuring us: “I think Suarez has got a big one in him.”—TUESDAY, Good Morning Britain calls in the big diplomatic hitter to comment on the US/North Korea peace deal.Singer Michael Ball: “I would feel better if it wasn’t those two having the conversation.“But there is nothing better than people talking, ’cos . . . ”’Cos love, love changes everything. Hands and faces, earth and sky.AFTER a relatively slow start, Love Island is now in the groove and I am totally immersed. To such an extent that I developed a really strong loathing for a couple of the contestants last week.Namely, Eyal, who’s as ruthless and possessive as the next smirking little berk who claims he’s “spiritual”, and Hayley, a venomous little madam whose description of herself – “I’m cute, funny, feisty, dozy” – is a million miles away from anyone else’s, unless the Theatre Royal St Helens is seriously short of dwarves next Christmas.Fortunately, she’s gone now and there are quite a few of the Islanders that I do actually like.Stationery-obsessed Jack, who has Dancing On Ice 2019 written all over him, top secret Josh, who can’t say too much about his job (taps nose) and Laura, who, like every Scottish woman ever born, is incapable of disguising her feelings, good or bad, and has a biological clock that’s ticking like a Countdown Conundrum.It’s the production that still sets Love Island apart, though, and the fact it’s the only reality show which would drop Beethoven’s Pastoral Symphony into the mix or have the wit to pay off the Alex/Eyal showdown with this news: “Megan had to choose between a man who saves lives with his bare hands and a boy who can walk up and down in a straight line while pouting.“There was only ever going to be one winner.”Brilliant television.Steve Wilson: “Portugal’s big man in the sky is on the pitch.”Alex Scott: “Croatia looked lustlackre.”Glenn Hoddle: “The Ref saw it so he must have been watching.”THIS week’s winner is Gemma Collins and Tiffany from Bride Of Chucky. Sent in by Connor David, via email.Picture research: Alfie Snelling.GOOD Morning Britain, Piers Morgan: “I love salad.”Good Morning Britain, Susanna Reid: “I’m totally neutral when it comes to politics.” (Dyed-in-the-wool BBC left-of-centre about everything).And Love Island, Alex on Megan revealing she’s a stripper: “I think that showed such character and strength.

Summer solstice is the longest day of the year and is the official start of summer It always takes place from June 20 to June 22 in the northern half of the year.In 2018 it takes place on Thursday, June 21. Summer solstice this year will end on September 23 at which point the autumn equinox begins. In the UK, the summer solstice centres around Stonehenge, which was built between 3,000 and 1,600 BC, where pagans thousands of years ago marked the day.Crucially the rising sun only reaches the centre of the ancient stone circle on one day of each year. Crowds of devotees, often dressed for the occasion, regularly converge to watch the moment the sun rises above the Heel Stone.It’s just one of the many pagan festivals. Others include midwinter and imbolc – the day that traditionally marks the start of spring.In many cases, the rituals are linked with themes of religion or fertility.This is because the day falls halfway between the start of the planting and harvesting seasons. Wianki celebrations in Poland are similar to those held in Britain, as the day is largely considered a pagan religious event.There are different traditions across Europe, with Estonia using the day to mark a shift in planting or cattle rearing.In Russia and Ukraine, it’s tradition for revellers to jump over bonfires to test their bravery and religious faith."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/NINTCHDBPICT0004085849473.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"computer games make children gambling addicts","story":"They warn dozens of titles could act as a gateway to problem betting in casinos or bookies when kids are older.Games such as Fifa 18, Assassin’s Creed Origins and Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare allow youngsters to buy so-called loot boxes.These contain various rewards that can improve a player’s chance of success, such as more powerful weapons and extra lives.Some games, including those targeted at kids as young as 13, allow players to cash out winnings for real money. Experts say these encourage kids to take financial risks for chance rewards — the same behaviour seen in betting.They called for a ban on loot boxes in games targeted at under-18s.It comes a day after the World Health Organisation classified gaming addiction as a medical disorder. Dr Aaron Drummond, of New Zealand’s Massey University, analysed loot boxes in 22 games aimed at under-18s.Ten met all five definitions of gambling — with six approved for children aged 13 or younger.Dr Drummond said: “People exposed to gambling when young are most at risk of developing problematic gambling behaviours.”Hit title Fortnite now has a loot box-free version after a backlash from gamers.Ukie, trade body for the games industry, dismissed the findings.Chief Dr Jo Twist said: “Loot boxes, and the purchasing of in-game items more generally, are covered by and fully compliant with existing relevant UK regulations.

Delays are all the more alarming, because more than ‘two billion euros (£1.75bn) have been spent on modernising controls since 2011.”Heavily unionised French air traffic controllers are currently striking regularly after joining a national public sector movement opposing President Emmanuel Macron’s employment reforms.Many are members of the USAC-CGT who said say they have to “resist the erosion of human rights,” said a spokesman.Air-traffic control in France handles more flights than any other country in Europe, because of the size of the country and its central geographical position.Carriers such as British Airways and Ryanair, the biggest budget airline in Europe, regularly have to make cancellations or delay flights because of the French.Under EU rules, passengers are not entitled to cash compensation if their journeys are ruined by strike action, although they may get accommodation and meals paid for."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/NINTCHDBPICT0004132975582-e1529084313308.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"rapport with her majesty gives meghan markle last laugh on critics","story":"Photos of her with the Queen this week showed the two of them getting along like a house on fire.It was clear Her Maj has a lot of time and affection for the newest member of the clan and she went out of her way to make Meghan feel at ease.It was very much a royal masterclass from the Queen to her young apprentice, and Meghan appeared to pass all of the tests with flying colours.It must have been intimidating for the newly minted Duchess to find herself carrying out a royal engagement for the first time with the woman she can now call “granny” without Harry by her side.There was a bit of a faux pas when the Queen had to briskly usher her grand-daughter-in-law into the limo when Meghan appeared to be unsure of ­protocol.The Queen then took her ­preferred seat behind the driver. These things matter when you are 92.You have your favourite chair, tea cup and biscuits, and routine is important.Both of these women will have bonded during the overnight journey in the royal train to carry out engagements in ­Cheshire, with the Queen dispensing the solid, common sense advice she has learned the hard way after 66 years on the throne.They might be from ­completely different backgrounds and ­cultures but the Queen and Meghan do have a ­surprising amount in common.Obviously first and foremost they both share a deep love for Prince Harry, but they also have a real sense of duty and a desire to serve.Meghan has a lot more substance than the majority of self-centred young American actresses and, from an early age she has wanted to change the world for the better.This week she became an official partner in The Royal Foundation, joining William and Kate and husband Harry — all dubbed the “Fab Four” ­— to help charities close to their hearts.Meghan wants to make a difference. She doesn’t want to be just a clothes horse or to merely cut ribbons and unveil plaques, and I don’t believe she’d be ­content with just being a mum and virtual stay-at-home housewife like most upper-class wives. She wants to roll up her sleeves and get stuck in.Those who snarkily accuse her of self-promotion are missing the point.Meghan is canny enough to realise her new position in life means she will ­constantly be photographed and written and talked about.She knows that a new hairstyle or frock will steal the headlines but will hope people will also listen to what she has to say on poverty in Africa, equal rights for women and saving elephants.Meanwhile, her old life could be luring Meghan back to La La Land with news that her performance in Suits has been submitted for an Emmy award.A submission is a long way from a nomination, but it will be interesting to see if those in charge fast-track her into the awards category for best actress. ­Personally, I don’t think it will happen.Even Meghan would admit she wasn’t by any stretch of the imagination the best actor in Suits.If Meghan was nominated and ended up winning, it would be nothing more than a stunt to get some sort of seal of royal approval.Surely even the US entertainment industry wouldn’t be that cynical.Since Meghan met Harry, she has been compared to Grace Kelly, the Hollywood star who gave up her career to marry Prince Rainier III of Monaco.Unlike Grace Kelly, who wanted to go back into movies, I don’t see Meghan being in any way tempted back to her old life after landing the best role of all.That’s not a criticism because I admire her work ethic and single-mindedness — and I think her desire to be a force for good is genuine.The Queen is nobody’s fool and if she thinks Meghan is worth cultivating and training, the new ­American Duchess should have our approval, too.THE two new judges being wooed to join The X Factor could very well save this show’s rather tired-looking format.Robbie Williams is an inspired choice, bringing his own brand of cheeky humour but also a real empathy for all those seeking fame and fortune.I reckon, however, his wife Ayda could prove to be the real star.She’s funny, feisty and has proved to be a TV favourite during her appearances on Loose Women.Ayda won’t take any nonsense from the formidable Simon Cowell and, much as she loves Robbie, you can expect some straight-talking spats between them.Of course there are those who will say she’s only getting a seat on the judges’ panel because of her husband’s fame, but I reckon Ayda , left with Robbie, is more than up to the job and will be a much needed breath of fresh air on a panel that was looking increasingly bored and out of touch.ON World Blood Donor Day this week I repaid my debt to the NHS when my fantastic TV show team donated their very own blood (having already given their sweat and tears on a daily basis).I had to have a life-saving three pints of blood after a serious accident and, like every other patient who is given a transfusion, I am no longer allowed to donate my own.Where can I give blood? Here’s how to find a donation centre and how often you’re able to donateIt’s something that has made me feel very guilty, so I cannot thank my team enough – although there would have been even more of the precious life-saving blood if some of the boys who work with me and happen to be gay had not been banned from donating.Gay men who have had recent sex are not allowed to be donors, which surely is an edict that needs to be changed.There has to be a way to ensure safety without making gay men feel like pariahs.IN Hollywood, money talks and the box office dictates trends.So It’s good news that the all-female Ocean’s 8 has trounced the other male-dominated movies in the franchise, because it clearly shows moviegoers WILL happily pay to see films starring women in leading roles.Ocean’s 8 is a rather silly but hugely enjoyable spin on the heist movie with a satisfying end twist and decent parts for women – who are all too often usually “the wife” or “the best friend”.It shows that the appallingly bad all-girl version of Ghostbusters, a real stinker that bombed horribly, was just a blip.Hopefully, this will be the start of more big- budget films with kick-ass roles for women that aren’t twee or patronising.ALL my fellow Holby City fans know that surgeon Jac Naylor would make a polar bear shiver if she gave it one of her “looks”.She’s the ultimate ice maiden, although we have seen a little bit of a thaw in recent weeks on her return to our screens.In fact, Jac showed her human side when the character had a breakdown on screen, something that Rosie Marcel, who has played the character for 13 years, knows all about.Rosie told me that she suffered her own mental health problems after having a real-life breakdown on set.She suffered from depression and had to seek medical help.Rosie walked out of her house in her pyjamas and bare feet and even had the dark thought that her family would be better off without her.Luckily, she was given treatment and was able to get back to work, but it was a frightening time and demonstrates once again that mental health problems can hit anyone.I salute Rosie for being so open and brave about her struggle.FASTEN your seatbelts, it’s going to be a bumpy ride in Poldark when the admirable Rebecca Front sails into Truro harbour like a magnificent galleon as the formidable Lady Whitworth.This ghastly harridan is the mother of the monstrous Ossie Whitworth, who has made his reluctant wife Morwenna suffer the torments of hell and even had his wicked way with her sister.If you wondered how Ossie could be so self-centred, heartless and cruel, then all will be explained when his mother heaves into view.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Say it. Sorted.”Endless repetition probably cost her a million votes in last year’s catastrophic snap election and earned her the label “MayBot”.She did it again while hailing her long-overdue £380million-a-week Brexit boost for the health service.Her NHS treatment for diabetes helped her “get on with my job”, she said.Except, it didn’t. Her Type 1 diabetes deserves sympathy and understanding, but it has nothing to do with her job as PM.To lead is to choose. Mrs May chose to lead but suffers paralysis by analysis.Since achieving her dream of leading this country, Mrs May has failed to make the right choices at a pivotal moment in British history.As a sceptical Remainer, she was perfectly placed to steer Britain through the complex task of leaving the European Union.Her first act should have been to summon her Cabinet and tell them “Brexit means Brexit”, which means every minister and Whitehall mandarin must work their socks off to make it a success.And while staring Chancellor Phil Hammond in the eye, invite anyone who felt otherwise to find another job.Instead, she boxed herself in by triggering a rigid Brexit timetable, slapping £39BILLION cash on the table and inviting Brussels’ biggest bullies to do their worst.And they did. Any idea this would be a friendly divorce has turned to ashes. We are at war with Europe, if only by another name.This week we are likely to see their Commons cats’-paws, the increasingly triumphant Remoaners, take Mrs May and the UK to the brink of abject surrender.We are being forced to repeal the verdict of our biggest ever single-issue vote by screeching siren Anna “Suck it up” Soubry and hypocrite Tory lawyer Dominic Grieve, who yesterday said he and fellow rebels were prepared to bring down the Government if they are not granted a “meaningful vote” on the final Brexit deal.Obnoxious Soubry gives even Remainers a bad name, resorting to reckless slurs of “racism” even as her precious European Union is being torn apart by rows over uncontrolled mass immigration.She shrugs off the real grounds for scepticism about Brussels — its sneering contempt for democracy and the misbegotten euro, which has destroyed the job hopes of a generation of young Europeans.These were the failures which actually led to Brexit, long before Tony Blair flung open the door to 4million foreign migrants and German Chancellor Angela Merkel raised the stakes with a million more.It was Merkel, as much as Blair and David Cameron, who soured the public view of Europe’s Grand Project years before Brexit ever became a possibility.But while it is easy to condemn defeated Remoaners as sore losers, it is hard not to be impressed by their organisational zeal, which would do credit to Jeremy Corbyn’s Marxist militia.By stark contrast, all of those who voted Out — and won — are entitled to be outraged by the performance of the Cabinet’s victorious Brexiteers.What the hell have they been doing for the past 18 months?They have been caught flat-footed, ambushed in the night, bound and gagged by a richly funded, highly motivated mob of undemocratic contemptibles. They should be shot for sleeping on the job.Boris trumpets the occasional bugle call. David Davis threatens to quit once a month. Michael Gove is busy elsewhere. And Liam Fox?They never talk to each other, prepare strategy or organise tactics, let alone mobilise financial backing or communicate with 17.4million supporters. Do they too think we are all thick and racistNow we risk the horrifying prospect of remaining half-in, half-out of the EU, robbed of our vote, our hard-won rebate and £39billion in hard cash.The game may be lost by default to the dark forces of organised bureaucracy: The Civil Service, the BBC, EU pensioners such as Peter Mandelson and those faceless Eurocrats.We shot their fox in The Glorious Referendum, only to let them regroup and return as a pack of wolves with a scent of blood.They had to suck it up or risk choking on the toxic fumes.But I think it sounds more like the punchline to a particularly revolting joke which is unsuitable for a family newspaper like this.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

There is no real commitment to it.\"Pressed further, he added: \"I think he was open to the experiment.\" Meghan\u0027s dad was not \u0027wowed\u0027 by Prince HarryWhen asked how he felt about the nuptials and whether he was \"wowed\" by the prospect of his daughter marrying into the British monarchy, he said: \"This is my daughter. My daughter is certainly a prize for him as well.\"Yeah, he\u0027s an interesting guy, he\u0027s a prince, but my daughter has been a princess since the day she was born.\"Recalling the moment Harry asked for his blessing to marry Meghan, Mr Markle said: \"Harry asked for her hand over the phone and I said: \u0027You are a gentleman, promise me you will never raise your hand against my daughter and of course I will grant you my permission\u0027.\" Meghan and her dad used code to keep Harry a secretMr Markle revealed he and his daughter would speak about Prince Harry in code to keep a lid on the fact they were dating.Recounting the moment his daughter broke the news to him about her new relationship, he said: \"The first phone calls were, \u0027Daddy, I have a new boyfriend\u0027, and I said, \u0027that\u0027s really nice\u0027.\"The next call was like, \u0027he\u0027s British\u0027... and eventually the third time around it was like, \u0027he is a prince\u0027, and at that point she said, \u0027it\u0027s Harry\u0027. I said, \u0027oh, Harry, okay\u0027.\"She said \u0027of course we\u0027ll have to call him \u0027H\u0027 so no one knows\u0027 that we are talking about Harry\u0027. Eventually I spoke to him as well. A very nice man, a gentleman, very likeable.\" Mr Markle did not realise the enormity of his daughter\u0027s marriageMeghan told him first about the wedding, and a few times afterwards she and Prince Harry both called Mr Markle together to discuss their plans.\"My daughter is very intelligent. She knows how to choose who she wants to be with. She\u0027s a smart girl, and she made a good pick, didn\u0027t she,\" said Mr Markle.But he also said that at the time, he didn\u0027t realise what his daughter was getting herself into and that she would become a global superstar overnight.\"I\u0027m not even sure she realised that,\" he said. \"The royals are very complicated. It\u0027s a whole different lifestyle, but I think my daughter is capable of anything, and she will certainly be a complement to the royal family.\" Meghan\u0027s dad had no idea he would be thrust into the media spotlightAsked if he was aware how much focus there would also be on him and the rest of his family, Mr Markle replied: \"I had no idea. I had no idea.\"It was a total invasion for quite a while. Everyone said I was hiding in Mexico. That was not true, I have been living in Mexico for six years.\"He described first being snapped by photographers as he walked out of a store: \"Suddenly they were flashing in my face and asking me questions.\"I run to my truck, jump in my truck and throw up a peace sign. I figured it was better than putting up half a peace sign. It\u0027s been like that for about a year now.\" Harry and Meghan told Mr Markle not to speak to the pressMr Markle revealed Prince Harry had offered him advice on how to deal with the media attention he was suddenly getting.He said the couple advised him not to speak to the press and to \"be careful\".\"They were very emphatic about not giving any information to the press because it just encourages them more,\" said the 73-year-old.\"Having the press at my door and everywhere I go, that kind of becomes an invasion a bit... but it\u0027s a compliment. My daughter is now seen all over the world as a duchess, so I\u0027m very proud of her. I\u0027ll adjust to this. I\u0027ll get over this.\" Meghan\u0027s dad was involved in setting up the paparazzi pictures of himThe former Hollywood lighting director admitted the photographs of him preparing for the wedding were staged.\"I didn\u0027t do this for money, I did it to change my image,\" he confessed. \"For one whole year I was presented as a hermit living out in Mexico, but obviously it was a mistake and it went wrong.\"This was a presentation to me to change my image because for the last year, photographs of me were always derogatory. They would take pictures of me hand-grabbing a beer or pictures of me getting in my car, or taking the garbage out.\"They\u0027d take pictures of me buying a toilet and making a big deal out of it. They\u0027d take all kinds of pictures of me making me look negative, so I thought this would be a nice way of improving my look.Mr Markle didn\u0027t go to the wedding because he was embarrassed about staging the photos\"The truth is I couldn\u0027t get over the fact that that had happened. All that stuff was working on me, I had a bit of a heart condition.\"This pushed me a little further to the part where I had heart palpitations. I had to drive at 2am to a hospital. They sent me to another little hospital and then they sent me to a bigger hospital and I had a heart attack.\"A day-and-a-half later he said he felt better and checked himself out against doctors\u0027 wishes in a bid to make it to the wedding, but the heart palpitations returned when he got home to Mexico.\"At that time I started getting chest pains and I said I have to cancel because I didn\u0027t take care of the heart problem before. I had a good friend take me back to a hospital across the border to the States where I was told that my condition was very bad and they had to operate, and I had heart surgery.\" It was always Meghan\u0027s desire for her father to give her awayMr Markle said he was determined to walk Meghan down the aisle and was \"excited and ready for it\".\"It was all set in place for me to go,\" he said. \"I knew I could rise to the occasion. I\u0027d be limping down the aisle, nonetheless I could walk my daughter down the aisle. I definitely wanted that - that was in the plan and that would have to be.\"He continued: \"Meghan was putting together fittings for me. It was all done sort of secret. They arranged for me to show up in Los Angeles in Beverley Hills under a different name. One time I was there and bought a pair of pants and by mistake gave my credit card, so they got my real name, but nonetheless nobody knew what was going on.\"He said he did consider travelling to England for the wedding sooner, but changed his mind: \"Those guys were busy. I think the last thing they needed was me popping in.\" Meghan \u0027cried\u0027 when her dad told her he wouldn\u0027t make the weddingMr Markle said he told Meghan he was not going to be able to attend her wedding just before he underwent heart surgery for a blockage in his aorta.\"This is what doctors called the widow maker - it would have killed me,\" he said.Speaking about the moment when he told the couple, he said: \"They were disappointed. Meghan cried, I\u0027m sure, she did cry, and they both said, \u0027take care of yourself, we are really worried about you\u0027.\"He said Harry and Meghan discussed coming over to see him, but he insisted he would be fine.\"I couldn\u0027t go, but I said worry about the wedding.\" Mr Markle was \u0027jealous\u0027 of Charles walking Meghan down the aisle\"I was honoured, I can\u0027t think of a better replacement than someone like Prince Charles. He looked very handsome and my daughter looked beautiful with him.\"I was jealous. I wish I had been there. I wish it had been me. But thank God he was there, I thank him for that.\"It might have been a treat for him as well, because he doesn\u0027t have a daughter.\" He watched the royal wedding at a B\u0026BMr Markle said a friend found him a room at a bed and breakfast in California for him to stay in for a couple of days to recover after the operation.\"She was beautiful, It was incredible watching her,\" he said. \"I cried a little bit about it.\"She was so beautiful walking down that aisle. I was so proud. She was so gorgeous. I was very proud, I couldn\u0027t have seen a better moment in my life.\"I was very upset that it wasn\u0027t me but the whole world was watching my daughter. I was very happy about that.\"He continued: \"The unfortunate thing for me now is I\u0027m a footnote in one of the greatest moments in history rather than the dad walking her down the aisle. That upsets me somewhat.\"It was a very emotional moment, I cried about it, and I regretted it because I really wanted to walk my daughter down the aisle. I wanted that moment. But I\u0027m thankful for everything the way it went.\" Meghan\u0027s dad expects his daughter to get pregnant soon\"She\u0027s wanted children for a long time and when she met Harry and she spoke how much she loves him, there\u0027s got to be a child in the making, somewhere soon,\" Mr Markle said.

And he claimed the so-called Brexit dividend - which the Institute for Fiscal Studies this declared to be a myth - will be worth \u0026pound135 billion a year by 2025. Taking questions after a speech on Brexit at the Speaker\u0027s House in the Palace of Westminster he said the Government had given Dominic Grieve everything he asked for. He continued: But it has not given Lord Hailsham everything he asked for. Lord Hailsham wants a motion that will stop Brexit, Dominic Grieve has said quite clearly that he does not want to stop Brexit but he wants parliamentary accountability. An unamendable motion is parliamentary accountability. An amendable motion could be used to stop Brexit.

Britain could receive a post-Brexit dividend of \u0026pound135 billion five years after Brexit, Mr Rees-Mogg added. He reiterated the claim while discussing sanctions on US products Britain was obliged to support while a member of the EU. He cited Professor Patrick Minford, the head of the Economists for Free Trade (EFT) group, which came up with the figure in a report last November. The MP said on Monday that being free of EU trade rules would mean our opportunities are going to be much greater and we will be able to deal with other nations.

The MS Society, which supports people with multiple sclerosis, hit out at a senseless rule which can stop people able to walk more than 20 metres from claiming the higher rate of mobility support under the personal independence payment (PIP). The charity, which is calling for the 20-metre rule to be scrapped, said under the previous benefit - disability living allowance (DLA), which had a 50-metre test - 94% of claimants with MS qualified for the higher rate of support, but just 66% do under PIP. As a knock-on effect, MS sufferers were forced to make increased use of NHS services, the charity said. MS Society director of external affairs Genevieve Edwards said: Contrary to the Government\u0027s insistence that PIP is meant to help those with the greatest needs, the truth is it\u0027s causing enormous harm to people with MS, with many losing their independence as a result. This senseless and unfounded rule is leading to people with the highest need facing the biggest losses, and costing our NHS at least an extra \u0026pound7.7 million each year.  A survey of 1,234 people with MS was carried out by ICM Unlimited between January and March 2018, including 447 people who moved from DLA to PIP. Of those, some 39% said they had increased their use of GP services since the change and 30% claimed they had been forced to cut back on spending on treatment or therapies. Waqar Rashid, a consultant neurologist at Royal Surrey County Hospital University Foundation NHS Trust, said: There\u0027s no scientific rationale or basis for the recent change to the 20-metre rule and it\u0027s impacting services as well as people with MS.

Deputy Labour leader Tom Watson has demanded the ASA take action over the claim, which he said was “at best misleading and at worst a complete myth”. The Prime Minister insisted the NHS will receive an additional \u0026pound20 billion a year in real terms funding by 2024, meaning a weekly increase of \u0026pound384 million in real terms, and \u0026pound600 million a week in cash terms compared with now. And a graphic published by the Number 10 Twitter account proudly announces (in large, bold letters) that it will be paid for by the “BREXIT DIVIDEND.” In non-bold letters, it adds: “with us as a country contributing a bit more.”    Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) director Paul Johnson says the dividend doesn\u0027t exist. He says the UK faces a steep exit bill, much of the money that would have gone to the EU has already been promised elsewhere, and the Office for Budget Responsibility has calculated public finances will be \u0026pound15 billion a year worse off due to Brexit. Mr Johnson told the BBC yesterday: “You add to that the commitment the Governments already made to keep funding farmers and so on, there is literally arithmetically no money, and in addition we know, because the Governments accepted this, that the public finances will be worse as a result of the Brexit vote.

More people on Personal Independence Payment (PIP) will be able to wait 10 years before they are re-assessed, officials pledged. And when that re-assessment does come, it will be a \u0027light touch\u0027 review, the government said. Ministers made the decision after bowing to pressure from charities. Those charities welcomed the shake-up for PIP claimants, some of whom have to suffer reassessment every year, as a victory for common sense. But they also warned today\u0027s announcement is not enough - because it will by no means apply to all PIP claimants.  Campaigners warned more must be done to stop people facing the needless and stressful re-tests for their benefits. The Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) has also been unable to say how many people will benefit from the change - because the policy is not finished yet. Detailed guidance will only be issued to staff later this summer. DWP guidance so far claims the 10-year policy will apply to people on the highest level of PIP, with severe or progressive conditions that will not improve. But DWP sources cautioned against coming up with a number of people affected because any help could vary from one case to another. Parkinson\u0027s UK estimated the shake-up will only help around half of people with Parkinson\u0027s who claim PIP. The charity\u0027s campaigning chief Laura Cockram branded today\u0027s announcement a piecemeal solution for a broken system.  She added: “The assessment process is simply not fit for purpose, and does not recognise the reality of living with long-term, progressive conditions. PIP can offer a vital lifeline however, people with Parkinson’s can find the assessment process humiliating and stressful, with assessor’s ignorance of Parkinson’s commonplace. “This is a step in the right direction but far more fundamental changes are needed. Simon Hopkins, chief executive of anti-poverty charity Turn2us, said: We welcome the news that the DWP has listened to the organisations and individuals raising this issue and are changing policy as a result. “However, this solution won’t fix all the issues we have seen with PIP. James Taylor, Head of Policy and Public Affairs at disability charity Scope, said: Today\u0027s announcement is a victory for common sense, but it still doesn\u0027t address the root of the problem with Personal Independence Payment (PIP).

There were cries of shame! as Sir Christopher Chope objected to the Voyeurism (Offences) Bill - which would make it illegal for offenders to take a picture under someone\u0027s clothing without their consent. Now, after Tory MPs slammed their colleague, Theresa May has taken matters into her own hands by taking control of the Bill - guaranteeing it will get through. Here are some of the key questions surrounding the issue: What is upskirting? The cruel and invasive craze involves perpetrators using cameras to take images or video up victims\u0027 clothing without their consent to see their genitals or underwear. While the vast majority of known cases involve men targeting women, the roles sometimes can be reversed. The first available data on the prevalence of upskirting showed victims as young as 10 complaining to police. Currently, there is no specific law in place banning the practice. But haven\u0027t people been convicted of upskirting? While Scotland has had its own law on upskirting for almost a decade, the law in England and Wales has not adapted to advances in technology. Currently, anyone in England and Wales who falls victim to the cruel craze can explore possible convictions for public disorder or indecency. Campaigners want a specific offence. Why could campaigner Gina Martin not prosecute at the time?  Her lawyer, Ryan Whelan, said: Decisions to prosecute rest with the authorities, not the victim. Under the current law the man who upskirted Gina could have potentially been prosecuted for outraging public decency. The problem is that prosecuting upskirters for outraging public decency is not appropriate. There are two primary reasons for this. First the offence of outraging public decency does not apply in all instances of upskirting. This means that women are not protected in all circumstances. Second, the offence of outraging public decency is inappropriate as it fails to reflect the sexual nature of the offence and/or the fact that the harm is caused to the individual (rather than the public). These positions are not controversial. Leading authorities in the field agree with my client: upskirting is a gap in the law and the only way to solve it is by legislation. What would the new law say? The new law would bring the punishment for upskirting in line with other existing voyeurism offences, and the changes will see offenders face a maximum of two years in prison. It would also allow this intrusive behaviour to be treated as a sexual offence and, with Government amendments, ensure that the most serious offenders are made subject to notification requirements - commonly referred to as the sex offenders register. There will be a threshold, meaning those who commit the more serious offences - especially those designed to cause alarm, distress or humiliation - are dealt with more seriously. Who is backing it?  The Government stated its support for making upskirting a specific criminal offence hours before Lib Dem MP Wera Hobhouse\u0027s Private Members\u0027 Bill. It was the crucial backing campaigners - including upskirting victim Gina Martin, 26, and her legion of famous supporters - were hoping for after months of meetings with the Ministry of Justice to thrash out terms for suitable legislation. High-profile public figures - such as television presenters Holly Willoughby, Dermot O\u0027Leary and Laura Whitmore - have also been open about their support for the campaign. How was it blocked?

It started because of a photoshoot where me and my twin sister were asked to take off our tops and knickers for an adult magazine. “Later, the photographer said we would be good in adult movies, being twins, and that led to escorting. “I’m now working as a barmaid and volunteering for various charities because I love to help people. “It is weird because you’re working seven hours and you think ‘Oh my God, I could have worked one hour for \u0026pound140 instead of many hours work at \u0026pound7.’ “When you serve behind the bar and people say ‘have one for yourself’ you’re only allowed to take 20p off them whereas, when I was an escort they would buy me cars and holidays, not give me 20p tips. “I grew up in Sunderland and we were racially abused in school because my dad is Arabic, but the bullies later booked me as an escort, so I had the last laugh. “My clientele was mainly regulars in Manchester, people in the north west and businessmen stopping over at Manchester Airport.  Kat described how her usual working day often started early in the morning - seeing clients before they went to work. She said: “A typical day would start at 9am but I was never off the clock. People want mornings because they want to release themselves before they go to work. “You just don’t know when you’re going to be busy, but it’s usually dinnertime and after work at about 6pm, as well as Sundays at 3am. “I would put my clientele into two types. Some who wanted companionship, conversation and for me to be like a girlfriend - and others who would pull your hair and spit on you. So I tended not to wear much makeup because you keep having to put more on, and I tied my hair up in a bun. I would spend about an hour getting ready and showered a lot throughout the day. Kat said she experienced one frightening situation during her 14 years as an escort. She said: “I’ve only been in one dangerous situation on the job - when a client spiked my drink and took the money back after I was paid. I thought I was going to die. I couldn’t breathe or anything. I had a driver to get me to jobs and I wouldn’t have got home without him.  “I never caught diseases from clients, but I feel a lot safer in my bar job with CCTV. “I used to see four to five clients a day. You do get idiot clients who come in drunk. “One would see me when his wife had gone shopping. Another spoilt me with an Audi convertible and trips to Milan and Paris. I felt like Julia Roberts. “I never worked from home and always picked a hotel to meet the clients at. I worked at an agency for a bit but I didn’t have any power over whether I wanted to take a job or not. “If I turned down a client, the agency would fine me \u0026pound50, so I started to find my own clients. It meant I would be waiting in hotel bars for my next job and I would drink to gain confidence before seeing a client. “That led to public disorder offences and ending up in hospital to have my stomach pumped. “I found the work lonely as other women doing it would dislike me because men booked me more than them. While Kat does still work over webcam, she\u0027s unsure about returning to full escorting. “I still perform on webcam and stay in touch with regulars, but I’m not sure if I will ever return to escorting.

The Oscar winner starring Tom Hanks has been voted the best feelgood film. The 1994 movie follows Forrest through the decades as he takes part in some of history’s biggest moments. It is the bittersweet love story that captured the hearts, as well as the legendary line: “My mom always said ‘life is like a box of chocolates – you never know what you’re gonna get’.”  Second in the poll was 1985 time travel hit Back to the Future, starring Michael J Fox. Third was 1964 Disney musical Mary Poppins, starring Julie Andrews. Happiness expert Dr Cliff Arnall said: “Life can feel pretty overwhelming for many when work, exams and family pressures fill head space. Taking the time to watch an uplifting film is one of the easiest ways of escaping from all of that. “Giving ourselves permission to switch off our worry buttons and have our imagination buttons pressed is highly therapeutic.” "},{"url":null,"title":"half primary school teachers give","story":"NewsHalf of primary school teachers give out soap to pupils from hard-up householdsAs budgets tighten, families are being forced to prioritise bills and food over hygiene essentials\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsByNada FarhoudMarie Lunn23:02, 18 JUN 2018NewsNearly 20% of parents said their child wears the same underwear for at least two days (Image: Getty)\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailHalf of primary school teachers are giving out soap, washing powder and shampoo weekly to pupils from hard-up households, figures show.

In his first ever interview on Good Morning Britain this morning the retired lighting engineer revealed what the Duke of Sussex told him about Brexit and US President Donald Trump. Thomas Markle Snr was not able to walk his daughter down the aisle due to ill health and is yet to meet any of his daughter\u0027s new family. Mr Markle spoke of the moment the Duke of Sussex asked for permission to marry the then Ms Markle. He told the programme: Harry asked for her hand on the phone and I said: \u0027You are a gentleman, promise me you will never raise your hand against my daughter and of course I will grant you my permission\u0027.  The father of the Duchess of Sussex said he was not fazed by his daughter marrying into the monarchy. Meghan initially said she had a new boyfriend, before dropping hints about who he really was. Thomas said: “At that point she said it’s Harry and I said, ‘Harry... OK’. “She said we’ll have to call him ‘H’ so no one knows. “I eventually spoke to him and he was a very nice man, a gentleman - very likeable.” Thomas Markle told Good Morning Britain he had held phone calls with the Duke of Sussex, adding: He\u0027s great, he\u0027s an interesting guy. When asked how he felt about the former Suits star\u0027s nuptials, he said: My daughter has been a princess since the day she was born. He added: He made a good pick, didn\u0027t he. He also discussed conversations he\u0027s had with Prince Harry - who he is yet to meet face-to-face.  It\u0027s been over the phone, we\u0027ve had some interesting conversations on the phone. He\u0027s a smart guy. He\u0027s an interesting guy. I was complaining I didn\u0027t like Donald Trump. He said give Donald Trump a chance, I sort of disagreed with that. The 73-year-old added: I think he was open to the experiment (of Brexit).  Mr Markle also spoke about the emotional moment he told his daughter he would not be able to walk down the aisle in Windsor Castle\u0027s St George\u0027s Chapel. Mr Markle told the programme: They were disappointed. Meghan cried, I\u0027m sure, and they both said, \u0027Take care of yourself, we are really worried about you\u0027. On Charles walking his daughter down the aisle, he said: I was honoured, I can\u0027t think of a better replacement than someone like Prince Charles. I absolutely wanted to walk my daughter down the aisle, he added. I\u0027m recovering from a heart operation but I\u0027m doing much better, he told GMB.  Speaking of the controversy after allegedly being caught staging photographs with the paparazzi, Mr Markle said: \u0027\u0027I spoke to them both and I apologised. I realised it was a serious mistake. It\u0027s hard to take it back.\u0027\u0027 He said the staged snaps were not for money but to improve his image. I thought it would be a nice way of improving my look, but obviously that all went to hell. I feel bad about it, I apologised for it, it was a mistake.  Mr Markle said he watched the wedding from an apartment where he was recovering after leaving hospital. He said: She was beautiful. It was incredible watching her. I cried a little bit about it. I was very proud. I was very upset that it wasn\u0027t me (walking her down the aisle) but the whole world was watching my daughter. I was very happy about that. The unfortunate thing for me now is I\u0027m a footnote in one of the greatest moments in history rather than the dad walking her down the aisle. That upsets me somewhat. He added: I\u0027ve never seen anything more beautiful than my daughter (on her wedding day), ever.

Shelley Dimet wanted to attend Ed\u0027s concert in Cardiff in memory of her daughter Ashlee, who died suddenly at the age of 22, reports Wales Online .  Ashlee was a huge fan and Shelley said she still wanted to see the show as a tribute to her daughter, who was found dead at home last year. However, she has been left distraught after Ticketmaster asked to see her daughter\u0027s death certificate when she tried to change the name on the tickets.   Fans have been warned they will need to take their tickets and booking confirmation to the Ed Sheeran concerts, plus the card (or photocopy of it) which was used to buy the tickets and valid photo ID matching the name on the booking, reports MoneySavingExpert .  Shelley said the three tickets are in her daughter\u0027s name and were bought using her bank card and email address. Despite pleading with the ticket company to change the tickets allowing her to go, Shelley said she has been left devastated by their response. She said: When I first spoke to Ticketmaster I was absolutely devastated. I was so upset. These were my daughter\u0027s tickets. Her ticket won’t be used and we are going to frame that one.  Other people have offered other tickets, which is very kind. But we want to go with the tickets that she bought. Shelley said she understands the reason for the rules at Ed Sheeran\u0027s concert are to help protect fans from ticket touts, but said sadly that hasn\u0027t been the case for us. She said: The tickets were bought via Ticketmaster who have been absolutely horrendous to deal with during this already extremely upsetting time. Apparently even her death certificate wasn’t enough. They required that I go to a solicitor to prove I have power of attorney before they would help - not even her banks asked me to do that. It has been so upsetting for me and my family. What should’ve been an evening for us to see Ed in our hometown and remember Ash has been tainted by more hurt and upset. I’s actually made us reconsider going.  Coventry University student Ashlee was found dead on September 1 in her bedroom while visiting Cardiff for the summer. Shelley said: She died suddenly. We just found her one Friday morning. She was home from university for the summer and she was preparing to go to Malta. There was a only a few weeks left before she died before she was going. We got up on the Friday morning, and I thought that it was weird that she wasn’t up. When I went in her room she was down the side of the bed. It took us 13 weeks to find out how she died. It was eventually discovered that Ashlee died from Sudden Adult Death Syndrome (SADS).  Shelley said: She worshiped Ed for many reasons. She was laid to rest in her favourite tour T-shirt and all of her wristsbands. His music was played at her funeral and the celebration of her life. She added: Ashlee was an enigma. She had been through a lot. It was her love of music that brought her back out of her shell. She went from this shy, quiet girl to someone who would go all over the country to see gigs. With the artist playing such a large part in her daughter\u0027s life, Shelley said she plans to go to the concert on Saturday with her friend as Ed Sheeran\u0027s music brings her comfort. She said: I’m still in shock. I’m still expecting her to walk through the door and I’m still expecting to hear her call me.

Mary Mellor, 25, has shown her incredible weight loss transformation after dropping from a size 20 to a 12 and is now using her experience to help others shed the pounds as a personal instructor. Exercise helped her beat depression and she is now set to wed her childhood sweetheart Martyn next year in the dress of her dreams. Mary told : I always struggled with my weight. I was a happy-go-lucky child until I lost my dad in 2004 when I started to comfort eat. Depression and anxiety kicked in when I was about 13 which got worse after I turned 17.  I used food to console myself and I started to gain weight. I\u0027d eat anything, particularly savory things like crisps and takeaways - lots of carbohydrates, fat and salt, she said. Mary gained 6 stone from the age of 17 to 23 which fuelled her anxiety and depression, trapping her in a nasty, intractable loop of negative emotion and hopelessness. Depression just creeps up on you and you don\u0027t even notice until you\u0027re at rock bottom. It\u0027s horrible and vile. I stopped wanting to go out or socialise with people. I didn’t want anyone to see me the way I was. I was stuck in my own bubble and I was too scared to go to the shops on my own. I thought everyone was staring at me and judging me because I was an overweight young mum. I was always sad and just wanted to be left alone. I knew there had to be more to life.  Then one day while her new baby Bobby, now 2, was asleep in his moses basket and her other son Tyler, now 5, was out at nursery school, Mary sat down on the couch eating biscuits watching soaps when her breathing became laboured. I felt so uncomfortable. Breathing was hard and I just felt so heavy. I have asthma and excess weight makes that worse. I was using my inhaler more and more and I was struggling to breathe. I knew I had to do something. I had just had my second child and I did not want to be the mum who couldn\u0027t play with them. So just eight weeks after Bobby\u0027s birth she decided to start exercising. I joined a circuit training course in Elite Fitness in Langton. I was really nervous but I asked a friend to come with me so I could not back out.  The first session was horrible. I thought I was going to die. At the end of the class I felt really good but it also made me realise how unfit I was. I had tried exercise before but I always got bored. But with circuit training you keep moving from one thing to another so it stays interesting. And exercise clears your head. It makes you feel you\u0027ve really achieved something for the day. I started to go to classes every Tuesday night and Sunday morning and I saw my weight start to drop off straight away.  Then I did a bootcamp where I went to three to four classes every week for two months. I lost 2st and I made friends for life with people from the class. They taught us about nutrition - advising us to cut out rubbish and fizzy pop and to eat vegetables and protein instead.  Before I ate everything the kids were having like chips and chicken nuggets, mashed potatoes and sausages or sandwiches.  But now I have omelettes for breakfast, for lunch I have a salad or freshly cooked stir-fry and for dinner I have chicken salad or turkey mince and vegetables.  Just changing your diet and exercising makes such a huge difference and I\u0027ve realised that if you pre-prepare your meals when you\u0027re hungry you can have healthy food quickly instead of grabbing an unhealthy snack. Mary, from Stoke-on-Trent, is to wed her childhood sweetheart Martyn next year. He is her brother\u0027s best friend and the pair have known each other since she was 13. I have 13 bridesmaids but I only brought my mum and sister shopping for the dress. I want it to be a surprise. I just bought it two months ago and I couldn\u0027t be happier. It\u0027s the dress of my dreams, only better, she said.  Mary\u0027s life really turned full circle two weeks ago when she was invited to teach the same beginners class she started just 18 months earlier with her first teacher who helped inspire her love of exercise. I was nervous being on the other side at the start but it was really good fun. There were 15 students - most of them were friends who had come to support me and I loved it. Now I\u0027m training for my level three so I can take one-on-one classes. I\u0027m studying nutrition, anatomy and the gym environment in my spare time and life is good. Depression was horrible. I never want to go back there. It was not an easy journey but I feel really good now and I want to use my experience to help other people feel good too, Mary said.  I can\u0027t explain how different life is now. Before I was anxious or depressed 90% of the time but that has dropped to 5% which is pretty healthy. Even clothes shopping is enjoyable now. I don\u0027t feel trapped anymore and I know that the world is my oyster. I still want to lose more weight but I\u0027m not built to be a size zero. I\u0027m 5\u00279 and I\u0027ve dropped from a size 20 to a 12. I\u0027m looking forward to our wedding, to the future and to helping others. I know how hard it is to lose weight and now I want to help other people feel better too.  Mary will take new clients through her Facebook and Instagram pages later this year.

Jennifer Katherine was out enjoying a ride and did not realise she had ridden into the Windsor Triathlon route until bikes began whizzing by her at around 9am yesterday. Her headcam shows the moment a cyclist appears to try to undertake her and allegedly clips the animal with Jennifer still in the saddle. Jennifer can be heard screaming \u0027oh my f***ing God\u0027 in fear as she tries to regain control of her horse. Meanwhile, the cyclist races on and does not stop to see if she or the animal are OK, appearing to turn and give what Jennifer claims to be the \u0027middle finger\u0027 to her.  Race organisers Human Race Events have confirmed they are reviewing the video and are investigating in a bid to track down the cyclist - claiming anyone at fault will be \u0027disqualified\u0027. Jennifer, from Windsor, Berkshire, said: Nobody stopped and the cyclist that hit me seemed to show no remorse by what looks like him lifting his middle finger at me whilst riding off as I screamed. Although one cyclist hit me, I am surprised there wasn\u0027t more. Many individuals on this stretch of road at this time had passed dangerously and irresponsibly - too fast and too close. They also put other road users at risk by putting themselves between my horse and oncoming vehicles. It was terrifying being on a spooked horse and knowing that these individuals weren\u0027t willing to stop. I am lucky to ride such a calm animal but there are other horses that really wouldn\u0027t have tolerated the speed and proximity of those cyclists, risking everyone. I am genuinely concerned. There are many amazing road users that pass safely - and who should always be thanked by horse riders - but there does seem to be a growing lack of awareness of how to pass horses safely on the road and indeed with other vulnerable road users such as cyclists.  I think that is what is more shocking in this instance as I felt victimised by many of the individuals on bicycles on that road at that time and particularly by the one individual that hit my horse and I. The incident left Jennifer in shock and she claimed to have an injury to her ankle while the horse lost one of its back shoes in the incident. Jennifer said she has reported the incident to the police, who she is due to meet with later. She claimed there was no event warning on the road. Jennifer said: I would not have been out on the road in any form had I known there was a sporting event on. I saw no signs alerting the locals that an event would take place on the road I was on and when, hence why I went out like any normal early Sunday morning this time of year. I\u0027m very thankful to the event officials for their prompt investigation into identifying the individual and the sincerity in which they are taking the incident. Human Race Events tweeted: We are currently investigating an incident at the Windsor Triathlon involving a group of cyclists and a horse rider. We are taking this very seriously. Riders will be identified and disqualified from all Human Race Events. All riders are briefed to follow the Highway Code. We do not condone dangerous cycling of any kind.

Dad-of-one Noel White, 28, was described as a beautiful man with the heart of gold by his heartbroken family and friends. He collapsed outside his home in Withington on Sunday but police believe he may have been attacked beforehand, reports the Manchester Evening News. Officers are investigating the possibility that Mr White was attacked at a car park just in the early hours on Saturday.  A 37-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of murder. He remains in custody for questioning. Paramedics fought to save Mr White, who collapsed outside his home in Heysham Avenue. He later died in hospital. On Sunday evening, a police officer stood guard as forensics teams trawled the house. Floral tributes and heartwarming letters to Mr White were left at the scene.  He was described by neighbours as a ‘nice lad’ who was well-liked. It is understood he was a talented singer and rapper, who had recorded a number of songs with other musicians. Further tributes to Mr White, who had the stage name ‘Whites’, were shared on Facebook. Close friend Anthony Wells said: “Noel had a heart of gold. He was a really good lad, he will be sorely missed.” Family friends Nikita, Jamielee and Mark Taylor shared a video of Mr White rapping on Facebook. “Noel was a beautiful young man inside and out,” they told the M.E.N.  “This has left a lot of people truly heartbroken. “He went out of his way for everybody and constantly had us laughing and smiling. He will be dearly missed.” Officers have appealed to anyone with information to come forward. Det Insp Wes Knights, from GMP’s Major Incident Team, said Mr White’s loved ones were ‘understandably beside themselves’. “We have now arrested a man on suspicion of the murder of Noel,” he added. “Our enquiries are continuing and we are still doing all that we can to establish the exact circumstances of his death. “There are still many unanswered questions in this investigation and we won’t stop until we answer all of them. Our thoughts are very much with Noel’s family at this difficult time. “I would urge anyone who may have seen Noel earlier that day, or may know his whereabouts in the lead-up to his death to get in touch with police as soon as possible.

You might have heard a few of the words on TV during the Olympics or Tour de France - but otherwise they\u0027re just used by those in the know. We\u0027ve teamed up with Halfords to lift the lid on some of the stranger examples you\u0027ve probably never heard of. To celebrate Bike Week, we\u0027ve also pulled together some of the best discounted bikes currently available at Halfords for men, women and kids. Cyclist lingo            Feed zone  This is where riders can grab their food and drink on the go in an event.  Bidon  French for \u0027water bottle\u0027 - the riders wouldn\u0027t get very far without these!  Domestique  Literally translated as \u0027servant\u0027, these are the team cyclists - and occasionally unsung heroes of big races - who do everything they can to try and keep their team leader in the race, including fetching food, water, and clothing. They even sacrifice their bike if their leader needs a replacement!  Peloton  French for \u0027group\u0027, the peloton is a pack of cyclists who ride together in close formation. This gives them added protection if they ride directly behind other cyclists, sheltering them from wind resistance.  Bonking  Another way of saying hitting the wall, bonking is when a cyclist completely runs out of energy, leading to feelings of nausea, dizziness and confusion. To minimise the chances of bonking, riders require proper hydration and nutrition during each stage of the ride.  Musette  These are cotton bags which are handed out to riders during the feed zones in races. They contain food, energy bars, and drinks to maintain energy levels and keep the bonk at bay.   Directeur sportif  Similar to a team manager, the directeur sportif is usually a former pro cyclist who manages a team and rides in the team car. They decide team tactics and strategies throughout races.  Autobus  You don\u0027t really want to be in the \u0027autobus\u0027 - aka the \u0027grupetto\u0027 - because it\u0027s the word used to describe cyclists who are struggling going up hill. It mainly applies to those flagging at the back during the climb sections of big races, so you probably won\u0027t hear it much working your way up your local hill.  Lanterne rouge  Meaning \u0027red lantern\u0027 in French, the lanterne rouge is the last cyclist to cross the finish line during the Tour de France, which takes place in a few weeks time.

After many parts of the country were battered by Storm Hector, summer is set to return as clouds clear and the mercury rises throughout the week. If temperatures do nudge 33C, the summer of 2018 could go down on record as being the hottest for 42 years, since the heatwave of 1976 led to droughts across the UK.  The sunny forecast comes as World Cup fever grips the country, along with the start of Royal Ascot this week, along with the Isle of Wight Festival and Wimbledon in July.  Met Office forecaster Mark Wilson said: “Early signs are promising for later in June and July, with mainly dry and settled weather, particularly in the South, with likely very warm or hot conditions.  “The North will have bright days and plenty of drier and warmer interludes, although will be more changeable and with some cloud and rain.” Ex-BBC and Met Office forecaster John Hammond of weathertrending said: “Tropical air may send temperatures into the high-20s across southeastern parts. “And it’s probably only a matter of time before 32C heat reaches our shores. “There are encouraging signs for events including Royal Ascot and the Isle of Wight Festival.”   Leon Brown of The Weather Channel has said: “33C is expected.” Bookmakers Coral slashed odds on summer being the hottest on record to 1/2 odds-on and Ladbrokes cut odds on June being the hottest on record to 6/4. Coral’s John Hill said “The betting clearly suggests summer is going to be a scorcher and the hottest we’ve ever had.

Sophie Turner, 19, put the names of the victims on social media and accused them of lying about the assaults in order to gain compensation. Ms Turner is the first person to be convicted in Merseyside of naming such victims, reports the Liverpool Echo.  The judge said that she had taken away the protection given to them by the law and sentenced her to 18 weeks. Her trial at Liverpool Magistrates\u0027 Court followed the jailing of two drug dealers who had plied two young girls with alcohol and cocaine before engaging in sexual activity with them.  They also filmed the attack and encouraged the girls, aged 14 and 16, to engage in sexual activity with each other. One of the men was Turner’s brother Jamie, 26, and both he and his co-accused Myles Bell, 23, were jailed for 12 years last July. The magistrates court heard that around the time of their trial Sophie Turner of Davidson Road, Liverpool, posted messages on the Liverpool Echo website that were “likely to lead members of the public to identify” both victims. These messages were then posted to Facebook “using menacing and derogatory terms towards” them, describing the victims as “dirty little dogs who lie for compo” and “wrong \u0027uns”. The breach was reported to the police by both victims in the case and Turner was interviewed - but the court heard that despite that she continued her behaviour.  Turner denied she was responsible for the messages and claimed that anyone could have access to her devices and post the comments to her account. But District Judge Wendy Lloyd found Turner guilty of two offences of harassment without violence and two of publishing the names of the victims of a sexual offence. Sentencing Turner to 18 weeks detention the judge said that she had tried to “brazen” her way out of it in the trial despite overwhelming evidence. She had caused the victims, who had to give evidence twice at the mens’ trial, further suffering by her actions and “exposed their personal details in a public forum. She said: “They have been utterly exposed. You could not accept the wickedness of your brother and no doubt encouraged by your family and friends you made various posts.” District Judge Lloyd said that she had based them on “ill informed gossip….You were relentless, even on your return from the police station you posted in a similar vein again…..There was something of a campaign as you consistently responded.”  She described it as an unusual case of harassment and worse than normal cases, sayinng: “You took away from these two women the protection that the law had given to them and they were left open to be put forward to the court of public opinion. “They were already traumatised and you traumatised them further.” She imposed a life long restraining order not to contact the two victims. The court heard that the 1992 law relating to publishing identifying details of sex victims had not kept pace with new technology and the maximum penalty is a fine. She added: “It was designed for newspapers but is now superseded by the fact we publish from laptops and mobile phones. Pascal Jones, prosecuting, pointed out that the law was there to encourage people to come forward through anonymity and such offences “erode faith in the criminal justice system.” Permission to bring the unusual charges had to be obtained from the Attorney General. She added: “Not only was their right to anonymity ignored but their sexual history was on full display to see on Facebook.” In impact statements the victims told of their embarrassment and one said she felt “humiliated and violated” and after the original posts had been removed Turner posted more.

CCTV showed two boxes reportedly containing fragile porcelain and china items being carelessly tossed out of the van and bouncing down the stairs. But when the courier is caught out by the furious buyer Patrick Duffy, he starts carefully piling the packages at the top of the steps before carrying them down. The driver\u0027s employer Yodel says it has apologised to Patrick, 68, and has taken \u0027appropriate action\u0027 following the incident. Patrick, from Bradford in West Yorkshire, said: I\u0027d spent about \u0026pound450 on antiques from eBay. It was absolutely disgusting. I watched as he took the boxes out of the back and threw them down the flight of 12 stairs without any care.  They were china and porcelain ornaments and they are very fragile. I\u0027m a live-in caretaker for a block of flats and was working on a garden nearby when I saw the van pull up and the man start throwing the packages. I shouted at him and ran over to check the boxes at the bottom of the steps. I was worried that the antiques I\u0027d bought were going to be all smashed. I got the impression he knew straight away what he\u0027d done when I shouted him to stop. The only reason he stopped throwing them was because he saw me. He just said \u0027open them and if there\u0027s any damage I\u0027ll take them back.\u0027 I refused to let him take anything back and instead contacted Yodel myself. Patrick had been working in a nearby garden on the afternoon of June 12 when he saw the delivery van pull up. He was horrified when he saw his packages being thrown down the stairs and ran to check on them.  The caretaker had decided to rent a cabinet of his friend\u0027s antique store in Bingley, West Yorks, and feared his items could have been destroyed in seconds. One of the items, an antique coal shuttle that he had paid \u0026pound15 for and planned to refurbish, was shattered across the top. Patrick now fears some of the more expensive, irreplaceable items he orders could be damaged in the future. Patrick said: A friend of mine has opened an antique shop and I\u0027d decided to rent a cabinet from him to make some money. One thing was damaged but fortunately it wasn\u0027t one of the more expensive items I\u0027d bought, it could have been worse.

Bizarre footage shows the reckless man ruffling the big cat\u0027s mane as his grinning pal takes photos on his mobile phone in Tanzania\u0027s Serengetti National Park. The huge beast initially just turns to glare at the pair but he quickly changes mood and lets out a terrifying growl baring his giant fangs. One of the passengers in the vehicle can be heard yelping close the window as another rushes to slide the glass shut. The lion is seen glaring in through the window as the pair then cower away.  The footage was shared on Wildlife Sighting\u0027s YouTube page, titled: \u0027Dumbest Tourists Ever,\u0027 where scores of people slated the men for their actions. It is believed the lion - who was seen earlier in the video with a pride of female lions - was so close to to the 4x4 as it was seeking shade. Under the video it says: Lions in the open plains of the Mara and Serengeti occasionally use a vehicles shade as cover when there are no trees in sight, this doesn’t mean that they trust humans but only the vehicles. To try to touch is incredibly stupid and ignorant of the tourist that filmed the sighting.  South African safari ranger Naas Smit told The Sun : ”Only those who work in the wild know the speed of a lion and it could have torn the arm off the person touching it. “It would have the power to pull that tourist straight out of that window and kill them instantly in front of their friends. It was an incredibly stupid thing to do. “It could also just have easily crashed its way through the open window and torn into those inside. They were lucky to get away with it. They are wild animals. “If the lion had killed this person then game rangers would probably have had to have killed it and if it was the pride male it could have serious consequences.  “I just have to shake my head when I see people behaving like this and they deserve all they get” he said. The near-miss comes just a month after a a family was forced to flee a chasing pack of CHEETAHS when they left their car at a safari park. Dramatic video captured from the vehicle behind the family, believed to be from France, showed the big cats dashing towards the family at Beekse Bergen in the Netherlands. Seconds before the near horrifying encounter, a woman and whom appears to be a teenage boy were filmed leaving their black-coloured car to photograph cheetahs lying down in the park.

tourists set to flock to city","story":"\t\t\t\t\tOpen-top bus tours are set to return to Dundee as tourism chiefs say they are “bang on target” with their vision for the city ahead of the opening of the V\u0026ampA.City development convener Lynne Short has revealed discussions are ongoing with three “major companies” to bring tour buses back.Ms Short said: “We’re already there (as a tourist destination). Tour companies are bringing people in, they’re spending time here, exploring the area, and that’s only getting better.“People visiting Scotland used to stay in Edinburgh then go for a bit of golf in St Andrews or Carnoustie and then head back to the capital. Now they can stay here.“There are discussions ongoing with three major companies with regards to bus tours.”It’s one of several initiatives being developed to further shape Dundee’s new identity as a cultural tourism destination, following widespread recognition in the media., Wall Street Journal, Bloomberg and Lonely Planet have all included it in lists of must-visit cities across the world.Several cruise ships have docked in Dundee this year, bringing with them a haul of foreign tourists keen to get their selfie with Desperate Dan in City Square.However, city promotion boss Jennifer Caswell has told the Tele her focus is now on making Dundee a city break hotspot, rather than just a day-tripper destination.To that end, she and other city bosses revisited the city’s tourism strategy in May for the years ahead, to ensure they’re well-prepared for the influx of people keen to see the city during The Open next month and, from September, when the V\u0026ampA Dundee finally opens its doors.She said: “We want Dundee to be the best version of itself that it can be.“Following last month’s meeting we’re where we want to be. We’re bang on target. The V\u0026ampA Dundee is fantastic – but it’s just the beginning.”Among the ideas being considered is Dundee having ‘world hosts’ – ambassadors for the city, for which Ms Short has undergone training – and ‘Dundee concierges’, local workers who can give visitors the inside track on the best attractions to see, as well as great places to eat.Along with making Dundee more attractive to foreign tourists, Ms Caswell said she wanted people from elsewhere in the UK to come to Dundee – just as we flock to cities like Newcastle and Liverpool.She said: “We’re hearing more and more all the time when we speak to people from elsewhere that they want to come and see what Dundee is all about now – they want to know more.“We just have to make sure we can provide for them.”Investment is key to the city’s growth, including its ever-expanding directory of hotels. Sleeperz opens next month at the new train station, with Hotel Indigo shortly to follow.Projects such as those, and others all over the city, form the “spokes” around the “hub” of the V\u0026ampA, which has served as a driver to bring cash in.Ms Caswell added: “We have seen an ever-increasing number of new ventures develop in the city to service the increase in current visitors to this area.“The expected rise due to the V\u0026ampA Dundee means this is likely to increase in pace over the next few months. Being seen as a top destination in Europe to visit helps establish our reputation across the board.“We are now on the world map as a city destination, be that for visiting, working or investing.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"ex dundee defender jon aurtenetxe linked with move to leeds united","story":"\t\t\t\t\tFormer Dundee full-back Jon Aurtenetxe has been linked with a surprise move to Championship side Leeds United.The troubled English giants recently appointed former Chile and Argentina coach Marcelo Bielsa as their new manager.The 26-year-old left-back enjoyed the best spell of his career under the enigmatic Argentine, known as ‘the Madman’, at Athletic Bilbao, reaching the final of the Europa League in 2012.Aurtenetxe left Dundee after a season at Dens Park.

with a clamp on its front wheel after being inspected by officials from the DVLA.But the owner of the car, who is unknown, appears to have little interest in having the clamp removed.Graffiti reading “f****** keep it”, apparently addressed to the DVLA, was scrawled across the bodywork.The car was abandoned in the car park outside Adamson Court in Lochee, and had people in stitches as they responded to a photo of the car being shared online.One wrote: “People make Lochee,” while another noted: “One of the reasons I miss Lochee.”The DVLA confirmed it had carried out enforcement action, attaching clamps to more than 80 untaxed vehicles.A spokesman for the agency said: “As part of its day-to-day enforcement, DVLA’s national wheel-clamping partner, NSL, clamps or impounds any untaxed vehicles seen on the road.“We can confirm that more than 80 untaxed vehicles were clamped in the Dundee postcode area between June 4 and 12.“It is right that we take action against those who don’t tax their vehicles and then drive them, otherwise it wouldn’t be fair to those who do the right thing.“Clamping is one of a range of measures we use to make sure these untaxed vehicles are not driven on the road.”Untaxed vehicles can pose a risk to law-abiding road users, according to the agency, as those driving without road tax may not have a valid MOT certificate, invalidating any insurance policy.If a car owner wishes to keep their car off the road for an extended amount of time, they must request a statutory off-road notice from the DVLA to avoid receiving a fine.Failing to tax a vehicle is subject to a fixed £80 fine, while removing a clamp costs £100.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/04/5ad70ec41a58a-270x180.jpg

retail.A sector-based work academy, which gives job hunters practical training in the field, will be run by the Dundee City Jobscentre in conjunction with Marks \u0026amp Spencer.It comes after the latest employment statistics for the city were released by the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP).In Dundee, the jobs market has remained largely unchanged, with 15 fewer people claiming benefits at the end of May compared with April.In total there were 4,130 people claiming out-of-work benefits in Dundee last month, down from 4,145.Jane McEwen, who is work services manager at Dundee City Jobcentre, said that she was hopeful private and public-sector developments in the city will bring further jobs in the next few months.She said: “This month, we are running the sector-based work academy called Get Into Retail, in conjunction with Marks \u0026amp Spencer.“It is for people aged 16 to 25 and it gives them practical experience in different aspects of retail, including things like training for good customer service, stock replenishment and operating checkouts or other equipment.“Because the scheme is such good quality, we are confident that a high number of applicants will go on to gain employment with M\u0026ampS across its three Dundee sites after the course.”To cater for golfing fans making their way to Carnoustie next month for The Open, bar and catering staff are being recruited for the event through Dundee City Jobcentre.Jane said: “With The Open, hundreds of jobs will come up.“We will be helping to recruit for that nearer the event.“Another big development at the moment is the construction of the Indigo Hotel, next to the Wellgate, which will have 120 bedrooms.“We are hopeful that there will be some associated jobs from that which will be on offer.”It is also understood there will be job offers going out this month for staff at the new Scottish social security agency in Dundee.A further recruitment drive for the agency is expected around the end of September into early October – with the jobs highly sought after.There were more than 500 applications for 80 roles when they were advertised in April, according to Social Security Minister Jeane Freeman.The new agency will manage 11 benefits which Holyrood is to take control of, said to be worth around £3.3 billion a year.The first devolved benefits are due to be distributed in Scotland in the summer, while the full transfer from Westminster will be by 2021, including personal independence payments and carer’s

the new season.Csaba Laszlo’s new-look team will have to gel quickly if they are to get their promotion push off and running early with a testing opening to the 2018/19 campaign, which starts on August 4.The Tangerines’ first away trip is a long one to Dumfries on Queen of the South’s plastic pitch before they welcome title challengers Partick to Tannadice on August 25.Former manager Ray McKinnon’s first clash with United comes on September 15 as his new side Morton head to his former stomping ground while the last game of the season for both will be at Cappielow.That concludes a difficult end to the campaign with trips to the Highlands to face both Ross County and Inverness CT in the last month of the Championship season.United were the favourites last season to top the table but fell well short of champions St Mirren.This time around, it promises to be even more difficult with two teams coming down from the Premiership.Starting with those two, let’s have a look at the Tangerines’ main challengers this coming season.Partick ThistleThe Jags became only the second top-tier side to lose out in the play-offs and are among the favourites to go straight back up.Alan Archibald has stayed on at Firhill and is rebuilding his side for the Championship.How strong they are remains to be seen but the experienced duo of Chris Erskine and Kris Doolan will be big factors in any success they have.Ross CountyAlso coming down, the Staggies aren’t hanging about putting together a team that can win the division.Co-managers Stuart Kettlewell and Steven Ferguson are determined to make their first chance in management a success.County will be a tough nut to crack for most teams in the Championship.Inverness CTCaley Thistle were expected to be Dundee United’s main challengers last season but got off to an awful start.Boss John Robertson turned things around and a late surge almost saw them into the play-offs.Expect that good form to continue in the new campaign.DunfermlineAllan Johnston’s 2017/18 team has been ripped apart with players leaving left, right and centre.With a lot of work to be done in the transfer market at the moment, another finish in the play-offs looks unlikely but Johnston has a history of getting his sides into the top four.FalkirkFormer Dundee manager Paul Hartley is slowly making the Bairns side his own after big changes in the winter and more to come this summer.Way off the pace last season, another mediocre campaign won’t be acceptable for the Falkirk faithful.MortonFormer United boss Ray McKinnon is just in the door at Cappielow and is busy bringing in players.His aim is the play-offs – Jim Duffy was sacked for not making them – so pressure is on.Queen of the SouthThe Doonhamers haven’t done much business this summer, the arrival of Gary Harkins apart, and will have to tighten up their defence if they are to cause any trouble at the top end of the division in the new campaign.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2017/08/599ec5e750c39-561x564.jpg ","title":"the tele guide to the world cup group cs local

Inverness","story":"\u0026nbspONCE-in-a-lifetime plans to transform eyesore buildings in the heart of Inverness into a major attraction will take several years to come to fruition, with discussions yet to take place ahead of any big decisions.Highland Council\u0027 announcement\u0026nbsplast week that it is to buy the notorious 1960s Upper Bridge Street buildings as part of a bigger redevelopment of Inverness Castle has been broadly welcomed.Already there have been suggestions for the site ranging from demolishing the entire block to creating a green space.But any action to redevelop the concrete carbuncles will not happen immediately as possible options have yet to be drawn up ahead of a public consultation, while tenants in some units still have several years left on the leases.They include the Scottish Children\u0027 Reporter Admin-istration (SCRA) which has stated its intentions to remain in its unit until the end of the lease in October 2025 while the Shapla Indian Restaurant is among the businesses yet to be contacted by the council on how the takeover and potential plans might impact on its future.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspRestaurant owner Shabaro Ali said this week\u0027 announcement had come as a surprise, although he welcomed the news.\"Obviously, if Highland Council is going to redevelop the site, it is good for the city, it is good for us, it is good for everyone,\" he said.With about another 10 years remaining on the lease, Mr Ali wants the restaurant to remain in its prime riverside location where it has been for the last 22 years.\"I am sure Highland Council will try to keep everyone happy,\" he said.Orkney businesswoman Judith Glue opened her shop in Bridge Street 10 years ago and although she has yet to be directly approached by her new landlord, she was not unduly worried about the change in ownership,\"I hope it will be positive for businesses to be a part of a brand new project which would be good for Inverness,\" she said. \"Until they get in touch and tell us about the plans, there is not a lot I can say.\"The SCRA, meanwhile, occupies the main concrete block nearest the river which many would like to see removed.When contacted by the Inverness Courier last week ahead of the official announcement, a spokeswoman said there were no plans to move out.\"This is where our staff are based and where we hold children\u0027 hearings,\" she said.Following discussions with the council, that position remained unchanged this week.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspScotland\u0027 rural economy secretary Fergus Ewing \u0026ndash also the Inverness and Nairn MSP and co-chairman of the steering group overseeing the castle redevelopment \u0026ndash warned the project would take time.\"I don\u0026rsquot wish expectations to be raised in that things will happen in the next year or so,\" he said. \"I think that most things worth achieving in life do take several years. That will be the case here and it\u0027 important that there\u0027 a sense of ownership of citizens in the city.\"He said the aim of the group, which had met 14 times over the last three-and-a-half years, was to create an international-class attraction which drew people to Inverness rather than being something people simply saw when in the Highland capital.LDN Architects will look at the Bridge Street site to help create a masterplan by autumn prior to public consultation. A Highland Council spokeswoman said the local authority would become the landlord of any occupants or tenants.\"There will be no changes to the buildings until consultation has taken place, apart from any minor repairs which a landlord would be responsible for,\" she said.Tuesday 19 Jun 2018 1:35 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.inverness-courier.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04116000/04116168.jpg","title":"Could this be Nessie lurking in the deep","story":"\u0026nbspAn Inverness man on a dreich day beside Loch Ness popped off a couple of shots on his camera before swiftly retreating to the shelter of his parents\u0026rsquo car.It was only later back home in Milton of Leys when he was reviewing his photographs that Toby Christian began to wonder \"Have I captured the Loch Ness Monster?\"Two frames seemed to show a dark shape in the water, perhaps indicating something lurking just below the surface.The second shot in particular which is reproduced on this page with Toby\u0027 permission shows a dark patch on the water in the foreground which looks particularly mysterious.Toby (47), a keen amateur photographer, said: \"I was out in the car for the day with my parents Robert and Mary and we stopped just off the A82.

GREATER sense of empowerment for residents of one of the Highlands\u0026rsquo most deprived communities is being promised as part of a new plan for the area.The South Kessock and Merkinch locality plan, launched this week, details measures to boost quality of life there.Drawn up by the Inverness Community Partnership (ICP) \u0026ndash a body bringing together representatives of a range of bodies including Highland Council, police and NHS Highland \u0026ndash it includes proposals to improve support for school leavers and provision for unemployed people looking to move into work, as well as plans for a new family science event and a community clean-up.As part of moves to develop \"stronger connections for local voices\", as well as improving participation by young people and schools in community planning, there are also proposals for a new focus group drawn from local residents to support the ICP\u0027 work.This is off the back of evidence that residents have \"little confidence that their voices are heard\".Marked by lower than average incomes and a lack of qualifications in young people leaving school, in 2016 the average life expectancy in Merkinch was just 66 years \u0026ndash compared to 82 in the affluent Crown area, barely a mile away.The report stated: \"Community partners recognise that, in order for health and wellbeing interventions to be effective, they need to be delivered in the local community in partnership with existing community projects and activities.\"We recognise that our best chance of achieving success is to put people and communities at the centre of our planning and delivery processes.\"We will work with the people to tackle what matters most to them and will make a positive difference to their lives and to the community.\"Notwithstanding this, it also means that we recognise that communities can and do achieve great things for themselves.\"We need to harness such achievements and increase the level of influence and sense of control that people have over decisions and services across the locality.\"The plan also raises the possibility of support for residents to take direct control of a range of community assets.Council city centre manager David Haas said: \"We have talked to all the local communities to find out what people want to see improved and help the great work that\u0027 already being done in these areas by existing groups.\"We want to give them the encouragement to do more.\"It\u0027 down to us to listen to what people want and give them a helping hand to create the community they want.\"Dell McClurg, chairwoman of Merkinch Community Council, said it was ironic that it was apparently not told of the launch event \"until it had already started\" but agreed: \"There needs to be more help for the people who are already working at the coal-face in the area.\"She said: \"It\u0027 important that the people who live and work here are listened to.\"We live here and we know what works in this area.\"We just need the right level of support.\"Highland councillor Bet McAllister (Inverness Central) said: \"Things are really moving forward in the area and people

Unfortunately, it is very small and it gets very over-crowded.\"The children and teachers deserve a place to meet modern-day learning needs while the outdoor facilities will benefit the whole community.\"I think everyone will be delighted.\"Dell McClurg, chairman of Merkinch Community Council, also welcomed the news but had reservations over the loss of some open space which will be replaced with all-weather pitches.\"We need a new school but I think there should be an ad hoc area for children to go and play and kick a football about for half-an-hour,\" she said.\"They don\u0027t always want organised football matches.\"David Paulin, Active Merkinch manager, said informal green spaces would still exist while more sporting activities could be available.\"This creates separate play areas from casual use areas which can end up covered in dog mess and covered in rubbish,\" he said.Tuesday 19 Jun 2018 1:35

options for developing the site.It also notes it is important for the development plan to fit within the common good fund\u0027 financial boundaries\u0026nbsp and the plans of potential

food outlets ordered to clean up by inspectors1","story":"\t\t\t\t\tBeetles and woodlice were discovered at an Aberdeen takeaway – one of six eateries urged to improve by inspectors.Aberdeen City Council sends food hygiene monitors to firms and groups that serve meals and snacks to assess cleanliness and food safety.Inspectors can award either a “pass” or a “requires improvement” rating.The Evening Express used Freedom of Information laws to ask the council for reports for outlets inspected since March where inspectors judged that improvement was required.One was De Ja Vu and Shakes N Screams, on Rose Street, which was inspected on March 5.The shops – part of one company – were warned they had a “pest problem”.The report said: “A significant number of dermestes beetles and woodlice were found in the back kitchen.“I am told that such are seen on a regular basis and for some time.“Dermestes beetles eat food debris, while woodlice eat rotting food and wood.“Considering the poor state of repair and cleaning within this room, it is not surprising [the premises] have a pest problem.“[The premises] are required to put in place procedures to control these pests.“I strongly suggest you employ a pest controller and carry out the cleaning and repair as stated above.“If you do not do so, this problem could develop into an infestation, at which point I will consider taking further action, which may include closure of your business.”Inspectors said 13 items were found damaged or in a poor state of repair and 10 areas were found dirty.The shop’s owner, Roy Duncan, said: “Immediately after the inspection, we called in a pest controller and that problem has now gone.“All the other problems have been addressed.“I have been running food businesses for 17 years and my standards have always been high.”Inspectors also visited Italian eatery Mi Amore, on Huntly Street, on March 7 and said a “deep clean” was needed, with mould and rusty equipment found.The report said: “A deep clean of the premises should be carried out covering all floor areas, walls, pieces of equipment and the ventilation canopy.“The dry goods store should not be used for the storage of food until the black mold is removed and the cupboard thoroughly cleaned and painted.“The microwave should not be used as it is badly rusted.”A Mi Amore spokesman said the issues had now been dealt with.“There were three concerns raised during this inspection and we dealt with each of them straight away,” he said.“We cleaned the area the inspector had identified, we replaced the microwave and we cleaned the dry goods store.“The council inspector returned shortly afterwards and found no concerns, except for some minor problems related to a fridge, which we discussed.“We employ 14 staff and take food hygiene standards very seriously.“It is good the council does these inspections to raise concerns and we are always willing to put right what they find.“However, this is the first time we have had an inspection that has identified any issues.”Another venue visited by inspectors was the Fittie Bar, on Wellington Street, on March 13.The report said: “In the fridge there was a tub of skirlie, which was undated and I was told was made four days ago.“There was also an opened container of cheese slices, with the opening date being unknown.“Both items were voluntarily disposed of at the time of the inspection.“There were also two unlabelled tubs of food within the upright freezer and pies stored here were also unlabelled with best-before dates.”It added: “The sealant behind the sink to the right of the dishwasher is deteriorating, therefore making it difficult to keep clean. This should be repaired or replaced with a material which can be kept clean. The floor of the microwave was dirty.”A spokeswoman for Fittie Bar said: “Although I find the inspections rewarding and that it helps maintains the standard required, I do feel sometimes as a small premises some logic needs to be applied.“The building has been in existence since 1821 and every effort is made to keep the kitchen area modern and clean.“Even more of an effort is made to ensure the storage of food and its preparation is maintained with the highest importance.”Rishis Indian Aroma restaurant and takeaway, on George Street, was inspected on April 25.“During the visit, hand contact surfaces such as equipment handles (fridges, freezer, microwave), door handles, light switches, yellow gas hob control knobs, the microwave door handle and control panel, the sink and its surrounding surfaces and taps, and the paper dispenser were dirty,” said the report.A spokesman for the restaurant said: “We rectified all the issues raised right after the inspection and before a second inspection, which found no problems.”Monitors also looked at Chopstix, at the Trinity Centre, on March 1.Their report said: “Members of staff in the ground-floor servery area were witnessed to be not changing the disposable gloves as often as required, or not washing their hands.“The floor of the walk-in chill had spillages of mixed vegetables and other food spillages and requires to be cleaned.”The Evening Express contacted Chopstix. The company did not comment.Inspectors visited the four-star DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel on February 8, on Beach Boulevard, and noticed staff were putting best-before stickers on food items – then putting new ones over the top to extend their shelf life. Coconut cheesecake also had mold on it.A DoubleTree by Hilton spokesman said: “We expect to uphold the highest of standards when it comes to food preparation at our hotel.“We have been working closely to fully address the matters raised in the report.“As a result, we have adjusted our processes and conducted training sessions for our team members. The inspectors revisited us in March and have indicated they are satisfied with the measures we have taken.”When inspectors returned on March 27 they noticed a “significant improvement” but still required improvement, as potato was seen to be out of date.Inspectors also visited Aitkens Bakery, on Menzies Road, Torry, on March 5 and said in their report: “You must start recording the temperatures of food and of equipment critical to food safety.“Skirting boards, wall-to-floor junctions and a pipe running above the skirting boards are in need of a deep clean as they have a build-up of dirt.”The shop has since closed due to matters unconnected with the inspection.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"summer charity ball returns to north east","story":"\t\t\t\t\tA summer charity event will return to the north-east.The Summer Marquee Ball will be back for its 21st year, being held at Raemoir House near Banchory on Saturday.The ball has raised £330,000 for local causes since it began, including almost £70,000 for the Banchory Sports Village which is expected to open early next year.This year’s proceeds will go to cancer charity CLAN Cancer Support.Funds will be raised through the annual auction and raffle.This year, first prize is a week-long trip to Portugal, with second place a stay at the Marcliffe Hotel and Spa, and third a £250 voucher for Deeside Photographics.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"caledonian clean sweep as stuart secures the links title at first time of asking","story":"\t\t\t\t\tStuart Whyte admitted he was unaware of the prestigious recognition associated with the Aberdeen Links Championship \u0026#8230 until he was on the brink of being crowned champion at his first attempt.Caledonian member Stuart, 41, defeated Steve Jamieson, of Nigg Bay, by 2\u0026amp1 in the final at the Kings Links after only joining the Links club at the end of March.Stuart, who is originally from Inverallochy said: “It was only after my father Robert told me how highly the Aberdeen Links tournament is regarded that I realised how important it is.“The final was a great match of really high quality and carded five birdies ahead of the match finishing on the 17th.”Stuart, who spent the last five years in Spain, Dubai and Oman working in the oil industry, took a stranglehold on the match from the turn after he won four holes in a row.However, Steve battled back to win the 14th and 16th but Stuart’s strong burst at the midway point of the match saw him run out the 2\u0026amp1 winner.The trophy cabinet at the Caledonian will house all four Aberdeen Links trophies after Stewart Finnie won the seniors title for a third successive year, Dave Forbes lifted the Handicap Shield and Stuart Wemyss secured the Murray Cup.RESULTS:ABERDEEN LINKS CHAMPIONSHIP – Stuart Whyte (Caledonian) bt Steve Jamieson (Nigg Bay) 2 and 1.HANDICAP SHIELD – Dave Forbes (Caledonian) (7) bt Stuart Slessor (Northern) (4) 6 and 5.MURRAY CUP – Stuart Wemyss (Caledonian) (20) bt Michael Boyd (Bon Accord) (14) at 20th.SENIOR CHAMPIONSHIP139 Stewart Finnie (Caledonian) 71 68 (winner by three strokes). 142 Graham V Somers 72 70. 143 Steve Forsyth 70 73.144 George H Paterson 70 74. 146 David Mullen 71 75. 148 Ron Watson 73 75. 149 Graham McBeath 75 74. 151 Scott Spiers 79 72. 152 Roy Pirie 74 78. 153 George Reid 76 77, R A Fraser 75 78.158 James Muir 82 76. 159 Benny Lumsden 80 79. 160 Walter Rae 89 72. 161 Dave Fowler 81 80, Jim Skinner 80 81, Norman Stewart 78 83. 162 Thomas Bremer 82 80.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"readers think matters us give us piece mind","story":"\t\t\t\t\tMaking assumptions about what our readers want is a risky way to make business decisions.

Therefore, we support separating pedestrians, cyclists and motorists through an expansion of the network of walking and cycling paths across Scotland.We would like to stress, however, that measures like these will not single-handedly lead to safer roads. The road mentality in Scotland still favours the motorist over more vulnerable road users, which presents a huge barrier to more people taking up active lifestyles.More needs to be done to change our road culture for people in Scotland to feel safer regardless of their means of transportation, ultimately empowering them to lead healthier and more active lifestyles.Perhaps it is time we started to beat the ‘presumed liability’ drum once again?Brenda Mitchell, Road Traffic Accident Law (Scotland) LLP, Edinburgh.Sir,Some people have difficulty getting up and down the steps on the Glasgow bus. We asked West Coast Motors about this and they gave us the answer we wanted.All Citylink buses are fitted with an access ramp, worked by the driver. A platform comes out on to the pavement, with a holding bar, and is then raised up to floor level. This is designed as a wheelchair lift, where two seats at the front have to be arranged to be taken out, to give plenty of room.It was agreed, however, that if someone felt nervous about climbing up or down the stairs, they could also use the access platform. Once they have paid their ticket, they can walk to a seat.West Coast Motors asks anyone wanting this service to please remember two things.Firstly, book your single or return tickets by phone or on the Citylink website.Then, 48 hours before your journey, phone Citylink and tell them the times and details of the booking you have made and let them know you will be using the access ramp.

We are proud to have distributed more than £9 million since 2010 to more than 250 projects led by these grassroots organisations.It is crucial we help rural areas during these times of change to retain a thriving countryside and encourage a sustainable farming sector in the UK and would encourage people to apply for our funding.Claire Saunders, director, The Prince’s Countryside Fund.Sir,At first sight, it seems odd that the controversy over the reported disturbance to common gulls, oystercatchers and black guillemots at the old oil depot in Ardrishaig is focused on a breeding colony of common gulls.I’m no bird expert and hadn’t realised common gulls are less common than the bigger varieties or that they’re a declining species.But among the reasons given for this are predation by mink and the loss of open rubbish dumps and both might be contributing factors in Mid Argyll.It’s surely hardly surprising that the only breeding colony along the canal is at the Ardrishaig end, where the urbanisation around the tidal flats of Loch Gilp and the Lingerton dump offer prime scavenging opportunities.I don’t know whether they lose out to the bigger gull species when it comes to local island nesting sites, or whether the old Gleaner site might offer other advantages, for example, maybe less vulnerable to mink predation – but could it be the gulls are there primarily because of man-made feeding opportunities and that they’ll find an alternative site that’s similarly convenient?Likewise, the smaller populations of oystercatchers and black guillemots, however, although they’re also both amber listed they don’t scavenge and seem to be more dependent on the sea and shore for their livelihoods.Their decline might be of more concern but they’re hopefully less swayed towards easy pickings around Loch Gilp and more evenly distributed to Loch Crinan.Perhaps Jim Dickson and Andrew Tongue can enlighten us further on just how endangered the populations of these three species are in Mid Argyll.Robert Wakeham, Lochgilphead.Sir,Please would the parents of the young girl who may have witnessed a recent incident with a man and dog in Inveraray Main Street contact my husband and I through this newspaper?We saw a man who, we believe, mistreated a dog in the street at 8.30pm on Sunday April 29.We are both keen to know this young person is alright as she appeared to be frightened, running off at speed with her two dogs.Knowing she was fine would put our minds at rest. We can still see her face full of horror and hear her cry.Otherwise we had a lovely holiday. You have a most beautiful part of the country to live in.Name and address supplied.Sir,It has been announced recently a Scottish Conservative government would invest £100 million into fixing potholes over the course of the next parliament.We all rely on our roads but they are now plagued with potholes which are damaging cars. Beyond our concerns for public safety, this systematic under-investment is slowing our economy and costing local councils a fortune in compensation for car owners.We recognise the importance of well-maintained roads and we are willing to invest in it.The SNP has consistently neglected Scotland’s roads and the results are obvious for everyone to see.Councillor Alastair Redman, Islay.On Monday May 14, I spotted six swallows over the rear of Meadows Place, hopefully heralding a decent summer.First seen this year.Mike Power, Lochgilphead.Sir,During this week\u0026#8217s Holyrood vote on the UK Government’s Withdrawal Bill, Labour, the Greens and LibDems joined the SNP in an overwhelming rejection of the UK Government’s currently-drafted Brexit plans, voting 93 to 30 against the bill.While the Scottish Government agrees in the need for UK-wide frameworks, it has described the retention of the overall control of agriculture, fisheries, food labelling and public procurement as a power grab.The Scottish Parliament has spoken loudly and clearly, and if the UK Government wants us to believe they value Scotland and devolution, they must respect the vote and remove the proposed power grab.Any constraints placed on the existing powers of the Scottish Parliament without consent would be a democratic outrage.During Prime Minister\u0026#8217s Questions, Theresa May failed to reassure us she will respect the decision of the Scottish Parliament. If she does choose to ignore the vote and force through this legislation, she will be breaking the conventions of the 20-year-old devolution settlement and imposing a power grab upon Scotland against our will.Brendan O\u0026#8217Hara, MP for Argyll and Bute.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column 25","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 21/05/18, 3:33 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Some would argue it has been an eyesore that should have been knocked down long before now and replaced with a more modern building.But it\u0026#8217s sad to see the old Inveraray Community Hall crumble and rot with neglect.What makes the building\u0026#8217s current predicament all the more galling is that there was the chance, according to Inspire Inveraray, to make the building safe six years ago.

As with other gull species which are opportunist in diet, junk food and bits of plastic provided by us humans can be inadvertently consumed.Over many years the Gleaner oil depot, which has a concrete bund in case of oil spillage, has provided a safe nesting site for around 20 pairs. The suggestion that this colony could easily find an alternative site is perhaps wishful thinking as suitable sites nearby in Mid Argyll are already occupied by other gull species or don’t have the required habitat features.Thankfully, however, this should not prove necessary. Following a productive on-site meeting last week with the Scottish Canals\u0026#8217 environmental scientist, the project architect and TSL contractors we noted 10-15 birds sitting on eggs and unaffected by the work going on around them.Planned works over the coming weeks should not affect these gulls, Oystercatchers or Black Guillemots from nesting and will also not impede the building work which is scheduled to be completed by next spring.The Mid Argyll hub project and new canal museum will largely reflect the social and cultural heritage of the Crinan Canal, but should also encompass the important and often decreasing natural history of the Crinan Canal corridor. These breeding birds are also a part of this and should not just be something to ‘chase off’ to somewhere else.Excellent viewing and educational opportunities from the new build will be possible to watch this colony raise their chicks as well as providing a point to lookout for other wildlife on the loch.Nearby, the tidal estuary of Loch Gilp provides us with an often highly under-valued unofficial nature reserve that links Ardrishaig with Lochgilphead, which in winter hosts important numbers of duck and waders, in summer includes breeding Eider ducks and Common Terns and during migration is a vital stopping off point during adverse weather for passage Whooper swans, Brent geese and Black-tailed Godwits to name a few.Increasingly good work is being undertaken by locals and the Phoenix Trust to help clear up some of the increasing amounts of shoreline rubbish.Keep up the good work!Jim Dickson, Argyll Bird Recorder, CairnbaanSir,I have been out and about Islay the past week speaking to my constituents, visiting local businesses and monitoring the roads department\u0026#8217s progress with road repairs.Unfortunately CalMac management\u0026#8217s shocking handling of our local ferry service is really taking it\u0026#8217s toll on many local businesses that depend heavily of Islay\u0026#8217s growing tourist trade. We simply cannot allow CalMac to continue to make the same errors every year without consequences.On another subject, I have been unimpressed with our local roads department management\u0026#8217s sluggish response to a large number of complaints from local residents and myself about the plague of potholes scattered across Islay.There are many roads across Islay that have some potholes marked to be filled while others remain unmarked despite them in many cases being side by side. This scattershot approach to pothole repairs is as random as it is ineffective.In the future we will need to see a more long term resurfacing solution to our local roads with less short term, random and piecemeal patchwork.Cllr Alastair Redman, Isle of IslaySir,In the run up to National Volunteering Week (June 1- 7), Cats Protection would like to extend our thanks to the many thousands of volunteers throughout the country who offer their time and expertise to help cats and kittens across the UK.In 2017, our 10,200-strong volunteer network contributed an incredible 5.5 million hours, each volunteer gifting a wealth of expertise and immeasurable passion to the charity. Their dedication enabled Cats Protection to help around 200,000 cats and kittens nationwide.Cats Protection is always on the lookout for new volunteers to join the UK’s biggest cat community. Though a large part of our work is helping cats, through fostering and rehoming, our volunteers have the opportunity to become involved with a range of interesting activities such as organising fundraising events, helping with publicity or managing funds and resources to benefit the greatest amount of cats.Volunteering can offer the chance to develop skills such as time management, interpersonal skills and teamwork, making CVs much more attractive and, of course, helping cats.Anyone who is interested in becoming a volunteer can go to our website www.cats.org.uk/get- involved/volunteering  to find out more.Julie Meredith, head of volunteering development, Cats Protection,Sir,I really love being active, especially the feeling after and that’s why I’m supporting Bowel Cancer UK and Beating Bowel Cancer’s latest fundraising campaign to get sponsored to do 30 minutes of physical activity for 30 days in June.Step up for 30 is a fantastic way for you to be more physically active to reduce your risk of bowel cancer – the UK’s second biggest cancer killer.

After a pit stop in the Royal Burgh it was on to Fort William, then Inverness and back home again- all to raise money for Cancer Research UK and Target Ovarian Cancer.Spokesperson for Breast Way Round, Laura White, said: ‘This year was full of fun, laughter, meeting new family members and although the daily miles are hard going, the weather and the beauty of the Scottish scenery made it that little bit easier.’As well as the sponsored trek, the bikers raised money in more traditional ways, such as bucket shaking (the men wearing bras) and hosting a raffle and auction in Caol Community Centre. The most coveted item, a patchwork quilt made by rider Cathy Anderson, went for a whopping £700.The annual trip was started in 2008 by Shirley-Ann McKnight as a last tour of Scotland for fellow biker and close friend, Alyson Porter, who was suffering from cancer. Sadly, Alyson never made it to her trip and now each year the journey is retraced in celebration of her life and all those affected by cancer.Since 2008, more than 600 riders have participated, each clad with a pink mohawk courtesy of Hairy-RS, and the team has raised £347,000 for Macmillan Cancer Support.

They won a throw-in deep in the Glasgow Red Star half, taken by Craig Aitken. After playing a neat one-two with Woody Hoad, Craig sent in a teasing cross for Keiran Caskie to glance past the Glasgow Red Star keeper.Lochgilphead introduced Jamie Stewart and Ciaran Gibson who helped freshen things up and work hard to close the game out.Special mention to subs Lee Harris, just returning from injury, and the ever reliable Calum Paterson.At the end of the game the Lochgilphead boys were presented with the League Cup and also the League Championship for 2004 age group teams to make it a double celebration.With three games still left to play the boys are looking to make it through the season with only one league defeat.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column 27","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 10/06/18, 3:50 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.The last thing David MacInnes sees himself as is a hero.Be we believe differently.

The pair were seeded car 30 in the two wheel drive section, run first on the day in a new schedule being piloted by the rally, the two wheel drive cars covering the stages before the four wheel drive cars followed in the afternoon.With the dry conditions in the weeks running up to the event dust would be the main problem for those running further down the field. Douglas attacked the first stage, Twiglees, and was catching the car in front when, unfortunately due to the dust being created by that car, came out of a 90 degree corner with zero visibility and connected heavily with a rock, damaging the suspension and forcing his early retirement.The car, and the driver, are noticeably quicker  each event they compete in and it\u0026#8217s only a matter of time before the results are there.The other Argyll car out on the stages was Ally Currie from Mull and Grant McNiven in the Ford Fiesta ST picking up 9th overall and 1st in Class 6.The next round of the Scottish Championship is Argyll Rally, based in Dunoon on June 23 \u0026#8211 the closest round for most Argyll rally enthusiasts and one not to be missed. The stages look absolutely breathtaking this year and well worth a watch.The Scottish Tarmac Rally Championship continues as well with round three being the Granite at Leuchars Stages hosted by Aberdeen and District Motor Club at the MOD base in Leuchars, Fife.Argyll was well represented both in the drivers seat and the co-drivers. All Argyll crew Willie and Steven Beattie were out in the newly finished and beautifully finished Escort MkII. They were absolutely flying and really getting to grips with the car when a sixth gear lock-up threw them into a spin and off the stage, clouting a fairly substantial fence post in the process.The navigators side now looks decidedly second hand, but nothing a few hours in the workshop won\u0026#8217t sort. A bent bottom suspension arm put paid to them re-joining but they will take the positives and the blistering pace into the next round for sure.Willie Beattie Snr in his equally exquisite Escort was also beginning to get the hang of the car, with some more seat time this year, not to mention experienced co-driver, Phil Sandham, pushing him on. He, after making sure his boys were okay when they didn\u0026#8217t show up at service after their spin, continued on to secure 12th overall and second in class: his first honours since building the car.The next round may see some family ties severely stretched, at least until the final results are announced.Ian Parker was also out in familiar machinery, co-driving for Fraser Smith in his Canal Garage-prepared Honda Civic. The pair were also making good progress up the class rankings until the diff decided to implode and finished their rally on Stage six.The drive of the day was not in question. Alan Kirkaldy led from start to finish despite some interesting issues in the first test. His door came loose after about a third of stage and he continued, holding the door shut by the open window whilst steering, changing gear and waving with the other.Astonishingly he still managed quickest stage time by five seconds. His co-driver for the day could forgive himself for being a little green about the gills after that.Eoghan Anderson from Cairnbaan was lucky enough to win the seat in a charity auction at the Annual STRC Dinner earlier in the year. An experience he is unlikely to forget in a hurry, although some of the memories may be a little bit blurry and perhaps just a little sideways. The top three were rounded out by Ian Forgan, ably guided round in his Subaru by his daughter in her first rally and the final position on the podium went to Ian and Allan Paterson, also in a Subaru.The next round is this weekend at Crail where the Beattie boys will be back out, Ian Parker swaps a Civic for an Escort MKII and Donald Bowness is set to get back out in the Nova.PICS:Photos: Gavin Brown, West Coast PhotosRed Escort (Car 1) Alan Kirkaldy/Eoghan Anderson (first overall) no_a24rally01\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"high tech preparation for mid argyll art show","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 14/06/18, 7:45 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowThis year has seen a lot of preparatory work ahead of the 2018 Mid Argyll Art Society exhibition in August.The popular show will again be held in the Drill Hall, Lochgilphead and will run from August 6-11.As in the last few years, the Mid Argyll Camera Club will have photos on display.The society is harnessing modern technology in a campaign to raise the profile of this year\u0026#8217s event.There is now a Mid Argyll Art Society Facebook page that can be used to get updates on what is happening.There will shortly be a website giving details about the art society, its history, information on the exhibition and how to participate, and photos of past exhibits to give a flavour of what the event is like.A lot of work has been done on modernising the entry process.

Now scientists from the University of Aberdeen have added a third species to the mix \u0026#8211 the European pine marten. These native squirrel predators are recolonising Britain after years of persecution, and so the scientists set out to uncover the impact of this on red and grey squirrel populations.Three study sites in Scotland were in the Highlands (marten recolonisation for over 45 years, no grey squirrels), Central Scotland (marten recolonisation for 8-14 years, grey squirrels since 1945) and the Borders (early stages of marten recolonization, grey squirrels since 1980).Populations were monitored for five months using cameras and multi-species feeders \u0026#8211 the latter with glue strips on the underside of the lid to obtain visitor hair samples. This material provided DNA to determine visitor species and identify individual martens.The results showed that while red squirrels avoided feeders used by martens, greys were equally likely to use feeders whether frequented by martens or not. So grey squirrel numbers were reduced where exposure to pine martens was high, whereas numbers of red squirrels increased – unequivocal evidence that recovering marten numbers affect competition between red and grey squirrels.This finding is likely explained by the fact that reds, having co-evolved with martens, instinctively avoid areas used by martens but invasive greys, having no such instincts, showed no avoidance behaviour at all.Since pine martens’ range is increasing and extending southwards, scientists are optimistic that this will control the invasive grey squirrel species.As they say in the title to their report, in this case ‘the enemy of my enemy is my friend’.PIC:The native grey squirrel may have an unlikely ally.

We simply don\u0026#8217t have enough children playing shinty in each school to make up separate clubs.Surely, in 2018, this shouldn\u0026#8217t be allowed to happen?It is only three clubs that are being affected by this, and they\u0026#8217re all in the south of Scotland,  half way through a season, leaving all our kids devastated at the though of losing their chosen sport.My son has been playing shinty since Primary One. He is now heading into Primary Four and is even more passionate about the sport. He enjoys quality team time, striving to be the best he can and just loving playing the game.It\u0026#8217s very difficult to explain something like this to an eight-year-old child, never mind the Primary One children we have in our club.One quote from a child was: \u0026#8216Everyone is going to be so sad if we don\u0026#8217t have shinty. Why would shinty people do this to us?\u0026#8217It\u0026#8217s a very sad day indeed for the children of Argyll and Bute who are simply being punished for what school they go to and where they live. We have to stand together and fight for our club and our children.The Camanachd Association needs to step up and find a solution to allow all children to compete nationally and stand as one united shinty community.Ailsa and Alastair Crawford, LochgilpheadSir,The Camanachd Association has put politics before the needs of the children and the development of the sport in Argyll.The kids are disappointed and the coaches who have worked tirelessly to set the club up are deflated. Surely the association knows this is a mistake that needs rectified immediately.Personally, Kilmory and Dunadd children\u0026#8217s club has inspired our son and daughter to get involved with the sport and to grow in confidence amongst other like-minded children.Stuart and Simone Charnock, LochgilpheadSir,My son has trained with Kilmory/Dunadd shinty club since he was in Primary One. The club has always treated the kids equally and welcomed all kids to participate.After years of hard work, the team was progressing well and was worthy of competing at national level.In his last year before high school, to be told he is no longer allowed to play is not only devastating to my son but greatly confusing and he is left wondering what he has done wrong.I fail to see how this can be classed as progress by the Camanachd Association. This needs to be readdressed to allow kids to compete in the game they love.Susan Jackson, LochgilpheadI was very angry to hear from local residents in Portnahaven that their recycling bins have been used by numerous motorhomes for disposing of general waste, including food waste.I have visited the recycling bins site in Portnahaven and spoken to my constituents in person about this and I can confirm that unfortunately Portnahaven\u0026#8217s recycling bins are full of general waste.This is as unacceptable as it is disrespectful. I have contacted the appropriate department with the council and asked for an investigation to be done. I also asked for some addition signage for the bins area.I made it very clear that my constituents should not lose their recycling facilities as a result of their bins being misused by someone else.I will continue to monitor this situation and provide an update as soon as I have more information.Alastair Redman, Isle of IslaySir,It is fitting to mark this Diabetes Week (June 11-17) for Scotland’s 30,000 adults and children living with type one diabetes by noting that life-changing monitors are now available on the NHS.A child diagnosed with type one diabetes at five faces 50,000 finger prick blood glucose tests by the time they are 18.Each painful finger prick is part of a daily routine which also includes calculating carbohydrate intake and frequent insulin injections, all to prevent life-threatening hypoglycaemia and long term complications.But since November last year, a \u0026#8216flash glucose monitoring\u0026#8217 system called the Freestyle Libre can be prescribed by local GPs, offering an alternative to such intensive finger-pricking.The roll out of flash glucose monitoring, which gives a reading via a simple sensor, however, is not consistent across all local health boards. So, our message for Diabetes Week is to call for health boards in Scotland to speed up prescription policies and step up much needed prescriptions.As someone who has lived with type one diabetes for 21 years, new technology, such as the FreeStyle Libre, makes a world of difference.Type one diabetes cannot be prevented and until we find the cure for it, research and technology are vital.Holly Davies, development manager, Aberdeen\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"ban smoking outside cafes could","story":"NewsBan on smoking outside cafes could be ditchedSouth Ayrshire councillors will launch a bid to scrap their own controversial rule, the Post can reveal.\u0026nbspShareByStuart Wilson16:10, 18 JUN 2018NewsNino and Karen Pajovic, owners of Cafe Le Monde, have received much public support (Image: Ayrshire Post)\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA law banning smoking outside cafes could be binned within weeks. South Ayrshire councillors will launch a bid to scrap their own controversial rule, the Post can reveal. We told last week how the three-year-old policy is being labelled a threat to small businesses. Now councillors are ready to intervene in the row. Labour’s Phil Saxton, who represents Troon, is to table a motion before colleagues calling for a rethink.  He said: “The word we’re looking for here is compromise. “I don’t think the relevant detail was considered when this policy was first introduced. “The ability to enforce something like this will always be very difficult.” Cllr Saxton is now expected to lead calls for a ‘mixed’ smoking zone outside cafes or bars which use council-owned pavements. He said: “We could look at 50 per cent of the tables smoking and 50 per cent not. “I don’t think that’s an unreasonable solution. “Right now I’m looking at gathering support and hopefully the vote will go our way.”  That vote is scheduled to take place on June 28 when the council holds its last full meeting before the summer recess. It’s understood members are currently divided on the issue, which was introduced under the council’s last administration. The new move comes as the Post reported last week how furious cafe bosses said their business was under threat because of the “crazy”council law. Nino and Karen Pajovic insisted a smoking ban outside their Cafe Le Monde premises in Ayr was costing them thousands Said Nino: “A compromise along these lines would be perfect and is surely the common sense approach.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"brave mum set skydive charity","story":"NewsBrave mum set to skydive for charity for inspirational nephewJoanne Dunlop, of Ayr, will jump from a hair-raising 10,000ft at Skydive St Andrews.\u0026nbspShareByLochlin Highet10:32, 15 JUN 2018NewsMegan Mcphearson and Joanne Dunlop\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA brave mum is set to take to the skies for her inspirational nephew.

Villagers - and residents across the greenbelt in Muirhead - mounted a stiff rearguard action after a bid to get it zoned for housing. For the first time it emerged a developer WAS behind the plan, rather than, as was insisted, South Ayrshire Council officers just selected it as a prospect. Senior SNP councillor Craig Mackay said on Tuesday it was now “highly unlikely” it would make the next stage. And he told Troon Community Council : “No decisions have been made and we are not out of the woods yet with the Muirhead-Loans site yet. “But on the basis the available land pretty much matches what we need for new housing over the next five years, there should be no need for any release of greenbelt sites. “It is highly unlikely it will be built on.” We revealed the secret plan for the soggy 30 acre field in October, which would link the medieval clachan to the town of Troon. It sparked an emergency meeting of Loans Community Council and the public packed out Troon Community Council meetings.  And at the time town councillor Peter Convery said: “That ground is sacrosanct and it should never have been suggested for the local plan.” Planners were promoting the sight, saying the “layouts of both settlements turn their backs twoards each other at the moment and this doesnt create an attractive approach to either of them.” Councillor Mackay said the house sites currently available “pretty much” matched the demand. And he revealed South Ayrshire Council has now taking a slightly different approach from the developer-led schemes. He added: “Brownfield land will be prioritised even though that is not as lucrative for developers.” Councillor Mackay also revealed a developer had been circling on the Loans site - despite insistence from council officers there was no developer. He said:”Planning officers gave assurances there was no developer.. but there was.”  The breakthrough has been hailed by David Chalmers, chairman of Loans Community Council. He said: “It is obviously encouraging hearing Councillor McKay’s statement that development be allowed on the greenbelt between Loans and Muirhead is unlikely to be adopted in LDP2. “We will, of course, anxiously await SAC’s verification of this which we understand will not be until nearer the end of this year. “Every praise should be given to the overwhelming response given by the residents of Loans and Muirhead - a 367 signature petition and 246 letters - which clearly demonstrated the level of feeling against.” South Ayrshire Council said the process to publish the new Development Plan was still active. A spokesman said: “There are a range of issues that are suggested, discussed and determined. This is a very thorough process to ensure that all stakeholders are given due consideration. As a result, we’ll only be able to give assurance of what is included in, or excluded from the proposed plan when a report is considered by the Council later this year.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnScottish National PartySouth Ayrshire CouncilTroonAyrAyr News"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article12698905.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/asr_ayp_060618Mhari5.jpg","title":"meet weeks wedding week","story":"NewsMeet this week\u0027s Wedding of the WeekMhari Bryce, 27-year-old Reception Manager from Hamilton married 36-year-old Operations Manager Chris Rowe from Manchester.\u0026nbspShareByAbi Smillie16:18, 13 JUN 2018NewsNewlyweds Mhari and Chris pose in front of a picturesque backdrop (Image: Adore photography)\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailMeet this week’s Wedding of the Week couple.

The pair now live in Ayr. “We met on a training course in Livingston in 2010 - Chris offered me his last jelly baby!” said Mhari. “It was after Chris moved from Livingston to Ayr that we started dating properly and have been together since.” The couple tied the knot on Sunday, April 1 at The Waterside Hotel in West Kilbride. Mhari said: “We had the perfect day with amazing weather and a beautiful sunset.  “All our closest friends and family joined us for a simple but loving ceremony carried out by Peter Clark of the Scottish Humanist Society.” The bride wore a Mori lee dress from Bijoux Bridal, Hamilton. Mhari’s veil held a special sentimental value to it. She said: “The veil is 25 years old which was worn by my aunt on her wedding day.” The groom and best men wore Grey Spirit kilts from Slaters, Ayr. The couple’s wedding party consisted of bridesmaids Sara Bryce (bride’s sister) and Lyndsey Bickerton and best men Grant Russell and Mark Rowe (groom’s brother). The newly married Mr and Mrs jetted off for a fortnight in the sun after the big day.  The couple said: “We flew to St Lucia for 2 weeks and stayed at The Royalton. “It was amazing - so relaxed, exactly what we needed after the wedding.” Adore Weddings captured the couple’s big day, with both photography and videography, leaving them with lovely memories to look back on. Mhari added: “Both Barrie and Jim were fantastic all day, with us and all the guests. “The pictures are just too hard to pick from.” Stems and Gems in Saltcoats created the bouquets, buttonholes and flowers for the centrepieces while the cake was made by a relative.  Mhari said: “The cake was made by my aunt. “It was baked in Norwich then driven all the way to Scotland and built. “All the flowers are made of icing to match the flowers in my bouquet.” Linzi of Linzi Smith Hair at Distinction styled the hair for the day while Elaine Sawyer of Lookz Mobile Makeup Artist created the makeup looks. The couple added: “We would like to thank everyone who travelled the distance to make our special day - some all the way from Texas. “Also a massive thank you to Ryan and Stacey of The Waterside - our day ran perfectly all thanks to them.” For more photos of this week\u0027s Wedding of the Week, pick up your copy of the Ayrshire Post.

The bill for absent workers comes on the back of 42,736 days lost during the last 12 months. Employees recorded an average of nine days on the sick during 2017/18. Psychological reasons (30 per cent) were cited as the leading cause for absence, followed by musculoskeletal (19 per cent) and hospitalisation (12 per cent). By far the biggest service to feel the strain was the Health and Social Care Partnership, where an average of 16 days per employee was lost. Teachers, who account for 23 per cent of the council’s workforce, were the best performing ‘directorate’ with a loss of just five days per worker.  All figures were recorded between April 1, 2017 and March 31, 2018. Council officials said trends were showing a “gradual and consistent improvement”. An average of 11.7 days were lost to absence by local government employees (all staff bar teachers) in 2010. The revised figure stands at 10.06 days for 2017/18. A council spokesman said they were “committed” to supporting staff and have a “number of policies and supports in place to maximise employee attendance”. They added: “In recent years, more robust monitoring and reporting arrangements have been introduced which have seen a steady improvement in this area, with our figures below the national average. “We continue to closely monitor employee attendance levels and take all appropriate steps to ensure appropriate standards.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article12713526.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/emp_ayp_070618ecrepont_10JPG.jpg","title":"talented youngster finn ecrepont walking","story":"NewsTalented youngster Finn Ecrepont is walking on AyrDubbed a hot prospect with a bright future, the local Ayr lad kicked off his footballing career with a knock back from Grange Academy’s Performance School of Football.\u0026nbspShareByLochlin Highet12:00, 18 JUN 2018NewsAyr United\u0027s Finn Ecrepont (Image: Ayrshire Post)\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailMost success stories in football start with a rejection somewhere along the line. And 15-year-old Ayr United starlet Finn Ecrepont is no different. Dubbed a hot prospect with a bright future, the local Ayr lad kicked off his footballing career with a knock back from Grange Academy’s Performance School of Football. The Kilmarnock school has dedicated facilities for bright talents in the footballing world. And after leaving Alloway Primary, Ecrepont’s aim was to join the set-up at the Grange - but he was told he wasn’t good enough at his trial for the performance school. But the left-back, who also went to Glenburn Primary, refused to give up on his dream. Ecrepont, who has played with Ayr United since he was nine, said: “Getting that knock back is key to where I am today, because that has made me realise it’s not as easy as just walking into a team. “I didn’t get through the first trial so that made me focus and I knew I had to work hard. “I guess there was choices to make and sacrifices to make, but I was willing to make these changes for my football.  “I had training at Ayr the night after I got my knock back so I went to ask my coach Ross Armour for advice, so that’s when the work began. “I went away and worked on my game and a year later I got into the performance school at the Grange, which is one of the best things that has ever happened to me.” Ecrepont worked his way up through the ranks at Ayr and has now signed a three year deal with the first team. Just last season he was training with the under 17s, but his progress has been off the scale and he is now training with the senior side. He has been getting day release from school on a Thursday to train with the first team, but after signing his new deal he will train four mornings a week with Ian McCall’s side. And despite most schools refusing to take him in due to his football commitments, Ayr Academy were good enough to take him in. And dad Eddy, who runs Cafe Ginger in Ayr, claims teachers from Ayr Academy have offered to work overtime to help Ecrepont through his studies. Ecrepont is delighted to get his chance so early with Ayr.  He said: “The coaches thought I was playing well so I got more of a chance through my training and playing more with the under 20s last season. “I just love being in and around the first team, and the boys have been great with me so I am happy to be where I’m at at the moment. “Everyone at the club has been brilliant with me, through all the age groups. All the senior players and coaches have been really accepting of me and I couldn’t have asked for anything more. “Ian McCall and all of the other coaches are great because they always give me feedback. “Whether it’s positive or negative they are always keeping me right. That has been key to my progression. “If I was to ask anyone a question at Ayr they would answer it no problem, and that’s exactly what I look for and it’s why I’m here.” Despite the gruelling schedule of being a footballer, Ecrepont claims he is still fully focused on his school work.  He said: “Adapting to be a footballer hasn’t been much different as I enjoy it and it’s more like a hobby. I play football for fun and that’s what’s most important to me, so I guess it’s just normal. “It can take a lot out of me, but again because I enjoy football so much I don’t really realise how much I am doing. “I don’t think it’s had an effect on my school and I think it’s going good. Hopefully I have done well in my exams which I’ll find out in August. “I’ll get a Wednesday off from training so I can hopefully work towards getting my highers. “This year I’m studying higher English and PE, next year I’ll do something like Chemistry and Biology. And despite his age, Ecrepont has already been involved in a number of big games. He scored for Scotland under 16s against England, but for Ayr under 20s he was involved in a league decider last season against Morton. He said: “Unfortunately we lost the game 1-0 from a penalty, but I played the full game and it was a great experience and the boys played really well.  “There was quite a few Ayr United fans there so they gave us a great support.” But Ecrepont refuses to forget where he came from, he is sure to consistently help his dad Eddy in Cafe Ginger. Ecrepont said: “I signed for Ayr on the Tuesday, I was washing dishes for my dad on the Friday and on the Monday I was training with Scotland. “I work with my dad at the cafe which has been key to keeping me grounded. I know for a fact he wouldn’t let me get big-headed so I couldn’t thank him enough for that. “I’ve been asked before where I see myself in five years, but the honest answer is I don’t know. “For all I know I could get injured tomorrow and break my leg. “I have been told many times that I haven’t made it, and I know that. “My hard work starts now, so I just need to take everything as it comes and take each day on its own.” "},{"url":null,"title":"The most exciting chapter yet is about to open in Melrose","story":"TOP TV chefs, The Hairy Bikers will dish up the starter at this weekend\u0026rsquos Baillie Gifford Borders Book Festival in Melrose on Thursday.\nAnd it will be followed by a generous serving of explorer Sir Chris Bonington and his fascinating memoir Ascent, Charles Spencer talking to the Duke of Buccleuch about Charles II, and Great British Bake Off judge Prue Leith chatting about life and food.\nThousands of lovers of the written word will once again make their way to Harmony Gardens for the latest chapter in this fascinating and much-loved festival.\nOther highlights for 2018 include Robert Peston\u0026rsquos McInroy \u0026amp Wood Lecture on the state of the nation, Archie Macpherson recalling the glory years of Scottish football, Alexander McCall Smith celebrating 20 years of his bestselling No1 Ladies\u0026rsquo Detective Agency, King of Crime Ian Rankin talking all things Rebus, and Richard Holloway musing on mortality in his Waiting for the Last Bus.\nAlso on stage over the four days are award winning military historian Antony Beevor, TV presenter and archaeologist Neil Oliver, politicians William Hague and Gordon Brown, naturalist and conservationist John Lister-Kaye, gardening expert Carol Klein, journalists Stacey Dooley and Misha Glenny, leading palaeontologist Steve Brusatte, James Naughtie and Simon Jenkins on Brexit, Alan Taylor and Ian Rankin on Muriel Spark, Mark Millar, the man behind some of the biggest comic books and their film adaptations such as Kingsman and Wolverine, sporting heroes including ex-international rugby star Doddie Weir, marathon runner and Irongran Edwina Brocklesby, and record-breaking cyclist and adventurer Mark Beaumont, as well as comedian and ventriloquist Nina Conti.\nFestival Director Alistair Moffat is rightly excited by this year\u0027s line-up.

closed.\nThis sparked a six-week consultation by the Post Office on proposals to operate a one-day mobile service in the town.\nThe consultation was met with a huge backlash from local politicians and residents, who set up a petition to restore full Post Office services in Innerleithen and the launch of an appeal for local businesses to come forward to take on a concession within their

with Post Office bosses soon put a stop to the idea.\nWhile the town has been without a permanent service, a mobile service has operated for several hours each Friday in Innerleithen, forcing residents who urgently need to make postal deliveries to travel east to Walkerburn, or west to Peebles to do so.\nA spokesperson from the Post Office told us that, while plans are yet to be finalised,

that equipped Peter for taking his duties in his stride, we\u0027ll never know.\nBut his composure and welcoming smile wasn\u0027t lost on any of the dignitaries around him.\nHonorary Provost Jake Wheelans said: \"After all the bad weather and everything else it was great to have Peter as our Standard Bearer.\n\"He was impeccable in every part of his duties today, and he upheld all of our traditions as a Standard Bearer should.\n\"Selkirk has enjoyed a tremendous Common Riding with a fantastic Standard Bearer.\"\n"},{"url":null,"title":"Keep calm - it  39 s only the Common Riding","story":"THE calming influence of Standard Bearer Peter Forrest made sure Selkirk Common Riding ran like clockwork on Friday.\nJust hours after Storm Hector had ripped through the region, Souters awoke to a serene and surprisingly relaxed morning.\nAnd about to head their day-long celebrations was to be the most relaxed of them all - Standard Bearer Forrest.\nThe Flute Band\u0027s Rouse Parade set the tone for a day few will forget.\nHundreds gathered at the War Memorial to honour the brave sons of Selkirk who didn\u0027t come home.\nAnd as the First Drum was sounded at 6am in the Market Place, the hundreds who do come home year after year from far off lands burst into song.\nHer Bright Smile has rarely sounded so good.\nThe build-up had well and truly begun.\nAnd by the time Standard Bearer Forrest was officially installed by Lady Busser, Dylis Wheelans, on the balcony of the Victoria Hall the hundreds had grown to thousands.\nA total of 281 riders followed the 2018 Standard Bearer doon the Green, across the Ettrick and up the Linglie.\nEveryone one of them was safe oot and every one of them returned safe in, some two-and-a-half hours later.\nOfficial reports later confirmed only three minor falls occurred throughout the entire procession.\nAs Standard Bearer Forrest, duly assisted by his Attendants Craig Monks, Robbie Reilly, Thomas Willmott and Liam Cassidy, led the cavalcade beyond Tibbie\u0027s towards the Three Brethren, beneath in the ancient streets of Selkirk the Hammermen, the Weavers, the Fleshers, the Colonials, the Merchants and the Ex-Soldiers began to muster ahead of their march to the Toll.\nAll the pomp and ceremony, headed by the trusty Silver and Pipe bands, brings out the best in this small rural burgh.\nIt\u0027s a place where pride and passion go hand in hand with smiles and laughter.\nSongs are sung, friendships rekindled and customs observed as the crowds patiently await the Coming in of the Burley.\nAnd they didn\u0027t have to wait long at Selkirk\u0027s northern most entrance as Standard Bearer Forrest, aboard the grey-dappled Lizzie, arrived to a cacophony of cheers and shouts of encouragement.\nProud parents, Ann and Rob, as well as girlfriend, Emma Pearce, were the first to offer him their congratulations as a well-deserved breather is taken at The Toll.\nAnd, in time-honoured fashion, his mounted followers made their own spectacular galloping return to the auld toon.\nJoyce Wright, representing the Ladies section of the Rig Committee, presented the traditional riding crop to Standard Bearer Forrest before he remounted to conclude his duties.\nAnd what a conclusion it is.\nThe Casting of the Colours pays homage to the heroic Fletcher, who returned from Flodden with a captured English banner and defiantly cast it around his head before dying.\nTo Up wi\u0027 the Souters Standard Bearer Forrest brought his ceremonial duties to an end with an impeccable cast.\nReflecting on his day, Peter told us: \"Being Standard Bearer was everything I knew it would be and more.\n\"I enjoyed the Marches - really enjoyed it - and my horse Lizzie was great.\n\"You think it can\u0027t get any better then it does. Coming in at The Toll was unbelievable and the Casting was something that will live with me forever.\n\"It has been a truly amazing day and I\u0027d like to thank everyone who came out and supported me.\"\n"},{"url":null,"title":"Casting their places in history","story":"SELKIRK Common Riding is undoubtedly a festival steeped in tradition and commemoration.\nBut it is also a day of contrasts for the followers as well as the ones lucky enough to take part.\nFrom the high-adrenaline riders returning at the Toll, the ecstasy and elation is quietly absorbed by reflection and respect as the colourful procession heads into town.\nBeneath silver skies the rearranged scarlet plinth within the Market Place awaited not only Royal Burgh Standard Bearer Peter Forrest, but the six accompanying Standard Bearers selected by the town\u0026rsquos ancient Societies and Associations.\nTo the growing thrum of expectation, as the hidden clock ticked past eleven, all seven gathered beneath the steps to await a brief minute or two that will live with them forever.\nSince the tragic cast of a blood-soaked English banner more than 500 years ago, this re-enactment both commemorates and celebrates, defiance and pride in equal measure.\nAnd as the Silver Band leads the way with Up wi\u0026rsquo the Souters, each Standard Bearer in turn re-enacts and relives this defiant and proud act.\nStandard Bearer Forrest, as he had been all morning, was assured and relaxed as he turned the Royal Burgh Standard above his head.\nIt was as deserved a cheer as any Standard Bearer has received as he smiled, waved and made his way from the gaze of five-thousand eyes.\nCollege lecturer Mark Easson \u0026ndash a painter by trade \u0026ndash resumed where Standard Bearer Forrest had left off. Armed with the Incorporation of Hammermen Banner, the 49-year-old showed a steady hand and perfect timing to provide an impeccable cast.\nHis smile was as deserved as the loud cheer that followed him down the steps.\nFletcher himself was a weaver before that bloody battle in 1513, and Michael Pepper made sure the fabric of the historic Corporation continued unblemished for another year.\nThe 27-year-old textiles worker may have looked a little nervous but as his cast continued his smile grew. Again, the appreciation was richly deserved.\nFormer farmer Jackie Johnston brought experience with him as he provided a perfect cast of the Incorporation of Fleshers Flag.\nIf there were nerves, they didn\u0026rsquot show as the self-employed excavator took it all in his stride, even managing a thumbs-up to the conductor of the Silver Band before dismounting.\nWhile the other Standard Bearers have enjoyed several weeks\u0026rsquo of practice under the guiding gaze of those who have gone before them, Colonial Standard Bearer Alisdair Piercy has been using two broom-handles taped together with an old Scotland flag in his garage in Toronto.\nBut casting the colours is in his blood - the 39-year-old was following in the footsteps of his father, Drew, and grandfather, Archie, by casting the colours.\nAnd the 2018 Colonial Standard Bearer was perfect in every way as he cast the striking yellow banner above his head.\nFollowing the ceremony Alisdair revealed: \u0026ldquoI watched the casting so many times when I was a boy growing up in Selkirk.\n\u0026ldquoBeing up there was amazing \u0026ndash I was ready to start but when that drum sounds it hits you right in the heart.\n\u0026ldquoI was trying not to listen to the band and keep counting in my head, like I\u0026rsquod been told, and I think it worked.\nThe wave and grin from Alisdair were deserved as he savoured every moment on the scarlet plinth.\nOne Standard Bearer who is more familiar with the new-look Market Place than most is architect Stuart Davidson.\nThe 37-year-old dad-of-three has been heavily involved in the ongoing redesign of the town centre.\nStuart was a picture of concentration throughout most of his faultless cast, only allowing himself a huge smile of relief during the final bars of Up wi\u0026rsquo the Souters.\nArguably the most poignant of all is saved for last.\nFormer KOSB Martin Young brought with him all the military discipline and reliability you would expect as he carried the Ex-Soldiers\u0026rsquo Association Flag onto the scarlet plinth.\nThe father of two, who is a now a traffic policeman, provided another faultless cast with the Union banner before leading this close-knit community in two minutes of silence and reflection.\nWith the centenary fast approaching of the end of the Great War, the sacrifice made by so many is being brought even clearer into focus.\nThat defiance of tyranny and pride in one\u0026rsquos own beliefs and customs, shown by Fletcher, has carried on in Souters down the centuries as decade after decade they have made the ultimate sacrifice.\nThose two minutes of impeccable silence and reflection were only broken by the haunting strains of The Liltin.\nAnd for yet another year, Souters can return home safe in the knowledge that the past won\u0026rsquot be forgotten and the future is one of hope.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"New route planned for tonight s Melrosian s rideout","story":"FOLLOWERS of Melrosian

Six-year-old Maisie, who plays the main character, Libby, in the film, in what was her first ever acting role, was accompanied to the glitzy ceremony in Los Angeles by her mother Elizabeth, co-star and writer Rachel Shenton, and the short film\u0026rsquos director Chris Overton.  And while a little young to be enjoying a champagne celebration, Maisie will be returning to her Upper Stratton home as one of the youngest actors to have starred in an Oscar-winning film.      THE. SILENT. CHILD. HAS. WON. AN. OSCAR.

The Silent Child follows Libby, a profoundly deaf child born to a hearing family who struggle to communicate with their daughter.  As a result, she grows up isolated and develops behavioural problems until a social worker, played by Rachel Shenton, comes in to help.  Rachel, most famous for her role as Mitzeee Minniver in Channel 4\u0026rsquos Hollyoaks, wrote the film to raise awareness of the issues around hearing impairment and to improve viewers\u0026rsquo understanding of the condition.  She was inspired to do so by her experiences with her father, who became deaf following chemotherapy when she was 12.  The film was directed by Rachel\u0026rsquos fianc\u0026eacute Chris Overton, with a \u0026pound10,000 crowdfunded budget.  Maisie earned her role following a nationwide search, during which over 100 children auditioned for the part.  After filming, a surprise screening of The Silent Child was organised by Rachel at Maisie\u0026rsquos school, Red Oaks Primary, in August.  Maisie then flew with her proud parents, Elizabeth, who is also deaf,\u0026nbspand Gilson, who is partially deaf, to the film\u0026rsquos international premiere in Rhode Island \u0026ndash her first visit to the US, and her first time on a plane.  The film was given its first public screening in Swindon last month at the Swindon Arts Centre. Gilson, who spoke before and after the showing, said: \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos a great pleasure to be able to finally show this in Swindon.  \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos a film to be appreciated, and to spread a message.

John Muir Park has regularly been used by teenagers who are celebrating the end of their exams.

Police have patrolled the area after concerns at public meetings regarding underage drinking and the flouting of local bylaws involving drinking in a public place.  On Friday and Saturday, police and community wardens seized the alcohol from youngsters aged 14 to 21, with a variety of lager, cider and spirits, including 12 litres of vodka, taken.  Inspector Andrew Harborow said: \u0026ldquoEvery year around this time we are aware of youths congregating at Bullet Hill. Whilst this started out as an end-of-school celebration involving those mainly in S6, the ages of those taking part has clearly widened.  \u0026ldquoIn order to reduce the risk to those involved, we have taken action over the weekend and seized alcohol to prevent harm being caused and will be making follow-up enquiries with parents, carers and local shops as to where the alcohol came from.

Jess Mackie\u0026rsquos family created the fund in her name after the Gullane youngster, who loved to sing and help others, passed away suddenly on January 2 this year.  The North Berwick High School pupil was a member of the National Youth Choir of Scotland and sang with Aberlady and Gullane Parish Churches, at care homes and for charities, and at school concerts.  Despite her young age, she had a sense of how music could help people in need.  And now the Jess Mackie Memorial Fund will \u0026ldquohelp her to keep helping others, as she had always done, and would have continued to do if she was still with us, said parents Michael and Jackie.  \u0026ldquoWe cannot let our beautiful daughter\u0026rsquos name and character be forgotten, they said. \u0026ldquoShe had so much to offer.  All monies raised will be used to provide support and comfort through music therapy at the Royal Hospital for Sick Children, Edinburgh.  Dad Michael, long-standing chairman of Gullane Sports Development Trust, said: \u0026ldquoWhen Jess passed away, we had a memorial service for her and decided to use it to donate to the Edinburgh Children\u0026rsquos Hospital Charity. Quickly thereafter, we learnt about an initiative involving music therapy they were running with Tinderbox Orchestra in the hospital. We met with one of the trustees initially and we decided to put in place something that would allow Jess to help other kids.  The memorial service, which was held at Aberlady Parish Church, raised more than \u0026pound2,000, with money continuing to be donated by members of the public and through organised events.  Michael, 52, said: \u0026ldquoWe were approached by Gullane and Aberlady Parish Churches and they asked if they could run an event in Jess\u0026rsquo memory, which they did last Sunday.  \u0026ldquoFrom the family point of view, it was another show of overwhelming support by the village and the community. We have raised a substantial amount of money. Gullane and Aberlady Parish Churches posted on Facebook that it had raised about \u0026pound1,800 for the fund and Gullane Athletic [FC] are running an event in August in support of the fund.  Twelve members of staff at North Berwick High School also took part in the recent Edinburgh Marathon Relay.  Split into three teams, they raised more than \u0026pound1,500 for The Royal Hospital for Sick Children Jess Mackie Memorial Fund, Richmond\u0026rsquos Hope and Leuchie House.  Jess, who was in S3 at the secondary school, was, like her twin sister Lauren, a keen singer.  Her dad told the Courier Jess \u0026ldquoloved singing and tried to help people and raise their spirits through her voice.  That love of singing and trying to help people has been mirrored through the success of the memorial fund, which sits at about \u0026pound9,800.  Michael added: \u0026ldquoI think that the fund reflects Jess completely. It reflects the impact she had while only 14 years old.  \u0026ldquoIt reflects the impact she had on people that she met and what she did in terms of her church singing, singing in local care homes, school concerts, helping out at various events like for the Bethany Christian Trust and Leuchie House. I think that reflects what she did while she was here.  The project aims to ensure children and young people who are feeling vulnerable in hospital are given the chance to enjoy music, which can have an enormous and positive impact, helping ignite a spark in them and giving them back a sense of control.  Michael added: \u0026ldquoMusic is a great comforter at times and what Tinderbox do is amazing for the kids.  \u0026ldquoWe had no hesitation in supporting what they do.  Janet Anderson, who is involved with the choirs at the two villages\u0026rsquo churches, also paid tribute to the talented teenager.  She said: \u0026ldquoI could not speak more highly of Jess.  \u0026ldquoShe did not think she had a special talent, she was just the most unassuming, normal girl you would ever meet.  \u0026ldquoShe was so pretty, so kind and so thoughtful and generous and she never thought she was anything special.

Chester, from Dunbar, is one of 13 pets, including cats, dogs and even a rat, taking part in the PDSA Pet Fit Club.  Together they weigh more than 200 kilogrammes and need to shed 75kg to reach their ideal weights.  Ten-year-old Chester, who lives with the Gilmour family on Newhouse Avenue, is looking to shift 2.6kg \u0026ndash or six pounds \u0026ndash to reach his ideal weight.  Chester, who tips the scales at 7.6kg, was gaining so much weight that his owners thought he must have an underlying medical condition. But when tests came back negative, it was clear Chester\u0026rsquos appetite and lazy ways were the root of the problem.  Owner Lisa said: \u0026ldquoWe realised everyone in the house was feeding him without knowing he\u0026rsquod already being fed, so he was getting fed by all four of us every day!  \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquove tried to help him lose weight, even putting a collar on him that says \u0026lsquoDo not feed me!\u0026rsquo for the neighbours, but that hasn\u0026rsquot worked.  \u0026ldquoHe eats whatever he can find including crisps left on the floor by the kids. He even stole my dad\u0026rsquos cheesecake that was on the kitchen counter! Another time my son woke up to the sound of rattling and he was trying to claw his way into a box of chocolates.  Lisa, along with partner Lindsay and sons Rhys and Ryan, got Chester when he was just a kitten.  Now they are determined to do what they can to help their pet lose some weight and be happier.  Lisa, who works in the family newsagent, added: \u0026ldquoHe\u0026rsquos getting older now and his weight will play on his joints if we don\u0026rsquot do something to help him. He can\u0026rsquot be comfortable carrying all that weight around and we want him to be happier and healthier as he ages.  Chester\u0026rsquos six-month Pet Fit Club diet and exercise programme will be specially tailored and overseen by the vets and nurses at Edinburgh PDSA Pet Hospital.  He is up against seven dogs, including a Cavalier King Charles spaniel who once ate a set of false teeth, a cat too fat to fit through the cat flap, and a rat who is double his ideal bodyweight.  If crowned the winner, Chester will receive a year\u0026rsquos supply of pet food, a pet-friendly holiday and a pet hamper.  Kathryn Marshall, PDSA Veterinary Care Assistant, will be helping to oversee Chester\u0026rsquos diet.  She said: \u0026ldquoWith the help of PDSA and Pet Fit Club, Lisa and Chester are making the necessary diet, exercise and lifestyle changes to help get Chester down to a healthier weight.  \u0026ldquoWe will support them every step of the way over the next six months to ensure they succeed."},{"url":null,"title":"Log found at Yellowcraig beach transformed into stunning violin","story":"              A VIOLIN maker has crafted a violin from driftwood found on an East Lothian beach to help raise awareness about the environment and the plight of the oceans.

His L\u0026eacutegion d\u0026rsquoHonneur medal was sent to his home in Cheltenham by post and contained a letter from Jean-Pierre Jouyet, French ambassador to the UK, which said: \u0026ldquoI offer you my warmest congratulations on this high honour, which recognises your military engagement and steadfast involvement in the liberation of France during the Second World War.  \u0026ldquoAs we contemplate this Europe of peace, we must never forget the heroes like you who came from Britain and the Commonwealth to begin the liberation of Europe by liberating France.  But Mr Smith insists he was just a young man doing a job.  He said: \u0026ldquoI didn\u0026rsquot know how the war was going, I didn\u0026rsquot read anything about the war. I was a young lad and I had no fear.  \u0026ldquoI just thought \u0026lsquoget on with it\u0026rsquo.  However, he remembers thinking about how worried his mother would be.  Len\u0026rsquos brothers James and Thomas were also in active service and James was in the D-Day landings. All three came home.  He said: \u0026ldquoWhen we came back my mum was overjoyed, she got three sons back uninjured.  Last year, Mr Smith returned to the Normandy beaches on a British Legion tour organised for veterans.

Education Scotland visited Knox Academy in Haddington at the end of 2016 and told parents that the school needed to \u0026ldquorevisit its \u0026ldquovision and values.  The inspection report, which was released in March last year, highlighted a number of areas in which the school could improve. \u0026lsquoLeadership of change\u0026rsquo and \u0026lsquolearning, teaching and assessment\u0026rsquo were ranked as \u0026lsquosatisfactory\u0026rsquo, while \u0026lsquoensuring wellbeing, equality and inclusion\u0026rsquo was described as \u0026lsquoweak\u0026rsquo.  Inspectors returned to the school 12 months on from the original report for a follow-up inspection, which led to a new report being published on Tuesday.  The inspection team talked to young people at the school and worked closely with the interim headteacher Lauren Rodger, who is returning to North Berwick High School after the summer holidays.  She will be replaced by Susan Cook, currently acting headteacher at Trinity Academy, Edinburgh  Other members of staff were also spoken to, to hear about the steps the school had taken to improve on areas previously identified in the original inspection.  Education Scotland noted the following key improvements:  - The interim headteacher has provided effective leadership in taking forward work to secure improvements, including a review of the school values  - Staff have developed a range of policies to improve practice in equalities and inclusion, including a new safeguarding policy  - The recently created Pupil Support Faculty is now better placed to address the needs of young people, and those with social, emotional and behavioural needs in particular  - The school has made progress in establishing a more positive learning environment for all.  The report did note that there were still some improvements to be made.  Issues highlighted included using evidence from self-evaluation activities to ensure consistency in learning and teaching across the school reviewing the purpose of the pupil support base to ensure there was a greater focus on learning for the young people using it and ensuring there was a whole school approach to equalities and inclusion.  Fiona Robertson, head of education at East Lothian Council, praised staff at the school for their efforts.  She said: \u0026ldquoI am pleased that Education Scotland acknowledges that Knox Academy has made important progress since the last inspection, and I would like to thank all the staff and pupils for their hard work and commitment in making these improvements.  \u0026ldquoIt is really encouraging that the positive relationships between pupils and teachers, and the fact that almost all young people recognise the value of learning in their lives, was noted.  \u0026ldquoThis is a strong basis for ensuring that the school continues to be a positive learning environment for staff and pupils alike.  And she added: \u0026ldquoWe will continue to work with the school and Education Scotland to make further improvements, and to working with Susan Cook, our new headteacher, who joins the school in August.  Education Scotland will continue to work with East Lothian Council regarding the school\u0026rsquos capacity to improve and will return to carry out another inspection within 18 months."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7898185.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"Thousands oppose Dunbar town centre parking charge plans","story":"              MORE than 2,000 people have signed a petition against the idea of parking charges being introduced on Dunbar High Street.  A public consultation looking at potential parking solutions throughout East Lothian came to a close last month.  Meetings and workshops were held throughout the county by East Lothian Council, including one in Dunbar Royal British Legion.  A number of suggestions were put forward, including for a disc parking system where visitors to the busy street would set a disc showing when they had parked.  Another idea being explored is parking charges \u0026ndash but that has met with the opposition of Dunbar Trades\u0026rsquo Association (DTA).  Philip Mellor, DTA chairman, said that the group \u0026ldquostrongly oppose the introduction of parking charges.  A petition, which was put in various businesses in the town, has attracted more than 2,000 signatures.  Mr Mellor added: \u0026ldquoThe DTA feel introducing parking charges to High Street and other key off-street parking areas will have a detrimental effect on our High Street and the local economy.  \u0026ldquoThe current system since the introduction of traffic wardens has already addressed concerns around space for shoppers on High Street and it now seems counterintuitive to then introduce a measure which will drive more customers away to out-of-town developments.  \u0026ldquoWhilst parking during heavy summer visitor times can be difficult, it is very few special event days where parking is congested enough to even consider parking charges viable the majority of the time parking is available and this potential charge seems to be nothing more than a money-raising exercise at the expense yet again of already-struggling independent business owners.  A spokesman for East Lothian Council said \u0026ldquoall responses would be taken into consideration as it looked to develop a strategy.  He added: \u0026ldquoThe draft Local Transport Strategy (LTS) sets out ways in which the council can meet both national and local objectives sustainably, while supporting the local economy and environment.  \u0026ldquoOur consultation on the draft LTS recently closed and we are grateful to everyone who responded or attended one of our workshops. We are grateful for and value all responses, which will be taken into consideration as we look to agree a strategy which meets future needs in and around our communities."},{"url":null,"title":"Port Seton Lottery winner climbs Ben Nevis for highest champagne spray","story":"              LOTTERY millionaire John Edmond has undertaken a suitably large-scale celebration to mark the creation of the National Lottery\u0026rsquos 5,000th millionaire. . . by climbing Ben Nevis to conduct the UK\u0026rsquos highest Lottery champagne spray!  John, 35, from Port Seton, won \u0026pound1 million in the EuroMillions draw on June 26, 2015, but he remained in his job as a roofer, insisting he wanted to keep working.  He took on the challenge to climb more than 4,400 feet and faced treacherous weather conditions to mark the Lottery\u0026rsquos milestone and tick off a lifelong dream from his bucket list.  It comes as new research reveals that more than half of the millionaires are now spending more on experiences rather than possessions.  Looking at their shopping trends across time, out have gone designer watches, ride-on mowers, racehorses and conservatories, and in have come protecting woodlands, paying university fees and bar/games rooms.  John said: \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquove always wanted to climb Ben Nevis so when the opportunity arose, I was up for the challenge.  \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom not an avid hill walker, nor do I have much climbing experience, so I was a bit nervous as I knew I would have my work cut out \u0026ndash but excited to be part of this once-in-a-lifetime celebration.  \u0026ldquoScotland was looking glorious in the sunshine when we initially left ground level however, the conditions quickly changed as we reached the halfway mark \u0026ndash typical Scottish weather!  \u0026ldquoVisibility was poor, I couldn\u0026rsquot see two or three feet in front of me, and the wind speeds were averaging 40mph.  \u0026ldquoThe heavy snow on the ground made it more challenging \u0026ndash but to me, it was all part of the adventure.  \u0026ldquoWith tough climbing, there were moments I was unsure if I was going to make it to the top, so I can\u0026rsquot put into words how I felt when I finally reached the summit.  \u0026ldquoTo know I was standing on the UK\u0026rsquos highest peak was an unbelievable achievement, made all the better with a chilled glass of champagne in my hand.  \u0026ldquoI was honoured that the National Lottery asked me to participate in this opportunity out of all the millionaires in Scotland \u0026ndash it\u0026rsquos certainly one I will never forget.

Plans to close Haddington Infant School and King\u0026rsquos Meadow Primary School were revealed last autumn.  East Lothian Council intends to create a new primary school, operating from the existing school buildings, which will cover nursery through to primary seven. The proposal was approved by East Lothian Council in April after a public consultation. It has now also been approved by the Scottish Government.  Combined, the two schools currently have a school roll of about 700 pupils. However, it remains unclear who the new headteacher for the primary school, which is yet to be named, will be.  Current headteacher Seonaid McGillivray is set to be appointed at another as yet unnamed school in the county, with the final details expected to be tied up within a matter of days.  Fiona Robertson, head of education at East Lothian Council, said: \u0026ldquoWe believe that the decision to establish one new primary school, operating under a single management structure, offers the best solution to not only developing a stronger and more cohesive curriculum, but that local children will benefit from improved progression planning and transition as they progress from infant to upper stage.  \u0026ldquoOur education service will work closely with our current headteacher Mrs McGillivray, and the chairs of both parent councils, to recruit a headteacher for the newly established school.

Five retail units are planned for a site at Gateside previously earmarked for a Sainsbury\u0026rsquos supermarket and petrol station.  The site, which totals about 60,000 sq ft, could be made up of units ranging from 7,500 sq ft to 20,000 sq ft in size.  Alastair Dickie, development director with Ediston Real Estates, which now owns the site, attended the town\u0026rsquos community council meeting on Tuesday, one week before plans are unveiled to the public.  He told members the proposal was for the site to include three food retailers, with the other two units including \u0026ldquoa household-type retail business and a coffee drive-through facility.  However, he was keeping tight-lipped on the identity of the businesses until legal agreements were in place.  Mr Dickie hoped planning permission for the site, off Oak Tree Roundabout west of Haddington, could be achieved by the end of the year.  He said: \u0026ldquoIf we submit an application in August, we would hope. . . we would hopefully have a consent in December or January next year.  \u0026ldquoWe could be on site quarter one of 2019.  It is then hoped that the retailers could be trading in the lead-up to Christmas that year or early in 2020.  The development, which has been described as \u0026ldquoEast Lothian\u0026rsquos first retail park, will involve in the region of \u0026pound14 million investment, with 150 jobs potentially created, as well as those during the construction process.  It has already been revealed that talks are ongoing with \u0026ldquoa number of major retailers who will be new to East Lothian.  Concerns have been expressed by a number of retailers in the town centre that the creation of a retail park on the outskirts would be detrimental to their business.  But Mr Dickie, who previously lived in the town and continues to stay in the county, was hopeful the additional retailers would encourage people to remain in the area rather than heading further afield to retail parks in Edinburgh.  The proposals are on display to the public from 2pm to 7pm on Tuesday at the John Gray Centre.  The developer is also continuing to make progress at a second Haddington site for retail development \u0026ndashat Harperdean, between the A1 and the A199, east of Aberlady Road.

The new scheme offers people an opportunity to support Our Community Energy \u0026ndash a partnership between not-for-profit Scottish firm Our Power and Mongoose Energy, which manages community energy assets \u0026ndash and hopes to find investors in the county.  They say that the site at Pogbie Windfarm \u0026ndash already home to the turbines \u0026ndash will create enough energy to power 7,200 homes and believe that, when they combine it with a second site in Berwickshire, the scheme will raise an estimated \u0026pound1.9 million in surplus profit over 25 years.  Our Power said that profit from the wind turbines it takes over would then be used to keep energy prices down, helping people who are struggling with the costs.  They need to raise just over \u0026pound3 million for the project, which covers both sites, and community groups and individuals are being invited to invest in bonds and shares to raise the money needed to get the project up and running, with investments ranging from \u0026pound500 to \u0026pound100,000.  Andrew Smith, Our Community Energy acting chairperson, said: \u0026ldquoFuel poverty is a huge issue for Scotland and we\u0026rsquore proud to be launching such an important fundraising opportunity to directly tackle it.  \u0026ldquoInvesting with a social purpose is something close to the hearts of many Scots, and these bond and equity offers provide the chance to have a huge impact locally.  \u0026ldquoThese offers aim to support those who struggle to afford sufficiently heated homes, as well as providing investors with an exciting new option which not only targets a significant social impact but a positive environmental one too.  \u0026ldquoHowever with these types of investments there are some risks and funds are not readily realisable.  \u0026ldquoInvestors should note that capital is at risk and returns are not guaranteed.  A fuel poor household is defined as one which needs to spend more than 10 per cent of its income on all fuel use and to heat its home to an adequate standard of warmth.  Last year, the East Lothian Poverty Commission found that almost half of local pensioners were forced to spend more than 10 per cent of their income on energy bills.  Mark Kenber, CEO of Mongoose Energy, added: \u0026ldquoWith the majority of Scots recognising the critical level that fuel poverty has reached, it is now more important than ever for investors to put their money into causes that work for the social good, not just their own.  \u0026ldquoOur Community Energy not only gives investors the potential to earn competitive interest rates on their money, but also the opportunity to support the wider Scottish community.

A pressure group called \u0026lsquoBowls for Gullane\u0026rsquo was established on Facebook in the wake of concerns that the village\u0026rsquos bowling club \u0026ndash with a membership of only about 30 \u0026ndash was to be sold to developers.  Councillor Jeremy Findlay, ward member and former chairman of Gullane Area Community Council, said: \u0026ldquoAll three ward councillors are behind the campaign to save the club and we hope that the members understand the feeling in the village.  \u0026ldquoI understand that the committee own the club and it would be the members who benefit from any potential sale.  About 50 residents gathered outside the bowling club on Monday evening to show their displeasure at the possible loss of the club.  The group told the Courier they had had hundreds of offers of support.  Catherine MacKenzie said: \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquove had people phone up, email and text us \u0026ndash and face-to-face \u0026ndash to tell us that they\u0026rsquore willing to become a member.  \u0026ldquoSome of them don\u0026rsquot live locally, or won\u0026rsquot be able to bowl, but they are willing to pay the membership fees.

Billy Mellors, the county\u0026rsquos bowls development officer, said: \u0026ldquoThe overwhelming support from the local community indicates to me the future of Gullane Bowling Club can be sustained if the current members accept it.  Many locals have tried to sign up as members but have been turned away by the club, it has been claimed.  Another member of the group said: \u0026ldquoWhat has shocked us as a group is how many people have been refused membership in recent years \u0026ndash young and old have come forward with their personal experience of being turned away.  Mr Mellors added: \u0026ldquoTime will tell on the way the club want to go but we all hope a common sense approach is taken to preserve this community facility.  East Lothian MSP Iain Gray met representatives of the Bowls for Gullane group last week and is keen to find a solution to ensure the club\u0026rsquos survival.  He said: \u0026ldquoThis is an unfortunate situation Gullane has lost too many local assets recently, so every effort should be made to avoid losing another. I did meet with representatives of the campaign and have said that I will support them in trying to find a way the land, and preferably bowling too, can remain part of the village community.  Ian McMillan, CEO of Bowls Scotland, said that he was \u0026ldquodelighted to see local residents lend their support to the campaign to save the 116-year-old club.  He added: \u0026ldquoI would encourage all in the village to support their historic club, get on the green, enjoy the great game of bowls and ensure future generations can benefit from the opportunity to play an accessible, inclusive sport. Bowls Scotland fully supports the work being undertaken to keep bowls an important part of Gullane\u0026rsquos community fabric.

Attempts by the Courier to speak to Michael Baxter, vice-president and secretary at the bowling club, were unsuccessful this week. In April, Mr Baxter told us: \u0026ldquoThere are not enough members to support the running of the club.  He had said then that the club was \u0026ldquotrying to find a solution but that it was not viable to continue with a dwindling membership.

I feel so proud to be performing it at the final and I hope we do it justice and get it the recognition it deserves.\"  Holly Edwards, another S6 pupil, said: \"The play is extremely relevant and gives a taste of real life and what really goes on at schools that have such a large social media influence.  \"The competition means a lot to us as a group and the thought of getting to the final is so exciting, we want to show people what this play is all about. After all our hard work we are all so happy to be in the final!  Heather Fortune, also S6, added: \"Life today as a high school student is displayed perfectly through the contrast between the boys\u0026rsquo reaction to the photo and the girls\u0026rsquo reaction to it.\"  And S4 pupil Abbey Greenwood: \"I have really enjoyed working on this play, I think it really brings people together and opens up discussions on how we treat each other in society.\""},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7930043.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"Calls to tackle Edinburgh Bypass gridlock as tram system to Musselburgh mooted","story":"              MUSSELBURGH\u0026rsquoS MSP has backed calls for improvements to the Edinburgh City Bypass \u0026ndash while suggesting extending a tram or light rail system to the Honest Toun.  Colin Beattie stressed that \u0026ldquoradical thinking needed to be done to create a solution, highlighting a possible extension of a tram or light rail system out to Musselburgh.  During a recent Holyrood debate, he said: \u0026ldquoPeople meet the queues of traffic heading on to the bypass on the main roads around my constituency before they are even near the bypass. This causes more congestion and more air pollution.  Mr Beattie later said: \u0026ldquoYou can go along the road at any time of the day and there are queues of traffic, mainly at Sheriffhall Roundabout.  \u0026ldquoIt is important that when the Government are looking at all the possible changes required to the bypass, all options are considered. The main priority should be that it is cost-efficient and done as soon as possible.  \u0026ldquoIt may be that it is more economic to extend a tram or light rail system out to the main population centres such as Musselburgh than to take on the eye-watering cost of enlarging the A720. This would also benefit the environment and be much faster than using road transport.  \u0026ldquoClearly more radical thinking needs to be done on creating a sustainable solution. I am not convinced that simply replicating a system which moves traffic speedily and efficiently into new choke points is the answer.  Miles Briggs, Lothian region MSP who led the Parliamentary debate, said: \u0026ldquoThe transport information company Inrix in late 2016 identified the bypass as the most congested trunk road outside London, with four of the UK\u0026rsquos worst bottlenecks.  \u0026ldquoI continue to be contacted by frustrated constituents and businesspeople who face frequent delays when using the bypass to commute or transport goods, especially but not exclusively at peak times or when there is an accident on the route. Many drivers tell me their experience is that these tailbacks and traffic jams are becoming more and more regular.  He said that while proposed work at Sheriffhall would be an important improvement, he added: \u0026ldquoIt is only one part of what needs to be a far broader, long-term and coordinated programme of improvements to the bypass which will ensure traffic can keep moving in the decades ahead.  \u0026ldquoThis means looking at innovative solutions, assessing whether extra lanes will be needed, looking at the possible use of hard shoulders in some situations and utilising technology so the bypass can become a smart motorway.  Mr Briggs called on the Scottish Government to take forward a feasibility study into widening the city bypass and new options to address the growing congestion.  A Transport Scotland spokesperson said: \u0026ldquoThe Edinburgh and South East Scotland City Region Deal includes investment of up to \u0026pound120m in the A720 city bypass for the grade separation of Sheriffhall Roundabout and \u0026pound20 million investment in public transport infrastructure in west Edinburgh.  \u0026ldquoThis investment will improve journey reliability and safety for all users and support significant planned investment in Edinburgh and South East Scotland.  \u0026ldquoThe Scottish Government remains committed to undertaking the improvements at the Sheriffhall junction at the earliest opportunity. We are continuing to progress the detailed design development and assessment of the preferred option and expect to publish draft orders in 2019."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7930076.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"Haddington pub seeking new owners","story":"              A TOWN centre pub which changed its name less than a year ago is on the lookout for new people to run it.

The premises at Olive Bank Retail Park has a completely new layout and design, including the installation of new fascia and frontage, digital signage, LED lighting, improved in-store navigation and new checkouts that are quicker and easier to use.  The alcohol side of the business was discussed at a recent meeting of East Lothian Council\u0026rsquos licensing board in Haddington.  An increase in the display of alcohol of 8.8 square metres was proposed and given the green light by the committee\u0026rsquos councillors.  A detailed statement was provided to the committee which outlined the revamp both inside and outside the shop.  It read: \u0026ldquoThe result will be a modern, bright, accessible and customer-friendly store with a focus on quality. This will transcend all ranges and lines including alcohol.  \u0026ldquoWhilst alcohol is very much ancillary to the overall offer, there is a desire to incorporate premium wines and craft beers.  In a bid to prevent items being stolen, members heard how various measures were being taken to cut down on the chances of theft.  New CCTV has been installed throughout the store, while various bottles of alcohol are only accessed through a member of staff opening a locked cabinet.

Scottish Labour leader Richard Leonard MSP last week met East Lothian Labour Party campaigners at Holyrood as they delivered a petition signed by more than 1,000 people to Kevin Stewart MSP.  While Councillor Lachlan Bruce, ward member for Preston, Seton, Gosford was joined by South of Scotland MSP Michelle Ballantyne, both Conservative, as they sent letters to Mr Stewart calling for the same action (see image inset).  The campaign comes after the minister called in a planning application by Inch Cape Offshore Ltd (ICOL) to build a substation \u0026ndash which would bring energy ashore from a planned offshore wind farm \u0026ndash on a large section of the site, which was recently purchased by East Lothian Council from ScottishPower.  That sparked cross-party condemnation from county politicians, who fear it could jeopardise local plans to create jobs and boost the economy on the site.  Mr Leonard added his signature to the Hands Off Cockenzie petition before it was submitted.  Iain Gray (Lab), East Lothian MSP said: \u0026ldquoMinisters claim the call-in is because the site is of national importance, but even the leader of the SNP Group on East Lothian Council has condemned the decision as unnecessary.  \u0026ldquoBy signing our petition in such large numbers, local people have sent a clear message they want East Lothian to decide on decisions about the future of the site.  Meanwhile, Mr Bruce said he had asked Mr Stewart to send the decision back to the council. He said: \u0026ldquoI think it is only right that this decision is made locally by the council on behalf of local residents.

Painted on a 60ft by 40ft wall overlooking the city\u0027s Clutha bar, it features a portrait of Mackintosh looking through a stained-glass window.  The street art was commissioned by Radisson RED and designed and created by Art Pistol Projects and well-known Glasgow street artist Rogue-one as a gift to the city.  As part of the project, Radisson RED has donated \u0026pound1,000 to The Clutha Trust, the charity set up after 10 people died when a police helicopter crashed onto the roof of the pub in November 2013.  Michael Weston, curator at Radisson RED hotel in Glasgow, said: \"After opening our doors in April, we wanted to give something that showed our commitment to the local art scene as well as the city of Glasgow itself.  \"It was important to us that the mural represented a key piece of Glasgow\u0027s history, so commissioning a mural of one of the city\u0027s most iconic artists, Charles Rennie Mackintosh, was perfect.  \"It is a fitting tribute to one of Glasgow\u0027s greatest talents in his 150th anniversary year - and I\u0027d encourage everyone to come see it.\"  Born on June 7 1868, Mackintosh trained as an architect and went on to create much-admired buildings including the Glasgow School of Art and Scotland Street School in Glasgow.  The mural was given the go-ahead following a planning row after an objection from a neighbouring business.  Alan Crossan, owner of the Clutha bar, said: \"This mural is a fantastic piece of artwork and a fantastic donation to the Clutha Trust.\"  Bobby McNamara, known as Rogue-one, is renowned for his photo-realistic style and is behind a number of artworks in Glasgow, including Mitchell Street\u0027s floating taxi.  Mr McNamara said: \"From the original design sketch to the completion of the mural, it\u0027s been hard work but of course great fun.  \"Using scaffolding to access the wall was awkward at times as it\u0027s hard to see what you\u0027re doing, but I pushed on utilising my skills and experience. In the end I think I achieved something special.\"  Ali Smith, founder of Art Pistol Projects, said: \"Mackintosh is a bit of a global superstar so we had to get this one right.  \"Stepping away from the wall now it really feels like a special one, a just portrayal of such an iconic and well-loved figure.  \"Everyone that\u0027s been involved deserves a big thanks.\""},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7936576.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"Singing for England  Musician   s rallying call for Scotland to get behind their old rivals in World Cup","story":"              A SCOTTISH musician has issued a rallying call for his countrymen to get behind their old rivals in the World Cup.

The BAFTA award-winning musician says that the majority of Scots have been supportive of the song.                         .bc-player-rkgvgWjWCG_default .vjs-tech { position: static !important }                       .bc-player-rkgvgWjWCG_default { height: auto !important width: 100% !important}                       .vjs-playlist-description { display: none }                       .vjs-big-play-button { top: 0pxleft: 0pxright: 0pxbottom: 0pxmargin: auto }                       .vjs-mouse.vjs-playlist { background-color: #f7f4f1color: #000min-width: auto }                       .vjs-playlist cite { overflow: initialtext-overflow: initialwhite-space: initialfont-weight: 600font-size: 16px }                       .vjs-mouse.vjs-playlist time { color: #fff }                       cite.vjs-playlist-name { text-align: left }                       .story-credits { margin-top: 20px }                       #liveMultiHide .vjs-dock-description { display: none }                       .vjs-playlist-thumbnail { margin-right: 10px !IMPORTANT }                        /* Style the overlay */                        /* Hide the overlay */                        .hide-countdown {                            display: none                        }                        .hide-overlay {                            display: none                        }                        /* Style the overlay */                        .vjs-overlay,                        .vjs-overlay.vjs-overlay-top {                            position: absolute                            top: 0px                            left: 0px                        }                        .vjs-overlay p {                            width: 100px                            background-color: #000000                            color: #fff                            padding: 10px                            margin: 0                            margin-bottom: 0                            border-radius: 0px                            text-align: left                        }                        .popout-player {                            position: relative                            width: 340px                            margin-bottom: 50px                            transition-property: all                            transition-duration: 100ms                            transition-timing-function: ease-in-out                        }                                                           width=\"100%\"                data-account=\"64298557001\"                data-player=\"rkgvgWjWCG\"                data-embed=\"default\"                data-video-id=\"5798536909001\"                class=\"video-js\"                playsinline                data-random-id=\"1113075630\"                                controls  And Chris says that any of his compatriots opposed to his support of the Three Lions should speak to the owners of whisky distilleries in the north of the country, who enjoy the benefits of their strong English customer base.  The father-of-one said: \"I came at it with the idea of how much Englishness can I manage to cram into one England world cup song?  \"It made for a challenge and an opportunity for a kind of humble gesture of support to our friends south of the wall.  \"It\u0027s been a surprise that the song has gotten such a brilliant response up here from all kinds of Scots who rightly feel that what\u0027s good for England is only good for us.  \"Many of us have English friends and family, and many of us go on holiday, or to university or to work in England. That works in reverse order too obviously.  \"I\u0027ve done this with a humble heart, trying to support our fellow islanders.  \"The cultural and economic links between Scotland and England couldn\u0027t be deeper.  \"To the tiny minority of Scots who get spiteful about the English football team, I\u0027d say go and have a chat with the whisky distilleries up north and ask them how they\u0027d feel if they lost their English customer base.\"  The singer-songwriter won a BAFTA for his music in the thriller film Killer.  He has also written promotional material for Creative Scotland, Jura Whisky and the World Health Organisation.  It is not the first time that a Scot has written a World Cup song for their neighbours south of the border with Lonnie Donegan penning the 1966 song World Cup Willy.

He added: \"Scotland will make it into the World Cup soon enough and you can be sure I\u0027ll be on the case with a Scottish world cup song when that day comes.\"  The Football Association in England has not commissioned an official squad single to mark the competition despite previous efforts such as World in Motion proving to be very popular.

The 53-year-old has gone on trial accused of putting his hand down a woman\u0027s trousers and touching her bottom as they danced at her hen night in Atik nightclub in Edinburgh last June.  The woman, who cannot be identified, said she saw Leslie when they entered the club and recognised him from television, particularly Blue Peter.  Leslie is on trial at Edinburgh Sheriff Court under his real name John Stott and denies the charge.  The accuser was the first to give evidence and said she had spoken to Leslie during the night about football, some of his ex-girlfriends and speculation he could appear in TV programme Celebrity Big Brother.  While dancing with friends and a stag party later in the night she said Leslie approached her and said \"be careful, you\u0027re getting married\".  She said she thought he was being \"protective\" and suggested they dance together.  Leslie had a hand on her waist and she had a hand on his shoulder, the court heard.  The woman said: \"We\u0027d been going in circles then he pulled me closer.  \"I did feel uncomfortable but thought I was maybe reading too much into it.\"  She said she gave her friend \"a look\" to make her aware she was uncomfortable, adding: \"After that I felt his hand go down my trousers at the back.  \"I didn\u0027t know how to react. I made even more of a look to my friend because I knew I needed to be out of that situation.\"  She said Leslie touched her skin but was not sure if he had put his hand beneath her underwear.  The woman told the court a friend pulled her away and then danced briefly with her hen party to \"pretend it hadn\u0027t happened\".  She added: \"But then I got really upset so moved to the booth.\"  \"I asked my friend something like \u0027why did he think he could do that or what did I do to make him do that?\u0027\"  She went outside with a friend and her sister-in-law who said they should tell someone, the court heard.  She said they told a female bouncer and later a police officer at the nightclub who took her to a station to make a statement.  CCTV of the pair dancing in the busy club was played to the court and the woman said it could not be seen exactly when the alleged incident happened.  Asked by fiscal depute Fiona Nairn how she feels now, the woman said it had impacted on her relationship with her husband, friends and work.  She said: \"It\u0027s been one of the toughest years of my life when it should have been the happiest.\"  Under cross examination by defence lawyer Derek Ogg QC, she cried and said: \"I don\u0027t know why anyone would think I made this up. I have nothing to gain from it.\"  Mr Ogg put it to the woman the CCTV footage showed the dance with Leslie ended \"voluntarily\" rather than with a friend\u0027s intervention.  She said: \"That\u0027s not how I see it. I just wanted out of that situation.\"  It was also established that the woman was taken home by two police officers and given paper bags to place her clothing in with no forensic protocol in place.  Forensic scientist Sandra Coupar-White told the court she examined the woman\u0027s trousers, pants and tutu for potential DNA.  She said a mixed profile was found on the trouser waistband likely made up of touch DNA from the woman, Leslie and two other \"minor contributors\".  She told Ms Nairn that DNA could be passed indirectly from holding hands during by dancing but said direct contact with the inside of the waistband was more likely.  The results from the pants and tutu were inconclusive, Ms Coupar-White said.  Mr Ogg questioned if it was possible for Leslie\u0027s DNA to be passed from one item of clothing to another.  The witness said: \"Secondary transfer is possible.\"  The trial before Sheriff Adrian Cottam continues on Friday."},{"url":null,"title":"Schools in Finland set to learn from Scotland s curriculum","story":"              IT HAS been easily the most controversial innovation in Scottish education over the past decade.  Critics of Curriculum for Excellence (CfE) have argued it has reduced subject choice and ushered in a culture of red tape and bureaucracy.  But now officials from one of the world\u0027s best education systems are travelling to Scotland to learn about the benefits of CfE, which seeks to shift the focus away from exam cramming and develop wider skills such as problem-solving and group working.  Under a new partnership, seven schools from Espoo, the second largest city in Finland, are to be linked with seven schools in East Lothian with teachers and pupils given the opportunity to collaborate and share their expertise and experience.  International tables shows Finnish children perform extremely well in literacy, numeracy and science even though they start school at an older age and spend fewer hours a year in the classroom than their counterparts elsewhere in Europe.  However, the country is implementing a new national curriculum and wants to learn from the experiences of schools in Scotland.  The visit was brokered by the General Teaching Council for Scotland whose Chief Executive, Kenneth Muir is an expert on the Finnish education system.  He said: \"We are delighted to have been able to bring together schools in Scotland to partner with schools in Espoo which is part of the highest performing education area in Finland.  \"Usually the world looks to Finland for educational excellence, but here is an example of Finland looking to Scotland.  \"This confirms the high quality that exists in many Scottish schools and proves that we need to offer more positivity about our education system and the opportunities afforded children and young people here.\"  Eeva-Kaisa Ikonen, Espoo\u0027s superintendent of education, said Finish schools were looking to shift emphasis in the curriculum to create more of a focus on collaborative learning.  She said: \"We have been impressed with the Scottish school improvement and professional learning programmes as well as the practices for implementing CfE.  \"Espoo greets our new partnership with East Lothian schools and looks forward to shared learning experiences on these and other mutually significant themes.  Fiona Robertson, head of education at East Lothian Council, added: \"We are very proud of our schools in East Lothian and I\u0026rsquom delighted that our staff will have this fantastic opportunity to share expertise and collaborate with their counterparts from Espoo.  \"The fact that we have the opportunity to be involved in this partnership is a reflection of the quality of our schools, our hard work and determination of all in East Lothian to secure the best outcomes from our children.\"  John Swinney, the Deputy First Minister, also welcomed the development.  \u0026ldquoIt is extremely welcome that the excellence within our schools in Scotland is being acknowledged by such a high performing and respected nation like Finland,\" he said.  \u0026ldquoI am especially pleased to hear of their interest in CfE the work currently going on to improve the life chances of all our children and young people.  \u0026ldquoI am sure this will be a useful and informative experience for all the schools involved and I look forward to finding out more about how the project is progressing.\"  In September last year a major critic of Scotland\u0026rsquos curriculum warned standards were being \u0026lsquodumbed down\u0026rsquo since its introduction in 2010.  Professor Lindsay Paterson, from Edinburgh University, said CfE lacked \u0026ldquoacademic rigour and could be \u0026ldquodisastrous for school pupils.  While recent international rankings caused concern placing Scotland as \u0026ldquoaverage more pupils are gaining Highers than ever before and the number of Scots getting to university is at record levels."},{"url":null,"title":"Expert  Iconic Mackintosh building can be saved","story":"              The iconic Mackintosh building can be rebuilt using world-leading digital blueprints of the masterpiece, a leading expert has claimed.  Despite being ravaged by fire at the weekend, leading architectural conservationist, Professor Miles Glendinning, believes the Glasgow School of Art building can be completely restored - it is just a question of finding the money to do it.  Following the fire in 2014, Historic Environment Scotland worked with the school to draw up a digital record of the site using photographs and drawings, with exacting detail down to the nearest millimetre.  Professor Glendinning, director of the Scottish Centre for Conservation Studies, claims this \"astonishing\" record means that despite the damage being far worse this time round, the building is in a much better position for restoration.  Speaking to Good Morning Scotland, he argued that the structure was of such significance that it should be restored, despite the financial barriers.  \"In terms of conservation and restoration, we\u0027re funnily enough a lot better off this time because of a very remarkable recording project that GSA undertook after the last fire,\" he said.  \"The building still exists digitally, even if the inside is for the moment physically absent.  \"It\u0027s a digital recording and reconstruction of the whole building down to the nearest millimetre outside and in, using photos and measured drawings.  \"This is kind of a world first for Scotland and it means the start of the restoration work doesn\u0027t need to involve questions over whether it can be done at all.  \"However bad it looks now, the problem now is not about that, but about when and how it is to be paid for.\"  Professor Glendinning, who chairs architectural conservation at Edinburgh College of Art, said Scotland could look to other countries for examples of ruined buildings being brought back to life - including Germany where a church destroyed during World War II was rebuilt after 50 years.  Frauenkirche in Dresden was reduced to a pile of rubble but was reopened in 2005 after a 10-year restoration project.  Mr Glendinning said: \"As far as the physical damage is concerned, it does look very bad, but it\u0027s not as bad as some other cases we\u0027ve seen in recent history.  \"It\u0027s really a matter of how long it will take and where the money\u0027s going to come from.\"  He added that he would be \"very surprised\" if a decision was taken to demolish the building, saying he believes it is more likely that the existing walls will be reinforced.  \"It may look absolutely daunting at the moment, but there have been a lot of buildings worse than this that have been successfully restored - and they didn\u0027t have this digital record.\"  Fiona Hyslop, cabinet secretary for Culture, Tourism and External Affairs, said she has already been in touch with Historic Environment Scotland about the digitisation and has asked officials there to be involved in looking at possible options for the site.  Speaking on Sunday Politics, she said: \"I\u0027ve asked for Historic Environment Scotland, who have worked very closely with Glasgow School of Art over the last four years, to assess... what might be able to happen going forward.  \"They have world-leading digitisation. They digitally recorded everything within the days and weeks after the last fire.  \"But the severity of this is very serious indeed, so I\u0027m not giving any commitments at this stage.\"  She explained that firefighters are still at the scene and building control staff and fire investigators have not been able to access the building yet.  Ms Hyslop added: \"The Scottish Government stands ready to do what it can to help, as we have done in the past.  \"We\u0027ll have to identify what the possibilities are going forward, but we\u0027ve got to be very realistic.\""},{"url":null,"title":"Tributes paid to music venue with colourful beginnings","story":"              Built in 1875, the ABC venue has been a key venue arts and music venue in the centre of Glasgow for more than 130 years.  It first opened as the Diorama, a theatrical experience invented by the French in the early 1800s, featuring canvas depictions of historic events.  It was then completely transformed to become Hubners Ice Skating Palace in 1885 and was one of the first buildings in Glasgow to have electricity.  It was here the first Scottish film \u0026lsquoThe Departure of the Columba from Rothesay Pier\u0026rsquo and Glasgow\u0026rsquos first public film was screened at The Skating Palace in 1896, which was commemorated by a plaque outside.  It\u0026rsquos eclectic history then continued in its later incarnation as a circus, when it was renamed the Hippodrome and became home to the popular \u0026lsquoHengler\u0026rsquos Circus\u0026rsquo, which moved its premises from Wellington Street.  Films were also shown here regularly in the off-season.  In 1927, it reverted back to a dance hall, the Waldorf Palais, before the Associated British Cinema Chain (ABC) took it over.  Designed by architect Charles J McNair and seating a total of 2,359 people, the Regal opened in November 1929 as ABC\u0026rsquos flagship cinema in Glasgow.  A smaller auditorium, Scotland\u0026rsquos first post-war new cinema the ABC 2, was added in 1967, when the Regal was renamed ABC 1.  In 1979, the two cinemas were rebuilt as the five-screen ABC Film Centre, however all the screens were closed in 1999.  It was subsequently earmarked as Glasgow\u0026rsquos newest music venue with renovations beginning in 2002.  The ABC reopened its doors in 2005 with a concert from American pop-punk band Sum 41. It became the O2 ABC in 2009.  The fate of the iconic building now remains unknown after the Glasgow School of Art fire also engulfed the building.  The Scottish Fire and Rescue Service confirmed there had been \u0026ldquoextensive damage to the venue, with aerial images showing its roof caved in.  As of Sunday night, around 50 firefighters and six fire engines were still in attendance with \"dampening down operations\" ongoing throughout the day and into the evening.  In a statement on their website, O2 ABC bosses thanked the emergency services for \u0026ldquotheir rapid and effective action.  It said: \"As reported in the media, there has been a significant fire at The Glasgow School of Art Mackintosh Building on Friday 15 June 2018 that has affected adjoining buildings, including ours here at O2 ABC Glasgow on Sauchiehall Street.  The area was promptly evacuated as a precaution, everyone is safe, and there are no reported casualties from any nearby properties.  It then announced a number of cancellations over the weekend and said it would post updates regarding all forthcoming shows on the individual event pages of its website.  Many have paid tribute to the\u0026nbspvenue in the wake of the blaze.  Geoff Ellis, CEO of DF Concerts and Events, said: \u0026ldquoAlong with the shocking news about the GSA fire, we were devastated to learn of the damage to the O2 ABC venue which, as well as being an iconic building in itself, plays a very important role on the touring circuit.  \"We have had some truly wonderful concerts there with acts such as Arctic Monkeys, Adele,\u0026nbspKendrick Lamar,\u0026nbspPaolo Nutini\u0026nbspand\u0026nbspDua Lipa\u0026nbspto name just a few that have quickly established this wonderful venue as part of the cultural fabric of Glasgow.  \"Whilst it is good to know that there are no casualties, our hearts go out to colleagues at the venue who work so hard, as well as to the GSA community.  ScottishCinemas.org, which archives pictures of cinemas across Scotland, said it was \"sad to see the severe damage\" to the venue.  Author and rapper Darren \u0026ldquoLoki McGarvey said: \u0026ldquoI hope the O2 ABC venue is not overlooked in the aftermath of this fire.  \u0026ldquoIt was a world class music venue, used by thousands of people every month.  \u0026ldquoAlso a great platform for local artists to get a shot on the big stage supporting international acts. A very special place.  Former Hue and Cry singer Pat Kane said the fire was a \"double hit\", adding \"both of them two of the most magical interiors I\u0026rsquove ever been in (the latter with so many triumphant @hueandcry nights).\"  US-based singer Beth Ditto, who performed at the venue last month, tweeted \"So sorry Glasgow, everyone at the school and the lovely staff at O2ABC\"  Singer Billy Bragg said the news about the Glasgow School of Art fire was \"heartbreaking\" before adding: \"Sorry to see that the O2 ABC was also badly damaged as I\u0026rsquove had some good gigs there. Hope the city doesn\u0026rsquot lose this important music venue.\"  A member of Scottish music duo Honeyblood sent a tweet that said: \"My heart is in absolute tatters. Not only the GSofA but O2ABC - a place that holds so many memories for me. Glasgow keep yer chin up.\"  Glasgow-based band Camera Obscura said: \"Absolutely gutted for everyone we know at the O2ABC. We\u0026rsquove played incredible shows there and it\u0026rsquos such a wonderful venue. Heartbroken for the GSofA.\"  The band Glasvegas said: \u0026ldquoGutted to hear about the fire at O2 ABC ... was just a month ago we had a very special night at Stag \u0026amp Dagger. I hope someone saved the disco ball.  Frightened Rabbit band members, who have recently suffered their own loss after the death of lead singer Scott Hutchison last monht, said: \"My heart is breaking reading about the Mackintosh building and the ABC.  \u0026ldquoThere aren\u0026rsquot enough words to describe the admiration for the ridiculously brave and heroic firefighters of Scotland who do this on a daily basis. Glasgow is hurting but will recover.  Gigs in Scotland, which helps promote and sell tickets for gigs, said: \u0026ldquoSending love to all of our colleagues at O2 ABC and of course to Glasgow School of Art. Two Glasgow institutions, both part of the creative backbone of our incredible city.  Still Game actor Gavin Mitchell described it as \u0026ldquoone of the best venues in Glasgow. \u0026ldquoIt now looks like we may have also lost the ABC. That beautiful wooden roof. One of my favourite and best venues in Glasgow.  \u0026ldquoSo many memories, from performing to seeing movies there when I was a kid. This is a truly horrible day for Glasgow."},{"url":null,"title":"Loss of the ABC a critical one for Glasgow and Scotland  39 s live music scene","story":"              IT was built in 1875, and opened as the Diorama, and for more than 130 years it has been a key venue, both for film and music, in the centre of Glasgow.  The loss of the ABC venue, since 2005 a music venue, is a particularly sore one for the Glasgow and Scottish music scene, which has seen several music venues close in recent years.  With a capacious main arena and an intimate second stage, the O2 ABC is one of the reasons that Glasgow was recently boasting about how it could \"unlock its potential\" as a city of music to rival Nashville or New Orleans.  It has a city centre location, an elegant Art Deco Facade, and, latterly, an enormous mirror ball in its main auditorium, and played host to cult bands, pop chart big hitters, rock, pop, dance and funk veterans, and all manner of Scottish talent in the last two decades.  The venue, perhaps an under rated or under-appreciated one, was one of the best in Scotland for its size and location.  The building\u0027s history is an eclectic one - it was at one stage a venue for ice skating, for a circus, then dancehall.  This writer\u0027s first memories of the venue are as a cinema - which it was from 1929 when the Associated British Cinema Chain (ABC) took it over, and called it the Regal.  After a major refurbishment in 2005 it became a major music venue, with more than 400 events staged in its halls annually.  Every year tens of thousands of eager gig goers ascended its (slightly cramped) stairs to the main arena, or utilised its long, old-fashioned bar that looked out onto the busy street below.  Its size was not cavernous, like the Armadillo or the Hydro, but could take sizeable crowds without losing too much an element of intimacy.  While not as iconic as the Barrowlands Ballroom, and not as atmospheric and intimate or sweaty as King Tut\u0027s, it was a key part of the city\u0027s music ecology - it has played host to Adele, Ed Sheeran, Chvrches, The Twilight Sad, Nils Frahm, Sam Smith, Bruno Mars, London Grammar, Royal Blood, Kasabian, Florence and the Machine, Gregory Porter and Bombay Bicycle Club, among many others.  The ABC also had regular club nights, also since 2005.  Its loss - as looks very likely - in the disastrous fire of the past weekend is an undoubted blow to the city\u0027s music scene.  Live music generates \u0026pound160m a year for the city and attracts 1.4 million fans to Glasgow.  Glasgow is an official Unesco City of Music, but a recent report said this title had not been utilised enough, being \"poorly used and largely unrecognised\" - this loss will not help.  The aerial photographs of the destroyed roof of the ABC, next to the burnt-out shell of the Glasgow School of Art, is a dismal one.  Music venues of the size and scale of the ABC are expensive to build, and there are few properties in the city centre that could take over its mantle as an accessible, sizeable, stage for music of all kinds."},{"url":null,"title":"Comment   Let s wipe away the tears and rebuild our beloved Mack ","story":"              LIKE so many Glaswegians, on Friday night I found myself wiping away tears as fire engulfed the Mackintosh building at Glasgow School of Art for the second time in four years.  I have a strong and very personal and relationship with this wonderful, magical, beautiful building. Over the years I\u0026rsquove seen countless exhibitions at the Mack, done various evening classes, danced and laughed with friends. I\u0026rsquove stood quietly and been bowled over again and again by its sheer elegance and practicality.  And by Saturday the initial sadness I felt turned to anger. How for the love of God could this happen again? How could four years of painstaking research and restoration by hundreds of craftspeople, the rebuilding of the peerless library, the ambitious plan to give every first year student at GSA a chance to study in the Mack, to live and breath its inspiration, have gone up in smoke?  Who or what was responsible for starting the fire and why did it take and spread so quickly? Were there not procedures in place to prevent this inconceivably grim turn of events?  We must be rigorous and ruthless in uncovering answers to all these questions and more in the months to come. In the aftermath of the 2014 fire, such inquiries were overshadowed by the outpouring of goodwill around restoration. This will not be the case this time around, and nor should it be. The people of Glasgow, Scotland and beyond deserve answers, not least because we gave so willingly and generously of our money to fund the restoration that now lies in ruins in Renfrew Street.  Once the fire service has produced its report into the cause of the blaze, a full public inquiry may be the only way to establish where responsibility lies and ensure nothing like this ever happens again.  But another, even more difficult question will soon need attention: what now for the Mack? It is painfully early days, of course, and since we don\u0026rsquot yet know the exact extent of the damage, or how viable the shell of the building may or may not be, at present thinking about the future just makes your head hurt.  But since this building has always been a place of ideas, creativity and ingenuity, I\u0026rsquom trying my damnedest to focus on the positives.  Firstly, the building is not, as some are suggesting, \u0026ldquogone. I went to see what remains twice at the weekend and grim as the experience was, what struck me was the fact that the once beautiful west gable, arguably the finest architectural aspect in Scotland, is still recognisable, as is the iconic front elevation.  Secondly, thanks to an innovative project started after the first fire in 2014, the entire building has been digitised to within a millimetre of its life, both inside and out. In this respect at least The Mack still exists in its full glory, making the experience of the teams that worked on the now destroyed restoration invaluable rather than wasted. We should also remember that many of the surviving fixtures and fittings from the 2014 fire are still in storage.  It will be possible to rebuild the Mack from scratch if that\u0026rsquos what it takes. We should take heart from the Frauenkirche in Dresden, rebuilt after German reunification over 10 years starting in 1994 after it was completely destroyed during World War Two. The miracle rebirth of this beautiful church is now part of its story, something that makes it even more interesting to visitors. Think, too, of the chamber of the House of Commons, totally rebuilt after being razed on the final day of the Blitz in 1941.  The Mack arguably exceeds either of these two buildings in terms of architectural and cultural importance. Its place in the hearts and imaginations of Glaswegians, meanwhile, simply cannot be overstated.  Yes, the cost of rebuilding from scratch would be astronomical - quite possibly into the hundreds of millions - though maybe not as much as a football stadium. And yes, any such project would require a daunting amount of political and civic will to succeed and take many years to realise. But surely if any building deserves this sort of effort, the Mack does.  A build of this scale and ambition would be a heritage project unlike any other undertaken in Scotland, one that could ultimately provide employment and training opportunities for hundreds of people. There are pros as well as cons to be considered. But the biggest pro of all would be the continued existence of the Mack, both as a physical presence and an idea. A world without it would be an eminently poorer place, after all.  Let\u0026rsquos be honest, the original Mack was lost in 2014 what was being re-created and restored until last week was already something new. A complete rebuild would represent yet another, even bigger leap of faith. But it could be done.  Ultimately, it will be up to GSA to decide, and I expect to hear calls for a different future for the site, a less costly one that could be filled with deserving, long-suffering students more quickly. But I believe the people of this great city will galvanise and rebuild their beloved Mack once again if that is what is asked of them.

Ciaran Williamson, aged eight, was killed while playing with friends in Craigton Cemetery in Glasgow in May 2015.  A Fatal Accident Inquiry (FAI) found his death could have been avoided if safety precautions had been taken in the Glasgow cemetery where the gravestone stood.  The claim was settled out of court for a six-figure sum and will be split among a number of family members.  In a statement released via their lawyers Digby Brown Solicitors, Ciaran\u0027s family said: \"We are glad the final legal hurdle is over.  \"The last three years have been devastating for us - especially during the FAI and having to relive everything.  \"However we\u0027re grateful the civil action could be settled so quickly as it means we can start to piece ourselves back together.  \"We\u0027d like to say thank you to our friends, family, the local community and the media who have supported us emotionally and practically since Ciaran passed away.  \"And also to our lawyer Mark who helped us greatly through the process.\"  The FAI heard a group of five boys were playing a game involving climbing on to a large 1920s memorial, pushing off from the top to the perimeter wall and grabbing the branch of a tree to swing to the ground.  Ciaran had been standing at the base of the memorial, which weighed almost two-and-a-half tons, when it toppled.  Sheriff Linda Ruxton ruled the boy\u0027s death could have been prevented if the memorial had been subject to a routine inspection, and if a hole in the wall where the boys got in had been repaired.  Mark Gibson, partner at Digby Brown Solicitors, said: \"Ciaran\u0027s family have endured a very public agony and in ways very few people can relate to so first and foremost I\u0027d like to pay tribute to them for their courage throughout.  \"I can confirm a civil action against Glasgow City Council has now been settled which I hope means the family can start focusing on themselves again.\"  A Glasgow City Council spokesman said: \"We always aim to deal with claims as quickly and sensitively as possible.

The party wants David Davis to face MSPs on the Scottish Parliament\u0027s Europe Committee amid a row over the UK Government\u0027s handling of the EU Withdrawal Bill.  Mr Davis has been asked to give evidence to the committee on several occasions, but is yet to do so.  The SNP was left outraged last week when amendments to the legislation affecting Scotland were passed after less than 20 minutes of debate in the House of Commons.  The Scottish Parliament had already voted against granting formal consent to the Bill.  The SNP said the move effectively turned \"on its head\" the Sewel convention, the precedent that Westminster must have the consent of Holyrood to legislate on devolved matters, and called for Scottish Secretary David Mundell to resign.  The opposition to the legislation stems from concerns Holyrood\u0027s powers could be constrained as a result of the legislation, with some of the responsibilities returning from Brussels going to UK ministers instead of those in Edinburgh.

The PinkNews reception at the seat of Northern Ireland\u0027s suspended devolved parliament at Stormont will be held on June 28.  Campaigners said it was the first time a DUP leader had agreed to take part in such an occasion.  The country is the only part of the UK where same-sex marriage is not available.  Change is strongly opposed by Democratic Unionists, who argue that civil partnerships are already available and believe marriage is between a man and a woman.  Benjamin Cohen, chief executive and editor-in-chief at PinkNews, said: \"The decision by Arlene Foster to attend the first PinkNews event in Belfast is an important step towards encouraging a dialogue in Northern Ireland and we\u0027re delighted that there will be a number of other senior cross-party representatives attending and speaking.\"  Political powersharing has been suspended in Northern Ireland for months, with Sinn Fein raising identity and rights issues such as same-sex marriage as key matters to be addressed in negotiations.

The North-east is the first area for the nationwide expansion of the programme outside of Glasgow.

We must harness the potential of these young people to support the current and future economic performance of our region.\u0026ldquoMany of these vulnerable young people lack the stability and support many of us take for granted. This imbalance is something the programme aims to address.\u0026ldquoMCR Pathways has already demonstrated significant impact and we are pleased to support its introduction to the North-east.                                                                                                        The Wood Foundation will be hosting an open event next week to inform potential mentors and business partners about the programme.A mentor meets a young person weekly in their school. They provide a listening ear and supportive voice \u0026ndash a constant adult role model who will build confidence, aspirations and a route to meaningful training or employment. Mentors are trained to guide young people through subject choices, training and professional routes to broaden their mind-sets and realise their potential.One of the opportunities, which requires support from the local business community, is \u0026lsquoTalent Tasters\u0026rsquo \u0026ndash a bite-sized work experience programme showing young people different aspects of industry.Iain MacRitchie of MCR Pathways said: \u0026ldquoA young person\u0026rsquos future should be determined by their potential, never their circumstances. Our mentoring scheme levels the playing field and gives young people structured, enthusiastic and dedicated support to really find a way to realise and achieve their goals as they make that transition from childhood to their adult lives.                                                                                                        \u0026ldquoWe are very proud of what the programme and our young people have achieved to date and we have no doubt the same successes will be realised in the North-east where we have recognised a real need and desire for this support.\u0026lsquoPathways Coordinators\u0026rsquo have been hired for each of the six schools and will begin work after the summer break.

More than 80% of mentored participants have moved onto further education, higher education or employment in sharp contrast to the national figure of 54%.Businessman Iain MacRitchie launched the charity in 2007 after being shocked by a professional experience restructuring a youth care business. While the business health was restored, the poor outcomes for young people remained the same and he realised the need for relationship-based, meaningful support.He commented: \u0026ldquoThat professional experience was a real eye-opener for me, seeing that these young people were not getting the support they needed and nowhere near achieving their potential.

Cows are crossed with Charolais, Salers and Aberdeen-Angus bulls and all calves are either finished on the farm or sold as forward stores, depending on market conditions and available space.        “We run a very commercial operation with a focus on profitability,” says Mr Milne. “We place great emphasis on ease of calving with the aim of achieving a high calving percentage and rearing as many calves as possible.”SBA chairman, Neil McCorkindale, Scammadale, Oban, said the Milne’s reputation for efficiency and the production of quality store and finished cattle made North Bethelnie an ideal venue for Scotland’s Beef Event.“The farm epitomises the North-east’s long-held reputation for the efficient production of high quality beef cattle,” said Mr McCorkindale.Vice-chairman, David Barron, Nether Aden, Mintlaw, who will chair the organising committee, said he was delighted the Milne family had kindly agreed to host the event.                                                                                                        “North Bethelnie will be a great draw for beef farmers throughout Scotland and further afield,” he said.Organisation will be in the hands of Natalie Cormack who has acted as organiser for the last two Scotttish beef events, at Mains of Mause, Blairgowrie, in 2015 and Fans, Earlston, in 2017.Sponsorship and trade stand enquiries are invited now to Natalie Cormack, Organiser, Scotland’s Beef Event 2019, Dairy Cottage, Tower Road, Ayton, Berwickshire, TD14 5QX.

She was delighted someone wanted to hear her story.Befriending Caithness \u0026ndash part of Caithness Voluntary Group \u0026ndash now has groups in Wick, Thurso, Mey, Berriedale and Bettyhill. Mey is especially popular, with befriendees meeting from across the county every couple of months for soup and sandwiches, where there is a \u0026ldquoconstant buzz of chatter, like music. It\u0026rsquos lovely to hear, Angie said.The intergenerational group involves S5/S6 school pupils visiting hospitals and care homes. One befriendee said these befrienders are \u0026ldquolike young relations.The benefits of this are twofold. As well as keeping the befriendees company, it gets the young befriendees into the voluntary mind-set early on, encourages them to become more empathetic and confident and it shows they can make a difference.Befriendees also benefit from regular contact with people \u0026ldquoso they feel as though they\u0026rsquore part of the community, according to befriending co-ordinator Elspeth Manson.Angie added: \u0026ldquoHelping someone recognise their worth is a benefit for both the befriendee and the volunteer.The recruitment procedure includes volunteers receiving Protecting Vulnerable Groups (PVG) clearance and providing three references. Once accepted, training includes support from other groups such as stroke awareness, Hearing and Sight Care and Parkinson\u0026rsquos awareness.Befriending Caithness is not a standalone organisation \u0026ndash it is helped by the community.An event to look out for is a fashion show at M\u0026ampCo in Thurso on June 28, starting at 7pm. Tickets cost \u0026pound5 and this will go towards the July summer lunch.As well as being greatly appreciated by co-ordinators, the joy felt by the befriendees is evident. Co-ordinator Isobel Campbell shared a few, including \u0026ldquobefriending has saved my life, \u0026ldquohaving a befriender would be a luxury and \u0026ldquobefriending is a cup of kindness.One volunteer remarked: \u0026ldquoI just love a laugh and the banter.Befriending Caithness is looking for a volunteer marketing/social media intern.

When he left the club and took over the national team he asked me to come help with a few bits, and from there I\u0026rsquove been working with the team since November 2017.\u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom not based in Croatia. I only come into the country for the preparations and matches, but when I\u0026rsquom there everyone is very friendly and welcoming.\u0026ldquoThe language is very difficult but luckily most of the team and all the staff speak English. Croatia is a beautiful country and the food is delicious so it\u0026rsquos always a pleasure to go over.\u0026ldquoWhen I\u0026rsquom there you see the culture is a strong passionate people but they are also very considerate and well mannered in general, with everyone happy to help each other out.\u0026ldquoIn my current role I am responsible for the gathering and compiling of our information to share with the coaching staff on the opposition and our own performances and training sessions, then to make that information available through video and written documents.\u0026ldquoWe record all our performances in training through GPS and video and then feed that back each night. Along with this we look to prepare our team through use of video meetings and documents on the opposite team.\u0026ldquoMy role is very much a support role for the coaches where I produce information so they can make the best and most informed decisions.\u0026ldquoThe post-match sessions are used to highlight areas which we can improve and the players are very professional and take this on board and process it into better performances where required next time.\u0026ldquoAs for Croatia\u0026rsquos World Cup campaign, the process began when we saw the draw for the group stages and we\u0026rsquove been building to now since then.Marc says a large chunk of his success has come down to the support of family and friends back home in Caithness.His grannies Nanette Plowman (Wick) and Lilian Campbell (Castletown) both still live in Caithness.Marc added: \u0026ldquoAll of my grandparents and my mum have been very supportive of me throughout my life and have always encouraged me to continue to do better. We speak each week and they always give me a boost in energy through encouragement.\u0026ldquoI always know they are there to support me and my little family and we are forever grateful for their love and support.\u0026ldquoPlus all of my aunts, uncles and cousins have also had an influence in who I am and what I do today. I have a few friends still around Caithness.\u0026ldquoI used to come up and play football at the garages in Papigoe or in Castletown, I would jump the neighbours\u0026rsquo wall and have a kick-about with the boys next door.

Few local high street businesses remain in Tain, Mr Stone\u0026rsquos home town.\u0026ldquoThe presence of these empty and increasingly derelict properties undermines one of the most important industries of the Highlands \u0026ndash namely tourism, he says.\u0026ldquoI would therefore suggest that properly tackling this problem should now be one of the most urgent issues for both the UK and Scottish governments.\u0026ldquoThis problem can no longer be ducked by plans that turn out to be more about words than actions \u0026ndash or, worse still, by means of the argument that the decline in the UK\u0026rsquos high street retail sector is inevitable.\u0026ldquoIf we really value our communities and their built heritage, then we must use every means at our disposal \u0026ndash grants, infrastructure investment, tax breaks, local and national planning \u0026ndash so that we can find new ways of bringing these buildings back into sustainable use.Speaking yesterday, Mr Stone said: \u0026ldquoIt pains me greatly to see what is happening, and also to witness nothing better than fine words and hand-wringing when it comes to tackling the problem.\u0026ldquoThis letter is my first move in a campaign that I am going to pursue with the greatest vigour. Tain is my home town and I care about it \u0026ndash and the same is true of the other communities that I have the honour to represent.Tuesday 19 Jun 2018 1:37 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":null,"title":"Sailor in distress proves false alarm","story":"Coastguards rushed into action on Friday night after a boat was\u0026nbspreported to be in trouble in the Pentland Firth.A lifeboat was launched from Scrabster, but on nearing the 30-foot yacht,\u0026nbspthe coastguard ascertained that the sailor \u0026ndash on his way home to Denmark\u0026nbsp\u0026ndash was not in any danger.\u0026ldquoHe was fine, but he\u0026rsquod been struggling with the tides to get through and that was all, said Andy Pearson, the station\u0027s full time mechanic.\u0026ldquoSomebody had obviously seen him dodging through the tides trying to make his way through the Firth, and he was using his experience to get through.Pearson said that the coastguard stayed with the man \u0026ndash described as \u0026ldquoquite an old experienced sea dog \u0026ndash to make sure he negotiated the Skerries safely.\u0026ldquoSomeone filed a report with good intent and it\u0026rsquos good for us to go out and check that they are ok, he underlined.Thurso is the most northerly RNLI lifeboat station on mainland Scotland.Crews of the Scrabster station\u0026rsquos Severn class all-weather lifeboat have received 17 awards for gallantry.Pearson said that the man was not planning on stopping before sailing across the North Sea to Denmark \u0026ndash a distance of around 450 nautical miles.He stressed that any small vessel low in power should monitor what the tides are doing before they try and negotiate the Firth.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspTuesday 19 Jun 2018 1:37 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.johnogroat-journal.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04114000/04114264.jpg","title":"Special delivery for retiring Lybster postie","story":"\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspHe started in 1988, taking over from another postie who was a familiar figure to a certain generation, Donnie Bremner from Mid-Clyth.Thirty years ago Murray had to go over the Ord to Helmsdale to meet the train north to collect the mail then take it to the local sorting offices in Dunbeath and Lybster. All the small local post offices and all the postboxes between Berriedale and Lybster had to have the mail uplifted on this run.Now two trucks each morning bring the mail north from Inverness and Murray has been working mainly, since these changes, on the rural run through Occumster, Roster, Clyth, Bruan and Ulbster.Murray frequently found himself stuck in snow in past winters and has been rescued by farmers pulling him out of drifts in the rural hinterland of south-east Caithness.He served under three postmasters in Lybster \u0026ndash firstly as a part-time postie as well as being a fisherman under the late Hugh Gunn, whose father before him had been the Lybster postmaster.

Murray duly delivered Annie\u0026rsquos mail having firstly helped with the other delivery, and on to his next stop.A collection was taken in Lybster Post Office and the money was handed over by local postmaster Duncan Winfield accompanied by wife Gail in a small ceremony on June 6.Tuesday 19 Jun 2018 1:37 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.johnogroat-journal.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04109000/04109865.jpg","title":"Wick museum set for another busy year","story":"\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspIan Leith, chairman of the Wick Society, made the plea after being re-elected to the post at the annual general meeting on Thursday night.\u0026ldquoIn the open season last year we had in excess of 5000 people, which was a good bit up on previous years, and this year looks as though it\u0026rsquos heading very much the same way, Mr Leith said. \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos busy, with a lot of tourists coming in.

It\u0026rsquos great that we get these visitors from all over the world, and many of them have Caithness connections and they come on that basis, but it would be nice to get more local people.\u0026ldquoOur open day on January 2 was a good start in that respect because it opened the door to people from the local area to come and see what we have.\u0026ldquoA number have come back on the basis of that.\u0026ldquoThe local people are very supportive of the Wick Society. Everything in this museum is donated by people who either live locally or have connections with this place.\u0026ldquoI mentioned at the AGM about the amount of donations that we get in monetary terms.

However, two existing panels are being moved to the Braehead and North Head.He said the paths were already proving popular with local people and visitors and the group is keen to provide information about the area.Mr Bogle added that the civil engineer\u0026rsquos gravestone \u0026ndash in the graveyard of Wick St Fergus Church \u0026ndash had also been tidied up recently.Wick Harbour Authority chairman Willie Watt MBE said: \u0026ldquoFor me James Bremner is one of the unsung heroes of Caithness. He is just an amazing character. Nothing was too difficult for him and he treated everybody he worked with the greatest of respect. He was a great leader and motivator.Mr Watt pointed out that one of the Wick engineer\u0026rsquos greatest achievements was the refloating of the SS Great Britain \u0026ndash the largest ship of its time \u0026ndash when she ran aground off Ireland in the 1840s.He said that Mr Bremner was sent for from Wick, along with a few of his men, when other engineers had failed in one of the biggest salvage operations of that era.James Bremner (1784-1856) was born at Stain, Keiss. He was an apprentice in a Greenock shipyard and returned to Wick to establish his own shipbuilding business, constructing over 50 vessels in as many years as well as designing and building many harbours. He was involved in the construction of the breakwater at Wick harbour.A local author, John Mowat, once described Mr Bremner as \u0026ldquothe Ulysses of the north and \u0026ldquoour greatest Caithnessian.Mr Bremner is still remembered in Keiss with a plaque at the harbour erected by the Institution of Civil Engineers.Tuesday 19 Jun 2018 1:38 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":null,"title":"https:wwworcadiancouk  \n","story":"June 18, 2018 at 5:06 pmThe hotel chain Travelodge has today announced that, as part of plans to include Kirkwall in an upcoming expansion of its network of hotels, it has written to Orkney Islands Council (OIC) proposing a \u0026#8220joint development partnership\u0026#8221 to finance construction of a new hotel in the town.

Feedback gathered will help us as we review route and timetable specifications for the 2020-2025 contract.”Both the ‘Bus Users’ and ‘Non-Bus Users’ surveys are available from the ‘Consultation and Engagement’ section of the council website. The direct link is available here.Paper copies are available on request from the Council’s Transportation Team for those unable to access the online surveys, by emailing transport@orkney.gov.uk or calling tel 01856 873535 ext 2539.

The plans represent an investment of £125 million for investors and would create 385 new jobs.According to the hotel chain, the letter it has sent to OIC sets out how it has supported 12 local authorities in England and Wales, supporting local regeneration, creating jobs and boosting local economies.With similar letters being sent to 19 other councils in Scotland, including Shetland Islands Council, the hotel chain is attempting to show how it could similarly support local communities around the country.These agreements offer a funding structure which the hotel chain says enables local authorities to utilise their existing assets, create jobs, generate income, and help to regenerate land in strategically important locations.Hotels in the programme are built on surplus local authority land, with the funding provided either through the local authority’s internal resource or via low-cost funding from the Public Works Loan Board or third party resources.Upon completion of the hotel development, local authorities would either have the choice of either retaining ownership of the hotel and receive an annual rent into the council’s revenue budget or selling the hotel with Travelodge as its operator.Brian Wallace, Travelodge chairman said: “Many local authorities are in possession of large amounts of property and assets that are not being utilised. Investing in a low-cost hotel like Travelodge is an increasingly attractive choice, as it draws visitors, creates jobs and helps boost the local economy.”“We operate 44 hotels across Scotland. However, the country is growing at pace and attracting visitors from all corners of the globe but there still remains a huge shortage of good quality and great value hotels. To fill this gap, we want to extend our Scottish network with a further 20 hotels and this includes our first hotel in Kirkwall. To help us achieve this, we are writing to Orkney Council, to invite them to consider how Travelodge can act as a catalyst to drive their local development agenda.”A spokesman for Orkney Islands Council has said the local authority is unable to comment at this stage as to date, a proposal has not been received by the council.\u0026copy The Orcadian - 2018A division of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.
