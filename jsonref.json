Meanwhile, Harry confirmed a rift with his brother William, the Duke of Cambridge, and told of how his father Prince Charles - the heir to the throne - had cut him off financially. And the couple, who were expecting their second child at the time, also revealed to Winfrey that they were expecting a girl.Their daughter, Lilibet Diana Mountbatten-Windsor, was born in California in June.She was given Queen Elizabeth\u0027s childhood nickname, sparking controversy over whether the royal couple had asked permission to recycle the head of the royal household\u0027s cherished moniker.Harry and Meghan also paid tribute to the Duke\u0027s late mother Diana, who was killed in a car crash in Paris in August 1997 aged 36.  "},{"url":null,"title":"Elon Musk Grimes split three years together","story":"Share this articleElon Musk and Grimes break up after three years togetherThe Life and Death of Grimes - WSJ"},{"url":null,"title":"Lawyer caught four times drink drive limit blames friends home Kombucha tea","story":"Share this article Angela Morrison told the magistrates the Googled recipe just said to use yeast and she didn\u0027t know what type had been used. She had been so \u0027horrified\u0027 when she found out there was alcohol that she poured the possibly \u0027vital\u0027 remaining liquid evidence down the sink, the prosecution noted.The court chairman Graham Edwards described her account as \u0027odd.\u0027The prosecutor told the court: \u0027The defendant\u0027s reading is extremely high. \u0027The reading is so high you are entitled to conclude she must have known she had been consuming alcohol.

The most important thing is that everyone played so good. “It is not about the message, we always try to play as good as possible. We have a lot of top players to create the chances and score the goals.”Lukaku gets down the left and sends a great cross to the back post for Azpilicueta to attack but it goes over his head as he stumbles into Cancelo. The crowd want a penalty but there is no chance it is happening.Four minutes are being added on but that could end up being a lot longer due to the treatment going on in the area to the two players. Azpilicueta chips a pass into Werner who has found space in the area, he turns and volleys a shot at goal but it whacks into Dias’ chest. There are the traditional calls from the crowd for handball but there is no chance of that being the case. Foden slips the ball through for Grealish to race onto, he gets one-on-one with Mendy and tries to dink it over the ‘keeper but he spreads himself well to deny the winger and keep Chelsea in the game.Alonso goes into the book for going through the back of Bernardo Silva as he looks to instigate an attack. Christensen then joins his teammate in the referee’s notepad for holding onto De Bruyne.The action is now relentless, that’s for sure. End-to-end stuff with plenty in between. Will City go for a second or will Guardiola get Fernandinho on soon to try and calm things down.Richard Leather emails. “After all that has been said about Lukaku - being the complete player etc. he has been largely invisible in the two testing games for Chelsea - Liverpool and City… These were the games he was supposed to turn?” The tactics and performance have no helped him. To be fair, Chelsea did play with 10 men for more than a half at Anfield. The open nature of the game now is making this fun. It is about to open up a touch more, as Havertz comes on for Kante. “I think the whole Tuchel is a tactical genius is a bit over done,” emails Declan O’Brien. “In your assessment of the first half, you chastise city for not managing a shot on target, but ignore Chelsea’s failure to do so. You seem to be painting it as if Chelsea have a cunning plan to not even threaten to have a shot in the whole half. That can’t have been Chelsea’s ambition so therefore the plan or its application are faulty.” I think I frequently pointed out that Chelsea’s game plan was to defend and hit on the counter, pointing out at half-time that the latter element had not worked.Chelsea are looking more ambitious. Lukaku gets the ball on the right and sends in a dangerous cross which Dias slides to clear.Kovacic lifts his head up for the first time and sees space for Werner to run into. His pass is a dangerous one but Ederson reads it and comes out quickly to collect.I am sure we will see a little rotation in roles after the break.Chelsea have gifted possession to City in the knowledge they can defend all day without giving up good chances. They will, however, be disappointed they have been unable to break on City, with Lukaku and Werner almost redundant.Moments later, Jesus controls the ball with his shoulder in the box but it bounces at an awkward height and he sends a shot high and wide. Mendy takes a long goal-kick for the first time. A further sign of a change in approach from Chelsea after 40 odd minutes of absorbing pressure. Tuchel looks like he wants his midfield to push higher up, as they are inviting pressure. The German coach looks a little frustrated by how things are going.Down the other end, Rodri gets the ball 30 yards out and he fires a shot off, which is going wide before Rudiger deflects it over. The resulting corner is headed back by Dias at the far post but Silva clears. The ball comes back to Foden at the byline but once again Chelsea get it out of play for a corner.This game is so good, I might actually read an article about the tactical nuances going on."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/22ffdb94d84b6b214d4a00a620c826333237a0ec/0_288_2066_1239/master/2066.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=0daa02800937aba0ed3391631bcb3e5f","title":"ryder cup golf united states usa europe day two whistling straits","story":"Also Jordan Spieth should get a bonus point for that shot of borderline psychedelic brilliance on 17, sending the ball miles into the air while hanging onto the side of a cliff, landing it six feet from the pin, then finally defying gravity by putting on the brakes just before momentum threatened to dunk him in Lake Michigan.

He said: In order to hasten the campaign, the government is expanding its army-run drive-through vaccination centres. The cases include 1,288 contacts of previously confirmed cases in Ulaanbaatar, as well as 1,374 cases in other regions of the country, according to the AKIpress news agency. A further 18 coronavirus patients died in the last day, while there were 2,662 recoveries.As of Friday, 1,029 people in Israel were hospitalised with the virus. The country’s overall death toll from Covid-19 stands at 7,611. Shops are only allowed to open between 7am and 11am. “There shall be strict corona curfew in the areas of Zadibal (wards 55-Hawal, 56-Alamgari Bazar and 63-Kathi Darwaz) and Lal Bazar (wards 59-Lalbazar, 60-Botshah Mohalla, 61-Umer Colony) for a period of 10 days starting from today,” Mohammad Aijaz, the district magistrate of Srinagar said on Friday.After social distancing was brought to a close on Saturday, customers are now required to show proof of vaccination, recent recovery from Covid or a negative test to enter hospitality and leisure venues in the Netherlands. Reuters reports that hundreds of protesters gathered in The Hague on Saturday, to march through the city centre against the measure, which while generally popular with the public, has drawn ire from the hospitality sector. Known as the “1.5-meter society” in the Netherland, social distancing measures have been in place for the last 18 months. From Saturday, everyone aged 13 and above must show a health pass to enter bars, cafes, restaurants as well as cultural venues such as theatres. Customers have to show they are fully vaccinated, have just tested negative or have recently recovered from Covid. Customers aged 14 and above must also show ID, with employees instructed to scan their pass QR codes and compare the data against the ID.  The caretaker health minister, Hugo de Jonge, said the pass requirement would be “as temporary as possible”.Carrying doctors, nurses and, crucially, vaccine doses, it has a mission to bring vaccines closer to people in small towns and poorer parts of South Africa, which has the continent’s highest number of coronavirus infections at more than 2.8 million. The train is parked at the rail station in Swartkops, a small town on the country’s south coast, the first stop on a three-month journey through the poor Eastern Cape province. It will stay for about two weeks at a time at seven stations in the province to vaccinate as many people as possible. The initiative aims to meet head-on two of the government’s biggest challenges: getting doses out beyond big cities to areas where health care facilities are limited and trying to convince hesitant people in those areas to get vaccine shots. The train, named Transvaco, can hold up to 108,000 vaccine doses in ultra-cold refrigerators. It has nine coaches, including accommodation coaches and a kitchen and dining area for the staff, a vaccination area and consulting rooms.Most of the 8m doses of the Johnson \u0026amp Johnson single-shot vaccine will be sent to Asia-Pacific countries, the foreign secretary, Harsh Vardhan Shringla, said in a statement reported by Agence France-Presse. The country, which is one of the world’s biggest vaccine producers, had pledged to export 1bn doses by December 2022, but suspended exports in May after India was overwhelmed by its second wave of cases. The largest number of cases were in Moscow, which registered 3,211 infections, while St Petersburg tallied 1,907. A further 822 Covid patients died in the 24-hour period, while there were 16,325 recoveries across the country.The central American nation of roughly 6.4 million people has obtained 12m vaccines since February, Reuters reports. Third shots would be given to people including those aged over 60, frontline health staff, teachers, the armed forces, police and firefighters, as well as Salvadorans with pre-existing health problems, Bukele said on Twitter. “Considering the success of the third dose in Israel, we have decided to start with a third dose in El Salvador,” the president said. People will be able to book a vaccination appointment from Sunday.  Panama, Ecuador and Chile are also offering third jobs to at-risk populations.The AP news agency reports that Israeli officials attributes the suppression of its third wave to the booster shot rollout, and expects the US and others to expand their campaign in coming months. The WHO has called on countries to hold off on administering booster doses until at least the end of the year to allow people in poorer countries to get their initial doses. Davidovitch acknowledged the problem, saying: “We know for sure that the current system of vaccine nationalism is hurting all of us, and it’s creating variants”, but added that the problem is “much broader than Israel”.From 4 October, fully vaccinated travellers will no longer have to take a pre-departure test when arriving from non-red list countries from 4 October. The change, which will come into force at 4am on 4 October, has been welcomed by the travel industry. The announcement follows a simplification of the travel rules in England, under which the travel traffic light system was replaced with a single red list. Pre-departure tests for jabbed passengers have also been scrapped, while from October, travellers returning to England will be able to take a lateral flow test instead of a PCR on day two.A further 3,273 infections were added to the country’s tally as the outbreak continued to grow, the Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency (KDCA) said to Reuters.

Video: Kathleen Harris Dr John Dunbar with a noble false widow spider, steatoda nobilis. Although he has handled thousands, Dr Dunbar has never been bitten. Photograph: Photograph: Dara Mac DonaillWe should see plenty of action in an hour, Dr John Dunbar says assuredly via email, excited at the prospect. As a venom expert, many nights are spent combing the walls and railings of Dublin housing estates for Ireland’s highly-poisonous false widow spider.Alone in the dark, armed with extended tweezers and a headlamp, he carefully places each one inside long plastic tubes as the residents sleep inside, blissfully unaware.On a chilly evening thousands of such spiders are scattered just out of sight along Beech Park, a long quiet suburban road in Lucan lined with detached homes and webbed hedges. The noble false widow – or steatoda nobilis – first recorded in Ireland in 1999 is far more common than most people realise and its numbers are increasing alarmingly.Within two minutes Dr Dunbar is poking at a web string. He has spotted two long, thin protruding legs, inconspicuous to the passerby. It is the first trophy of 94 that night.Although he has handled thousands, Dr Dunbar has never been bitten. Twenty bites have been recorded in Ireland, he declares, and the bite is one to be avoided.In some cases victims have experienced severe bacterial infections, debilitating pain and body tremors.Steatoda nobilis is compared to the notorious black widow for a number of reasons including notable similarities in appearance, genetics and toxins. It is known as the “false widow” because in regions where they co-exist it can be difficult to tell them apart.Smaller than the native house spider, chocolate brown with a large bulbous abdomen and an intricate cream pattern sometimes resembling a skull, the false widow is easy to identify.Five or six years ago researchers would have had to look hard for one. Today, a single hunter can expect to bag between 100 and 150 in a few hours in any suburban estate.Thought to have originated in the Atlantic archipelagos of Madeira and the Canaries, it arrived in the United Kingdom and Europe on banana boats. Throughout the 20th century it established thriving populations throughout England and Wales, and later colonised parts of western Europe, California, Chile and the Middle East.Although found in Co Wicklow a little more than two decades ago, little was known about its presence here until more recently. A 2017 Royal Irish Academy study confirmed the species in at least 16 counties, but most significantly in the greater Dublin area where it is abundant in urban buildings and around street furniture.As Dr Dunbar walks slowly from suburban home to home, he identifies and scoops up the spiders from virtually every single driveway pillar he examines. His head torch illuminates the undersides of wall ledges, shrubs, gates, guttering, the back of ESB boxes. They are everywhere. After just a short while it seems other native species are relatively difficult to come by.Potent venom“But they do have a venom that’s a little bit more potent than what we’re used to. It’s very similar to the venom of black widows, not quite as potent, but still kind of getting there.”The risk posed are similar to ones posed by bees and wasps. Each spider can give about half of one microlitre of venom, about one thousandth of a millilitre. On his regular hunts Dr Dunbar tells the gardaí he will be prowling. The glow from his headlamp and his intricate inspection of neighbourhood walls are common, as are encounters with neighbours.Just as he is plucking a sample with his extended tweezers, a resident approaches with a fair idea of what is going on but curious all the same. “They are obviously everywhere in this area,” Colm Gallagher says resignedly. “I know what the implications are they have venom and whatever else. But they’re not terribly dangerous.”They do go inside houses, but not usually. Whether for the curious resident, the arachnophobe or the scientist, there is still a lot to learn about these creatures and a race to learn it.“They are here to stay, there is no way we’re going to get rid of them,” he says. “But we really need to monitor them while we can over the next years and see what happens. Now science must tell us what we are dealing with,” he said."},{"url":null,"title":"climate","story":"Price volatility should prompt accelerated deployment of solar PV, says energy groupEurope awakens to cold reality of what happens when wind fails to blow for long periodsWhat\u0026rsquos happening when it comes to climate change, what are the targets and why do we need to up our game?"},{"url":null,"title":"heritage","story":"Another Life: Earlier leaf-fall, even of days, could reduce carbon stored by forestsStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"covid 19 vaccine tracker how many people have been inoculated in ireland","story":"It has been over a year since the first case of Covid-19 was confirmed in the Republic of Ireland. Since then, over 300,000 people have been diagnosed in the State, and over 5,000 people have died.Globally, over 200 million people have been diagnosed and over 4\u0026nbspmillion have died since the virus was first identified in China in December 2019.Four of these have been authorised for use in the EU - one from AstraZeneca, one from BioNTech-Pfizer, one from Moderna and another from Johnson \u0026amp Johnson (Janssen).The EU has put in place purchase agreements with Sanofi-GSK\u0026nbspand Curevac, and\u0026nbsphas concluded exploratory talks with two other vaccine producers - Novavax and Valneva.Ireland, along with all other EU member states, will get a proportional amount of every vaccine that is approved for use by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) according to its population.But how do these other vaccines work, and when will they be approved for use here? Have there been any reported side effects? And when can you expect to receive a vaccine?The  Vaccine Tracker will be updated daily as the country embarks on the largest inoculation programme in the history of the State.Storage: Must be kept in a freezer at - 70°C.EMA approval: Granted on December 21st.Overview: Developed by New York-based Pfizer and German company BioNTech this vaccine has a brand name of Comirnaty. It uses messenger RNA (mRNA) technology, which has instructions for producing a protein from Sars-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19. The person’s immune system recognises this protein as foreign and produces antibodies and activates T-cells (white blood cells) to attack it, giving them immunity. The vaccine will last for six months when stored at -70C, and five days when stored at between 2 and 8 degrees Celsius. The EU has approved the withdrawal of six doses from each vial.Side effects: Common side effects (occurring in more than 1 in 10 people) included pain and swelling at the injection site, tiredness, headache, muscle and joint pain, chills and fever. Severe allergic reactions occurred in a very small number of cases.How many will Ireland get? 546,000 in April, 738,000 in May and\u0026nbsp844,000 doses in June, with 5.4 million doses in total expected by the end of 2021.Storage: Must be kept in a freezer at - 20°C.EMA approval: Granted on January 6th.Overview: Developed by Boston-based company Moderna, this vaccine is manufactured for EU states at partner plants in Switzerland, France and Spain before being distributed across the continent. Like the Pfizer BioNTech vaccine, it uses mRNA technology to produce a Sars-CoV-2 protein, which the body then attacks to give immunity. It will last for up to six months when stored at - 20°C. The first Moderna vaccine was given in Ireland on January 16th.Side effects: Common side effects (occurring in more than 1 in 10 people) included pain and swelling at the injection site, tiredness, chills, fever, swollen or tender lymph nodes under the arm, headache, muscle and joint pain, nausea and vomiting. Less common was redness, hives and rash at the injection site. Severe allergic reactions occurred in a very small number of cases.How many will Ireland get? 383,000 by June and 870,000 doses by the end of 2021.How many have been vaccinated here?Dose: Two doses, between 4 and 12 weeks apartEMA approval: Granted on January 29th.Overview: The OxfordAstraZeneca vaccine (also known as Vaxzevria) was thought of as a potential game-changer because it can be transported and stored at 2 degrees to 8 degrees for up to six months, making it much easier to move around and administer. It is also much cheaper, costing about $3-4 per shot, compared with $20 for the PfizerBioNTech jab, with the former being made on a not-for-profit basis for the duration of the pandemic.It is based on a harmless chimp cold virus that cannot grow inside human cells. Scientists have tweaked this virus so that it carries genetic material containing the instructions for a protein of the coronavirus. Once the vaccine has been administered, our bodies produce the coronavirus protein, triggering an immune response.During the trial, a dosing error led to the serendipitous finding that when clinical trial participants were given half a dose followed by a full dose, the vaccine had a higher efficacy than when participants were given two full doses, with 90 per cent efficacy in the former case and 62 per cent efficacy in the latter. This led AstraZeneca to announce in November a new global trial of the vaccine with the half dosefull dose regime.In January, a bitter row broke out between the European Union and AstraZeneca after the pharmaceutical company drastically revised downwards the number of doses it could deliver the bloc.\u0026nbspWhile the EMA approved the use of this vaccine for all ages, doubt was cast over its efficacy in the over 65s due to the lack of data from Astrazeneca’s clinical trials in this cohort. As a result, Germany, Austria, Sweden, Poland and Belgium have opted not to approve this product for their older population.Following suit, Ireland has also decided to use the Pfizer or Moderna vaccine for the over 70s where possible, not the AstraZeneca jab.It would not be the first time this jab led to a\u0026nbspsignificant reorganisation of our vaccination plans.Reports of serious blood clots, mostly in women aged under 60, led the\u0026nbspNational Immunisation Advisory Committee (Niac) to first defer the use of the vaccine on March 14th, before resuming it\u0027s use on March 20th.However, on April 12th, Niac\u0026nbsprecommended that AstraZeneca should not be given to people aged under 60, once again leading to a reorganisation of the rollout. This was revised to people aged over 50 on April 27th. On June 28th, Niac revised its advice again and said the vaccine could be given\u0026nbspto people aged under 40, although the mRNA shots were preferable for that age group.How many will Ireland get?\u0026nbspLatest projections are 224,000 in April, 262,000 in May and 327,000 in JuneStorage: Lasts for up to two years frozen at –20° C, and up to three months refrigerated at 2-8° C.EMA approval: Approved on March 11th.Overview: The EMA started a rolling review of this single dose vaccine from Janssen, the Belgium-based subsidiary of Johnson \u0026amp Johnson on December 1st.On January 29th the company announced the results of its Phase 3 trial: the vaccine had an efficacy of 72 per cent in the United States, 66 per cent in Latin America, and 57 per cent in South Africa.This vaccine uses double-stranded DNA to deliver a protein from the SARS-CoV-2 virus into the body, thereby creating immunity. It is different from others on the market in that it requires just one injection. The EU has agreed an initial contract for 200 million doses, with an option to buy 200 million more.On February 16th the company applied to the EMA for\u0026nbspseeking authorisation for its single-dose vaccine, and it was approved on March 11th.However, on April 13th the company paused deliveries of its vaccine in Europe pending an investigation of rare blood clot cases that have halted its rollout in the US. The blood clotting conditions reported in recipients of the Johnson \u0026amp Johnson vaccine in the US are the same rare condition linked to the AstraZeneca vaccine.On April 20th, the EMA\u0027s review of these issues found a possible link to very rare cases of unusual blood clots with low blood platelets, and agreed a warning should be included in the product information.\u0026nbspHowever, it concluded\u0026nbspthe overall benefits of the vaccine\u0026nbspin preventing Covid-19 outweigh the risks of side effects, and so Janssen announced it would resume deliveries to the EU. In Ireland,\u0026nbspNiac initially recommended that the jab be used only for people over the age of 50, but this was revised to include the under 40s on June 28th. Those aged 18-34 can apply to get the Janssen vaccine at pharmacies around the country.How many will Ireland get?\u0026nbsp2.2 million doses in total,\u0026nbsp600,000 between April and June.Storage: Stable at 2°C to 8°C.Overview: US company Novavax has developed a Covid-19 vaccine which stimulates an immune response by delivering spike proteins into the body. These spike-proteins are grown and harvested from insects. Similar technology is used in the production of vaccines for influenza and HPV. The European Commission has concluded exploratory talks with Novavax with a view to purchasing up to 200 million doses. The EMA began a rolling review of the vaccine on February 3rd.Overview: In September the EU signed a deal to purchase 300 million doses of this vaccine. It is based on the same technology as one of Sanofi’s seasonal influenza vaccines - more conventional than the mRNA used by Pfizer and Moderna - and it was thought it could play a big role in ending the pandemic. However, despite positive results from Phase 1 trials, news came in December that Phase 2 trial results showed an insufficient immune response in older adults. Phase III studies were expected to start in December, but the companies now plan to begin a phase 2b study in February with a different formulation of the vaccine. Even if their new formulation is successful, they do not expect the vaccine to be available until the end of 2021.Storage: Will last for at least 3 months at 2-8°C.Overview: The German company CureVac began its final Phase 3 trials in December, with results expected in the first quarter of 2021. It uses the same mRNA technology as the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines, but can be kept at normal refrigerator temperatures. The company has signed a deal with the EU to supply 405 million doses, pending regulatory approval.The EMA began a rolling review of the vaccine on February 12th.Storage: Stable at 2°C to 8°C.Overview: Valneva is a French company which has created a Covid-19 vaccine based on their Japanese encephalitis vaccine. It delivers a chemically inactivated coronavirus and uses an adjuvant (immunity booster) to create immunity. It entered clinical trials in December and reported positive results from these initial phase 1 and 2 trial in\u0026nbspApril 2021, while announcing it was entering\u0026nbspphase 3 trials on 4,000 people.On January 12th the European Commission concluded exploratory talks with the company for the supply of 30 million doses, with the option to buy a further 30 million.When might you be vaccinated?Over 80 per cent\u0026nbspof people in Ireland aged over 18 are now fully vaccinated, with over 90 per cent in receipt of at least one dose.

We can never have enough TDs to complain about.Were it not for the pandemic, the business of carving up constituencies and handing out extra seats would already be under way. The next general election, barring an unlikely early collapse of Government, should see at least seven new seats up for grabs.When Fine Gael returned to power in 2011, one of its big election promises was to shrink the size of the Dáil by 20. It was a popular selling point with voters. But that didn’t happen as it would have required a referendum. In the end, the number of seats on offer in the next election was reduced by 8 to 158.A decade ago, Sinn Féin was against the change.“It makes absolutely no sense,” said TD Brian Stanley, arguing that local government needed to be strengthened first. “We must take serious issue with the proposal to cut the number of TDs from the current 166 to a figure between 152 and 160. We would prefer that the pay of TDs was reduced rather than the actual number of TDs.”So it’s seats all the way for Sinn Féin. The number crept back up to 160 last year. Given the party’s impressive election performance, the prospect of significantly more seats on offer next time around must be tantalising.Fianna Fáil’s Seán Fleming was crunching the numbers for us during the week. Like most of his contemporaries in Leinster House, the TD for Laois-Offaly takes a keen interest in population patterns and how they might affect constituencies. He says there will be a minimum of seven extra seats available next time out.“The census should have been in April but it was postponed for a year because of Covid-19. Had it happened, everyone here would be talking about the redrawing of the constituencies now. Really, really talking about it, because with the rise in population we are very definitely looking at a jump in seats.”The Central Statistics Office recently produced the population estimate for this year. It shows the population breaking the five million barrier (5.01 million) for the first time since the 1851 census.“In normal circumstances, the preliminary results for each county and constituency would be in by now and the Constituency Commission would be up and running,” says Fleming. “But even though everything has been put back for a year, we still know that the population has risen. The Constitution requires one TD for between 20,000 and 30,000 people. So if you ide the five million by the top, most restrictive, figure, you get at least 167 seats. The number will automatically increase.”But the rising population tide doesn’t necessarily lift all boats.“Everyone will be watching what happens with interest. The fate of inidual TDs will be influenced by the findings of the boundary commission. It will be good news for some, but not all. On the plus side, it’s also a chance to get new people and new voices into the Dáil, and that’s always a good thing.”Extra seats mean extra physical seats in the chamber. A narrow block to the right of where the Taoiseach and government sit might have to be used. This area used by departmental civil servants and known as “The Bullpen” may have to be decommissioned.The distinguished visitors gallery above it looks safe from extinction, for now.Live and let dyeYou can’t be too careful about what you say these days. Nobody wants to cause offence.Being pass-remarkable for a living can be a fraught existence.So we will not be commenting this weekend on what TDs were wearing.But, honest to God, did you see the state of that Chris Andrews in the Dáil this week? Or should we say Dame Edna Andrews.I mean. Look at the hair!Tiochfaidh our locks, as they used to say in Sinn Féin. Now it’s lilac and think of Ireland...Senator Lorraine Clifford-Lee, staunchly supporting her colleagues, angrily condemned the offending article on social media: “shocking and nasty, bottom of the barrel stuff.” Clifford-Lee, who is married to John Lee, executive editor at DMG Ireland, which owns the Irish Mail on Sunday, was fortunate to escape the undiscriminating eye of the author.She must have been out of the room at the time, concluded some FF TDs around the tea urn on Tuesday in the Dáil canteen.But back to Chris Andrews, who turned heads in the Dáil chamber when he turned up this week with pink hair.It was a kind of fading pink, still neon in parts but mellowing to dusky elsewhere. Everyone who saw him did a double-take. But here’s the thing: nobody dared ask him why his hair looked so odd.“I think they thought I’d had a dye job and it went wrong,” he told us yesterday. “I could see people looking at my hair and thinking I had some sort of blue rinse effect going on. They were afraid to say anything.”This is wholly understandable. Once upon a time the Dáil chamber was a national repository for dodgy toupees and cheap, unnatural-looking hair colour. It was the fashion among male TDs of a certain age. Not anymore. You’d miss it.Deputy Andrews went pink as part of a “shave or dye” charity challenge. The event last weekend was organised by Gemma Devoy, who lives in the Pearse House flat complex in his Dublin Bay South constituency. The 35-year-old mother of one was recently diagnosed with breast cancer, and she started her first course of treatment this week.Gemma and Chris have been involved in other fundraising activities, including the Darkness into Light walks. She decided to start raising money for the Marie Keating Cancer Foundation after she realised the extent of the costs faced by people undergoing treatment for cancer. When she went to buy a wig she couldn’t believe the cost – it was €1,500. While she has the support of family and friends, others are not so fortunate.Deputy Andrews says he opted to go for the dye job instead of having it all shaved off. “I didn’t want the lingering fear that it might not grow back. And anyway, I’m too vain.”Gemma put in the colour and helped out with all the volunteers on the day before shaving off her own long hair for donation to a group which makes wigs for children.Soon after launching her fundraiser, Gemma was “blown away” when a single donation for €10,000 landed in her GoFundMe account from MMA fighter Conor McGregor. She is now on course to hit her €25,000 target with €22,000 raised so far.While people in Leinster House may have been the soul of discretion when faced with a TD’s purple-tinged hair, not everyone was kind. “Somebody watching the Dáil from outside emailed to tell me I looked like a complete plonker.”Taking New York brick by brickMicheál Martin looked like he was going to explode with happiness and joy during his brief sojourn at the United Nations top table this week. The Taoiseach looked chuffed with himself.Could things get any better? Any more glamorous?Yes, it could. For on Tuesday evening, Micheál, New York at his feet, was given the singular honour of unveiling a brick in Hell’s Kitchen. It was a very nice brick. Reddish. Rectangular. A bricky brick.It was to mark the “dedication” of the new Irish Arts Center, which has been in the pipeline for many years now. Officials at the event were at pains to stress that the Taoiseach was not officially opening the centre but taking part in a dedication symbolised by a brick dating from 1916. He didn’t bring it with him from Ireland, though. It wasn’t taken from the rubble in O’Connell Street or anything like that. This particular brick is from the facade of the old tyre company which is soon to become the Irish Arts Centre in New York.The Irish journalists accompanying the Taoiseach on his big trip were very disappointed he didn’t take the opportunity to treat his audience to Fr Jack’s famous line in Father Ted, after he forms an unusual attachment with a building block. Micheál could have clutched the unveiled dedication to his chest and cried: “I luv my brick!”He’s certainly gone one better than Enda Kenny when he was taoiseach and on duty abroad. Enda went to Berlin and ended up opening a burger van in a car park. Mind you, we recently reported on former minister Jimmy Deenihan unveiling a borehole in Africa.How can Leo Varadkar compete with that? The best he’s done so far is pose with a spoon beside his office dishwasher. But it’s the Tánaiste’s turn to go to New York next week. Let’s see if he can trump Micheál’s brick.Dáil drink link runs dryStaff returning to Kildare Street after months working from home were disappointed to find that the safest ATM in the country is no more.The Leinster House drink link, situated near the entrance to the LH 2000 annex, was very convenient for taking out the few bob to drop into a brown envelope when the need arose. It was also handy for withdrawing some cash prior to a trip to the Dáil bar or prior to a trip home from the Dáil bar.We liked it very much.It’s gone now and if the numbers complaining to this column is anything to go by, people are not happy at all. At the very least, they say the Leinster House community (it’s like a little village) should have been consulted.A spokesperson says the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission made a decision during the summer to have it removed. “When last in use the cash withdrawals were down to €200 weekly.” Another factor is that an ATM “is quite costly to keep on site”.However, politicians and staff say that footfall had to be down in the past year for obvious reasons. There were few people about, nearly everywhere in the city was closed and the businesses which were open were not taking cash. Now, with restrictions lifting, people are carrying money again.But an ATM in Leinster House will not be dispensing it. It’s not coming back.Golf baitThings you never thought you would hear until the pandemic came along last year and the world went mad:“Anything stirring in the Oireachtas Golf Society? Have you changed the name yet? Any sign of an agm? Any outings?”“Jesus, no! God no! Nothing. Nothing until next year at the earliest. Oh, God no. Sure the court case isn’t even over yet.”The disgraced Oireachtas Golf Society came to mind this week because of the palaver over the Ryder Cup, and particularly the antics of those half-doors who call themselves golf fans and roar stupid stuff like “Get in the hole!” and “You da man!” when someone tees off.Could we urgently dispatch Sinn Féin’s Louise O’Reilly to Whistling Straits in Wisconsin to teach the hollering corporate cheeseburgers a thing or two about voice projection.On Thursday, when Leo Varadkar was baiting Sinn Féin yet again during Leaders’ Questions, Louise’s voice majestically soared above the bickering.“Aah, gerrup the yard!”"},{"url":null,"title":"germany votes the election that could change europe s future","story":"Chancellor candidates Olaf Scholz of the Social Democrats, Annalena Baerbock of the Greens and Armin Laschet of the CDUCSU before a television debate last week.There’s a chill in the air of Berlin’s government quarter. Hints of red and yellow speckle the trees between the modernist chancellery and the historic Reichstag parliament, reminding me of the wistful urgency of Kurt Weill’s September Song.\u0026nbsp“When the autumn weather turns the leaves to flameI haven’t got time for the waiting game.”Jakob Heinze is tired of Germany’s waiting game on climate – and he’s tired from the hunger strike he began on August 30th.With half a dozen friends, he set up camp between parliament and the River Spree, starving in public as representatives of the “Last Generation” who can avoid irreversible climate change.Heinze, a 27-year-old campaigner with a bushy beard and tired eyes, says none of the main political programmes are ambitious enough to limit the 1.5 degree temperature rise required to avoid climate disaster – an analysis confirmed last week by a leading German economic think tank.If Europe’s largest country falls short, Heinze fears, the continent and the world will fail too.“I see hunger strike as the last means of civil disobedience, to make clear the disastrous situation in which we find ourselves, that soon there will be nowhere to hide,” said Heinze from a chair in front of his tent on Tuesday.The “Last Generation” camp had largely been wound up by the time huge crowds streamed through Berlin on Friday for Germany’s largest climate strike, lead this time by Sweden’s Fridays for Future founder, Greta Thunberg.\u0026nbspGermany is the sixth-largest emitter of carbon dioxide but, she said, its politicians were “duping” their voters, refusing to “treat the climate crisis as an emergency, not even after the terrible flood tragedy in the summer”.When 60.4 million Germans are called to the polls tomorrow, the election result has the potential to change Europe’s future – for better or worse.If you believe what Germans tell polling agencies, climate concerns are uppermost in voters’ minds as they head to the ballot box. Scratch beneath the surface, though, and the readiness for change evaporates amid cost and comfort concerns. Yes to green politics, no to more expensive petrol – and has anyone seen my SUV keys?That is cold comfort for locals in the southwestern state of Rhineland-Palatinate where, last July, the worst floods in the region for centuries washed away homes, businesses and left at least 183 dead. As the clear-up work continues, many towns here don’t even have lampposts to hang election posters from. Local Green Party candidate Martin Schmitt says the big climate question is secondary next to practical, every-day survival worries: electricity, water, heat for the winter.“At the moment, people’s shock is still so great that the federal election seems to be something from another planet,” he says.One hour north, in the pretty village of Keyenberg, locals are also fighting the loss of their homes. Not to flood waters but to local energy giant RWE. In a controversial deal with the state government of North Rhine-Westphalia, RWE has been granted permission to strip-mine the region and extract the Braunkohl – lignite – that lies beneath.Keyenberg, first mentioned 1,128 years ago, is one of five villages in this western region earmarked for destruction – and this although Germany has vowed to exit fossil fuels by 2038 at the latest.David Dresen grew up in Keyenberg, moved back here after studying in Bonn and expected to take over the family farm. While many neighbours have sold out to RWE and moved away, he is fighting to stay.“It makes no sense to me that today, in the 21st century, people should have to leave their homes to dig up lignite, which we know will ruin our future,” said the 29-year-old.Like most villagers, Dresen’s fury is directed at Armin Laschet, the state premier of North Rhine-Westphalia and the man hoping to retain the chancellery on Sunday for Germany’s centre-right Christian Democratic Union (CDU).“It is hypocritical for Armin Laschet to speak out for climate protection while being responsible for us losing our homes to lignite,” he says. “Germany has a reputation of being a leader on climate but the opposite is the case. People say they want climate protection but they prefer others – like us – to pay the price.”In an ironic footnote, he says that families left homeless by the July floods have now been housed in buildings awaiting demolition in Keyenberg. Today’s climate change victims in Germany live next door to tomorrow’s. At the end of the Merkel era, Germany’s unresolved climate struggle is inextricably linked with its unresolved energy dilemma.Along with coal, lignite – one of the dirtiest fuels known to man – contributes one quarter of Germany’s energy mix for homes, transport and heavy industry. Energy – and climate – pressures will increase still further next year, when – according to Chancellor Merkel’s post-Fukushima timetable – the last of Germany’s nuclear plants have to go off the grid.At her final press conference with journalists, days after the July floods, the chancellor insisted that she had “invested a lot of energy” in climate protection but, pressed by journalists, conceded that “not enough had happened” in her four terms.Last April Germany’s constitutional court agreed: it struck down her government’s climate plan for its lack of ambition, said it endangered the future of younger generations and forced a rushed rewrite.\u0026nbspDr Claudia Kemfert, energy expert at Berlin’s DIW economic institute, says the chancellor never pushed back energetically against Germany’s powerful energy and automative lobby.“Angela Merkel, as a former environment minister, started out as climate chancellor but unfortunately implemented too little of what would have been necessary from a climate protection perspective,” said Dr Kemfert. “The flood disaster at the very end of her chancellorship is symbolic: a result of unchecked climate change, for which Germany is partly responsible, is hitting Germany with full force.”No one expected much from Merkel when she scraped into power in 2005 – not even her own party – and certainly no one expected her to last 16 years. As chancellor, like a contestant in a demonic game show, she has faced an exhausting conveyor belt of crises: banking, euro, Ukraine, refugees, Covid-19. Through it all, Merkel remained a constant, consensus-seeking centre of calm. On the global political stage she proved that decency still matters, competence beats machismo, and modesty trumps Trump.Thanks to her herculean efforts, Europe’s centre has held. The question of Germany’s election, though, is: at what price? A clue lies in a 1991 television interview with a young Merkel that turned up recently online. In it, Helmut Kohl’s new family minister said she had a “longing for the possible” and preferred political compromises – but agreed that too many compromises bring a “risk of losing one’s truthfulness”.She returned to the theme recently, telling a leading German scientist how, early on as chancellor, she “made a fundamental decision to give all I can – but no more”.For good or ill, Merkelism is the perfection of politics as the art of the possible. The chancellor lifted the country out of economic decline, partly due to others’ reforms, largely insulated the country from the last decade’s shocks and made Germany the continent’s indispensable player.Her skill at compromise and will for European unity – most recently on joint EU deals on vaccine procurement and a joint recovery fund – means most Europeans, in a recent poll by the ECFR think tank, see Berlin as an integrating force and a trustworthy, pro-European power.But the downside of Merkelism – as France’s mercurial president Emmanuel Macron can attest – has been the Berlin-based drag on how Europe addresses growing challenges on the climate or global security.“Many of the most pressing challenges Europe faces\u0026nbspare impossible to address with the Merkel method,” the ECFR argued. “The EU will need a more visionary and courageous Germany to strengthen its foundations and defend its place in the world, many Europeans seem ready to accept this shift – and may even be waiting for Berlin to initiate it.”The key question – one that the three main chancellery candidates managed to avoid over three television debates – is whether Germany’s next government is prepared to make that leap.They are more likely to be preoccupied by Germany’s domestic reform building sites – climate change, energy transformation, dilapidated analogue and digital infrastructure, a pension time-bomb and more. The winner on Sunday may be the politician who promises voters a minimum of change at the least personal effort or cost.Germans crave stability and rewarded Merkel with four terms in office, where she perfected the art of making political omelettes without breaking any eggs. But her legacy of small-step politics – maximum consensus, minimum progress – remains palpable in German democracy, even if she is no longer on Sunday’s ballot.“This kind of democracy does not offer what is most necessary in these times of great transformation: an honest policy of demanding policies to take on the battle against crises, and maybe even to win,” argued Die Zeit weekly.Germany’s Greens took an early lead in polls with an ambitious plan: no more fossil fuels or permits for traditional cars by the end of the decade – rather than 2038 as agreed. Lead candidate Annalena Baerbock insisted Germany could become a world leader in industrial climate transformation technology – then sell its know-how to others.“The markets of the future are climate neutral,” she argued.But the Greens lost their poll lead after a series of gaffes, and when the personal cost of climate change became apparent. The CDU rose in polls with its new leader Armin Laschet. His confidence, some would say arrogance, that Merkel’s chancellery keys were his for the taking was dented in July when cameras spotted him laughing in a flood-wrecked town. Those images catalysed many voters’ doubts that this regional leader had the gravitas for the big stage in Berlin.His election pitch – tax cuts for the rich and dire warnings if Germany elected a leftist, non-CDU coalition – has struggled to catch the public mood.That honour goes to the centre-left Social Democratic Party (SPD) and its candidate Olaf Scholz. He has pitched himself as the continuity-but-change candidate with an election narrative and to-do list that his party says mixes realism with respect: tax hikes for top earners and measured climate measures that help, rather than overwhelm, business and lower incomes.With his party’s poll lead tightening this week, he warned voters in Nuremberg that Germany needs to shake off its Merkel-era “complacency” and do more: on research, investment and climate change.For young Germans like Jakob Heinze, resorting to hunger strike in Berlin, or David Dresen in his endangered home in Keyenberg, this is the issue at the heart of Sunday’s election. Can Germany shake off late Merkel-era mildew and embrace change as an opportunity – rather than a threat?“The Merkel government’s framing of the last years has always been, ‘we need change but too much or too fast is bad and expensive and you don’t want that’,” says Dresen. “That’s the big business lobby talking. I hope there are enough voters who realise that it’s only with change – well-managed change – that we will get through.”Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"analysis thousands usual dying not covid","story":"While focus remains firmly fixed on Covid-19, a second health crisis is quietly emerging in Britain. Since the beginning of July, there have been thousands of excess deaths that were not caused by coronavirus.According to health experts, this is highly unusual for the summer. Although excess deaths are expected during the winter months, when cold weather and seasonal infections combine to place pressure on the NHS, summer generally sees a lull.This year is a worrying outlier. According to the Office for National Statistics (ONS), since July 2 there have been 9,619 excess deaths in England and Wales, of which 48 per cent (4,635) were not caused by Covid-19.So if all these extra people are not dying from coronavirus, what is killing them?Data from Public Health England (PHE) shows that during that period there were 2,103 extra death registrations with ischemic heart disease, 1,552 with heart failure, as well as an extra 760 deaths with cerebrovascular diseases such as stroke and aneurysm and 3,915 with other circulatory diseases.Acute and chronic respiratory infections were also up with 3,416 more mentions on death certificates than expected since the start of July, while there have been 1,234 extra urinary system disease deaths, 324 with cirrhosis and liver disease and 1,905 with diabetes.Alarmingly, many of these conditions saw the biggest drops in diagnosis in 2020, as the NHS struggled to cope with the pandemic.A report released last week by the Government detailing the direct and indirect health impacts of the pandemic reported that there were an estimated 23 million fewer GP consultations – both in-person and online, in 2020 compared with 2019.Diagnosis of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) fell by 51 per cent, atrial fibrillation 26 per cent, heart failure 20 per cent, diabetes 19 per cent, coronary heart disease, 17 per cent and stroke and transient ischemic attack by 16 per cent.Since the start of the pandemic, charities and health bodies have warned that people were struggling to access care as the NHS switched to fighting the pandemic.Now, 18 months of delayed treatments may be starting to take their toll.Dr Charlotte Summers, an intensive care consultant from Addenbrookes Hospital, Cambridge, told a Royal Society of Medicine (RSM) event this week that patients were arriving at A\u0026ampE with serious conditions that had worsened during the pandemic. “There is an increase in non-Covid emergencies that are arriving at the front doors of hospitals from all the delays the pandemic has created already. Things like people presenting later with tumours, and therefore having bowel perforations and aneurysms and lots of other things that were delayed,” she said.“We\u0027ve got a massive elective backlog....and we’re potentially likely to have flu at increased levels this year because immunity to influenza will have waned.“Last winter, there was almost no RSV (Respiratory syncytial virus), and paediatric intensive care was pretty much empty and could help us out. Now they are absolutely teeming as are our emergency departments with adults and children with RSV infection.“It feels like winter is already here, rather than it is coming. It’s worse this year than I think I remember at any point in the last 20 years.”Data from NHS England suggest that there are around five million people currently waiting to begin treatment, and the Health Secretary Sajid Javid has warned that the figure could rise to 13 million.Elective operations fell by 3.5 million between March 2020 and February 2021 as the NHS prioritised Covid-19 care, and there was an increased staff absence due to illness, and the need to self-isolate.Between October and December 2020, approximately a quarter of all surgical activity in Britain was lost, with one in five operating theatres shut, and one in eight anesthetic staff absent from their normal duties.Emergency admissions also fell by 1.6 million as people failed to seek help for fear of burdening the NHS, or concerns they might catch Covid-19. A government report, put together by the Department of Health and Social Care and the ONS, found that while admissions recovered over the year, elective admissions by mid July were still lower than the pre-pandemic level for all cancers apart from colorectal.The authors warned that: “Although it is not possible to quantify the full impact of the delays in presentation, consultation and diagnosis stages at this point, the literature shows that these treatment delays are likely to lead to poorer health outcomes for patients.”The country is also suffering because of a lack of immunity. While lockdowns, social distancing, isolation and masks kept Covid-19 down, it also prevented other diseases from circulating.In the 52 weeks to the week ending July 11, 2021, there was a decrease in the number of reported infectious illnesses across diseases such as mumps (-72 per cent), rubella (-84 per cent) or yellow fever (-100 per cent) compared to the pre-pandemic five year average.Last year, the influenza-like illness rate peaked at 3.8 per 100,000, compared to a peak of 59 per 100,000 in 20172018.While this undoubtedly saved lives, we are beginning to experience a rise in infectious diseases that could hit us harder than ever this winter as we have less protection than normal.The danger is that these added pressures on the NHS will force the Government into locking down the country again this winter, mandating masks and work from home rules.If it does, we could end up in a perpetuating state of low-immunity in winter that it will be difficult to escape from. The Covid-19 response may have inadvertently created an ongoing health crisis from which there is no way back.More from NewsExperts who appear on BBC news \u0026#39should declare political views\u0026#39Police accuse courts of letting officers ‘take the flak’ over Insulate Britain protestsDenmark vows to resist Emmanuel Macron\u0026#39s EU army plansAirlines slash prices to as little as £15 in bid to kickstart foreign travelStop panic buying fuel, AA chief tells motorists amid chaotic scenes at petrol stations\u0026#39Beyond the cult of Churchill\u0026#39: New Netflix film Munich shows Chamberlain in \u0026#39sympathetic light\u0026#39More from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"queen came ideas london 2012 olympics james bond sketch reveals","story":"The Queen came up with ideas for the London 2012 Olympics James Bond skit herself, Daniel Craig has revealed.Her Majesty’s big reveal during the opening ceremony video, is which she appears sitting at a bureau scribbling notes, was the Queen’s inspiration.As she took direction from Danny Boyle, the monarch fired back, suggesting tweaks to the sketch. Craig, 53, told BBC Radio 2’s Zoe Ball Breakfast Show: “The Olympics thing was one of those things where suddenly Danny Boyle was on set. Barbara (Broccoli) said to me, ‘Can you come and have a word with Danny?’“And I sat in the room and he pitched this idea to me, and I just went, ‘You’re out of your mind, what are you talking about?’“I was right in the middle of a scene and I kind of went ‘yeah, ok’, and then sort of walked off. And the next thing you know I’m literally on the way to Buckingham Palace in a tuxedo and we shoot it.“And Her Majesty’s there, and Danny’s giving her notes. It’s kind of great - ‘Your Majesty, could you possibly erm...?’  And she’s improvising a bit. She literally kind of said ‘Would you like me to pretend to be writing?’  And he’s like, ‘yes, that’s great, that’s great’.“So, she sort of acted a bit. That was all her own stuff. It was amazing.“She was great – calmer than me. My heart was going, ‘dum, dum, dum, dum, keep it together, keep it together’.“Literally there’s corgis tripping you up. There’s like, five corgis.”Speaking on Friday, he added: “If you put it in The Crown they’d think it was rubbish. They would be like, ‘no, it’s not real’.“I was rolling around with the corgis on the floor at one point in Buckingham Palace.”The skit saw Bond escorting the Queen from Buckingham Palace before appearing to parachute into the Olympic Stadium alongside her. While the Queen herself acted out shots at the palace, the second part of her cameo, where she floated down to the stadium, was played by a stuntman in a wig.Craig’s latest 007 outing as Bond, in No Time To Die, directed by Cary Fukunaga, is released on Thursday.More from NewsExperts who appear on BBC news \u0026#39should declare political views\u0026#39Police accuse courts of letting officers ‘take the flak’ over Insulate Britain protestsDenmark vows to resist Emmanuel Macron\u0026#39s EU army plansAirlines slash prices to as little as £15 in bid to kickstart foreign travelStop panic buying fuel, AA chief tells motorists amid chaotic scenes at petrol stations\u0026#39Beyond the cult of Churchill\u0026#39: New Netflix film Munich shows Chamberlain in \u0026#39sympathetic light\u0026#39More from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"wind farms paid nearly 2m switch customers face soaring energy","story":"Wind farms were paid more than £1.8 million to shut down this week – at a time when consumers face huge rises in energy bills because of the spiralling cost of natural gas.The turbines were switched off over the course of three days because the electricity they would have produced could not have reached the regions that needed it. Instead, electricity from gas-fired power stations was used at a further cost to consumers of several million pounds.An analysis by the Renewable Energy Foundation (REF), a charitable think tank that has criticised wind energy over its reliability and cost, found that 38 wind farms – all in Scotland – received payments totalling £1.85 million over the course of three days not to generate electricity.The constraint payments are made by the National Grid to balance supply and demand across the electricity network. Payments tend to be highest on warm, windy days when turbines can produce a lot of electricity that is not needed.Dr John Constable, the director of REF, said: Uncontrollable and heavily subsidised generation such as wind-power has made the UK electricity system into a costly and dysfunctional joke. High winds, low winds – whatever the weather, the consumer suffers. It\u0027s almost the only thing about wind that is reliable.REF estimated that the biggest payment, of just over £400,000, went to Moray East offshore wind farm, and £167,000 to Griffin wind farm.The cost of wholesale gas, used in gas-fired power stations, has soared in recent months amid claims that Russia is manipulating supply, threatening to push back the post-Covid recovery in Europe.The crisis has cast a spotlight on Britain\u0027s energy mix amid deepening concern that the country has become reliant on a combination of increasingly expensive gas and wind power, which critics say is unreliable and costly because of consumer subsidies.A spokesperson for the National Grid Electricity System Operator said: Constraint payments are the most efficient option to balance supply and demand, keep costs down for consumers and ensure secure and reliable electricity.The alternative to constraint payments is building more electricity transmission infrastructure, which is more costly, meaning consumers\u0027 bills would rise. We continuously weigh up constraint costs versus the cost of building an asset in a comprehensive cost-benefit analysis.More from NewsExperts who appear on BBC news \u0026#39should declare political views\u0026#39Police accuse courts of letting officers ‘take the flak’ over Insulate Britain protestsDenmark vows to resist Emmanuel Macron\u0026#39s EU army plansAirlines slash prices to as little as £15 in bid to kickstart foreign travelStop panic buying fuel, AA chief tells motorists amid chaotic scenes at petrol stations\u0026#39Beyond the cult of Churchill\u0026#39: New Netflix film Munich shows Chamberlain in \u0026#39sympathetic light\u0026#39More from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"airlines slash prices little 15 bid kickstart foreign travel","story":"Airlines have slashed prices to as little as £15 for October half-term flights to Europe in a bid to persuade fully-jabbed holidaymakers to take advantage of the reopening of foreign travel.Half-term flights to popular Spanish resorts including Alicante and Tenerife are up to 30 per cent below pre-pandemic prices as airlines seek to pump-prime the autumn holiday market.Low-cost airline EasyJet is offering October flights from Luton to Fuerteventura, the second biggest Canary Island, at £15.08, and at £22.99 for UK flights to Malaga and Faro.Skyscanner, which monitors prices and bookings, said there are also last-minute deals on offer for Milan from £19, Nice from £41, Pisa from £51 and Barcelona from £98.It follows the Government’s announcement that pre-departure tests for returning holidaymakers will be ditched from Oct 4 and PCR tests on arrival in the UK could be replaced by cheaper lateral flow versions in time for the October half-term.“There are a lot of offers being added onto the market for October and November to encourage people to return to flying but prices for next summer are going up and are about 10 per cent higher than this year,” said Paul Charles, chief executive of the travel consultancy The PC Agency.The cost-cutting appears to be targeted more at city-break destinations like Milan, Lyon and Amsterdam where there is generally less demand than for late autumn beach resort breaks.However, Alicante flights are averaging £125 for half term week, nearly 30 per cent below pre pandemic charges of £164. Tenerife is similar with prices a third lower, at £227 compared with £299 before Covid and Malaga at £131 against £159.It has meant that some holidaymakers who booked their flights earlier in the summer have seen prices plummet below their original outlay.Property developer Ian Dunckley and his wife Steph from Medbourne, Leicestershire paid £216 per easyJet flight from Luton to Faro for the first week of the October half-term with children Hattie, 15, and Tom, 16.However, the prices have since been slashed to less than £70. “We knew it was a gamble booking in June and we had no idea what the situation would be come October,” said Mrs Dunckley.“But we’re staying in a friend’s apartment so didn’t have to worry about losing money on accommodation and we knew that, if we were unable to fly, easyJet would honour our flights and hold over our booking to the ski season or our next holiday.”Travel experts have, however, warned that prices may ratchet up if demand increases and seats are steadily filled. It already appears to have hit the business flight market for popular resorts.Secondary school teacher Simon Hare revealed that the two return flights he booked a month ago to Madrid in BA business class for Covid reasons because of the extra space have doubled in price from £567.“I checked to see how much they were when the traffic light system was dropped and the exact same flights were priced at over £1,300,” he said.Gavin Harris, pricing expert at Skyscanner, said: “Now more than ever it is in the interest of travellers and the industry to keep prices as competitive as possible in order to reboot travel.“Travel fares always fluctuate following any major announcement on travel, and that’s true for pre-pandemic times too, for instance if a new route opens up.“What happens is that there is a short period of time for pricing to adjust to new demand levels, and then they usually return to close to what they were before the announcement.”More from NewsExperts who appear on BBC news \u0026#39should declare political views\u0026#39Police accuse courts of letting officers ‘take the flak’ over Insulate Britain protestsDenmark vows to resist Emmanuel Macron\u0026#39s EU army plansStop panic buying fuel, AA chief tells motorists amid chaotic scenes at petrol stations\u0026#39Beyond the cult of Churchill\u0026#39: New Netflix film Munich shows Chamberlain in \u0026#39sympathetic light\u0026#39Lancet accused of sexism after calling women ‘bodies with vaginas’More from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"stop panic buying fuel aa chief tells motorists amid chaotic","story":"Fuel shortages at some petrol stations have been driven by panic buying, rather than supply-chain issues, according to the president of the AA.There have been chaotic scenes at forecourts after BP announced on Thursday evening that it was closing some pumps and rationing petrol and diesel because of a lack of lorry drivers. On Friday, EG Group also said it was imposing a £30 limit at its 400 petrol stations.But Edmund Kind, president of the AA, told BBC Breakfast that drivers were exacerbating the shortages by filling up unnecessarily, insisting that “there is plenty of fuel at source”.“We were in discussions with government ministers last night and we talked to the major fuel companies, and we can reiterate there is not a problem with supply at the source,” he said. “Earlier in the week, there were some problems with the supply chain, as we know, due to a shortage of some lorry drivers, but that was only a localised problem.”There has been a deluge of posts from motorists across the country sharing images of closed forecourts and, where pumps are open, long queues as drivers in the last 48 hours. “We are driving up to London and there is chaos at every petrol station, queues even back onto the motorway,” one Twitter user, Lorraine, wrote on Saturday morning. “Quite an ugly atmosphere at the Shell petrol station across the road,” added Alex Andreou. “Long queues, most pumps out, tooted horns and shouted words.”But Mr King suggested the chaos was unlikely to last, as the supply chain has not been disrupted by ongoing challenges such as industrial action. “The good news is you can only really fill up once - you\u0027ve got to use the fuel, so this should be a short-term thing,” Mr King said. “It\u0027s not like the fuel crises in the past when the supplier was hit by strikes, etc.”But, he warned that the threat of shortages of lorry and HGV drivers is likely to continue.   “The market is stretched, so I think that is a broader issue that is affecting the supply chain, not just the petrol and diesel, but retail as well,” My King said. The Government is expected to announce that visa requirements for lorry drivers will be relaxed to help ease the crisis.Up to to 5,000 temporary visas for HGV drivers are expected to be granted under the plans, which Boris Johnson is expected to sign this weekend.More from NewsExperts who appear on BBC news \u0026#39should declare political views\u0026#39Police accuse courts of letting officers ‘take the flak’ over Insulate Britain protestsDenmark vows to resist Emmanuel Macron\u0026#39s EU army plansAirlines slash prices to as little as £15 in bid to kickstart foreign travel\u0026#39Beyond the cult of Churchill\u0026#39: New Netflix film Munich shows Chamberlain in \u0026#39sympathetic light\u0026#39Lancet accused of sexism after calling women ‘bodies with vaginas’More from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"blind paralympic who glued himself","story":":root Blind Paralympian who glued himself to roof of British Airways plane jailedFormer two-time gold medallist James Brown, who represented himself during his trial, was jailed today after costing British Airways £, and disrupting  passengers Image: PAByHenry VaughanShiler Mahmoudi:,  Sep Updated:,  Sep | commentsA former Paralympian and Extinction Rebellion activist who glued himself to the roof a plane has been jailed for a year.On October  , athlete James Brown, , managed to climb onto the British Airways aircraft and superglued himself to its roof as part of an Extinction Rebellion protest against flying at London City Airport. Brown, who is completely blind and had previously been awarded two gold medals for Great Britain in cycling and athletics, glued his right hand on the plane that was headed to Amsterdam. He had also pushed his mobile phone into the door to stop it from closing, and was able to hold the plane up for an hour before being removed. Northern Ireland-born Brown had also gone on to represent Ireland in cross-country skiing, but was arrested after he caused disruption to more than  British Airways passengers, costing the airline £,.  Brown represented himself during his trial and denied one count of causing a public nuisance, claiming he had to do something spectacular to draw attention to the climate crisis. On Friday  September, he was found guilty at Southwark Crown Court in July after a jury deliberated for less than an hour and Judge Gregory Perrins sentenced him to  monthsapos imprisonment, of which he will serve half.He told Brown: The right to protest does not entitle you to cause major widespread disruption to a major airport... simply because you think it is the right thing to do. Judge Perrins said: This is a case in which you acted together with at least  other activists to plan and execute a major act of disruption.You intended to cause the maximum amount of disruption possible at the airportnot shut it down completely.The judge told accomplished athlete Brown: You cynically used your disability to put your plan into action, adding: You put your own le at risk by climbing on top of the plane.He said he accepted Brown was motivated by a desire to bring about a change you genuinely believe is for the benefit of all and that there must be a sense of proportionality when sentencing those who commit offences during a protestDramatic stunts that changed the world as Greenpeace celebrates its th anniversaryBut he told Brown there is no entitlement to more lenient treatment because he was protesting about the environment.The court heard that Brown had booked his flight on the morning of the stunt and had been offered assistance boarding due to his disability.He had a bottle of superglue in his luggage that had not been detected by security, prosecutor Richard Witcombe told the jury during Brownaposs trial.Brown declined an offer by a member of cabin staff to help him to his seat, telling her that he was going to climb on to the roof of the plane.Giving evidence, he wept as he told jurors: I was prepared to challenge myself, to be scared, to face the fear, because the fear of climate ecological breakdown is so much greater.In an emotional speech, married father-of-four Brown, who runs a charity, said: My protest, the purpose I hope is clear, my motivation was to maximise media attention to the climate crisis, which back at that time was hardly receiving any. Tim Maloney QC, defending Brown at his sentencing hearing, said: He has expressed an intention not to become involved in unlawful protest again.Mr Maloney said Brown has overcome the barriers to live a successful and inspiring le, competing at five Paralympic games and becoming a successful businessman.There is so much more to his le than sporting excellence, he said as he described Brownaposs career as a maths teacher before working for Gloucestershire County council in disabled childrenaposs services.He also built a conference centre aimed at meeting the needs of disabled people and set up Mobiloo, a company which provides facilities for disabled people at festivals and events.

But she added: “No one can say I am trying to emulate Keir and certainly no one will say that Keir is trying to emulate me.” Askedshe wanted to be leader one day, she said: “I’ve seen what we do to our leaders - it petries me! “We are so brutal, even within our own movement we can be pretty brutal to our leaders. “I just want to make a dference.” She laid bare the frustrations of spending her six years in the Commons in opposition. “The thing I regret most about being in Parliament since I’ve been elected and had the privilege of representing my constituency is Iaposve been voted down so many times because we’re not in government,” she said. “I can do a good round at PMQs but that’s not going to change things for working people of this country. “What I need to do is get us into government. If I can get my little hands on getting into government in any way, stretch or form I can, Iaposll do it.”Ms Rayner revels in her role as the confident, bold and brash face and voice of Labour on the airwaves.But she admitted she gets “frightened” touring the TV and radio studios.  “It frightens me to put myself forward all the time in the way that I do as an inidual because it’s a lot of pressure, but I also think it’s important that I’m not there to represent me, I’m there to represent the people that elected me,” she said. “You don’t want to let people down, when you put yourself forward on the national stage like that.” She dismissed the brewing internal row over Labour elects future leaders as argy bargy. Keir Starmer wants to tear up the current one member, one vote system and replace it with an electoral college. That regime was axed in  to give grassroots activists the power to pick the party premier. But Mr Starmer wants toto the system that gives MPs a third of the vote, the unions a third and ordinary Labour members a third. Ms Rayner said: “It wouldn’t be a conferencewe didn’t have some form of argy bargy. “I’ve never been to a Labour Party or a trade union conference where there isn’t an argy bargy on something. “But I do think we should have a respectful debate.”  But the former union official refused to be drawn on the row. Askedshe supported the proposed overhaul, she said: “We will see what happens.” She added: “Keir’s said he wants to look at that, he’s said he wants to discuss it and consult, and heaposs doing that, and I think that’s fine. “What I don’t want it to be is a big, internal fight within the Labour Party - I think that’s very disastrous for us because ided parties don’t win elections.” She feared a row would derail Labour’s chance to showcase policies in Brighton. “I would hate to think that people’s messages out of conference‘the Labour Party are not focusing outwards’ - and I know that Keir shares that vision,” said Ms Rayner. “But you have to fix your internal as well as your external.” She added: “We make no apologies for reviewing all of the issues that we face internally, as well as focusing on the country, because we have to be ready to govern. “Me and Keir are very clear on that.” Comment MORE ON Labour PartyPMQsBoris JohnsonPolitics\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Scotlandaposs Lord Advocate Dorothy Bain QC announced that those caught with Class A substances could receive a police warning rather than prosecution. Police will be able to use their discretion in inidual cases - but those supplying hard drugs will still face criminal charges.The Labour leader, a former Director of Public Prosecutions, said the decision was probably the right thing to do - but said drug laws should not be ripped up.Officers can already use their discretion to issue warnings to those caught with Class B and C drugs - such as barbiturates and cannabis - under current Scottish laws. This has now been extended to Class A substances, which also include ecstasy, crack cocaine and magic mushrooms. In the interview with ITVaposs Representing Border, Mr Starmer said: There is a world of dference between a decision not to prosecute a particular case and ripping up the drug laws. It is not unusual in any legal system for those caught with small amounts of cannabis not to be prosecuted. I donapost think many people would argue that that discretion isnapost sensible. The very same in Scotland - there is a world of dference between that exercise and saying aposdo you think drug laws should be scrapped apos to which my answer is no.

Scotlandaposs drug minister Angela Constance hailed the move as very signicant as Scotland aims to reduce drugs deaths - which reached a record , in .  She added the change will only be an option in cases of possession for inidual use, not where someone is suspected of being involved in supplying drugs to others. Ms Constance told BBC Radio Scotland the change had been welcomed by all parties at Holyrood with the exception of the Conservatives. Conservative justice spokesman Jamie Greene said the change means people will now be receiving the same punishment for carrying Class A drugs as they would for urinating in public.He added: Under the SNP, drug deaths have become our national shame, but their plans for an effective decriminalisation of drugs is not the way to solve this scandal.He insisted the Government must rethink this dangerous approach, which dilutes how seriously we treat possession of the most deadly drugs in our society.

The burden fell on those who couldn’t work from home and those who were already struggling, he says.He goes on to say people want to emerge from lockdown into something better, as Brits did when they emerged from the Second World War, adding: I believe we are living through a time when the inidualism that prioritises personal entitlement, moral superiority and self-interest is receding in society’s rear-view mirror.  He says: “Britain under the next Labour government will no longer be trampled by the tyranny of low expectations. “If we are to reimagine what is possible, we will need to demand high standards. “If we are to unlock the vast reserves of potential and productivity in this country, we will need to be restless. “If we are to overcome cynicism, we will need to be the party of practical action.”Labour is pro-business and will aposfixapos the Brexit dealBoris Johnson once reportedly said f*** business when told firms feared Brexit would damage the economy. Trade barriers have added an extra £m in cost since Britain left the EU and there is a growing frustration over red tape, staff shortagesand empty supermarket shelves. Starmer underlines he sees business as a force for good and pledges to fix the holes in the shoddy Brexit deal and rebuild ties with Europe. He says: We have seen from the government’s failure to properly manage our departure from the European Union what happens when the expertise and concerns of business are ignored. The sight of empty shelves in our supermarkets should be embarrassing to ministers who failed to understand the complex supply chains and streamlined logistics that British businesses rely upon. By creating unnecessary red tape and bureaucracy, the government has cost both businesses and consumers. The Labour leader has very little to say on immigration, however, saying only that the idea that the immigration and social security systems are a free-for-all has been fertile territory for populist politicians, who have sowed mistrust. Labour will refuse to fight the culture wars Many claim Boris Johnsonaposs Tories are keen to fight the next election on the culture wars and woke issues, as campaigners raise questions on Britainaposs history, and racial, gender and social equality. Starmer calls the Tories war on woke an increasingly bizarre obsession and makes clear that he sees the battleground dferently. Rather, he thinks Labour should not wade into every row and instead focus on opposing the conspiracy theories, crankery, misinformation and hatred allowed to flourish, often as part of the debate.  He says the Government has many slogans, such as levelling up, but adds: In the absence of a defining economic project or plan, theTories have instead plunged headfirst into the murky depths of the so-called ‘culture wars’. Building bonds between fellow citizens has never been more crucial, he later adds. But rather than take on these challenges, the Conservatives have tried to exploit isions, leading to an increasingly bizarre obsession with what happens on university campuses, a crime bill that offers statues of slavers more protection than women walking down the street, and McCarthyite accusations of Marxist plots against everyone from teachers to those protesting racism. But Starmer has some fighting talk for the SNP Rather than the culture wars, Starmer sees the SNPaposs push for independence and what he calls the rise of the multi-headed hydra of nationalism as a more immediate threat.Hinting at how Labour might make the case for the Union in any second independence referendum north of the border, he claims the SNP and Scottish Tories feed off ision.He says: Both the SNP and the Conservatives use culture to distract and deflect, creating ision between people of these islands. The business of effective governance and improving people’s lives comes second to ideology. Both use nationalism freely to whip up fear of the other.  He adds: Nationalists like to portray themselves as patriots. But patriotism and nationalism are not the same. In fact, they are opposites. Nationalism represents an attempt to ide people from one another patriotism is an attempt to unite people of dferent backgrounds. Nationalism is about the casting out of the other patriotism is about finding common ground. Nationalism is the flag as a threat. Patriotism is the flag as a celebration. These are lines which will be highly contested by Nicola Sturgeon and other pro-independence figures. The Corbyn era and Labour aposnavel gazingapos is officially over Frustration at Corbynaposs rejection of Blairaposs years in power run through the treatise, with Starmer fuming that in recent years the party has been squabbling over its own past, rather than one focused on the future. He contrasts Labouraposs towering achievement in government with long periods of self-doubt and navel-gazing and lambasts his predecessor, saying: We had moved from being the party of ‘white heat’ to the party of sepia-tinged nostalgia. He adds: In recent decades, the legacy of the  Labour government has become contested to the extent that the party has at times felt like separate families living under one roof. This has been harmful and alienating. It has not progressed the cause of achieving a Labour government and has been damaging to our country. Jeremy Corbyn is not mentioned once in the document Boris Johnsonwhile the word aposfutureapos crops up some  times.Tony Blair is back in fashion In , Blair gave the  anniversary lecture for the Fabian Society, and he called it Let Us Face The Future. In Starmeraposs essay, for the same think tank, the Labour leader appears to directly reference Blairaposs critique of his party in , writing We must take inspiration from  – but that cannot mean dwelling on the past. Instead, we must face the future. He adds: “It is impossible to live in this moment and not feel the winds of changes blowing, just as they did in  and .”  He also mirrors some of New Labouraposs language, calling for a new settlement between the government, business and working people, a new deal for working people and an effective partnership of state and private sector, which sees Starmer distance himself from Corbynaposs policies of renationalising services like utilities and rail. Throughout, Starmer holds up Blairaposs, and Gordon Brownaposs successes and ambition for the country in opposition to the Toriesapos record. Starmer backs new laws to tackle racial inequality - but is less clear on trans rights Starmer pledges a new Race Equality Act and his view to tackle complex structural racism which exists in Britain. This follows the vile racism faced by England stars such as Marcus Rashford after they took the knee at games and outcry over a highly-criticised Government-commission report which claimed to have found no evidence of systemic racism in the UK. The Labour leader writes: When people across the world come together to say that black lives matter, when England footballers take the knee before the biggest games of their lives and when black people chant ‘we can’t breathe’,they aren’t asking for more nice words or inquiries – they are demanding real progress. We would introduce a new Race Equality Act in the UK, aimed at tackling the complex structural racism that holds back people from every community. While Labour has said separately that it backs reforming Gender Recognition Act and self-declaration for trans people, Starmeraposs essay makes no mention of trans rights.Mental health waiting list targets Starmer said, as Blair set his Government waiting NHS waiting list targets in , he would back similar targets for mental health services. This follows reports that people needing support for mental health problems ranging from depression and anxiety to psychosis and eating disorders are left waiting months and in some cases years for help. He said: The  Labour government set ambitious targets for waiting lists in the NHS and they worked: the next Labour government will set ourselves the same challenge on mental health. The mental health charity Mind suggest that just one in eight adults with a mental health problem are currently getting treatment  and waiting lists are soaring. The leader plans to stick around... and for a long time  Perhaps most revealing were the final words of Starmeraposs treatise, in which he makes clear he in post for the long haul. It comes amid speculation he could face a challenge from the Left of his party and critics pointing out that Labour has yet to catch up with the Tories in the polls while an election could come as early as . Starmer says: To anyone who believes in a better future, based on these principles, I say: join us. The road ahead will be long. The journey will not always be simple. But the choices are clear and the prize at the end great. At this historic moment, Labour has a chance to once again build a better country for working people. This is the path we have chosen: let us take it together.

Some , supermarket employees - % of the total - and , carers - % of the workforce - are paid less than the benchmark for decent living standards. The Real Living Wage’s hourly rates are £. outside London and £. in the capital. Analysts calculate the voluntary level by taking into account costs like housing, travel and healthy food, and extras like kids’ birthday presents. It is paid regardless of employeesapos ages. In contrast, the Governmentaposs “national living wage” – the rebranded minimum wage – is £. an hour and only paid to workers aged  and over.  Hourly minimum pay for under-s is £. the rate for workers aged  to  is £. and the minimum for those aged  and  is £.. Some , key workers are set to lose their £ per week Universal Credit rise later next month, according to RSA calculations. But lting carers’ pay to the Real Living Wage would pump an extra £ a year into their wallets before tax - and cost the sector £million, the RSA says. The average supermarket worker would be £ better off. In a move which would cost the industry £m annually. The RSA’s future of work programme chief Alan Lockey said: “We need to focus on good work for everyoneweaposre to level-up. Boosting the incomes of the lowest-paid key workers would be good for those employees, good for UK productivity, and good for the workforce as a whole as this would likely raise wages across the board.  We also need to see a ‘new deal’ for our key worker heroes, including better childcare, decent sick pay and better mental health support, especially in the NHS.” Living Wage Foundation director Graham Grfith said: “Supermarket staff and care workers have been vital in keeping the country fed and cared for throughout the pandemic. “This important report shows that all too often this commitment is very poorly rewarded, with almost one million supermarket and care workers earning below the Real Living Wage. “It’s time these essential workers are paid a Real Living Wage, so that they can put food on the table and care for their own families, as well as ours.”Most ReadDont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Living standardsMental healthMinimum wageNational Living WageUniversal CreditPoliticsLiving wage\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Have a story to tell The good news is Labour is a party rooted in strong values. The bad news is they have few policies on which to hang those values. Nobody is expecting the party to produce a fully-costed manesto this far out from a general election. But voters would like a taster of what Labour would do in power.Until Keir Starmer has something to say he will remain vulnerable to the Tory attack that he is carping on the sidelines while they get on with the business of government.The Labour leader urgently needs a story to tell of how his party will improve people’s lives and transform the fortunes of the country. Be more nimble Opposition is hard. It is especially demoralising when you are up against a party with an -seat majority. All opposition parties face the same Catch-: you cannot get a fair hearing because people are sceptical you can win power but you cannot win power unless you get a fair hearing. Labour needs to be quicker to seize the few opportunities it gets. When major news events occur, such as the energy crisis, then it should be on the front foot saying how they would do things dferently. Lead, don’t follow. Be more welcoming At some point Labour forgot the basic rule of politics - to gain power you need to win people over to your side. That means welcoming people with whom you may disagree, including Tory voters. Fairly or unfairly the perception of Labour is of a party that has become a haven for the self-righteous, the worthy and the woke rather than an organisation that represents all sections of society. The party has been better at preaching than reaching out. It needs to starting building bridges so former voters can feel comfortable ing to the party. Regain trust Obviously, this is easier said than done. In some areas, such as health and education, Labour is still trusted by the voters but in others, notably the economy and immigration, they have lost the confidence of the public. There has been some progress since Starmer became leader but more must be done to prove that Labour can once again be trusted with the country’s finances.  Stop fighting internal battles Labour has always been a broad church. When in power this can be something to celebrate but in opposition this can be a liability. In recent years the congregation has spent more time engaged in feuds and bloodletting than in singing with one voice. Rather than seeking converts, they have preferred to hunt dissenters. Instead of attacking the Tories, they have spent more time attacking each other. Those who called for unity under previous leaderships may wish to start practising what they used to preach. Broaden the palate If the Labour Party does not stand up for the vulnerable, the poorest and the voiceless then it has no purpose. As Harold Wilson said, Labour is a moral crusade or it is nothing. It is right that the opposition holds the Government to account on poverty and social security. But Labour cannot be seen as exclusively as the party of welfare and the NHS. Issues such as the technological revolution, the changing face of work, and law and order also matter to voters yet Labour has so far had little to say on these subjects.  You cannot please everyone Yes, elections are won by those parties with the broadest appeal but you have to realise you cannot please everyone. Voters have an instinctive ability to tell when a politician is saying something for the sake of it rather than because they believe it. Certain sections of the public may not always agree with you but they have more respect for someone who sticks to their beliefs than someone who tries to pretend they are something they are not.Labour’s contortions over Brexit demonstrated there is much to be lost and little to be gained by trying to sit on the fence.Remind people of your record Labour governments can make a dference. In power Labour introduced the Equal PayAct, Sure Start, the Equality Act, the national minimum wage and Sex Discrimination Act . If you spend your time trashing your record in government don’t be surprisedvoters start to share that opinion. If you take pride in what you achieved then voters will be reminded of why they once voted for you.  Rediscover aspiration The former leader of the Transport and General Workers Union Ron Todd once said: “What do you say to a docker who earns £ a week, owns his house, a new car, a microwave and a video, as well as a small place near Marbella  You do not say ‘let me take you out of your misery, brother’.” Labour has a great story to tell on aspiration, it just forgets to say it. The party needs to remind people how its policies have helped lt people out of poverty, given them an education and opened doors they thought were closed. Unite the Kingdom If the Tories insist on playing the isive card, Labour needs to deal the unity one. The vast majority of Britons are fed up with culture wars, arguments over Brexit and the constant attempts to play off one part of society against another. The temptation is engage with the Conservative games. A better strategy would be to present yourselves as unying force that can heal the wounds the Tories have opened.

At its party conference this weekend Lucy Powell, Shadow Housing Secretary, is expected to unveil her plans to re-establish the link between genuinely affordable housing and average earnings. Labour hopes to bring affordable rents and the dream of home ownership closer for those locked out of the system today. They will also stop foreign investors snapping up homes before they are built, and often leaving them empty.  The Tories will need to nail their housing policies as the sector is key to levelling up the country and reducing inequalities between the north and south.Itaposs seen as a key element of levelling up - and some in the Conservative Party wonder whether Mr Gove has been given his new job to drive development. Today Ms Powell slammed the Tories housing failures, branding Conservatives as “the party of speculators and developers”. “The Conservatives’ failures on housing today mean that they don’t have the answers to solve the challenges of tomorrow.“They treat housing as a commodity, not the bedrock of stable lives and le chances.”  It follows Michael Gove’s appointment as Levelling Up, Housing and Communities Secretary in last week’s reshuffle.Learning of his new role, Ms Powell was quick to say she looks forward to being his opponent.Many have deemed Mr Gove’s appointment as Levelling Up Secretary as Boris Johnson giving him a huge issue that could make or break the next election, Ahead of conference, Ms Powell MP said: “The country is facing a housing crisis with the link between hard work and getting on the housing ladder broken for many.

At the heart of the party’s proposal to revive the struggling sector is legislating for collective bargaining so trade unions can negotiate pay and terms on behalf of workers.The move would bolster care for those in need - and boost wages and staff retention, said Labour aposs deputy leader, Ms Rayner.The industry is notorious for low pay and employees quitting the sector.Former agency care worker and Unison trade union official Ms Rayner unveils the plan at the party’s annual conference in Brighton on Saturday - and vows to make it her top priorityKeir Starmer becomes Prime Minister. Speaking exclusively to the Mirror, which is campaigning for Fair Care for All, she said: “I have seen that the collective voice improves not just the standards for workers but improves the level of care and the service that people get. “I was really passionate about it when I was a home carer.” Boris Johnson famously declared on his first day as PM in July  that “I am announcing now, on the steps of Downing Street, that we will fix the crisis in social care once and for all with a clear plan we have prepared to give every older person the dignity and security they deserve” - before waiting  months to publish it.Ms Rayner, the party’s Shadow Secretary of State for the Future of Work, signalled Labour’s plan would be brought to Parliament less than three weeks after the party s to office. “Within the days of the next Labour Government .. the first thing I’m going to say, when Keir’s Prime Minister, is ‘Right, this is what my driving goal as Deputy Prime Minister is - to drive this Employment Rights Bill right the way through so we can deliver that immediately’,” she revealed. Under Labour’s plan for Fair Pay Agreements, workers’ leaders and bosses would “be brought together by the Government to establish and agree minimum pay, terms and conditions which will be binding on all employers and workers in the sector”, the party said.  It added: “The Fair Pay Agreement would then form a ‘floor’ in a sector, preventing exploitative employers from undercutting the many good employers.”Ms Rayner blasted the right-wing caricature of collective bargaining, saying people think it “is about Punch ‘n’ Judy, the management versus the staff and the union”.Recalling how she fought for better conditions when she was a union rep, she added: “Actually we worked collaboratively to have a programme called Delivering the Workforce which meant that the girls that worked in home care - and they were predominantly women then - had a career path, they had a skills training set. “The staff retention was amazing, staff sickness levels went down, therefore the employers saved money, the service was improved and the workers had better work le balance and better terms and conditions. “I see collective bargaining as a win-win.” Ms Rayner said care work could be “incredibly rewarding but it can be demoralisingyou don’t get the time and the training to do the job properly”. “You feel it personally,” she said. Fair Pay Agreements would begin in the care sector but eventually be rolled out to other sectors. “I think every industry should look at it,” said Ms Rayner. They would work alongside existing pay agreements and legal minimums, such as the £-an-hour minimum wage which Labour pledges for all workers. In contrast, the Governmentaposs “national living wage” – the rebranded minimum – is £. an hour and only paid to workers aged  and over.  Hourly minimum pay for under-s is £. the rate for workers aged  to  is £. and the minimum for those aged  and  is £.. Sipping tea at Powell’s Eats in South East London, where the words “Good Hope” are spelt on the wall, Ms Rayner, , expanded on her plan to overhaul workers’ rights. Labour’s shake-up would “not only deliver for workers, which I think is crucial … it’s also good for our economy and local economies,” she said. “We are in a cafe now - local people will be using this cafe.

The EG Group said in a statement that the move was intended to ensure everyone would have a “fair chance to refuel” and to enable sites to carry on smoothly, Manchester Evening News reports.The £ limit will not apply to emergency services and lorry drivers because of their “vital role”, the company said. The announcement comes as the government looks into introducing temporary measures to tackle the shortage of HGV drivers that has signicantly impacted a number of industries. Boris Johnson is reportedly considering relaxing UK immigration rules to allow more foreign drivers into the country, although No  insisted any measures would be “very strictly time-limited”.Up to , temporary visas could be granted for HGV drivers, according to the Financial Times and the , as authorities scramble to tackle the problem of empty supermarket shelves and closed petrol stations.Esso, BP and Tesco forecourts have been affected by challenges getting petrol deliveries. BP said that around  or its , forecourts were closed due to a lack of available fuel, and between  and  sites have been affected by the loss of at least one grade of fuel. Esso owner ExxonMobil said a “small number” of Tesco refilling stations have also been impacted. In a statement published by the EG group, a spokesperson said: “Due to the current unprecedented customer demand for fuel and associated supply challenges we have taken the decision to introduce a limit of £ per customer on all of our grades of fuel. This excludes HGV drivers and emergency services due to their vital role at this time. “This is a company decision to ensure all our customers have a fair chance to refuel and to enable our sites to carry on running smoothly. We kindly ask everyone visiting our sites to treat our colleagues, supply chain partners and customers with respect during these very challenging times.  All of EG Group’s UK sites remain open and operational to serve customers.” Transport Secretary Grant Shapps has urged drivers not to panic buy petrol, amid chaotic scenes at petrol stations across the country. Speaking to Sky News on Friday, he said that motorists should “carry on as normal”. Meanwhile, a survey by the Office for National Statisticsfound that around one in six adults in Britain said they were not able to buy essential food items at some point during the past two weeks, due to products not being available. A Downing Street spokesman said: We have ample fuel stocks in this country and the public should be reassured there are no shortages. But like countries around the world we are suffering from a temporary Covid-related shortage of drivers needed to move supplies around the country. Weaposre looking at temporary measures to avoid any immediate problems, but any measures we introduce will be very strictly time-limited. We are moving to a high-wage, high-skilled economy and businesses will need to adapt with more investment in recruitment and training to provide long-term resilience.

The Department for Educationtoday announces it has expanded its Glasses in Classes scheme to reach more than , pupils in at least  schools in England. It was trialled in Bradford and will now be expanded to Doncaster, Derby, Durham, Norwich and Breckland, and the North Yorkshire Coast. Children identied as needing glasses will receive one pair for home and one for school to help improve reading and writing skills. Children can already get free eye tests and vouchers for glasses but experts fear many poorer pupils do not have sight problems spotted in time. Under the scheme, pupils receive support from a vision co-ordinator, usually a teaching assistant, to attend follow-up eye examinations, get their prescription glasses and wear them regularly.  Schools do not usually get the results of vision screenings that pupils take in reception. But during the pilot, these results were shared with staff in schools so they knew which pupils and families to support. The scheme, first piloted at  primary schools in Bradford, aims to prevent disadvantaged pupils from being left behind because of poor eyesight. It will now be adapted for five disadvantaged areas in England under the DfEaposs Opportunity Areas programme - where the Government has targeted more resources at  social mobility cold spots. Speaking on National Eye Health Week, Education Secretary Nadhim Zahawi said: As a young boy shortly after arriving in this country, I sat at the back of the classroom with poor language skills and low confidence, struggling to engage with my lessons. Back then, I could never have dreamt of the opportunities this country would give me and I am determined to help every young person overcome obstacles, just as I was supported. Too many children still struggle with the literacy skills they need to make the most of their education. Simple steps like providing free glasses to those that need them so they can clearly see words on a page, for example, can help close the literacy gap and foster a love of learning. Geoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders , said: This novel scheme focuses on young people whose learning is hampered by poor eyesight and whose circumstances mean they have either not been to see an optician or do not have the glasses they need. It is refreshing to see the Government reacting positively to a local initiative that has seen results in Bradford and extending it to a further five disadvantaged areas in the north of the country. It would be greatit could eventually be rolled out on a national basis to bring the same benefits to all young people. Paul Whiteman, general secretary of school leadersapos union NAHT, said: It is essential that the Government invests more in education and young people, and does so without delay. Programmes like this are encouraging but what the education sector is crying out for is a fully funded strategy for education recovery which meets the needs of all pupils in all areas of the country. Thereaposs no time to waste, particularly because the Comprehensive Spending Review will be delivered next month.Most ReadDont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Paul WhitemanNadhim ZahawiEducationSchools\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The Mirror understands there are “live discussions” inside the Department for Work and Pensionsabout changing the “taper rate” to let working families keep more money.A proposal under discussion would see the taper - which is the amount of Universal Credit withdrawn for every pound someone earns - cut from p to p. Sources say the DWP is lobbying the Treasury to improve the rate as part of Chancellor Rishi Sunakaposs October  Budget. The Treasury is said to be exploring the idea.It would be the first taper change in five years, and would partially cushion the blow of the £-a-week cut - which kicks into payments between October  and November . Scroll down for an explanation of what this all means. Are you struggling on Universal Credit  E-mail webnews@mirror.  The £billion-a-year move would leave many working benefit claimants p better off, rather than the current p, for every pound they earn after tax. But sources are downbeat about whether Mr Sunak - who is demanding Whitehall cuts ahead of his Spending Review - will authorise the move. Mr Sunak has already stonewalled pleas to stop the £-a-week cut, which will save him £bn-a-year but throw hundreds of thousands of families into poverty. Evena p change in the taper is approved, it will not come close to making up for the £-a-week cut for most families. A -year-old single mum working  hours a week on minimum wage could be £. a week better offthe taper rate was cut from p to p.  But because UC is being cut by £ across the board, she would still be £. worse off than she is now. And those still covered by work allowances, or too sick to work, would not benefit at all from changes to the taper. Karl Handscomb of the Resolution Foundation think tank said: “Reducing the taper rate in Universal Credit would raise incentives for workers to earn more – and boost living standards by allowing them to keep more of their earnings. But while welcome, this is no alternative to maintaining the £ a week uplt to Universal Credit. The gains are far smaller than the £ a week cut, and would flow to better off families on UC while three million families would gain nothing at all. Virtually all households would still be signicantly worse off overall.” Work and Pensions Secretary Therese Coffey was blasted for claiming families could work an extra two hours to make up for the £ cut. Experts said many would have to work six hours due to the taper - or nine hoursthey pay tax and national insurance. A person with knowledge of the talks told the Mirror there is now no hope of reversing the £-a-week cut. Focus is turning to the taper instead, they said, adding: “It may be that they say the cut is going ahead - but here’s a lollipop”.  A second source said cutting the taper would help push claimants towards working more hours - as Ms Coffey suggested. After job vacancies topped a million, the source said: “When the economy’s growing and there are lots of job vacancies, more money should go into the taper rate because when people start work they keep more of their money. It’s an incentive.” Every penny cut from the taper would cost £million a year once Universal Credit is fully rolled out, the IFS think tank says. Some .million out of .million claimants have a job, and could benefit from a cut in the taper. Not all would benefit as some are already spared the taper, due to having a work allowance and earnings under £ a month. UCaposs architect Iain Duncan Smith, who has demanded ministers halt the £ cut, originally wanted the taper to be p but was overruled by George Osborne.Mr Duncan Smith appeared to reveal talks about the taper were under way in a Commons debate this week. He urged Ms Coffey to use his bid to stop the cut “as justication for her negotiations with the Treasury to secure a better investment in the taper.” Labour announced last month it would cut the taper, but has not said what the new taper should be.Shadow Work and Pensions Secretary Jonathan Reynolds told the Mirror: Rising food costs, tax hikes, the energy crisis and cuts to Universal Credit are a perfect storm facing working families. Itaposs not too late for the Government to change course and cancel their cut. Labour is on the side of working people, thataposs why we would maintain the uplt and reduce the taper rate to allow people to keep more of the money they earn when we replace Universal Credit. The Lords Economic Committee called last year for a cut in the taper, saying the poorest in society were being hit with a “very high effective tax rate”. The committee, led by Tory former employment minister Lord Forsyth, said: “The principle of always making work pay has been undermined by cuts.”By buying a little bit extra with the weekly shop and putting it in the donation box located in-store, customers can help Lidl meet its target of donating million meals a year to those in need. Lidl is helping to tackle hunger in Britain’s communities through its Feed it Back scheme and has teamed up with partner Neighbourly to ensure any donated food will be put to good use every day.The key items to pop in the box are: Cereal Soup Pasta Rice Tinned tomatoes or pasta sauce Lentils, beans and pulses Tinned meat Tinned vegetables Tea and coffee Tinned fruit Biscuits UHT milk Fruit juice. Find out more about Lidlaposs Feed it Back scheme here. What is the taper rate in Universal Credit  Universal Credit allows people to keep claiming eventhey get a job, because some jobs pay so badly that the wage is not enough to sustain a family. If you earn money from a job while on UC, your benefits are tapered away by a set amount depending on how much youaposve earned after tax. For every £ you earn over a set threshold, your benefits are reduced by p. That means effectively youaposre only p better off for every £ you earn after tax. The taper is designed to aposmake work payapos - to smooth people off UC as they re-enter the world of work without abandoning them completely. But critics and charities have long said the taper is just too high. It leaves too little incentive to get a job because people need - hours just to make £. The taper doesnapost apply to earnings that you make under a work allowance - £ a monthyou get housing help, and £ a monthyou donapost. However, only some claimants are eligible for a work allowance - in other words,they have responsibility for a child or limited capability for work. Even those who are eligible will tip over the work allowance and into the taperthey work just eight hours a week at minimum wage.

Around . million households on Universal Credit will see their energy bills rise signicantly in October while losing their £ a week uplt payments a week at the same time. Boris Johnson has tried to assure the nation that Christmas is still on, but food shortages are still on the cards. Read on for a breakdown of the issues you should look out for from next month. Rising energy prices Tories have admitted that Brits face a tough winter ahead - with people in the North more likely to be hammered by rising energy prices.A surge in global gas prices has put pressure on domestic energy suppliers, several of which have already gone bust.Spiralling wholesale costs look set to filter down to household bills.The energy price cap protects consumers from sudden hikes in their bills, but it also means that suppliers have gone to the wall as they can’t pass on higher costs to their customers.But some .million households have seen their providers collapse, meaning they face uncertainty about which company will take on their supply and how much it will cost.The energy price cap is already set to rise on October  by £, and ministers are in talks with regulator Ofgem about the next review in Aprilgas costs remain high.Petrol shortagesMotorists are facing fuel shortages at the pumps as a lack of HGV drivers wreaked havoc on the supply chain.BP, Esso and Tesco petrol forecourts were hit by shortages, with large queues reported on Friday as drivers tried to fill up.BP said that around  of its , petrol forecourts were closed due to a lack of available fuel, with between  and  sites affected by the loss of at least one grade of fuel.There is a shortage of , drivers, according to the Road Haulage Association, with the situation exacerbated by Covid pressures and Brexit red tape.Ministers were locked in talks on Friday over how to alleviate the shortage, with changes to immigration rules considered to make it easier for foreign drivers to fill the gap. Empty shelvesShoppers have already seen some empty shelves due to a shortage of carbon dioxide linked to the global gas shortage.US-owned fertiliser plant CF Industries was handed a Government bailout to restart its UK operations after halting production due to the gas price rise.Its UK plants are major suppliers of CO, which it produces as a by-product.Carbon dioxide is used for a range of things in the food sector, including stunning animals before slaughter and keeping fresh products chilled.The shortage of lorry drivers has also compounded issues.Retailers warned there were just  days to save Christmas from signicant disruption due to the lack of hauliers.The British Retail Consortiumsaid festive disruption would be inevitableprogress is not made swtly. Furlough comes to an end The furlough scheme will shut down next week on September . One million Brits are set to still be on furlough when it comes to an end, experts have revealed. The Resolution Foundation projected one million employees are set to remain on the scheme right up until the last moment. Of those, “the majority” willto their jobs but hundreds of thousands will need to find new work in October. Since it launched last March, furlough has supported .million jobs by paying up to % of people’s wages - at a cost of nearly £billion to the taxpayer.But there are fears of a cost of living crisis - as energy bills are rising on October  and Universal Credit payments are being slashed from October .Covid winter A leading health expert said Coronavirus could resemble the common cold by spring as peopleaposs immunity to the virus is boosted by vaccines and exposure. But we still have a fierce winter ahead of us. Professor Sir John Bell, regius professor of medicine at Oxford University, himself admitted winter needs to pass as double jabbed Brits are still at risk of the virus. In the coming weeks we could see Covid hospitalisations in England rising to more than , a day, according to Government scientic advisors. This would be higher than the third lockdown peak. Worryingly for the Government, which has said that instructing people to work from home is only a “possibility”cases soar, SPI-M said there was “clear consensus” that the measure had kept the pandemic under control in recent months. Boris Johnson outlined his plan for tackling Covid over the winter months, a period when respiratory viruses thrive.Plan aposAapos revolves around booster jabs for the over-s and vaccinating - to -year-olds. While plan aposBapos, measures enforced could include mandatory vaccine passports, face masks in public places and encouraging people to work from home. Universal Credit A million and a half working people face being plunged into “hardship” this winter as their benefits are slashed by £ a week, at the end of this month. Citizens Advice research showed % of working claimants fear they will struggle to pay bills, fall into debt or be forced to sell belongings to make up for the £,-a-year shortfall in their income. About one in four working recipients - equivalent to , people - worry they will be unable to afford food or other basic necessities like toiletries.Even Boris Johnson could not sayhe could survive on the usual Universal Credit payment earlier this week.The Prime Minister was askedhe could get by on just £ a week - the standard UC allowance for a couple over  after UC is slashed next month.The temporary “uplt” was announced in March last year as the coronavirus pandemic hit Britain.Calls to extend the rise are mounting amid growing warnings of a winter living standards crisis.

A staggering  percent of adults living in Cardf don’t feel safe at all on the streets at night, while another  percent worry about their safety even during the daytime. Nearly four in tenliving in Birmingham have installed CCTV and alarms at home to curb their fears about safety. Just under halfof people living in London would feel much safer with a police station in their neighbourhood - and just over a quarter in the capital would even consider legally owning a gun or kne for self-protection.  In comparison, Sheffield, Southampton, and Edinburgh came out as the top three safest cities to live in, with less than one in ten adults in the Scottish capital experiencing any sort of crime. Half of those in Southampton would recommend living in the city to friends, due to feeling so secure there. The stats emerged in a study to mark the launch of the new series of crime drama Murdertown on Crime+Investigation.  A spokesman said: Despite being popular living spots, it’s surprising to see some of the most common cities deemed unsafe - particularly the likes of Cardf, London and Birmingham.  “There are clear concerns of activity from the British public that they could be a victim or witness a crime when walking around at night or even in during the daytime. “The new TV series will aim to uncover the most shocking murders in the UK and examine the impact they had on the cities around them.” Norwich and Leicester complete the top five safest cities, while Bristol and Leeds come further down the chart, ranking th and th. Researchers found Londoners are most likely to have experienced crime in the capital- an increase of  percent since . Most common wrongdoings include unprovoked acts of violence , fraudand muggings . And over a quarter of adultsin Cardf have witnessed a crime - up from  percent three years ago.  Almost a thirdadmitted they were a victim of crime themselves, compared to just  percent of adults living in the Welsh city in . Of these illegal acts, home break-ins were most common , followed by fraudand car theft- indicating crime activity has increased since  and during the pandemic. But research, commissioned via OnePoll, found overall  percent of adults would remain in the area they live in as they feel safe when in their own home. And to make their property safer to live in,  percent have installed smart lights that turn on when they’re outdoors, and  percent have added in extra locks around the house. Other measures added to make their home secure include security cameras, growing big hedges around the property and buying a guard dog. Outside of the home, one in five respondents feels safe most of the time - but six in ten won’t go out after dark unless they have to.  And one fth would feel safer in their citythey didn’t know of so many attacks or break-ins nearby, while  percent can’t help but pay attention to local gossip. For a resounding four in ten adults, a bigger police presence would make them feel more protected, while a third want more CCTV and one quarter want a local police station. When it comes to law enforcement, more than half of British adults do not feel the police are able to keep their area safe. And  percent feel women in particular are being let down by the police following the Sarah Everard case. The spokesman for Murdertown added: “The UK police force play a vital role in keeping our cities safe and ensure people feel comfortable to go about their normal lives without causing any issues. “Of course, that’s easier said than done when staffing levels can be an issue, and some cities have such high crime rates to contend with.”There will be more stories unveiled in Murdertown’s new ten-part series which premieres on Crime+Investigation on th September at pm.TOP  SAFEST CITIES TO LIVE IN THE UK...Edinburgh Southampton Sheffield Norwich Leicester Manchester Newcastle Cambridge Liverpool Glasgow Bristol Leeds Birmingham London CardfMost ReadDont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterMORE ON CCTVCrimeCity of CardfSouth Wales PoliceCity of Edinburgh\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

However, the same phrase also has connotations to mean female masturbation. Richard, from South West London, said: A friend of mine sent me the post saying aposwhat on earth is Costa thinking apos  At first I thought it was a hoax, there was a bit of me that thought aposthat canapost be real, someoneaposs made thatapos. I did my due diligence, rather than just sharing it, and found the post on Facebook. When I saw the phrasing aposflick the beanapos I thought apossomeone needs to check the definition on Urban Dictionaryapos. I donapost know whether [the person responsible] was being a bit cheeky.  Thereaposs a bit of me that hopes it is very tongue in cheek but I think whoever signed it off might not have necessarily got the underlying joke in there. Itaposs a bit risque. Itaposs something I would imagine a smaller company that was trying to get peopleaposs attention would run with for a little giggle, but slightly surprised to see it from a national brand like Costa.  The ad put a very cheeky smile on my face for the rest of the day. The Dunmail Park Facebook post read: FRESHERS! Fuel your early morning lectures OR the start of your wild nights out with a discounted or even a FREE Costa treat! Get lucky when you flick the coffee bean into one of the Costa cups to reveal a surprise deal. Play aposFLICK THE BEANapos here! The chef and owner of Boxed Local shared the now-deleted Facebook post from the Dunmail Park branch onto his own Instagram page yesterday morning [nd September].Richard wrote: @costacoffee know how to start the day right! £flickthebean. Four hours later Costa Coffeeaposs Instagram account replied, quipping: Canapost take credit for this one! - Natalie. The Facebook post was swtly deleted while similar posts on other branchesapos Facebook pages with the same promotion were later deleted. The offers section of Costa Coffeeaposs website is still live for people to play the game and potentially scoop a prize. Richard said: I imagine they may have got a bit of flack - a family-friendly company posting things like that. Itaposs a little bit on the nose, but Iaposm a little bit sad to see it come down. A Costa Coffee spokesman said: This competition was run by one of our franchise partners in a small number of stores and was not approved by Costa Coffee. We apologise for any offence caused and have requested the immediate removal of the competition.

Since then, he has been diagnosed with fibromyalgia, and is also a carer for his partner, , who has visual impairment, and their three-year-old daughter Amelia.Are you worried about the Universal Credit cut  Get in touch at webnews@mirror The couple are now trying to juggle their household budget to make sure they have enough money put by to heat their home and put food on the table, as well as try to give their daughter a good Christmas. He said the uplt meant they could provide extra activities with their daughter while her nursery was closed, and provided an extra security blanket as they endured lockdown. He said: It just enabled us not to worry too much about the bills, it took the pressure off. Now we are going to be £ a month worse off. Are we still going to be able to do the things we want to do with Amelia, and heat our home, especially with the energy crisis going on  Are we going to be able to get the food we need, and pay the bills, especially with the winter coming  It certainly is a worry, and I hope it doesnapost get to that. My partner is writing lists and making sure we save enough money to pay for this bill and that bill, and have enough money for food and Christmas. More than a third of the almost six million people on Universal Credit nationally are in work. The system was rolled out by the government to replace a series of other benefits, bringing together support for income with housing and childcare costs into a single payment.The £ a week uplt was brought in at the start of the coronavirus pandemic in  for a year and was extended in March this year, but is due to end by October. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has shown no signs of reversing plans for the £ reduction, suggesting it could only be keptpaid for by tax hikes.In comments made during his US trip, he said he had “every sympathy” for those toughing it out on benefits, but that the £- billion required to make the additional weekly payments permanent would have to “come out of some people’s pockets”. The government has said the uplt was always meant to be temporary, and one minister said the reduction equalled two hoursapos work for those in employment.The cut also comes as Boris Johnson refused to say whether he could live on the usual Universal Credit payment. The Prime Minister was askedhe could get by on just £ a week - the standard UC allowance for a couple over  after UC is slashed next month. It came as he again snubbed calls to maintain the £-a-week rise for six million of the poorest families - despite mounting warnings of looming hardship and poverty.

It marked the start of a dark decade that culminated in the infamous aposWinter of Discontentapos, where industrial action left mountains of rubbish piled up in the streets and severe weather cut off access to entire towns.With commentators now warning the Government faces a similar season of turmoil, here is how Britain was thrust into chaos - and risks being so once more. Pubs shut and TV curbed in aposthree-day weekapos Rising inflation troubled the economy throughout the s and to tackle it, pay caps were imposed on major industries including coal mining. By the end of , workersapos average pay had fallen behind inflation and the National Union of Mineworkers held a national ballot on strikes. Get the biggest news delivered to your inbox.for the Mirroraposs free newslettersWhile the motion was not passed, an overtime ban was imposed that crippled the coal industry and forced prime minister Ted Heath to take drastic measures. At midnight on December , the Tory leader took the unprecedented step of introducing a three-day working week - meaning businesses could only operate for a maximum of three consecutive days. In scenes similar to lockdown, most pubs shut their doors, while even TV broadcasts were limited. The BBC and ITV implemented a staggered shutdown, shutting off at .pm in alternating nights. As blackouts hit the country, it was even speculated that the Army could be called in to haul coal and work at power stations. In January , the NUM upped the stakes by going on strike and Heath responded by calling a general election.Feeling Brits would side with the Government, the Conservatives ran with the campaign slogan aposWho governs Britain apos The move backfired, however, with Labour taking the most seats. Labouraposs Harold Wilson ed to power in a minority government and cemented a majority in a second election that October. The miners were granted a  per cent pay increase, but the wave of discontent spreading across Britain had just begun. aposWinter of Discontentapos saw rubbish pile up in Leicester Square In the winter of – there were widespread strikes by public sector trade unions against the Governmentaposs attempts to curb wage increases. With Jim Callaghan now prime minister, the Labour leadership was once again battling rapid inflation, but faced internal disputes over the pay caps from members committed to the partyaposs socialist roots.  By the end of , lorry drivers had gone on strike, driving the country to a halt just as temperatures plummeted. In the coldest winter for  years, freezing weather cut off access to towns, with local authorities struggling to clear roads blaming staff shortages. Even football was affected as an entire round of the FA Cup was postponed for the first time in its history. With more than , strikes erupting around Britain, grim images of the consequences flooded newspaper front pages. Refuse collectors refused to pick up bags of rubbish, which piled up in Leicester Square, while even gravediggers joined the walkout.Their actions were demonised in headlines like “Now They Won’t Let Us Bury Our Dead!” and last year one union official promised the Mirror never again - though insisted low-paid workers were treated like dogs”.  Returning from a Caribbean summit, Callaghanaposs insistence that the situation did not amount to mounting chaos was met with derision. The Sun ran a front page headlined aposCrisis, what Crisis apos and quoted Shakespeareaposs opening line from Richard III, aposNow is the winter of our discontentapos - a phrase that came to define the era. As Tory leader Margaret Thatcher won a wave of support for denouncing the scenes, Callaghan faced a vote of no confidence. Sweeping to victory, Thatcher set about clamping down on the unions, while Labour faced over a decade in the wilderness.

That will spark fears that rising prices will leave families behind as public sector wages are frozen and benefits are cut. It could also squeeze Bank of England interest rates, which have been rock-bottom for so long that much of the mortgage market is dependent on them staying that way.Meanwhile, a lorry driver shortage blamed on Brexit immigration rules has led the Government to slash legal requirements to become an HGV driver.Industry chiefs fear the issues could affect the supply of toys, turkeys and more over the Christmas season.

Black Labrador Bonnie was left in searing pain when a spider - thought to be a  widow or similar - sank its fangs into her face while she was out on a walk. The -month-old pup was rushed for emergency treatment in Gateshead after her eye became so swollen it closed shut. Owners Lisa and Nick Bennett, who were visiting family, were terried that Bonnieaposs throat and windpipe might close up from the reaction.They searched online for urgent animal treatment and found Vets Now emergency clinic in Gateshead - where they took the increasingly distressed pooch, Chronicle Live reports. Bonnie also experienced vomiting and diarrhoea on her way. Attendant vet Konrad ran tests and concluded Bonnie had been bitten by a spider, and hooked her up to a drip. The bite happened five days previously while the couple were walking their pet near Redditch in Worcestershire. Konrad gave Bonnie an injection, put her under observation, and waited for the swelling to go down. Bonnieaposs condition improved quickly after the treatment and she was soon well enough to be reunited with her relieved family. Lisa said: “It was a terrible shock to see her face swell up and it happened so quickly. “Being so far from home made it even worse — you just feel so vulnerable when your pet is in distress. “Bonnie is a very intelligent dog and she was clearly aware that something was wrong. “She kept trying to use her paw to wipe and scratch away the swelling, which made it more upsetting to see. “We assumed it was a reaction to something she’d eaten or possibly a snake bite, but it never occurred to us she’d been bitten by a spider. “Konrad and the team at Vets Now said it can be several days before a spider bite starts affecting a dog — and that’s when we realised. “Five days before all this drama happened, we’d been walking Bonnie and our other black lab Benson near our house when she gave a yelp and came limping back to us. “We checked her over, couldn’t see anything untoward and just assumed she’d maybe stood on a thorn. “Then she went off again and seemed totally fine. “But what we know now is that the yelp was almost certainly a sign she’d been bitten.”Senior vet nurse Ashley Wemple said it’s very rare for pets to be bitten by spiders.She added: “This is not the type of case we see every day. Butyour dog gets bitten by an insect or even a snake, it can be dficult to see any evidence because the bite is often covered by their fur. “Symptoms can include swelling, itchiness and irritation of the skin and, in severe cases, an allergic reaction. “It can take hours — or, as in Bonnie’s case, days — for this to happen. “Butthere is a bad reaction or swelling then time really is of the essence, and you should seek help straight away. “Nick and Lisa did the right thing calling us when they did —they had delayed, the consequences could have been very serious. “Bonnie was such a friendly and good-natured dog. We were all delighted to see her go back to Lisa and Nick after treatment with her tail wagging.” After three days there was no longer any trace of swelling on Bonnieaposs face - and she made a full recovery. Lisa said: “The service we got was brilliant from the moment we rang — and Konrad and his colleagues were so incredibly kind and patient, not just with Bonnie but with us as well.

It has issued a nine-point plan including demanding the reintroduction of mandatory mask wearing indoors, more financial support for people to self isolate and the right to work from home where possible for all workers.

Stephen Williams put up the ft-high picket fence to block off a path and a layby used by customers going into the chippy next door. The -year-old used to run a sweet shop next to Victoria House Fish and Chips, which he was forced to close in . He has held onto the property and has now transformed the building into a house. The old shop front is being turned into a living room but customers are furious, saying pedestrians must now walk on the road to get to the chip shop. Thereaposs a layby outside the chippy which people use to park before picking up their food,” one customer said.  The chip shop has been there for years. Whoever bought the house next door must have known that. Sticking a fence up is very petty.” The customer went on to say it was “unbelievable” that Williams wants privacy now, after benefiting from people walking on the path when they were coming into his shop and “lining his pockets”. Mr Williams built the fence along the original boundary line of his £, semi-detached property in Alnwick, Northumberland, which extends ft onto the layby. A nearby resident said that while they didn’t agree with the fence, they had some sympathy for Williams.  Stephen is sick and tired of people eating their chips right outside his home,” they said. Sometimes schoolkids queue outside and can go right outside his living room window. They are basically sitting on his windowsill stuffing their faces while heaposs watching TV. Council chiefs are now investigatingMr Williamsapos fence is legal. Cllr Gordon Castle, Alnwick ward member for Northumberland County Council, said he had raised it with officers at County Hall to the highest level. He [Mr Williams] claims to have deeds showing ownership of where his fence now sits,” Cllr Castle said. I can hardly believe he has gone ahead with this before any resolution with county highways, especially given the impact on pedestrians and children walking to school. There are meetings scheduled to find the legal way forward and Iaposm sorry I canapost do more, but Iaposve sent photos and explained to officers that Iaposm receiving many messages of complaint. I canapost get it higher or faster at County Hall, but I wonapost let it go. Mr Williams defended the fence, saying he wanted privacy now that the shop had been turned into a house and the front room had become his living room. This means the window faces straight onto the path which is used by people queuing to get fish and chips,” he said. Weaposve had people eating their chips on our windowsill and looking through the window while we are trying to relax. Itaposs not on. We just want some privacy. The land is rightfully ours. We checked with the plans and we are legally entitled to put a fence up. Most people wouldnapost want people using their land as a footpath and neither do we. We just want to protect our property.

Thousands of people Brits are reporting symptoms that could be easily mistaken for Covid. Negative results show they are suffering instead with a harmless but nasty common cold infection.Dr Philippa Kaye, a GP at a London practice, told BBC Newsbeat : Weaposve actually been seeing a rise in the number of coughs and colds and viral infections.We are mixing in a way that we havenapost been mixing over the past  months. The spike in viral infections come as the public s to normality -with less stress now on mask wearing and social distancing as Brits head back to work or school. New arrivals at universities also face a spike in Fresheraposs Flu - an increase in viral symptoms as students bring viruses from their own towns to their lecture halls, Wales Online reports.Rebecca London, , from Bournemouth told the BBC she caught a cold at a festival and it was aposthe worst everapos. She said: I barely slept, Iaposd wake up in the night just coughing, a constantly runny nose and feeling so tired. The cold lasted more than a week, she said. Noor Hashmi, , another student, told the BBC: Normally Iaposm still able to go about my day, but this one left me with muscle fatigue, a lost voice and headache that meant Iaposve just stayed indoors. Dr Philippa advises people experiencing symptoms of Covid - like a new cough, fever, loss of sense of taste or smell - to take a PCR test. Cold symptoms can be treated with rest, fluids and over-the-counter painkillers, she adds. Following Covid prevention measures - like wearing masks and social distancing - means weaposve missed the chance to develop immunity to coughs, cold and flu viruses for two years. As your body has not had the opportunity to fight the illnesses, when they reach you the symptoms can be worse.Dr Ron Eccles, Emeritus Professor at Cardf Universityaposs School of Biosciences told Patient.info : If youaposve been exposed to a particular virus before, you may not develop any symptoms at all, because your immune system has been primed to fight off the infection.Itaposs the same process that means you usually only catch chickenpox once. With common colds we generally donapost have such a strong immune response and therefore we probably donapost get lelong immunity to a particular virus, he adds. However, we may get a milder responsewe are exposed to that virus again. The NHSaposs big three symptoms for Covid are a high temperature which leaves your back or chest feeling hot, a new, continuous cough, and a loss or change to your sense of smell or taste. If you experience any of these symptoms then get a PCR test and self-isolate until you get your test result.

The Scots and West Midlanders are runners-up in their love of the burn, at  and  per cent respectively. But spice is off the menu in Yorkshire: around one in five people declared that they prefer their food mild – the highest number of any region surveyed. Hot on their heelswere those in the East of England. The survey also revealed the gap between people’s estimation of their own region’s appetite for spice and the reality. Residents of Northern Ireland were widest off the mark, guessing that only  per cent would like fiery food, whereas the true figure was  per cent. In contrast,  per cent of those in the North West thought their population would love serious spice, but it was actually a mere  per cent. London and the West Midlands came out top when people were asked which region they thought would have the greatest penchant for spicy food, and they were broadly right. But those in the South West were wrongly assumed to have the least tolerance for the tingle factor.

Presenting duo Ant and Dec have left people making all kinds of attempts to pronounce another location after snapping a photo on their way to the I’m a Celeb filming spot.The pair once struggled to pronounce Gwrych Castle, which is near Abergele, where the show was filmed last year, Chill reports.And en route to the venue where the show will be filmed for , the presenters stopped off at Mynyddislwyn, which left UK fans pondering the correct pronunciation. Even Ant and Dec looked baffled - but that may be because they were  miles out of their way after taking a wrong turn at Newport.  So here’s all you - and Ant and Dec - need to know about Mynyddislwyn and how to pronounce it like a local with a quick Welsh lesson.How do you say it Don’t stumble at the first hurdle - the ‘y’ in the first part of the word. It’s pronounced like aposughapos. aposDdapos in Welsh is classed as its own letter and is pronounced aposthapos. Another confusion comes with aposwyapos that makes an aposooapos. But let’s make it easy for you - put it all together and you get mun-ith-is-loo-in.Wondering where to eat, drink or visit for your next UK holiday  At Chill we help you decide where to go and stay next with hundreds of recommendations right on your doorstep. Visit our brilliant new website chill and start packing. If youaposd also like weekly inspiration and advice for your next trip, you can sign up to the Chill newsletter here. For the latest must-have travel news follow us on Instagram, Facebook and Twitter.What does it mean anyway Mynydd means mountain in Welsh and the parish is often translated as aposmountain ashapos or aposmountain below the groveapos. There is actually a place called Mountain Ash not too far away, so donapost get them mixed up.Where is it exactly Mynyddislwyn is a small parish between Ystrad Mynach and Crumlin and while technically in Monmouthshire, itaposs more aligned to Caerphilly. So people there claim it as theirs, whatever the internet might say.And what about Gwrych Castle  Any help on how to say that According to researcher at Gwrych Castle Preservation Trust, Rhŷn Williams, the impressive Welsh castle is in fact pronounced, Goo-rreech. He said the stress on the aposWapos part is paramount. *That’s ‘welcome back’ in Welsh!

The family live in a -bed former care home over four floors in Morecambe, Lancashire, and often update their followers with videos on YouTube. In the latest offering, Sue, , started by showing off the childrenaposs play area at the front of the mega property which has swings and a slide. Itaposs also where the kids store their bikes, and the family hopes to soon buy a plastic storage facility to put them in, she explained. I think thataposs going to be next on the to do list, the busy mum - who runs a bakery alongside husband Noel,  - told the camera. Sue then walked across the articial lawn in the back garden where the family boasts a collection of luxurious sun loungers, a hot tub, fire pit and bar and adjoining seating area. She said they are planning to buy a gazebo to put the hot tub in so they can continue to enjoy it now that autumn has arrived. I have to say [the hot tub] has just been the best thing ever, admitted Sue. The kids all get so much enjoyment out of that.  Sue and Noel - who famously donapost rely on any benefits to support their brood - currently have  of their kids living under their roof, with many sharing bedrooms. The two oldest - Chris, , and Sophie,  - have previously flown the nest. Their th child, Alfie, was sadly stillborn in .  Pointing to the grey seating area with scatter cushions, the mum said: I just love this area, itaposs so nice. You can sit here with a nice cup of coffee in the evening and just chill out when the kids have gone to bed. But her favourite spot is the bar. This is probably one of my most favourite things in the garden along with the hot tub. Itaposs just brilliant, said Sue.  In a previous video last year, Noel had explained how he had built it with the help of daughter Chloe, , and son James, , during the Covid lockdown. Itaposs just been so brilliant. We just love it, gushed Sue. Nicknamed aposThe Lockdown Barapos, it has been decorated with a wind chime and signs, including one that says: I wine because they wine!  They also have a barbecue and pizza oven for outdoor dinners. Sue explained: This was Aldiaposs pizza oven and it is really really good. Weaposve had so many nights with the kids making their own pizzas and things so thataposs been a massive hit. Earlier this year, Sue and Noel began a major DIY project, in which they transformed their garden, including adding an articial lawn which they vacuum to keep clean.

As well as meeting Emma, Kate also chatted with fellow British US Open champions Joe Salisbury, who won the menaposs doubles title with American Rajeev Ram, and Gordon Reid and Alfie Hewett, the menaposs wheelchair doubles champions. There was an awkward moment when Kate first arrived as she was unsure how to congratulate the group.She said: Are we shaking hands  I donapost want to break your training bubbles.Itaposs really awkward, you donapost know quite whether to do it. It is the same with face masks.You never know whether to hug people, congratulate them or shake hands. But amazing, guys honestly, congratulations.Emma, who is now ranked nd in the world, became the first qualier to win one of the four majors when she claimed the US Open womenaposs singles title earlier this month. She also became the first British woman in  years to win a Grand Slam title, when she breezed past Canadian Leylah Fernandez in straight sets.After her victory, Kate took to Twitter to send a rare personal tweet saying : Huge congratulations @EmmaRaducanu on your stunning performances and historic Grand Slam victory! Incredible –we are all so proud of you. @leylahfernandez well done on your amazing achievements at this year’s #USOpen, it’s been a pleasure to watch. CThe Queen also said it was a remarkable achievement at such a young age and added she was an inspiration for future tennis players. In a personal message to Emma, she said: I send my congratulations to you on your success in winning the United States Open Tennis Championships. It is a remarkable achievement at such a young age, and is testament to your hard work and dedication. I have no doubt your outstanding performance, and that of your opponent Leylah Fernandez, will inspire the next generation of tennis players. Raducanu shot into the spotlight with a surprise y run to the second week of Wimbledon - her Grand Slam debut tournament earlier this summer. And even before the tournament, it appears that Kate and husband Prince William were fans of the young Brit. In a tweet from July, the couple made their predictions of who would win Wimbledon and said: Unbiased prediction to win it: @andy_murray and @EmmaRaducanu #Wimbledon.

There has been speculation that the couple could travel to the UK for Christmas and bring their children with them.Since moving to Calornia last year, Harry has only ed to the UK twice, while Meghan and two-year-old Archie have not been back so far.Meanwhile, Harry and Meghanaposs newborn daughter Lilibet has not been to the UK after being born in Calornia in June and is yet to meet her great-grandmother the Queen or her grandfather Prince Charles.Earlier this year, it was announced that Harry would be releasing a tell-all memoir about his le that would be released next year.And royal author Angela Levin, who has written a biography of Harry in the past, told True Royalty TVaposs The Royal Beat of a Christmas visit: I think it would cause a lot of people a lot of grief.The Queen would be delighted because she adores Harry - and also you love a child even though you disagree with everything they are doing - but I think for the other Royals, it is quite a stf time where everybody has a very explicit diary of changing five times a day and what they have to do at what time. I think it will be very, very dficultthey come over because the feeling is you can’t trust them, and they might use this for their next documentary or for his next book.” Love the royals for the Mirroraposs daily newsletter to get all the latest news on the Queen, Charles, Kate, Wills, Meghan, Harry and the rest of The Firm.

Harry and Meghan have made the trip to the city alone and are thought to have left three-month-old Lilibet and her big brother Archie at home in Calornia. Since Lilibetaposs birth in July, the couple have not released any images of the youngster and have hardly given any updates about her.But as they walked between engagements yesterday, one reporter from Inside Edition called out to the couple, asking: Meghan, howaposs Lilibet And Meghan simply replied: Sheaposs beautul.

Experts have warned of a crossover of symptoms for the past  months, making it dficult to tell the dference between the two illnesses. Symptoms of the virus are extremely similar to those of a regular cold, particularly for those who have been double jabbed.Vaccinated people who contract the virus are likely to experience a runny nose, sore throat and sneezing, the Daily Record reported. But now, new research from the ZOE Covid Symptom study, developed by Kingaposs College London, has found that thereaposs one symptom that can help tell the dference.Data shows that loss of smellor loss of taste is still one of the most important predictors of testing positive for coronavirus rather than a regular cold.Researchers say you can check your sense of smell easily at home by snfing scented foods or products, or noticing whether familiar foods start to lose their flavour or taste strange. Millions of people have been logging their symptoms, tests and vaccines on the UK ZOE COVID Symptom Study app since it was launched. Thanks to health reports, scientists now know there are more than  symptoms of Covid-, including headache, runny nose, sneezing and sore throat.

A well-run country would not have queues at the fuel pumps, empty shelves in supermarkets and firms unable to source basic goods. Thanks to this Government’s incompetence and complacency, firms have been walloped by rising energy bills, a shortage of CO and a transportation crisis. And that is before you add in the disruption from Covid and economic pain caused by rising living costs. Boris Johnson has been in denial about the chaos caused by these multiple crises. An emergency is looming, but there has been no emergency planning. The Prime Minister likes to boast about Global Britain – but on his watch, we are in danger of becoming Broken Britain. Keir moment  Next week Keir Starmer will finally address the Labour conference in person. The pandemic has been doubly frustrating for the Labour leader, dominating the news, making it harder for the Opposition to be heard and preventing Sir Keir from properly introducing himself to the public. This why so much is riding on his leader’s speech this Wednesday. Sir Keir inherited a broken and ided party which had suffered its fourth election defeat in a row. Since then he has made steady,slow, progress in turning around Labour’s fortunes. The party is in a better place than it was two years ago, but Labour’s rehabilitation is not yet complete. That work must continue at the conference in Brighton. It is time the party stopped talking to itself and began a conversation about how Labour can transform lives and build a better Britain.

The property on Dorchester Drive, Herne Hill in south London, has an asking price of £.m and comes with original aposs radiators, original Crittall windows and an original kitchen. The home is just one of handful designed by the design duo Kemp  Tasker, who are perhaps best known for their cinemas. Boasting three receptions rooms, two toilets and five bedrooms, the house also has a large garden, iron staircase, “sunspan” curved windows in the living room, roof terrace, original hardwood flooring, and aposs tiled bathroom.The sellers Hamptons have suggested that the two reception rooms could be knocked into one to create a ft “ballroom”.In  a Kemp  Tasker house design won the Daily Mailaposs Ideal House Competition and was erected temporarily at Olympia in the Village of Tomorrow at Ideal Home Show the following year. The builders, Bromley-based Messrs Morrell Bros. Builders advertised that the home could be built to order anywhere but only three known examples exist - in Dublin, Hayes in Kent and this one on the market. A spokesperson for Hamptons said: Owned by the same family since , this house now provides the opportunity for a buyer to breathe new le into a well-loved family home to create something really special in terms of style and space. It has wonderful features such as curved doors, original hardwood flooring , original Crittall windows, the fabulous apossunspanapos curved window in the lounge, grand iron staircase and original tiled bathroom. There is a wraparound garden and off-street parking on both sides. The original sales brochure described the ground floor as having the option of combining the two reception rooms with the hall to create a forty ft ballroom. Its beautul wooden floor, believed to be maple, also extends into the study which has full- window views over the garden. The roof is a perfect spot to enjoy the sun and the views over London. There is an additional room on the roof, not shown on the floor plan, housing the water tank and providing useful extra storage space.

The UK has been plagued by a number of shortages in recent weeks, brought on by a shortage of HGV drivers.BPaposs head of UK retail Hanna Hofer has said it is important the government understands the urgency of the situation, which she described as bad, very bad, ITV News reports.She added that BP had two-thirds of normal forecourt stock levels required for smooth operations and the level is declining rapidly. Here we take a look at which oil companies have faced petrol station closures, and the reason for the fuel shortage. Which petrol stations have closed   BP and Tesco have closed some petrol stations because of petrol and diesel supply issues, brought on by the lack of HGV drivers. There are around , BPO branded filling stations around the country, of which  are operated by BP themselves, and the oil giant has said a handful of these have been forced to close. The oil giant, which is the largest operator of petrol stations in the UK, has not said which specic ones have closed.  The Mirror reached out to BP, but the company could not confirm which specic petrol stations were closed due to the fast-changing situation. BP said in a statement: “We are experiencing some fuel supply issues at some of our retail sites in the UK and unfortunately have therefore seen a handful of sites temporarily close due to a lack of both unleaded and diesel grades. These have been caused by some delays in the supply chain which has been impacted by the industry-wide driver shortages across the UK and there are many actions being taken to address the issue. We continue to work with our haulier supplier to minimise any future disruption and to ensure efficient and effective deliveries to serve our customers.  They are currently working to address the problem, and prioritising deliveries to motorway service areas, major trunk roads and sites with the largest demands. The company said: We continue to work with our haulier supplier to minimise disruption and to ensure efficient and effective deliveries. Esso, which owns  Tesco Alliance sites, has reported similar issues with a small number of them. A spokesperson said: We are working closely with all parties in our distribution network to optimise supplies and minimise any inconvenience to customers. “We apologise to our customers for any inconvenience.” Currently these are the only two suppliers reporting shortages. Supermarket Morrisons has said itaposs not seeing similar issues with any of its  petrol stations, according to the BBC. Similarly, Co-Op, which operates  petrol stations, has a full complement of fuel delivery drivers. Tesco says it has a good availability of fuel, and the BBC report that both Sainsburyaposs and Asda have had no issues in fuel supplies. Why is there a fuel shortage   Is panic-buying understandable - or selfish  Let us know in the comments below Similarly to the food shortage which is causing empty supermarket shelves, the reason for the fuel shortage is to do disruption to the supply chain. This is due to a post-Brexit shortage in the number of HGV drivers. Since the UK left the European Union, many non-UK nationals who drive trucks have opted to work solely within EU countries. This has left logistics firms struggling to find workers. According to The Road Haulage Association , Britain needs as many as , more drivers to keep shops stocked and supplies moving.The coronavirus situation has made everything worse, with the closure of test centres worsening the shortage of drivers.The Department for Transport has recently changed the rules for tests to speed up the process of qualication.Most ReadDont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON BPExxon Mobil CorporationEuropean Union\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Some UK service stations are rationing fuel as the lorry driver shortage hits petrol supply chains and forces forecourts up and down the country to shut. Worried drivers formed lines before the break of dawn in hopes of filling up, as scenes queuing stretched into a second day. Others were seen carrying jerry cans onto forecourts.At least one bust-up as been witnessed, as a clash broke out at a busy petrol station in Portsmouth, Hants, where drivers had flocked to a Shell station. Two groups of men were aposscreamingapos at each other before one group chased another fleeing in a van - hurling stones at the vehicle, according to a witness. The ugly scenes shocked onlookers at a forecourt in the Hilsea area of the city at around .am. A witness said: People were queuing throughout the night. Pumps are almost dry.Have you been affected by the shortage  Email your stories and pictures to webnews@mirror The man said the groups were screaming and shouting at each other. He added: One group got into their van and drove off out of the city as the other group gave chase and hurled stones at the retreating van. Itaposs utter madness. Lengthy queues were being spotted today around London, Essex and Kent to Bristol and Cambridgeshire, as industry bosses warned the capital and south of England were worst affected. Some petrol stations had road cones blocking forecourt lanes and signs announcing they were closed as pumps ran dry. Police forces are pleading with drivers to be apossensibleapos as lines were seen stretching around roundabouts in some parts of England. EG Group, which runs hundreds of forecourts across Britain, imposed a purchase limit of £ per customer for fuel due to the unprecedented customer demandaposapos.  Petrol retailers say they are unable to transport fuel due to a lack of lorry drivers, which is being blamed on Brexit labour shortages and the pandemic. Some firms have offered handsome cash incentives, salary increases and free training in desperate bids to recruit and retain drivers, as the exodus of EU workers left firms struggling to fill the gap. Reports have speculated the government is likely to bow shortly to industry demand to issue temporary migrant visas to plug the gaps.  Haulage industry bosses have warned the UK is short nearly , lorry drivers. The problem is being exacerbated by a gas price hike crisis threatening the UKaposs food supplies and driving up energy bills to eye-watering rates. Lincolnshire Police warned the queues could cause chaos on the roads and urged drivers not to fill upthey donapost need to. The force said: This is a potential hazard for vehicles making other journeys, and may cause dficulties for emergency services trying to reach people in need. While we appreciate that some people may be particularly keen to fill up their vehicles this weekend, we would respectfully ask motorists to be sensible when making judgements about joining a queue at a petrol station. If it is too long, consider ing at a dferent time. The president of the AA says panic-buying rather than supply chain issues is driving the shortage of fuel at some petrol stations.  Edmund King said the problem should pass in a matter of daysdrivers just stick to filling up when they need it, adding there is plenty of fuel at source. Speaking to BBC Breakfast, Mr King said shortage of lorry drivers had only been a localised problem earlier in the week. We were in discussions with Government ministers last night and we talked to the major fuel companies, and we can reiterate there is not a problem with supply at the source, Mr King said. Earlier in the week, there were some problems with the supply chain, as we know, due to a shortage of some lorry drivers, but that was only a localised problem.  Mr King warned the shortage had been exacerbated by people going out and filling up when they really donapost need to. If you think about it,  million cars out there,theyaposve all got half a tank they all rush out to fill up the rest of the tank and the tank is about  litres, that will put a strain on the system, he said. Mr King said the issues were unlikely to last because the supply chain is not being disrupted by ongoing problems such as industrial action. The good news is you can only really fill up once - youaposve got to use the fuel, so this should be a short-term thing, he said.  Itaposs not like the fuel crises in the past when the supplier was hit by strikes, etc. So, once people have filled up, they wonapost travel more than they normally travel, so this strain on the system should ease up in the next few days. However Mr King said the lorry driver shortage would remain an ongoing issue for the industry until solutions were found. Andrew Opie, director of food and sustainability at the British Retail Consortium, said: “HGV drivers are the glue which hold our supply chains together. “Without them, we are unable to move goods from farms to warehouses to shops. “Currently, the UK faces a shortfall of around , HGV drivers and it is consumers who ultimately suffer the consequences.” Comment MORE ON Panic-buyingVehiclesBPOn Instagram\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The Duke of York is accused of having sex with her on three occasions when she was , knowing she had been trafficked by his close friend, the convicted paedophile Jeffrey Epstein. Andrew and his accuser, now , jointly agreed that service was effective as of September , according to a Friday filing with the US District Court in Manhattan. The prince has until October  to respond to the lawsuit. He denies Giuffreaposs claims. A previously scheduled October  court hearing has been canceled.Do you enjoy reading about the royal family for all the best royal news from the Mirror here  The agreement appears for now to end a monthlong effort by Andrewaposs legal team, including lawyers in Britain, to block Giuffreaposs lawsuit at the outset rather than have the -year-old defend against it. Giuffre accused Queen Elizabethaposs second son of forcing her to have sex around two decades ago at the London home of Epsteinaposs longtime associate Ghislaine Maxwell. She also said Andrew abused her at around the same time at Epsteinaposs mansion in Manhattan and on Epsteinaposs private island in the U.S. Virgin Islands.  Andrew has not been charged with crimes. His lawyers are seeking to review a  settlement agreement from a lawsuit against Epstein in Florida, to determine whether it requires a dismissal of Giuffreaposs August  lawsuit. Giuffre is seeking unspecied damages. Epstein, a registered sex offender, also had a home in Florida. He killed himself in a Manhattan jail in August  while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges. Giuffre sued Andrew under a  New York law that gave survivors of childhood sexual abuse a since-closed two-year window to sue their alleged abusers over conduct occurring many years or decades earlier. Maxwell faces a scheduled November  trial in Manhattan on charges she helped recruit and groom underage girls for Epstein to abuse. She has pleaded not guilty.Most ReadFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterMORE ON Prince Andrew, Duke of YorkUS District CourtRoyal FamilyJeffrey EpsteinGhislaine Maxwell\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily royal round-up direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The memoir is expected to hit the shelves next year - possibly around the time the Queen is celebrating her historic Diamond Jubilee. Harry said he is writing the book not as the prince I was born, but as the man I have become and stated that it will include the highs and the lows, the mistakes, the lessons learned. Buckingham Palace fear further explosive headlines as they pick up the pieces from Harry and Meghan Markleaposs tell-all Oprah interview. He has been secretly working on a memoir for nearly a year - and it has triggered a tsunami of fear among royal circles.But royal author and publisher Andrew Lownie believes Harry’s personal account could prove to be a step too far for the Firm.He told the Express that the memoir could sour Harryaposs already tricky relationship with his family.He said: “I think given the fact that he’s doing his tell-all book, I would have thought that’s the final straw for them.  The book will be published by Penguin Random House UK, with all proceeds to be donated to charity. Despite profits heading to good causes, two-thirds of Brits says they are aposnot interested at allapos in reading it. Over a third say it is aposinappropriateapos for him to publish it. A YouGov survey found says almost one in  people say he should not have signed the publishing agreement - and most wonapost read it.  In a statement confirming the book, the Duke said: Iaposm writing this not as the prince I was born but as the man I have become. “Iaposve worn many hats over the years, both literally and figuratively, and my hope is that in telling my story - the highs and lows, the mistakes, the lessons learned. I can help show that no matter where we come from, we have more in common than we think. “Iaposm deeply grateful for the opportunity to share what Iaposve learned over the course of my le so far and excited for people to read a firsthand account of my le thataposs accurate and wholly truthful.” But a source told the Daily Mirror the book has struck fear into the family. “Ever since leaving royal le, Harry and Meghan have made claim after claim of how they allege they have been treated, the insider explained. “They say that it is their truth but there is only ever one truth. “Since their interview with Oprah Winfrey tensions have been running very high as much of what they said has since been proven to be unreliable at best. “There is a now tsunami of fear among the royals over what Harry will write.

Sailing Kate has a deep love of sailing and showed off her skills in  at the King’s Cup regatta off the Isle of Wight - although she was beaten to the finish line by William. Itaposs no surprise that sheaposs also struck up a friendship with Olympics sailing hero Sir Ben Ainslie, whoaposs even taken her out on the water. Get the biggest news delivered to your inbox.for the Mirroraposs free newslettersThis summer, the Cambridges are said to have made the most of the fleeting sunshine by taking a boat around the Norfolk coast.A local source told Vanity Fairaposs Katie Nicholl that they are very much a family of sailors now after getting the kids up to speed while staying at their holiday home Anmer Hall in early August.“Kate has always been a competent sailor and William’s pretty good too, said the source. Volleyball Donning a pair of five-inch wedges, perhaps Kate was looking for a height advantage when she tried her hand at volleyball. In her first solo engagement since the birth of Prince George, the royal joined young athletes and their parents in education workshops for her charity SportsAid in  - but wasnapost quite dressed for the part in her skinny jeans. The Russell and Bromley heels didnapost stop her at the volleyball net but she did tell one young fencer: Iaposd like to give it a go but Iaposve brought the wrong shoes. She chatted to aspiring athletes and watched them play badminton, volleyball, fencing and wheelchair basketball before posing for a photo with the group. Kate was joined at Londonaposs Olympic Park Copper Box by rower Katherine Grainger and wheelchair basketball player Ade Adepitan as they tutored the next generation of Britainaposs athletes. Hockey Hockey is one of Kateaposs first sporting loves. Sheaposs very good too, having captained her team as a schoolgirl at Marlborough College. Back in , the duchess swapped her skirt suit and heels for a tracksuit top and trainers to join Great Britain’s women’s Olympic hockey team.  And she even grabbed a hockey stick and joined in the practice session herself during her visit to the London  Olympic Park. The dressed-down royal ditched her trademark LK Bennett heels for comfortable trainers as she ran around the pitch at the Riverside Arena in bright coloured skinny jeans .The Duchess’s visit boosted the team, and some took to Twitter to share their excitement.England and GB hockey player Kate Walsh wrote: “A real pleasure and an honour to meet and play hockey with HRH the Duchess of Cambridge this morning!  “Think our team have got Royal approval!” Hannah Macleod praised Kate’s sporting skills, adding: “A pleasure and an honour to meet HRH the Duchess of Cambridge this morning at the Olympic Park. “Sheaposs quite handy at hockey too!” Table tennis As a spectator, Kate can often be spotted in the royal box at Wimbledon watching stars like Andy Murray. A patron of the Lawn Tennis Association, sheaposs also partial to the slightly less sophisticated game of ping pong too.  After sister Pippa boasted about her familyaposs skills back in , the duchess displayed the ‘Middleton competitiveness’ when she took on William during their Scotland visit. Onlookers agreed mum-to-be Kate was the better player as the royal couple had a knockabout at the Donald Dewar leisure centre in the Drumchapel area of the city. The pair were joined in a doubles match by teenagers Yaser Razouk and Stephen Grimes.  Both boys, members of the Drumchapel Table Tennis Club, agreed that Kate won in her match against William. Yaser said he thought they would make a really good doubles team. He said: We knew before they came that we were going to give them the bats, but I never thought weaposd end up playing with them. When they were playing each other at singles William was convinced he was winning but I think it was Kate who ended up the winner. Her knack for table tennis appears to extend into the full court game too.Speaking to the Daily Mail, Australian former world number one Rod Laver said: I’d met William and Kate a few times, and in the Royal Box you get a chance to chat with them a little bit.They play tennis against each other. William told me he couldn’t beat her. Rowing The sight of Kate at the helm of a Dragon Boat on the River Thames is one of the defining images of her love story with Prince William. The royal made her now infamous appearance in the boat in  following a brief split from William as the The Sisterhood rowing team prepared for a cross-Channel race in the traditional Chinese vessel against all-boys crew the Brotherhood. The challenge drew throngs of attention from round the world and, though Kate eventually pulled out over security fears, her team went on to complete the gruelling race. The images were so renowned they even made their way into Hollywood’s William and Kate film, which came out shortly before the couple wed. High jump Like that one annoyingly brilliant friend we all know, Kate has proved herself to be a dab hand at nearly every sport over the ears. Sheaposs had a go at cricket, football tennis and even given archery hurdles a go. Perhaps one of the lesser known facts about the accomplished sportwoman, though, is that she still holds a school record in one field. A talented high jumper, Kate set the still-standing record of . metres when she was a pupil at St Andrewaposs School in Pangbourne, Berkshire, which she attended from  to . Clearly, nothingaposs too much of a leap for the daring duchess.Got a story  Get in touch by emailing alex.bellotti@reachplcComment MORE ON Kate Middleton, Duchess of CambridgeRoyal FamilyPrince WilliamWilliam and Kate\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily royal round-up direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Lady Louise Alice Elizabeth Mountbatten-Windsor, , is the daughter of Prince Edward and Sophie, the Countess of Wessex.This week she stepped into the spotlight to commemorate her grandfather Prince Philip in a BBC documentary. Prince Philip: The Royal Family Remembers aired on BBC One on September , and featured interviews from all of the Queen and The Duke of Edinburghaposs children and adult grandchildren.  Among those who paid tribute was Lady Louise, who recalled her close bond with Prince Philip and their shared love for carriage driving. She is the th in line to the throne and is the grandchild of the Queen, , and her late husband Philip. When her parents Prince Edward and Sophie Rhys-Jones got married in , Buckingham Palace announced their children would not be styled as prince or princess. Instead Louise and her brother James, Viscount Severn, are titled as children of an earl. The decision was said to be part of Edward and Sophieaposs hopes for their children to have as normal a childhood as possible.  Thereports that the final decision on whether to take the title of princess will be left up to Louise when she turns . She will choose whether or not to style herself Her Royal Highness Princess Louise after her birthday with her parents, the Earl and Countess of Wessex, said to be leaving the decision up to their daughter. If she decides to take the new title, she will be styled as Her Royal Highness Princess Louise. The Queenaposs other grandchildren have a mixture of titles with Louiseaposs cousins Princess Beatrice and Eugenie also styling themselves as HRH. Princess Anneaposs children Zara Tindall and Peter Phillips have never held HRH status.  Due to the the  Letters Patent HRH titles could only be passed onto the children of the sovereign, the children of the sovereign’s sons, and the eldest living son of the eldest son of the Prince of Wales. This was amended in  to include all the children of the eldest son of the Prince of Wales. As a result all of the Duke of Cambridgeaposs children have HRH status. Royal expert, Phil Dampier, said that as she comes of age Louise could prove to be the monarchyaposs apossecret weapon.apos He said: Because she’s the granddaughter of the Queen, Lady Louise can call herself a princess when she becomes ... and there’s a strong argument for her doing it.  “She seems to be very mature for her age, and she’s shaping up to be precisely the kind of person the Queen can rely on in the future. “Could there be a role for her in a slimmed-down monarchy  The Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh had , patronages between them. You have to ask yourself who is going to continue their legacy, what with Harry and Meghan and Prince Andrew off the scene  There’s a huge workload there.”Meanwhile, there have been several reports that Lady Louise is the Queenaposs favourite grandchild due to their special bond.A royal source previously told The Sun: The Queen loves the fact that Louise and James relish their time at Balmoral, and she has become particularly close to Louise, who seems to have become her favourite grandchild, closely followed by James. The source added: “Louise also endeared herself to everyone by looking after William and Kate’s children when they were up here. “Louise loves drawing and sketching and was very patiently trying to get Charlotte to do pictures of rabbits and deer. Because of her obvious artistic skill, the Queen allowed Louise to look through some of the collection of Queen Victoria’s Highlands sketches which are kept at Balmoral but are rarely dug out these days.” While the spotlight mainly focuses on Princes William and Harry, the Queen has eight grandchildren, and she is said to be close with them all.

Andrew Dellbridge, head of Ace Pest Control, said rats in Norwich are getting aposbigger and braverapos, forcing one couple in the city to leave their home. He said another customer was left speechless when she used her bathroom, heard a noise and then saw a rat in the toilet bowl below her. Mr Dellbridge said the terrying episode is becoming increasingly common and he has spotted rats aposas big as catsapos in the city. He told the Norwich Evening News: I was called out to one job in Norwich and the customer could barely speak, she was in so much shock. Sheaposd been using the bathroom and heard a noise. She looked down and it was in the toilet bowl. And this is happening more and more frequently. They used to work around us but now theyaposre gaining access they wouldnapost have attempted before. Mr Dellbridge added that the issue is becoming worse due to overflowing bins and wild verges being filled with rubbish. The pest control boss has been working flat-out through the summer, despite the winter usually being his busiest time of the year. He said cats are no longer a solution to a vermin problem as aposa sensible cat doesnapost like a big ratapos. It comes after huge rats ran riot in lockdown Britain - with easy access to food meaning the vermin grew in size and number.  Footage showed a pair of them - the size of a small cat - stealing food from hungry birds. The plump animals climbed up the frame before gorging themselves on the food. The large rodents were scampering around in broad daylight in full view of a family in Accrington, Lancs. Experts said the easy access to food - with many businesses closed during the pandemic - caused the UKaposs rat population to skyrocket. The number of rats increased from  million to  million during , according to pest control company pest.  The big freeze, lockdowns and food stockpiling created the ideal environment for rats and mice to enjoy a little quiet time in vacant buildings. A rataposs bite is in fact six times stronger, relative to their size, than a great white shark, pest expert Jenny Rathbone said. Pest controllers have seen evidence of cunning rats moving a crisp packet and placing it over a glue trap, to enable them to travel across it without being caught.

Femicide, the killing of a girl or woman, is a topic that has already been highlighted earlier this year, when Sarah Everard, a -year-old marketing executive, was killed in South London, on her walk back home. These victims tragically add to a horrying statistic that has been recently reported: six women are killed every hour by men around the world, according to UN data. Additionally, a woman is killed by a man every three days in the UK. According to Karen Ingala Smith, co-founder of the Femicide Census, men’s violence against women is a leading cause of the premature death for women globally but research in the UK and Europe is limited and unconnected. Dr Nilufar Ahmed who works as a Behavioural Psychologist at the University of Bristol helped us identy things men can do to help women feel safer and ways to stop violence towards women. How men can help feel women feel safer while walking alone  Being taught consent from a young age Men should learn to accept a womanaposs lack of interest in them. Violence inflicted on women is often entangled with sexual assaults, and therefore should be educated on consent. According to the United Nations Women , freely given and enthusiastic consent should be mandatory, “every time”. UN Women added that phrases like “she was asking for it” or “boys will be boys” attempt to blur the lines around sexual consent, placing blame on victims, and “excusing perpetrators from the crimes they have committed”.  Dr Nilufar Ahmed explained to the Mirror that changing our social attitudes was something that needed to happen across society and from an early age. She said: Understanding consent from an early age. ‘No means no’ is often framed in terms of sexual consent and rape, but it has a much bigger application –someone is rejecting your attention, friendship, or company in any setting, respect this. Schools can play a role in this by teaching young children about respecting boundaries. Being taught gender equality in schools The World Health Organisationpublished a pamphlet revealing that gender inequalities increase the risk of violence by men against women and inhibit the ability of those affected to seek protection. Experts have found that exposing children to non-stereotypical characters found in books and movies, as well as iding housework equally at home, can help children understand the notion that all genders are equal. Stop victim blaming Victim blaming is a way for someone to justy their motivation behind their own crime, while literally blaming their victim for their own action. Too often the behaviour and personalities of the women is scrutinised and judged first before the actions of the man who attacked them. Dr Nilufar Ahmed told The Mirror. She added: As though it is inevitable that a lone woman walking in the dark is automatically at risk of being attacked.  This victim blaming exonerates men from responsibility and blame by focusing on the woman. Allied with this, often when men commit heinous crimes, their crimes are qualied with added information about their lives as ‘good fathers’ or ‘high achieving students’, whilst the women are described only in terms of the way they were dressed and their actions that night. Becoming a better ally to women Doing something as simple as listening to women and their experiences goes a long way. Men should be able to acknowledge their privilege, as well as taking women’s concerns as a serious issue. Furthermore, men should not shy away from calling out blatant sexism and misogynistic behaviour when they witness it. Being supportive and contributing to the safety of women starts by becoming an ally. Destigmatise men’s mental health As the WHO found that potential perpetrators may be at an increased risk of committing femicidethey are unemployed, own a firearm, have made previous threats to kill with a weapon, or have committed sexual violence, men’s mental health needs to be addressed. Saying things like “man up” or “boys don’t cry” nourishes a culture of toxic masculinity which both prevents men from expressing their feelings, but also lead to dangerous behaviour such as resulting in violence instead of communication. According to Dr Nilufar Ahmed, there is not one reason that pushes men to harm and kill women, but it can include psychological reasons such as feeling rejected, feeling incapable of attracting a partner, being angry, feeling emasculated, a need to assert control, feeling entitled. These do not necessarily have to be about women – a man may experience repeated rejection from jobs, be angry at their landlord, etc, She said. She continued: Unaddressed, this can boil over and be projected onto a target that men are stronger than – women. Most men experiencing these will not go on to harm women butthese feelings are overwhelming go unresolved they can be damaging to the inidual and others around them, and could in extreme circumstances lead to aggression and even murder. If men are struggling with any of these issues accessing mental health support can help to work through them. Facilitate women’s access to protection and safety against domestic violence The WHO has revealed that there is an increased risk of perpetuating femicidethe aggressor has a history of intimate partner or family violence. A men with a history of domestic violence thereby is more likely to murder his partner. Domestic violence is reportedly not taken seriously in UK courts, as criminologist Jane Monkton-Smith toldthat her examination of  domestic abuse killings shows how sentences for manslaughter convictions were often mitigated by “ridiculous claims, like how much the perpetrator said they loved the victim”. Immediate things men can do to help according to a psychologist Dr Nilufar Ahmed said: Immediate things men can do are to be mindful to keep a safe distance from women when out walking or running. If you see a situation where a woman looks uncomfortable don’t be afraid to intervene either yourself or by making someone  aware .As a society we must all take responsibility for collective behaviours and actions. This means calling out comments and behaviour that are disrespectful to women whenever we encounter them.

A -second clip shows a balding man wearing a black hooded coat and grey jeans looking over his shoulder and pulling at his hood as he walks down a path. The Met spokesperson told the Mirror earlier today the force was not speculating about the appearance of the manaposs hands or reports of how Sabina may have been killed. Earlier today reports claim police sources believe she was pounced upon and attacked with a hammer just moments after leaving her flat on what should have been a five-minute walk across a park to her pub date.  Detectives have also released an image, captured in the Pegler Square area of Kidbrooke, of a silver car they believe the man has access to. The Met has appealed for anyone who recognised either to contact the force immediately. Detective chief inspector Neil John, from the Metaposs Specialist Crime Command, said an extensive trawl of CCTV in the area continued and said information on the manaposs identity and whereabouts could be vital to the investigation. Sabina was walking to meet a date at The Depot bar in Pegler Square near her home at around .pm last Friday when she was attacked.  A member of the public found her body under a pile of leaves close to the OneSpace community centre in Cator Park, in the borough of Greenwich, on Saturday at around .pm. The politan Police said a -year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of Sabinaaposs murder. The suspect was arrested at an address in Lewisham on Thursday and is being questioned in custody. It is the second arrest Scotland Yard has made in connection with the attack. On Saturday, detectives arrested a man in his s on suspicion of murder before he was released under further investigation.  Ms Nessaaposs cousin Zubel Ahmed remembered her as a beautul soul who loved teaching, telling the BBC that she was the most caring person - kindest, sweetest girl you could meet. Lisa Williams, the head of Rushey Green Primary School where Ms Nessa taught, said staff and pupils are taking our time to reflect and process the devastating news of her death and will be remembering the teacher privately. In a statement, Mrs Williams said: We have shared the details about the vigil with our school community and some people may be attending on a personal level to privately pay their respects.  As a school we are taking our time to reflect and process the devastating news we received this week, and will be commemorating Sabina in our own way. The vigil is being held on Friday evening at pm at Pegler Square, and people who cannot attend are being encouraged to hold a candle at their doorstep at the same time. Reclaim These Streets, a campaign group involved in supporting the Kidbrooke communityaposs vigil for Sabina, said it is angry and heartbroken about her murder. Tower Hamlets Councillor Rabina Khan told BBC Radio aposs Today programme said she was attending the vigil this evening and hoped high profile people would also attend. I too, just like my daughters, I have a -year-old, I have a -year-old, we spoke up for Sarah Everard, she said. When we saw high profile people who attended , I was really pleased and proud that the Duchess of Cambridge attended the vigil... I hope, tonight, we see many profiled people attending Sabina Nessaaposs vigil.Most ReadFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterMORE ON Scotland Yardpolitan PoliceCCTVMurderCCTV footageSabina Nessa\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Ms Nessa, , was taking a five-minute walk to meet a friend at The Depot bar in Pegler Square near her home in Kidbrooke, south-east London, on September  at around .pm when she was attacked. A member of the public found her body close to the OneSpace community centre in Cator Park on Saturday at around .pm. A -year-old man arrested in connection with the murder has been released under investigation, the politan Police said today.  The man was arrested on Thursday at an address in Lewisham, south-east London, and detectives are continuing to appeal for information about another man captured on CCTV in Pegler Square on the evening Ms Nessa was attacked. In a statement released to the PA news agency ahead of a rally at the East London Mosque, her sister Jebina Yasmin Islam said: We as a family are shocked of the murder of our sister, daughter and aunty to my girls. There are no words to describe how we are feeling as a family at the moment. We did not expect that something likewould ever happen to us. I urge everyone to walk on busy streets when walking home from work, school or a friendaposs homes. Please keep safe.  I ask you to pray for our sister and make duafor her. May Allahgrant her paradise. Halima Begum, chief executive of the Runnymede Trust race equality think tank, told PA: Speaking as a woman and a Londoner from the cityaposs Bangladeshi community, Iaposm heartbroken. Sabina is related to members of my extended family and everything I know about her speaks of a beautul, intelligent young woman who had so much le to live, and so, so much to offer in terms of making a positive dference to the peopleaposs lives she touched, not least her familyaposs and the young children she taught at school. Tragically, gender-based violence does not occur in isolation. I do not know how many more women will suffer before our streets are safe. What I do know is that Sabinaaposs death fills all of us with grief. Londoners, regardless of their gender, are hopeful that Sabinaaposs murderer will be found and brought to justice swtly.  Community leaders and Asian women, some of whom said they were too wary to attend a vigil for Ms Nessa on Friday night in south-east London but still wanted to show their solidarity in a location they feel safe, are among those who are gathering at the mosque. Fridayaposs events in memory of Ms Nessa come a week after she died and as the public spotlight is thrown on womenaposs safety and gender-based violence. Her death comes after the public outrage and protests over the abduction and murder of -year-old marketing executive Sarah Everard as she walked home alone in south London in March. Sufia Alam, of the East London Mosque and the Maryam Centre, said: This brutal murder of one of our shining stars is genuinely saddening and deeply shocking. I have three daughters, and I canapost even begin to express what I am feeling right now. Sarah Everard was one of our daughters, and so was Sabina Nessa - their lives were tragically cut short - at the hands of violence and brutality. We have much work to do against the violence faced by women in our society. We will not stop campaigning until our mothers, sisters and daughters are safe anywhere and everywhere. She said this state of affairs is not just about women and girls being vulnerable, this is about men and boys and educating them early on about respecting and honouring women and girls, and treating them with the dignity they deserve. Ms Alam, who is set to be at the east London rally where many women are due to attend, added: When a Muslim woman is murdered, this dampens the aspirations of other Muslim women and girls in education and employment - and this will be particularly hard for us to deal with and manage.Most ReadFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterMORE ON House of CommonsMurderCrimePoliticsHate crimeSabina Nessa\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Scotland Yard is appealing for help as detectives work around the clock to solve the -year-oldaposs murder in south London. Sabinaaposs death has led to widespread grief and amplied concerns about womenaposs safety after she was killed as she was about to set out on what should have been a five-minute walk. Sabina had left her Kidbrooke home to make the short journey across a park to a pub to meet a date at around .pm Friday when she vanished. A dog walker discovered her body under a pile of leaves at a park the following day. Sabina was described as “beautul, talented and caring” by her grieving sister. Pals said the talented young woman had dreams of moving abroad to teach in Dubai.  Where did she vanish  Detectives say Sabina, a teacher at the Rushey Green Primary School in Lewisham, set out on what would have been a five-minute journey to meet a friend at a pub in Kidbrooke Village, south London, at around .pm Friday. Her short journey would have taken her about  minutes from her Astell Rd home across Cator Park to get to The Depot in Pegler Square. Pals have said she was excited about going on a date with an old friend that evening at the bar. But she never arrived. Sabina was not reported missing by anyone after failing to show up to the bar. Adog walker found her body near a walkway close to the OneSpace community centre in Cator Park, Kidbrooke, in the Royal Borough of Greenwich at around .pm Saturday, under a pile of leaves. Police have not yet said publicly at what point of the journey she is believed to have been attacked.  What was the cause of death  A post-mortem carried out at Greenwich Mortuary proved to be inconclusive, police said on Monday. Detectives have said they believe she was hit with a heavy object and was taken to Cator Park, where her body was found. A Met Police spokesman said the force is not commenting on the reporting on the suspected murder weapon.Who killed her Police have said they were keeping an open mind on a motive to the killing, which has been widely reported as a suspected stranger attack Speaking at the scene where tributes had been laid to Sabina next to the police cordon at Cator Park on Thursday, Detective Chief Superintendent Trevor Lawry said earlier he is “keeping a completely open mind” on what the motive of the attacker may have been.  Asked whether detectives were worried the killer could attack someone , he said: “We have lines of inquiry that we’re pursuing at the moment. “It’s always a concern that it may happen, but that’s not something that we have any intelligence on at this time.” Asked whether he believed the killing was a stranger attack, DCI Lawry told reporters:“That’s definitely a line of inquiry that we’re looking at.” Sabinaaposs flatmate, speaking on condition of anonymity, told reporters she feels unsafe after losing her friend. Her fearful housemate of four months said she had last seen Sabina when the pair hung out and took pictures together.She told: ‘I never thought something like this could happen to her. I had been texting her and it’s not like her to not reply to my messages.“I don’t feel safe living here now.”  Who is the man in the CCTV images  Police say CCTV images of a man seen walking through south London is another person they would like to speak to. The force says the unknown man was in the area at the time of the attack, as well as pictures of a silver car they believe he has access to. The images of the man, taken from CCTV, shows him walking in Pegler Square, south London, on the evening Sabina was attacked. Where is the mystery car captured on CCTV going  Police have also released an image of the car they believe the man has access to, which was also captured in the Pegler Square area. Police are urging anyone who recognises the man and vehicle to make contact immediately. They have not revealed any more detail yet about exactly where or when the car was seen or what direction it was heading. However they have said they are appealing for sightings of the man and car across the south London borough of Greenwich, including in Catford, Kidbrooke and Greenwich itself. Have arrests been made  A man in his s was arrested on suspicion of murder at an address in Lewisham on Saturday evening, and was later released under police investigation. The politan Police announced on Thursday that a second, -year-old man had been arrested at an address in Lewisham on suspicion of Sabinaaposs murder and was being held in custody.  What you can you to help Police want to speak to anyone who may have seen anything that could help their investigation. Anyone who recognises the man in the CCTV images or has seen him in recent days is being urged to contact the Met. Detective Chief Inspector Neil John, from the Metaposs Specialist Crime Command, said: Our team have been working tirelessly to find the person responsible for Sabinaaposs murder and this has included an extensive trawl of CCTV, work which remains ongoing. We would ask anyone - especially those in Kidbrooke and the wider area of Lewisham and Greenwich - to take a careful look at these images to check whether you know who this man is or have seen him over recent days. Any information as to his identity or whereabouts could be vital for our investigation so we are asking you to share this image far and wide to ensure as many people as possible see it.  Where to attend the vigil for Sabina Nessa Vigils are being held for Sabina in locations around London later on Friday, and people are being encouraged to light candles on their doorsteps. Reclaim the Streets, a campaign group calling for an end to male violence against women, involved in organising previous vigils, said it is “angry and heartbroken” about her murder. Sabinaaposs death comes after the killings of Sarah Everard, who was knidnapped and murdered by a Met cop as she walked home, and sisters Bibaa Henry, Nicole Smallman, who were stabbed to death in a park. ‘I don’t feel safe living here now.’ Sabinaaposs community of Kidbrooke in Greenwich have organised a vigil at pm on Friday evening in Pegler Square, with the support of Reclaim these Streets. The vigil will be held to remember Sabina, how she lived and the lives she transformed as campaigners demand womenaposs rights to safety, the campaign group says.

Experts and researchers from the University Hospital A Coruna in Spain believe those who can manage the feat in less than a minute have better heart . Lead author Dr Jesus Peteiro, a cardiologist at University Hospital A Coruna, Spain, said: The stairs test is an easy way to check your heart health. If it takes you more than one-and-a-half minutes to ascend four flights of stairs, your health is suboptimal, and it would be a good idea to consult a doctor.  The main symptoms of coronary heart disease are: chest pain, shortness of breath and pain throughout the body, as well as feeling faint and also feeling sick . Last week, it was revealed in a study during a follow-up of almost  years of adults with hearts disease that continued low physical activity was linked to  per cent lower risk of dying from any cause. And sustained high physical activity was linked to a  per cent lower risk of death compared to those who are inactive, the Nord-Trondelag Health Study found.Coronary heart diseaseis a major cause of death in the UK and worldwide. CHD is sometimes called ischaemic heart disease or coronary artery disease. The main symptoms of coronary heart disease are:chest painshortness of breath pain throughout the body feeling faint feeling sick Coronary heart disease can develop when your heartaposs blood supply is blocked or interrupted by a build-up of fatty substances in the coronary arteries. The process - atherosclerosis - is when the walls of your arteries can become furred up with fatty deposits, which are called atheroma. Atherosclerosis can be caused by lestyle factors, such as smoking and regularly drinking excessive amounts of alcohol.

It’s important to note that everyone copes with grief in dferent ways, and there is no real right or wrong in the grieving process.With digital reminders of your loved one on social media s like Facebook and Instagram, things can get really tough. Although there are ways to turn off the profiles, you may still miss their online presence and knowing that they are a short message away for a quick chat.Reopening old text messages are bound to bring up many emotions, but what about those who continue to text their loved one  It’s now a common coping mechanism, and experts say it can actually be useful for those to deal with the transition. When considering why many people do this to cope with their loss, psychologist Ingrid Collins said: “When a loved one dies, we find it hard to adjust immediately to the fact that they are no longer physically with us. “In the first stages of grief, we tend to become emotionally numb as a result of the trauma of bereavement, often finding it dficult to accept that they are really gone.”FRisk is a wakeup call for the millions of people with no will or protection in place for their own death. FRisk is a FREE intuitive app that produces a FRisk Score confirming the level of risk your family and loved ones face were you to die without effective planning in place. Use Frisk to find out your own personal FRisk Score including: What would happen to your children  Who’s entitled to your estate  Who can bring claims  How much tax would you pay  What about your pets and your digital estate  Plus much more. Get your FREE FRisk Score now by clicking here. It is in this phase that many find it comforting to ease adjustment to a loss by continuing on a conversation. Ingrid continued: “Be it imaginary, as some believe, or communicating with the lingering soul of the loved one, as others believe. “Either way, it is a way of softening the harsh reality of never being in their physical presence again.  As a culture, it’s no doubt that we are taught to cope well with bereavement, with a “stf upper lip” approach for many. To some, that may signy that the inidual may not be coping well at all, and bottling up any emotions from others. When talking about text messaging loved ones that have passed away, Ingrid said: “Any method that enables us to prolong the comfort of the relationship with the deceased or,the bond was challenging, to go some way to resolving the relationship, is to be welcomed. “Sometimes people cling on to their loved one’s physical possessions that serve as a reminder. “This is one way of adjusting. Some take up a campaign in order to bring some meaning to what might otherwise appear to be a random or supposedly preventable death.” In short, those who choose to communicate with a deceased person are “taking an effective shortcut to arriving at some measure of acceptance.” Comment MORE ON GrievingText messagesFrisk\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Bradley Lynn, , and Connor Williams, , have been filmed carrying stacks of waste to leave at deserted roadsides. Environment chiefs launched an investigation to find the fly-tippers after they used fake number plates to carry out the crimes. CCTV footage shows Lynn and Williams apparently travelling in an untaxed and unregistered tipper van. The pair were spotted dumping rubbish at a former LG site in Newport, South Wales, in September and October last year. The site has been dubbed the Road to Nowhere as it has become a hotspot for fly-tipping.  Lynn, of Splott, Cardf, and Williams, of Trowbridge, pleaded guilty to an offence under the Environmental Protection Act . Magistrates in Newport fined each man £ and ordered them to pay costs of £, and a victimaposs surcharge of £. Newport city council said it worked with Gwent Police and Fly Tipping Action Wales to bring them to court.  After the case, Councillor Roger Jeavons said: I would like to thank the public for providing information that led to the identication of these two people. As well as fines, they could have faced being sent to prison for this crime and I hope this prosecution will act as a deterrent to others who illicitly dump waste. Residents should also note thatthey employ others to clear waste and itaposs not disposed of legally then they would also be liable and could be prosecuted.  We will not hesitate to take action against those who deliberately dump refuse on our land. It is a crime that blights our communities, the city and our environment and it will not be tolerated.

Sunday will be slightly cloudier but the temperature will otherwise remain around C in most places. The western parts of England and the whole of Wales could see some cloud and potential rain on Saturday morning before it brightens up in the afternoon with highs of C.  This could take a turn on Sunday with some heavy showers in the South East. North-western Scotland meanwhile will be windy in the morning on Saturday before becoming a mainly dry day with some bright or sunny spells developing and highs of C. Sunday will be largely dry and bright with strong southerly winds around the coast. The weather will take a turn on Monday, with the Met Office predicting next week to be the start of autumnal weather.It comes as people have been warned by the AA to not top up their cars outside of their normal routines ahead of planning any potential weekend trips away to take advantage of the weather. Nicky Maxey, for the Met Office, said: Youaposre much more likely to see highs of  degrees more widely but we could see some spots reaching highs of  or C.  It will be similar on Sunday, with places such as Lincolnshire potentially seeing similar temperatures, but still the higher temperatures being in isolated pockets rather than widespread. She added: Sunday perhaps will see an increased chance of rain, but thereaposs still plenty of sunny spells around and fine weather. But we have got a cold front moving in to Northern Ireland and Scotland on Sunday and then crossing from east to west of the UK on Monday. Thataposs bringing some potentially heavy rain. Thereaposs still some sunshine scattered round on Monday but we could see heavier showers. Hail and thunder is also a risk to the North and West, so Monday heralds a real change towards the autumnal-style weather. Weather forecast for Saturday: Starting rather cloudy with occasional drizzle or rain in the west, especially northwestern Scotland where it will also become increasingly windy. Some sunny intervals likely where. Very warm in sunshine. Outlook for Sunday to Tuesday: Still warm for many on Sunday, some heavy showers in the South East. Rain and stronger winds arriving into the west starting a change to cooler, unsettled conditions early next week.

There will be three more days of sunshine - Friday, Saturday and Sunday - before the weather turns cooler next week. The mini-heatwave has only affected southern parts of the country, while northern areas have experienced strong winds and heavy rain. The best conditions and high temperatures will be felt in the east and central parts of the UK over the next few days, according to the Met Office. Met Office meteorologist Alex Deakin said: “Plenty more sunshine across much of the country today.  “Much of southern Scotland and certainly most of England and Wales will have another fine day of September sunshine. “Temperatures are responding to that sunshine, heading up into the low twenties - C, maybe C across parts of the south east.” But the early autumn sunshine will only continue for a few more days before torrential rain and gales hit Britain and temperatures turn cooler. The Met Office said that at the beginning of next week Brits will see a sht in weather conditions.An active weather front will bring heavy rain and blustery winds as it pushes in from the west across the UK, forecasters said. Meteorologist Adam Thornhill said: For the rest of this week and for the weekend, we will continue to see low pressure systems bringing blustery weather to the north of the UK whereas further south the drier, warmer weather remains thanks to the influence of high pressure extending up from the Azores. However, a sht in the position of the jet stream brings a change in our weather next week, allowing a cold front associated with a low-pressure system in the North Atlantic to spread eastwards bringing wet and windy conditions across the whole country throughout Monday.  Behind the cold front, conditions will feel much more autumnal with a cooler feel and blustery showers for many. Next week, gusty winds will create a more autumnal feel across many areas of the country. The Met Office said the weather will turn cooler from Monday, but temperatures are expected to slowly recover to above average as we move into October. UK  day weather forecast This Evening and Tonight: Some rain crossing Scotland, with low cloud, mist and drizzle also spreading to some western areas later. Further south and east, some clear spells, and for southern and central England the chance of some fog patches. Windy in the north. Friday: Low cloud and drizzle continuing to affect some areas especially parts of the west and southwest, though some sunshine east of hills. Further east, a better share of warm sunshine. Outlook for Saturday to Monday: Mainly fine and warm Saturday. Some rain for the northwest. Scattered showers overnight into Sunday, perhaps heavy in the southeast. Squally band of rain pushes east Sunday and into Monday.Most ReadDont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON WeatherMet Office\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

But it was the reason why one particular child couldn’t focus that changed everything for deputy head-teacher Rebekah Wilson.“A boy in my class didn’t seem his normal happy self and he couldn’t concentrate for scratching his stomach,” says -year-old Rebekah, known as Bex. “He told me he didn’t have a bed at home, and the cushion he shared with his brother to sleep on was infested with bed bugs.”This was the moment that Bex, who works at an inner city primary school in Leeds, realised the impact that hygiene could have on her pupils and their education. “Times are hard for some families who are having to choose what they can do without,” she says. “Hygiene items often get sacriced. We’re not talking luxuries here, just the absolute basics like toilet roll, shampoo, deodorant, shower gel and soap. “Going without these things affects kids’ self-esteem. Imagine what it’s likeyou can’t keep yourself clean or you don’t have clean clothes  It can really stop children learning, engaging and taking part at school and it can lead to bullying or them being singled out.” Happily there’s an organisation that’s helping to relieve the pressure. The Hygiene Bank, which stresses that being clean is a basic human right, collects new, unused, in-date personal care and household cleaning essentials and distributes them to families in need through schools like Bex’s and charities.  And Boots has been supporting The Hygiene Bank by hosting more than  banks in stores across the UK where customers can donate their own hygiene products. The retailer then donates four products for every kilogram that has been donated. Toothbrushes and toothpaste are two items Bex knows are particularly needed. “So many children are coming to school with tooth problems now,” she says. “Bad dental health can cause a lot of pain and distress and really affect children’s confidence.” But something as simple as shampoo or shower gel can also improve the wellbeing and happiness of those struggling to stay afloat. “I had a mum in tears the other day because we’d given her a hygiene package that included some shower gel. As little as a p bottle can make a dference. She said it felt like Christmas.” Another mum had just £ left for her weekly shopping. “She needed nappies, washing powder and washing up liquid. She didn’t know what to buy because she knew she couldn’t get it all.” Hygiene products provided through The Hygiene Bank across the UK help fill the gap. “We all deserve a certain minimum,” says Bex. “We need to ensure every family has access to these basics, and remove the stigma of asking for support, making sure that families are treated with respect.” Boots leads big donation drive Boots and charity The Hygiene Bank are working together to provide much-needed hygiene and personal care products to people living in poverty.  In the last year, Boots, which has more than  donation points in stores across the UK, has given more than , items – from toothpaste to shower gel, soap to shampoo – to hundreds of communities and charities across the UK. Boots donates hygiene products to The Hygiene Bank. And since it believes every child has the right to feel good when they go back to school, Boots has also worked with the charity to design educational resources for parents and teachers to help young people understand hygiene and hygiene poverty. In its ‘You donate  we donate’ initiative, Boots gives four products for every kilogram of items donated to The Hygiene Bank in Boots stores.You can donate at your local Boots donation point, through the boots e-voucher scheme, and directly to The Hygiene Bank. Products are distributed to those who need them via schools, charities, council services and voluntary organisations. Milford on Sea Boots Store Manager Charlotte Whiteside says: “We’re very grateful for anything that our kind-hearted customers donate – but essentials include shampoo, toothpaste and sanitary products.” Shampoo Deodorant Toilet roll Period products Toothpaste Toothbrush Soap Nappies "},{"url":null,"title":"why stormed good morning britain","story":":root Why I stormed off Good Morning Britain - Richard and Susanna dont get itI was expecting to be called a hypocrite, but Richard Madeley and Susanna Reid arent ready to accept that climate breakdown will endanger the very fabric of our society, writes Insulate Britain spokesman Liam Nortonthis.style.displaynone\" Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will auto-play soonCancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror video gmb-richard-madeley-criticises-activist-,customFields:,enableJWPlayer:true,jwPlayerSiteID:hPpIvH,jwPlayerMediaID:LIHlmnhw,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : #

It all got a bit heated.I was prepared to be called a hypocrite, a fascist and to be asked why I don’t go to China to be shot at . I’ve been managing quite well during the last few weeks to stay calm during the barrage of questions that have been coming my way. People have been quite rightly furious and upset by what we are doing and I accept that. What frustrated me on Wednesday was the refusal by the other people on the programme to accept the physical reality we are in. The reality that Sir David King means when he says, “What we do in the next three to four years will determine the future of humanity”. That’s the reason I’m on the telly sitting through that rage and anger. It is because I really care about the country I live in and all the people who live here. Do you agree with Insulate Britainaposs actions  Have your say in the comments below  What the GMB presenters are not ready to accept is that climate breakdown isn’t primarily about survival of polar bears and dolphins, as important as they are, but about the survival of our economy, our NHS and of the very fabric of our society. This means many people will suffer.  What Insulate Britainis asking for is to conserve our society. To do that at this time means having to make some tough decisions, we understand that. The comparisons to Churchill on the programme upset Richard Madeley. I wasn’t saying that IB were the same as Churchill, what I was saying was that there were some similarities. The people that didn’t want to oppose Hitler were seen as appeasing Hitler. Churchill understood that you either faced up to the reality now or you paid for it later. He had the support of just six MPs. That meant that  million people lost their lives. It was locked in. There is a similarity now. If we don’t move as rapidly as Sir David King says we should, the suffering of millions of people in the next few decades will be locked in, unstoppable. What was happening on GMB on Wednesday was appeasement. A refusal to accept the reality, while also turning their anger of that reality onto me. Well we feel angry too. Angry that our government has ignored our letters, petitions and protests for  years.Insulating our homes is our line in the sand and we will not let them cross it. It gives the best value for money in terms of CO emissions, will provide hundreds of thousands of meaningful jobs and will stop tens of thousands of our elderly from freezing to death each winter and means families can heat and eat. This isnapost aboutmy home is insulated or not. Itaposs not about whether Iaposm a hypocrite for calling for all homes to be insulated. Itaposs about how tackling the climate crisis will not only save our country from destruction, but also benefit millions of our citizens and bring them out of fuel poverty. Itaposs a win-win. What Richard and Susanna don’t seem to understand is thatthe government continues to ignore us, it will get much more heated.

And sometimes itaposs very explicit.“Iaposve had people try and stop and talk to me a lot or try grabbing my arm and talking to me. Just being very persistent. Day and night. People shouting things at you, following you, I feel like thereaposs too many examples.” The -year-old, who set up the initiative in March in the wake of the Sarah Everard case, has seen it quickly grow to a worldwide community. She started it with a friend while studying in Exeter and similar groups were quickly launched in Birmingham, Cardf, Portsmouth and Brighton.Have you been affected by this story  Let us know at webnews@mirror  Talisker is in the process of setting up groups across London and next week one goes live in Amsterdam. Plans are also in the works for a Toronto version of Urban Angels. The group is used for alerts, discussions about safety measures, and many cities now have walking schemes to pair up people walking in the same direction late at night. She was speaking in light of the murder of Sabina Nessa, who was found dead in Kidbrooke, south-east London, on Saturday morning.The -year-old school teacher had been walking a short distance to the pub from her home the night before when she was attacked. It comes as Transport for London said it has no plans for theof the Night Tube until next year after the Covid pandemic saw the service halted. The   train service operated on Fridays and Saturdays for the Victoria, Jubilee and most of the Piccadilly, Central and Northern lines.It means night buses, taxis or walking are often the only means of transport home after dark. “Itaposs not a good move. In terms of womenaposs safety and safety for non-binary people,” said Talisker of the decision to hold off on reintroducing the service.  “I really want the Night Tube back. Andy Lord, managing director of the London Underground, said: “We are playing, and will continue to play, our full role in London’s recovery from the pandemic. We are running as close to a full service as possible across all our services and the Tube continues to serve Central London with last trains leaving around : and starting again at :. Our extensive night bus network continues to operate. We are continuing to review our options for when we might be able to reintroduce the full Friday and Saturday Night Tube in a safe and viable way and are exploring the feasibility of reintroducing some services on one or two lines more quickly.” Talisker believes people might feel safer using the Night Tube rather than the night buses which still operate across London but can be a minefield. “One of the big things for safety that a lot of people always say is familiarity, she said. If you donapost know where you are, you’re instantly less safe, because you kind of donapost understand which routes you are taking, youaposre potentially going to be out for longer or later.” The campaigner went on to say Tubes are in areas more densely populated and often staffed.

Emma Cousins, , from Sheffield, has been living with one eye after being diagnosed with mesenchymal chondrosarcoma in April . She had noticed her left eye appearing to grow and bulge and shortly after her daughteraposs second birthday she went to AE to get checked out as she started to feel unwell. Emma, who is mum to an -year-old son and five-year-old daughter, said: “My eye felt stretched and I felt sick. “The doctor thought it was a small bleed so I saw an out of hours optician who askedI had any selfies on my phone.  “I had six years’ worth of pictures so I showed the optician, who asked to see pictures of me from further back. “It was at that point I thought ‘oh no something is wrong’. I managed to find pictures of me at . “The optician said he didn’t know for sure but that it looked like something had been growing behind my eye since I was .” Looking at the images side-by-side, Emma could see a subtle dference as her eye appeared to grow and bulge over time. She was booked in for an MRI scan which found a large tumour growing behind her eye and in April  a biopsy was taken to seeit could be salvaged.  Sadly, nothing could be done and she was diagnosed with a form of sarcoma cancer – and told she would lose her eye. Emma said: “I thought ‘no, it can’t be, I’m too young’ and the doctor was acting very nervous. “The doctor said ‘the eye will have to come out’ and told me I’m the only person in England with it, and that chemotherapy wouldn’t work.“He told me not to Google it but obviously that was the first thing I did when I was alone.“I wish I had listened as all I could find were pages saying it spreads to the lungs and you die. “After reading that it made me panic and the reality kicked in – I was going to lose my eye and I had cancer.” Over the following weeks, surgeons planned the tricky, warning Emma that, while they would remove as much of the tumour as possible, she would be left disfigured. Emma said: “I had to tell my children because, with my eye going, I couldn’t hide it from them. “I told them I needed to have my eye removed then I would be better.” In June , she had her eyeball removed in a terrying procedure. Emma said: “I was nervous but knowing I had cancer and how bad it could be made me feel better about it. “Losing an eye for a chance of saving my le was a risk I was willing to take. “I think one of the worst things was  minutes before the eye removal, one of the nurses drew an arrow on my forehead to highlight which eye it was – and for the rest of my time left with two eyes I was panicking they would take the wrong eye out by mistake. “My main concern was what would happen with the kids – my daughter was so young at the time, so she wouldn’t remember anything about me.” Thankfully, Emma made it through the tough surgery and started a six-week course of radiation therapy, which caused burns to her skin. Sadly, she had a reaction to the treatment and ended up in ICU connected to a ventilator as she fought off the debilitating symptoms linked to fulminant multiple sclerosis, which left her “completely paralysed”. She said: “I couldn’t even talk – it was like being completely locked in my own body, unable to communicate anything. “Doctors told my family I would die, but to their surprise I regained the ability to talk, my arms started to work, and I have slowly recovered to the point I can now walk myself – although not as well as I used to.”  Her medics were left equally baffled by the adverse reaction and much is still unclear about why Emma suffered so much post-surgery. As soon as she saw herself with one eye, Emma realised she looked “dferent to anybody ”. She said: “The first thing I can remember thinking was ‘wow it doesn’t look as bad as I thought’. “It was still a few months before it all settled and the bruising had gone down, but it looked so much nicer than I had presumed it would look. “I actually liked it because everything has been done now with hair and makeup, whereas everyone notices how dferent I look – and I try to live up to that with my eye patches. “After all, they are going to stare at me anyway, so why not give them something to stare at ” Later that month in June , Emma was referred to have a prosthetic eye made, but found it to look “fake” and be too much “faff”, so opted instead to wear glasses and eye patches. Over time, a small hole developed in her empty socket – which doctors believe was caused by the radiation – that has been widened. Emma said: “Because the radiation has killed veins in my socket they supply the skin with blood and because blood cannot get to the area the skin dies and that’s what the hole is. “I’ve waited over a year for the operation but now the hole is getting bigger simple things like having a shower or being in heavy rain can drown me. “As the hole is directly connected to my lungs – meaning anything going in my eye can enter my lungs. “I have to stay away from a swimming pool and baths as I could drown.” Her children have been incredibly supportive, as Emma explained: “They have been wonderful. When the hole first appeared to now, they have had to see it grow in size but have been great at adapting – even though it has meant no swimming, which they love. “I don’t think they realise just how good they have been throughout all of this. “They have had to grow up so fast and seen daily not only how big the hole is getting, but my daily struggle to recover.” Despite her suffering, she has received global attention on TikTok, after taking to the social media  to share videos of her empty socket. One video received  million views, with thousands of fans cheering her on. One person said: I would just like to say this is not scary but inspiring, unique and beautul. Because this is who you are. This is so powerful, another fan added. Someone  commented: No offence but it kinda looks like your eye is breathing but your beautul. [sic] Emma also showed off her unique party tricks – which include blowing out candles with the hole in her socket. Now, the mum is focusing on continuing her recovery, which should involve a procedure taking a chunk of skin from her leg to cover the hole in her eye socket.

Joanne Elmes said the mark looked like a textbook sign of cancer, prompting her to send a picture of it to the doctors.Her mum was then handed a two-week urgent referral for the mole to be removed, PlymouthLive reports.Doctors confirmed her mum had melanoma in situ - which is the earliest stage of skin cancer - and luckily the disease had not spread through her body. Joanne thought something might be wrong after noticing her mumaposs mole had a iation of colours with irregular borders. The dentist described the mole as looking just like the photographed examples of superficial spreading malignant melanoma.  Joanne and her fellow healthcare professionals have become the first line of defence in spotting skin cancer in patients after skin cancer charity Skcin rolled out an education programme in  aimed at those who work in the hair, beauty and healthcare industry. The thought process behind the roll out was that these iniduals would be spending a lot of time with customers or patients, meaning they would be perfectly placed to observe abnormalities or changes that may occur on their client’s or patient’s skin. Discussing how she was able to spot the early signs of skin cancer in her mum, Joanne said: I had seen a mole on the back of my motheraposs arm that looked dferent. I carried out closer inspection.  It was approximately mm in diameter, irregular borders, and iation of colours. I felt it looked just like the photographed examples of superficial spreading malignant melanoma given to me in my Pro training with Skcin. I took a photo of it next to a tape measure and my mother uploaded the photograph on an e-consult form to the doctors. She got a  week urgent referral and had it removed by dermatology. It has now been confirmed to be an aposin situapos melanoma and therefore has not spread thankfully. It was on the back of her right arm. Risk factors included: sun bathing when she was young, wearing olive oil and lemon juice on her skin, using sunbeds in her early twenties, and living in New Zealand for four years. Iaposve also encouraged my dad to go to the doctors which he now has a two-week referral as he has a suspicious lesion on his foot! Iaposve done so many more referrals as a dental therapist from before the training. Get all the latest news sent to your inbox.for the free Mirror newsletter Since the early s rates of non-melanoma skin cancer has risen by % in the UK with cases expected to reach almost , by . The incidence of melanoma has risen faster than any other common cancer in the UK. According to Cancer Research UK,  in  males and  in  females will be diagnosed with melanoma during their letime and alarmingly, it is one of the biggest killing cancers in the - age group. However, the good news is that around % of all cases are preventable. It is also the only cancer we can physically see developing in it’s early stages, so with education, the hope is these statistics can reverse and save many lives. What Causes Skin Cancer Around % of all skin cancers are caused by overexposure to UV radiation from the sun and or sun beds. Sunburn, reddening, peeling and even tanning of the skin, is clear indication of sun damage. While many people associate a tan with looking healthy, a tan is actually a sign that our skin has been harmed by UV radiation and is trying to defend itself against further damage. Sunburn has strong links to melanoma. When we burn, the superficial layers of the skin release chemicals that cause the blood vessels to expand and leak fluid, causing swelling, pain and redness. Without sun protection UV radiation starts to penetrate deep into the layers of the skin, causing damage to the DNA in our skin cells. Damage from UV is cumulative and irreparable, therefore once the tan fades, the damage remains, which can result in serious consequences over time.  Is skin cancer risk determined by skin colour  We all have ying skin colours that respond dferently to UV radiation emitted from the sun. However, everyone, regardless of skin colour, can sunburn and accumulate sun damage, meaning we are all at risk from skin cancer. Melanin - the natural pigment that gives our skin dferent colours exists to help protect our skin from UV radiation. When we tan our skin is busy producing melanin to help protect it from the sun’s harmful rays. The darker our skin, the more melanin we have and the longer it takes our skin to burn. The paler our skin, the less melanin we have and the quicker our skin will burn. Although those with fairer skin who tend to burn more easily are at greater risk of skin cancer, the simple fact that our skin has changed colour is a sign of sun damage. Damage is permanent and cumulative, so the more we tan or burn, the greater our inidual risk of developing skin cancer. Whilst Caucasians are the primary victims of skin cancer - everyone, regardless of skin colour, can fall prey to it. It is a common misconception that people with darker skin colours are immune to melanoma. This is one reason why people of colour are diagnosed with skin cancer at later stages. Unfortunately, these delays mean that skin cancers are often more advanced and potentially fatal, whereas most skin cancers,detected early, are almost always curable. How should we protect our skin from UV radiation  Around % of skin cancers can be avoided by adopting simple sun safe strategies. Simply check the daily UV Index and when UV levels reach  or above take action to protect your skin by following Skcin’s Five S’s of Sun Safety:Slip on clothing Slop on sunscreen Slap on a sun hat Slide on sunglasses Shade from the sun What steps can we take to detect the early signs of skin cancer  Skin cancers seldom hurt and are much more frequently seen than felt. The sooner a skin cancer is identied and treated, the better a person’s chance of avoiding surgery, or in the case of a serious melanoma, potential disfigurement or even death. Getting to know your skin and regularly checking it thoroughly from head to toe, is the best way to spot any potential warning signs. Experts advise checking yourself once a month. There are lots of dferent kinds of skin cancers that can appear in many shapes, sizes and colours, so it’s wise to swot up on the ious forms and characteristics to understand what to look out for. However, as a general rule of thumb use the following checklist andyou detect anything of concern, seek immediate advice from your GP or dermatologist. If a new or existing skin, nail or mucosalpigmented or nonpigmented spot, lump, lesion, mole or freckle:Gets bigger and or changes in shape, particularly getting an irregular outline. Changes colour, gets darker, becomes patchy or multi-shaded. Becomes elevated, firm to touch and is growing. Starts to itch, gets painful, starts bleeding, gets crusty or becomes inflamed. Looks or is behaving dferently to the rest of your moles or skin lesions. Is evolving in any way, such as: changes in size, symmetry, surface characteristics or symptomsSkcin now have trained over  healthcare professionals, all who have embraced the opportunity to upskill and join Skcin’s in our fight to combat skin cancer and get skin cancers detected sooner and raise awareness and the profile of skin cancer in UK.To find out more about the work Skcin do you can visit their website here.

The Sussexes arrived in the Big Apple on Thursday, visiting a   memorial along with New York City mayor Bill de Blasio and the stateaposs governor, Kathy Hochul. While in New York, they have booked to stay at The Carlyle, known as New Yorkaposs “Tower of Power”, and have been spotted having a drink at the hotel’s bar. The Carlyle was known to be a favourite of Harryaposs mum Princess Diana, who often stayed there when she was in the city.  Diana first visited New York in February  as a royal for a three-day solo tour, and ed to the same hotel after her orce in , where she reportedly stayed in the ,-square-foot “Royal Suite” on the nd floor. According to the  documentary “Always the Carlyle”, the late Princess shared the hotel lt with Michael Jackson and Steve Jobs. Prince William and Kate Middleton also stayed at the hotel when they visited New York for a series of royal engagements in .  In another subtle tribute to the Princess of Wales, Harry and Meghan spoke about a subject that was also close to Diana’s heart. While touring the One World Observatory on Thursday, the couple spoke about mental health with Mr De Blasio. The New York City mayor said: “They’re good people and they’re really committed to the world. “I got a great vibe, particularly the work that they’re doing on mental health ... I think the prince makes a great point when he says, ‘mental fitness,’ calling it ‘mental fitness’ as a positive aspirational idea. That was one of the things we talked about. I really admire what they’re both doing on that.”  While she never set out to be an advocate for mental health, Diana had also broken royal barriers decades before by candidly discussing her own struggles with mental health, including postpartum depression, bulimia and self-harm. In a  interview with the BBC, she described her bulimia as “like a secret disease”. “You inflict it upon yourself because your self-esteem is at a low ebb, and you don’t think you’re worthy or valuable,” she said. “You fill your stomach up four or five times a day — some do it more — and it gives you a feeling of comfort.” She added: “It’s like having a pair of arms around you but it’s temporarily, temporary.”  She went on to say that the immense pressure to keep her marriage together left her “crying for help”, but that others used her eating disorder as “a coat on a hanger. “They decided that was the problem — Diana was unstable,” she said. In February , Diana paid a visit to Henry Street Settlement’s Urban Family Center in New York, which offers services and shelter for homeless families with children. During her visit, she met with a group of formerly homeless women who worked at the centre as well as a family who was living there at the time.  The organisation tweeted: The Duke and Duchess of Sussex are in town raising mental health awareness. It reminds us of Princess Diana’s memorable visit to Henry Street in !Writing for Curbed in , the centre’s chief administrator of homeless and transitional housing at the time, Verona Middleton-Jeter, described the royal visit: “She was interested in the problems of homeless women and families, and the program that we had, but she asked more questions about women who were in abusive relationships.”Harry and Meghan are due to appear at Global Citizen Live on Saturday in Central Park to urge world leaders to adopt a vaccine equity policy to help end the pandemic.

The abandoned park - which featured in US television shows including Top Gear America - is currently in a dilapidated state following its permanent closure in .This came after a rocky history including a serious accident that led to a former-employee becoming paralysed, together with three re-opening and subsequent closures.  Seventeen years after it was abandoned, the current state of the former family favourite has been captured in the photographs taken by Shaun, who described the abandoned waterpark as an incredibly surreal scene. In one image, the entrance to the dilapidated park can be seen almost entirely covered in graffiti – a theme which continues through the site, having clearly been frequented by visitors since its closure. In another shot, litter can be seen scattered across the grounds – including what appear to be spray paint cans. What do you think about this story  Sign in and let us know in the comments below  Meanwhile, nature has started to take over the abandoned site, with overgrown trees throughout the park. In an aerial shot, the barren land surrounding the park can be seen – stretching out into the distance. A crumbling slide can be seen in the background of one image, curling around a hill and covered in dirt. Many of the park’s slides were sold years ago, leaving large empty spaces in the once-bustling park.  “I’ve visited the park several times over the years since it was first abandoned, and each time it is slightly more decayed and weather-beaten – not to mention covered in spray paint,” Shaun, who is in his s and lives in northern Nevada, told Jam Press. “This particular visit was in mid-September  after Iaposd heard the property was listed for sale for  million – which kind of seemed like a joke, as it is so damaged itaposs hard to imagine making any al use of the structures and remains of the old waterpark that are still standing.  The Raise the Stakes Photographyaposs owner added: “A large waterpark sitting abandoned in the arid Mojave Desert is an incredibly surreal scene, and itaposs great to see people turn it into essentially a playground and guerrilla art gallery for those others who are willing to hop the fence and explore it. “The state of decay is part of the whole thing, and knowing it wonapost exist forever – whether it becomes some fancy development like the owner is hoping for with listing it for sale, or eventually just reverts to massive lot of sand like much of the other parcels out here – just makes it something to appreciateyou can catch it the window of time that it exists in this state.”  The -acre park is located in the Mojave Desert and was built by local businessman Bob Byers, who named it after his we, Dolores, opening to the public in . Nicknamed the ‘fun spot of the desert’, in its heyday it was chock full of waterslides, zip lines, a lazy river, bumper boats and a go kart track. It closed in the s due to legal and financial problems, later reopening as Rock-a-Hoola Waterpark in , but a year later an accident involving an off-duty employee led to a law suit and a . million judgement against the park.Have you got a story that you think we should feature  Email us at webnews@mirror The employee had slid into an inadequately filled pool and was paralysed from their injuries. Investors declared bankruptcy, leading to the park’s second closure. Finally, it was reopened in  as Discovery Waterpark – but closed permanently in , leaving many of its structures to crumble, though most of the park’s slides were sold to other waterparks. Now, the formerly popular site is for sale with Samina Mahmud at a listing price of  million – and includes permission to develop the property for any commercial use.

High school sweethearts Joel Forchue, , and Mickey Pagan, , met each other in Rhode Island in  when Mickey started attending the school Joel was at. They quickly took an interest in each other and started dating, staying together after high school and starting a le together. Mickey had always known she was bisexual and Joel would joke around with her, saying he was going to have aposfive wivesapos and aposbabies everywhere, of every nationalityapos. One day Mickey called his bluff and suggested they find a girlfriend. In September , Joel met Jaida Cutino, , on MeetMe, an app that allowed people to chat and make friends.  As Mickey listened to them chatting, she realised she also had common interests with Jaida. Over time, the couple would wait for Jaida to come online to chat to her and Jaida would wait for the couple. On November , , Mickey and Joel asked Jaida to be their girlfriend and shortly after, Joel got down on one knee and asked Mickey for her hand in marriage. To combat the jealousy that can arise in their relationship, the trio say they stay true to themselves and their intentions and remind each other that no one is loved more than the other.  When they have a moment of jealousy, they always reassure each other and make sure those thoughts donapost escalate. Despite their love for one another, Jaida and Joel have lost contact with members of their families over the relationship. Jaidaaposs mother no longer speaks to her and Jaida says she feels like sheaposs been disowned. Joelaposs mother also stopped talking to him, however he says the younger members of his family have been much more supportive. My family donapost agree with it, they say a man is supposed to be with one woman and thereaposs not supposed to be extra partners, said Jaida.  I used to get really upset and hurt about it because Iaposm a big family person and there was a point where I was really depressed and unhappy about the situation. I still hope one day theyaposll accept Joel and Mickey but I donapost see it moving in that direction. Sometimes my family will invite me to a party but tell me to come on my own and that I shouldnapost bring the people I love. The throuple say people tell them that theyaposre aposgoing to hellapos or that theyaposre aposungodlyapos but the trio hit back and say they go to church and pray before they eat, when they wake up and when they go to bed and feel incredibly close to God.  Being in a triad is like having two best friends and le partners instead of one, said Mickey. Weaposre never alone and thereaposs always someone  to talk to. We donapost see our relationship any dferent and go through le just like everyone . Thankfully my mum is very open and accepting, she says that she has four children now - she always used to call Joel her son and now she calls Jaida her daughter. I want people to know that weaposre all lucky, not just Joel, me and Jaida are lucky too.  People say weaposre not godly because of our relationship but weaposre incredibly close to God and try to be closer and closer every day. If one of us gets pregnant, Joel wants to get the other pregnant so we have kids at the same time and can go through the pregnancy together. We havenapost got anything planned - but at the same time itaposs kind of planned. The throuple say thereaposs no favouritism in the relationship and they all treat each other as equals. Joel and Mickey donapost let the time theyaposve spent together prior to meeting Jaida impact their relationship now. People ask us for advice or a better understanding of a polyamorous relationship but the truth is we donapost know because we didnapost plan for this, said Joel.

Sharing her story anonymously, the woman said that she had been with her partner for three years and they were very happy together - but recently a problem had developed. She said that he had become irate about Chris Pratt, and hated the actor so strongly that he would go on hour-long rants about how terrible he is. The woman said that the problem reached a new height when her boyfriend discovered that the actor would star in the new Mario movie, and his reaction was so severe that she was now considering leaving him. What do you think about the boyfriendaposs actions  Let us know in the comments Taking to Reddit, the woman said: My boyfriendaposs unhealthy hatred of Chris Pratt is affecting our relationship.We have dated for years and he is so sweet and innocent. However, the one thing I canapost stand is how much he talks about hating Chris Pratt.He hated him in Parks and Recreation and even more in s of the Galaxy. Any mention of him always brings him in a bad mood and thataposs why he refuses to watch movies like Jurassic World, Lego Movie, and onward.Things went from bad to worse for the woman when the new animated Super Mario Bros film was announced, and it emerged that Chris Pratt would be the voice of the Italian plumber.She continued: He is a huge Nintendo fan and was looking forward to the Mario movie. When he heard Chris Pratt would be voicing Mario though he had a tantrum where he ended up breaking his Switch as a result. I tried to calm him down but he childishly accused me of supporting Chris Prattand ordered me to leave once I did not agree with his rants.

And another added: My uncle used to go on hour-long rants about trivial shit too, but he was bipolar and it was a facet of his illness.

But one couple recently discovered a apossecretapos room hidden behind a wall in their house. Sarah King and her husband Toby were giving their property in Brighton a fresh lick of paint when they came across the faint outline of a doorway. Sarah, , said: We knew there was a void there, from the plans. The other houses along the road have got a cupboard therebut we had thought ours was completely bricked up.  Get the news you want straight to your inbox. for a Mirror newsletter here.However, while prepping and sanding the walls of their dining room, they came across the outline and had to knowthere was anything more to the space. With Sarah still furloughed but Toby out at work as a technical support engineer, she had some free time on her hands. He went to work one day and I started chipping away the surface just to seethere was any way of finding out what was there, she explained. I just did a tiny bit then sent a photo to Toby - he was replying and happy for me to discover more. As I uncovered the lintel, I realised that it was not resting on the breeze blocks that were blocking the door. They weren’t supporting anything above.  Throughout the process, I was sending updates to Toby, who was cheering me on and friends and family too, who were getting excited to see what I would find in there! Sarah, who has recently launched her own interior design business, managed to chip through the wall and knew there was a room there, but held back until Toby finished work. Sarah said: I waited until Toby was home to make the final hit to smash down the breeze blocks – in case something was staring back at me! It was a tiny room with just a pull-out shelf desk, some knee pads and a car battery. It had electricity to it and believe it or not, hardly any cobwebs and thankfully no spiders. Once they found the room, the couple decided it was the perfect space for a bar area to entertain guests, as it sits just off their dining room. So they have transformed it into their dream bar for just £, mainly using materials they already had at home. The pair had just started work on renovating their dining room and decided to use the same paint in the bar. They then made cupboards for the wall with leftover wood they had from another project and also made a bar top from offcuts and wrapped it in marble effect vinyl. They added new handles to the cabinets and stuck mirror stickers to the back of the bar area to create a mottled glass look.To finish the whole thing off they managed to nab some glass shelves from Facebook Market place for free - bargain!Sarah added: We love it! We are so pleased with it and we love the story behind it of uncovering the space.Do you have a story to share  We want to hear all about it.

As a consequence, the  United Nations Climate Change Conference, also known as COP, will welcome world leaders, ministers, and other high-level officials including The Queen, to discuss climate issues. The conference, which takes place from October ,  until November , , includes multiple events that attract people from the business sector, fossil fuel companies, climate activists and more.   The  Paris Agreement required Parties to help limit the increase in global temperatures to well below  degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels, but preferably to . degrees. This year, the COP could not have come at a more crucial time. What will happen at COP  The official website for the COP has underlined four key points to be addressed during the meetings: . Securing global net zero by mid-century and keeping . degrees within reach.With this in mind, countries will be asked to come forward with ambitious  emissions reductions targets that align with reaching net zero by the middle of the century.  To deliver on these stretching targets, countries will need to:accelerate the phase-out of coal curtail deforestation speed up the switch to electric vehicles encourage investment in renewables.. Adapting to protect communities and natural habitats.This will mean Parties will need to work together to enable and encourage countries affected by climate change to:protect and restore ecosystems build defences, warning systems and resilient infrastructure and agriculture to avoid loss of homes, livelihoods and even lives. Mobilising finance in order to deliver the COP’s first two goals.This will mean that developed countries must make good on their promise to mobilise at least  billion in climate finance per year by . . Parties will be required to work together to rise to the challenges of the climate crisis.They will therefore:finalise the Paris Rulebookaccelerate action to tackle the climate crisis through collaboration between governments, businesses and civil society.  Why does COP matter  The world is now facing unprecedented dangers related to climate change, such as floods, storms, and other environmental hazards. Furthermore, the IPCC gathered the observations of scientists who have confirmed that the Earth’s climate in every region and across the whole climate system, was directly affected by human’s activity, leading to continued sea level rise. Nevertheless, the IPCC has also revealed that strong and sustained reductions in emissions of carbon dioxideand other greenhouse gases would limit climate change. At the COP, participating Parties are due to finalise their national action plans to cut emissions under the Paris Agreement, and therefore limit global warming to C above pre-industrial levels to curb the climate crisis. According to Friends of the Earth , this year’s COP, which was delayed due to COVID- restrictions, is a vital event because the window of opportunity to remain under that crucial . degrees of planetary warming is getting smaller and smaller with each passing year.  FOEaposs director of campaigning impact, Jamie Peters, told Sky News: “Itaposs particularly important to the UK because, as host, all eyes will be looking at what the UK is actually doing,rather than what it says. As one of the nations most responsible for climate change, due to historic pollution, there will be a world focus on the UKaposs role in responding to it - as well as how these talks are chaired.” The th UN Climate Change Conference will take place at the Scottish Event Campusin Glasgow.

The company’s chief executive, Stéphane Bancel, said a boost in vaccine production should mean enough jabs for “everyone on this Earth” by the middle of next year. He said booster shots would be available soon, as would jabs for infants. With the vaccine industry as a whole expanding production, “enough doses should be available by the middle of next year so that everyone on this Earth can be vaccinated”, he said. Mr Bancel added: “Those who do not get vaccinated will immunise themselves naturally, because the Delta iant is so contagious. He continued to the Swiss newspaper Neue Zuercher Zeitung : “In this way we will end up in a situation similar to that of the flu. You can either get vaccinated and have a good winter. Or you donapost do it and risk getting sick and possibly even ending up in hospital.Asked whether that could spell a “ to normal” next year, he replied: “As of today, in a year, I assume.”According to figures published by Our World In Data, . per cent of the world’s population has received at least one dose of a Covid vaccine. In low-income countries, only . per cent of people have received at least one dose, while countries with the highest incomes are getting vaccinated more than  times faster. On Tuesday, United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres slammed wealthy countries for hoarding jabs and called on the world to “wake up” to the greatest “cascade of crises” in our letime. “A majority of the wealthier world vaccinated. Over  per cent of Africans still waiting for their first dose,” he said. “This is a moral indictment of the state of our world. It is an obscenity.” Colombian President Ivan Duque joined Mr Guterres’ calls at the UN General Assembly on Tuesday, and said the international community must equitably distribute jabs to avoid the creation of new, more fearsome iants of the coronavirus.“It is our moral duty,” he said during his speech to the th assembly on Tuesday. Some countries have acquired enough doses for six or seven times their population and have announced third booster doses, he added, while others have not been able to administer any shots. In the UK, booster jabs are currently being offered to the over-s, younger adults with health conditions and frontline health and care workers.

The Well of Barhout in Yemen is shunned by many locals who believe it is a source of eternal bad luck. Located in Yemen’s eastern province of Al-Mahra, the enormous hole in the desert floor spans ft wide and plunges a staggering ft below ground. The cave, thought to be millions of years old, is said to give of strange odours - with tales of the damned and aposnonbelieversapos being sent there in an afterle. A team of Omani explorers decided to explore what really lay at the bottom of the mysterious wonder - making the eerie descent to its floor. Mohammed al-Kindi, a geology professor at the German University of Technology in Oman, told AFP: There were snakes, but they won’t bother you unless you bother them. “Some say it is where apostates and nonbelievers are tortured after death. Others believe that their heads would be severed once they’re down there.” The team of cavers collected samples from its depts, and shed more light on what lay waiting for them at the bottom.  Prof al-Kindi added: We collected samples of water, rocks, soil and some dead animals but have yet to have them analysed. “We noticed strange things inside. We also smelled something strange … It’s a mysterious situation.” Stunning images from inside the cave show millions of years of sedimentary rock circling its walls. Light pouring in from the entrance also appears to illuminate the caveaposs surface, creating a shimmering, luminescent effect. A report of the teamaposs full findings is due to be made public when finalised.

Tragically, Lena, who suffered from impaired vision, did nothome and her body was found on Wednesday morning. Police say she ventured from Jersey Ave along Richardson Road, before turning up Grande Avenue, where was last sighted on CCTV at around .am.After failing tohome, she was reported missing before an hours-long police search was launched.A member of the public eventually found her body on a narrow track at around .pm. A post mortem examination led to a murder investigation before a -year-old man was arrested. He is expected to appear in court on Friday, reports news.au. Detective Inspector Aaron Pascoe said: Lena was a young lady, she was small in stature. She was vulnerable and whoever the offender or offenders are, have targeted a vulnerable member of our community, which is just appalling.

But her boyfriend, who hasnapost been named, decided to place a tube of the toxic glue alongside it due to the baking heat in the country. He fetched what he thought was her medicine to help with the tricky process before she screamed and he released his horrying mistake. They could not tell the dference between the glue and the drops, which have similar names in Portuguese aposcolaapos and aposcolirioapos.  Regina is now recovering at home after the ordeal. The two plastic containers are similar in size, and as neither of them were wearing their glasses at the time, it was reported.  At the time of the incident, Regina tilted her head back and opened her eyes wide as her boyfriend squeezed what he thought was her eye drops directly into her eye. She said: The moment the drops hit my eye, I felt an intense burning sensation. I thought my eye was going to explode.  She was taken to a local hospital, where doctors used a serum and cotton to try to alleviate her pain. Ophthalmologist Liana Tito told UOL: When chemical products such as superglue, or even alcohol gel, which happens quite frequently, fall in the eye region, the eyelid can be affected by chemical burns. She added that the burns can also affect the cornea and conjunctiva. Regina was discharged the same day, but she said the pain made it impossible for her to sleep. She said: I had tears running down my cheeks all night. The glue stuck to the cilium region can form a crust, which rubs against the cornea causing extensive lesions. If for some reason these lesions evolve, they cause bacterial ulcers and then become lesions with imminent risks of perforation and blindness. She then paid another visit to the ophthalmologist, who reopened her eye and used scissors and tweezers to try to remove the traces of superglue. The doctor explained: The glue stuck to the cilium region can form a crust, which rubs against the cornea causing extensive lesions.

Rizwan Khan was shopping in Sydney, Australia, when he ed  minutes later and was surprised to see a crowd of people taking photos and videos of inside his Jeep. As he neared his car, he realised that a huge swarm of bees had managed to fly inside of his car and had settled onto the doorframe by the driver’s seat.Maybe they liked my Jeep, you know  Mr Khan told News.I ed to the car and I had people around the car with their cameras on and bees inside the car.”  In an unbee-lievable stroke of good luck, a local beekeeper happened to stumble across the scene. This old man came up to me [and said] aposdo you want to give it to me apos Mr Khan continued. And I said, of course, you can take them all.” Footage taken from the incident showed the beekeeper using his bare hands to scoop the bees into a box.  He was a lesaver for me, Mr Khan said, adding that he will be keeping the windows of his car firmly closed from now on.In the UK, one man was forced to call a beekeeper back in May after a swarm of , honey bees descended on his caraposs number plate.Jon Tribbeck, , was alerted by a neighbour who noticed the infestation and was shocked when he saw the black cloud which appeared like something out of a horror film.Elsewhere in Brazil, two dogs died after being attacked by a swarm of killer bees in the town of Guarapari in South East Brazilian state of Espirito Santo.Comment MORE ON InsectsAnimals\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Jitender Gogi, one of Delhi’s most wanted gangsters who was involved in several criminal cases and jailed at Tihar since last year, was one of those fatally shot inside Rohini court. He was transported to hospital, where he was declared dead.According to reports fromNDTV India , the two other men killed in the crossfire involving the gang members and police , were gangsters who had come to the court intending to kill Gogi.Both the attackers, reportedly named Rohit and Morish, had dressed as lawyers before barging into an ongoing hearing in Court Room No.  to shoot Gogi, who was from a rival group going by the name ‘Tillu gang’. As soon as Gogi entered the same room, both the attackers started firing at him. Police then retaliated, shooting and killing them on the spot. According to an eyewitness, a female law intern also sustained bullet injuries as a result of the crossfire. Delhi Police Commissioner Rakesh Asthana told NDTV that two people from a rival gang had opened fire at Jitender Gogi, prompting police to retaliate and shoot the two assailants. “The police acted swtly and killed both the assailants. Total three dead, including Gogi,” said Mr Asthana. The incident marks a huge security lapse on court premises. Questions had incidentally been raised about whether metal detectors at the court were working andthey were, how the armed men could get past. “We are already investigating the case and we shall not spare anyone who is involved in this shootout. No one will be spared,” Mr Asthana said. He added: “Delhi Police is doing its job seriously. We were effective and focused and that is why the shooter was successfully neutralised. We will say more after a detailed investigation is carried out.” Tillu gang and Gogi’s gang had reportedly been at war for years. More than  people had reportedly died in their clashes. Gogi, born Jitender Mann, was arrested in March last year and was considered a big catch for the Delhi police.

as council chiefs ponder future public transport access to the Granite Mile.City planners have been sent back to the drawing board to work out how to improve the city centre, as all acknowledge drastic action is needed to bring people in.Potential pedestrianisation of the Bridge Street to Market Street stretch of Union Street is on the table as part of the £ million refresh of the city centre masterplan.But the suggestion that buses would have to bypass Aberdeen#s seven busiest bus stops in the long term has caused outrage.Now, the administration#s lead spokeswoman on the city centre masterplan, Councillor Marie Boulton, has revealed roads chiefs could well roll back the years and reclaim the Castlegate for public transport use # while being #realistic# about what can be achieved.Pedestrianised in the early s, the historic market area is currently under used # and the local authority wants to make more of it as a link to between the city centre and beach.Mrs Boulton said: #We have discussed a Castlegate bus terminus and suggested we might look at the merit at making it a turning circle again for the buses, or a stopping pointdrivers need to catch up on timetables.#That certainly will feature as a possible solution.#Connectivity is the biggest challenge we have and connections between the city centre and the beach are going to be paramount.#How we go through the Castlegate and connect to the beach is going to be really important, so I am excited to see what innovations the council can come up with.#Reintroduction of buses to the cobbled square surrounding the th Century Mercat Cross could go some way to appeasing the city#s major transport firms.Only last month, bosses at Stagecoach and First Aberdeen united in their calls for an urgent end to the ban on buses in Union Street.A central stretch of the city#s main thoroughfare has been closed since early in the pandemic, as part of a £. million physical distancing project.Planners are looking at permanent pedestrianisation however, blocking a clear run up the Granite Mile for all but walkers, cyclists and, potentially, some bus services.Peter Knight, Stagecoach managing director, and David Phillips, operations director at First Aberdeen, revealed #frustrations# at the prolonged closure.They claimed buses had been stuck in traffic four times as long since the workaround ersion through the bus gate at Market Street was put in place.And while their exile from Union Street remains, Aberdeen Journals has been told the council is exploring ways of accommodating buses again # evenfull scale, long term pedestrianisation is voted through.However, while buses could be allowed to share the space with walkers and cyclists like in Broad Street, the council could encourage #creative timetabling# to keep Union Street open.#There would be nothing worse than pedestrianising between Bridge Street and Market Street and then having it constantly blocked with buses,# Mrs Boulton told us.#Frequency of buses is quite important and that is a conversation we would need to have with the operators.#We have to be realistic about the way our city is laid out as we don’t have the same parallel streets as Edinburgh and Glasgow to be able to do what they have.#Buses play a vital role for many people, particularly those on lower incomes to access the city centre or for those without a car, and the older population who like to come in to the city centre during the day # getting off in Union Street is probably quite important to them.#I know at the moment we can have lots of pretty pictures but we have to make sure we marry that with reality.#I am a bit of a realist and I recognise thatyou make a city hard to access, we just won’t have people coming here.#For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles."},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2021/09/Stuck-in-rent-featured-image2-300x180.jpg class=attachment-part-medium size-part-medium wp-post-image ","title":"coronavirus in scotland here are the key demographics","story":".dct-cta@-webkit-keyframes dctSpinnertransform:rotate%transform:rotate@keyframes dctSpinnertransform:rotate%transform:rotate.dct-cta__title.dct-cta__content p.dct-cta__content p:not.dct-cta__content p:last-child.dct-cta__label.dct-cta__input.dct-cta__input::-webkit-input-placeholder.dct-cta__input::-moz-placeholder.dct-cta__input:-ms-input-placeholder.dct-cta__input::placeholder.dct-cta__label:hover.dct-cta__input,.dct-cta__label:focus.dct-cta__input,.dct-cta__input:hover,.dct-cta__input:focus.dct-cta__input,.dct-cta__btn .stransition:all cubic-bezier .s.dct-cta__btn.dct-cta__btn:disabled.dct-cta__btn:not.dct-cta__btn:not:hover.dct-cta__btn:not:hover,.dct-cta__btn:not:focus.dct-cta__btn-text.dct-cta__btn:before .stransition:all cubic-bezier .s.dct-cta__btn-loadingborder-top:px solid #fffborder-radius:%width:pxheight:pxbox-sizing:border-box-webkit-animation:dctSpinner .s linear infiniteanimation:dctSpinner .s linear infinite.dct-cta--signup.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__title.dct-cta--signup__dialogs.dct-cta--signup__dialog.dct-cta--signup__dialog--success.dct-cta--signup__dialog--error.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__grid.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__label.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__btn.dct-cta--subscribe.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__btn.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__title.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__content@media only screen and @media only screen and .dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap@media only screen and .dct-cta--subscribe.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap+.dct-cta__content@supports or.dct-cta__flex:after.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__label.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__btn.dct-cta--signup__dialog.dct-cta--signup__dialog--js-active.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta__image-wrap.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap,.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__content@media only screen and .dct-cta--subscribe--contained .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta--subscribe--contained .dct-cta__image-wrap@media only screen and @supports or.dct-cta__grid:after.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__label,.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__btn.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__gridgrid-template-columns:fr minmaxgrid-gap:.rem .remWe’ve put together some regularly updating charts and maps showing the demographic information available on the people affected by the coronavirus pandemic in Scotland.The charts below show the distribution of deaths by age and gender.Given the way the virus transmits, we also looked at whether there was any link between the fatality rate and the population density.The NRS provides information on the number of deaths by smaller areas, known as intermediate zones, once per month.The chart below shows the proportion of deaths by location.This chart shows Covid- as a proportion of deaths each week in Scotland.The animated chart below shows where Covid- sits in the ranks of leading causes of death in Scotland.Covid vaccine in Scotland: Track the rollout progress with these charts\" title\"#Covid vaccine in Scotland: Track the rollout progress with these charts# #

Many of these are linked to previous and devastating trauma and are only made worse by the circumstances they are forced to live in.Part of our work at Crisis is to ensure our clients have the psychological support they need to establish a le away from homelessness. Keeping this going through the pandemic has been a real challenge and Crisis staff have been finding all sorts of creative solutions.In the early days of the pandemic our coaches worked rapidly to provide phones, tablets, laptops and data to our clients who needed it and adapted our services, including our psychological support, so we could provide a continued leline over the phone and online.With lockdown and restrictions now eased, it is a relief for our clients to feel less of the added mental pressure that we#ve had from the circumstances of the last year and for face-to-face support to be more of an option again.Whether in person or online, all our work is only made possible by the fantastic people and organisations who support us, meaning we can continue to help people across the country to leave homelessness behind for good.On behalf of Crisis and the thousands of people we support each year, we would particularly like to thank the players of People’s Postcode Lottery, across Scotland and where, who have helped fund the vital work of our clinical psychologists in such dficult times.Peter Oakes, lead clinical psychologist at CrisisSir,Recent disruptions with our ferry service from Islay to the mainland have once again shown us just how much we depend on a fit-for-purpose service with reliable, newer vessels in operation.Unfortunately this is currently not the case as our ferry fleet has been underfunded for many years,not decades, as a result of decisions made by urban-centric central government.Our frontline CalMac ferry crews and port staff are hard-working and an asset to our island and mainland communities, however they can only work with the tools they have at hand.The -year-old MV Hebridean Isles is one of the oldest in the state-owned fleet and while it was no doubt good in its day that day has passed a long time ago. Problems with our Islay ferry service have also been exacerbated with the continued poaching of one of our ferries in the summer months for other areas that CalMac operates in.On numerous occasions, distillers on Islay said they were facing major problems in transporting whisky to the Scottish mainland because of a capacity crisis on the ferry links.The feeling amongst many of my constituents is that it is we on Islay, Jura and Colonsay who always end up getting a raw deal.This simply cannot be allowed to continue.Councillor Alastair Redman, Kintyre and the Islands ward Sir,Thanks to funding from the Scottish Power Foundation, an Argyll and Bute scheme is offering young people a new route to gaining employment and skills in heritage.Heritage Horizons, run by the Culture, Heritage and Arts Assembly, Argyll and Isles , and Argyll and Bute Heritage and Museums Forum, aims to address the issue of an ageing workforce in the heritage and museums sectors by offering skill-building opportunities for young people.The project will work with Argyll heritage venues in areas of high unemployment, developing  accredited placements for young people.

Academics agree that a sustainable level of material use, which would still allow for a high quality of le, is about eight tonnes per person per year.Zero Waste Scotland is advocating for mindful shopping, encouraging Scots to buy smarter and adopt reuse, repair and renting behaviours as well as embracing second-hand shopping.When finished with an item, it is calling on people to dispose of items responsibly by donating, reselling or recycling.With global climate change discussions at an all-time high and COP coming to Glasgow this November, the topic of responsible consumption in relation to the climate crisis has never been more timely.Everything we buy has a carbon cost and we are urging Scots to think dferently about what we buy and how we consume.Changing our own consumption habits is the single biggest thing we can all do to play our part in tackling climate change.Now is the time for action and we want people to bin less and buy better, seeking out items which will last longer.Responsible consumption isn’t on the COP agenda so we wanted to ensure it is top of the consumer agenda.To learn more about the campaign, please visit www.howtowasteless for further details.Iain Gulland, chief executive, Zero Waste Scotland"},{"url":null,"title":"science matters does genetic tolerance aid wild swimmers","story":"Dorothy H CrawfordUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwards.Subscribe NowWild swimming has become increasingly popular during lockdown, but in general people are ided into those who love swimming in cold water and those who think that it’s complete madness.Now scientists have found a possible explanation for this ision related to a muscle protein called alpha-actinin- .We have two types of muscle fibres # type  and type .Type  fibres provide fatigue resistance important for prolonged, submaximal activity like marathon running, while type  fibres produce a rapid and powerful force for short-burst, vigorous activities such as sprinting.The two types of fibres respond dferently to cold exposure # type  fibres produce an involuntary, low-intensity, continuous increase in muscle tone, while type  fibres give bursts of high-intensity activity causing overt shivering.ACTN is only active in type  muscle fibres, and deficiency of this protein is caused by a non-ing ACTN gene.This occurs in - per cent of the world’s population, around . billion people, and is most common in Europe and Asia.These people lack type  muscle fibre activity and although this is compensated by having larger type  fibres, it adversely affects muscle , impacting on athletic performance, particularly in sprint and power activities.Now scientists have investigated the role of ACTN in cold tolerance .Male participants,  with ing and  with non-ing ACTN, were immersed in water at °C for -minute periods interspersed with -minute rest periods at room temperature .The ordeal ended either after a maximum of six immersions or when participants’ body temperature dropped to .°C.The scientists found improved cold tolerance in those with non-ing ACTN, some  per cent of whom maintained body temperature above .°C compared to  per cent of those with al ACTN.So those lacking al type  fibres had better cold tolerance, suggesting that cold-induced increased muscle tone is more efficient at generating heat than overt shivering.Improved cold tolerance probably gave our ancestors an evolutionary survival advantage after their migration from Africa to colder climes in Eurasia, so explaining the high frequency of non-ing ACTN in today’s northern populations.It would be interesting to investigate how many Scottish wild swimmers carry this genetic iant.

Healthy trees are being protected during the works and will remain.The same stone recently used to resurface Colchester Square # Achnaba stone quarried locally by MacLeod Construction Ltd # will be installed on the new public square area, with electrical installation for the square also anticipated in the autumn.The historic drinking fountain close to the public toilet block has been dismantled, to be reinstated later in the project.The front green scheme is expected to be complete by early .Lochgilphead is also seeing investment in shop front improvements, supported by the council, and the town centre Conservation Area Regeneration Scheme is just getting underway.Structural and service works are almost complete as part of a redevelopment of Mid Argyll Community Pool by owner Mid Argyll Community Enterprises Ltd , allowing fit-out and finishing over the next couple of months.MacLeod Construction Ltd began work in March on the MACPool Activity Hub which, when completed, will offer soft play, an all-access café and multi-use rooms for hire in addition to improved changing facilities for the pool.The project, due for completion in October, is going to plan despite materials supply challenges faced by the building industry.Unforeseen complications in the build have also caused minor delays, but MacLeod Construction is finding ways around these hurdles and the MACEL Board is hopeful that swimmers can be welcomed back by the second half of December.All aspects of the new Activity Hub should be up and running early next year, and MACPool manager Fiona MacAlpine is going to be recruiting some new team members in the coming weeks.MACEL chair Kim Ritchie said: #Thanks to the many organisations and iniduals who have supported the project financially, all funds for the main build and basic fit-out of the Hub are in place.#But there is still a need for funds to complete the fit-out and landscape and furnish the external area.#Soyou haven’t yet contributed and would like to # it’s not too late.There are two community sponsorship schemes, one for local businesses and one for iniduals – the Sponsor Our Seascape program.

He recalled: ‘We were out on a day sailing on the Dasher when she blew up and sank. They lost more than  men that day. And I lost my tools.’It was after the second world war that Peter realised his ambition of running his own electrical company.He had started his electrical apprenticeship in  at the age of  with the Campbeltown and Mid Argyll Electrical Supply Company, and by  he was ready to set up shop in Argyll Street, moving to Colchester Square in the s by which time he and his business partner Davie Wilson employed  members of staff,  working from Campbeltown to Strontian and on Islay, Mull, Coll and Tiree.Peter recalled the start of his career: ‘I used to leave at am, get my rolls in the morning before travelling up to get the ferry to Craignure on Mull,  then I’d take a bus to get the ferry over to Iona and then make the trip back home again. It was very hard work but it’s just what you did back then.’It was also at the end of the war that Peter married a woman he had met while working at the Clyde shipyards. His we Anne was from a family of  children brought up in Kilmacolm.Speaking at Peter#s birthday celebration, his daughter Margaret Loughran said: #My dad, his parents and his sisters Maria and Netta were given a really warm welcome when they moved to Lochgilphead in the s.#There were hardly any other families from outside Scotland living here at that time so they were always really grateful to have been accepted into the community.#I think that#s why Dad worked so hard over the years to support the church and the community more generally.#"},{"url":null,"title":"new argyll shop local gift card set for launch","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwards.Subscribe NowA new gt card is coming soon to help Argyll businesses emerge from the pandemic with the help of local residents.The Argyll and Bute love local gt card will allow holders to enjoy a fantastic range of products, services and experiences on offer across the area, including hotel stays, gts, clothing, dining, household goods, groceries and services such as garages and accountants.Businesses are being encouraged to register for the Scottish Government-backed scheme to stimulate increased local spending and help protect jobs across Argyll and Bute.A map and listings of all registered businesses will appear on a dedicated Argyll and Bute webpage on the Scotland Gts Local website when the card launches next month.The gt cards will be sold online via the Scotland Gts Local , which allows people from all over the world to order a card.An ever-growing number of Argyll and Bute businesses are signing up, including cafes, bookshops, opticians, tourist attractions, gt shops and supermarkets.The scheme is being delivered by Scotland’s Towns Partnership , which is behind the Scotland Loves Local Campaign with funding from the Scottish Government and endorsed by Argyll and Bute Council.Visit www.lovelocal.scot gtcard to find out more about the Scotland Loves Local gt card, including details on how to sign up.Councillor Robin Currie, policy lead for the economy and rural growth, said: #The gt card scheme presents an excellent opportunity to support our local businesses as they continue to recover from the impact of COVID.#It has the potential to generate signicant spending across Argyll and Bute’s economy, helping secure jobs and build a more sustainable future for the region’s communities.#We would encourage all businesses across Argyll and Bute to sign up # this is the perfect way for people to show their support for their local traders particularly in the run-up to the Christmas shopping period.#Scotland’s minister for community wealth, Tom Arthur MSP, said the Scottish Government was #delighted to be backing this innovative scheme#, adding: #The gt card is a quick and efficient way to encourage spend and drive sales growth in our local economies.#The Argyll and Bute gt card is one of , unique to each region of Scotland, and can only be spent in businesses located in the region.[Would you box the following please and set in body of copy ]"},{"url":null,"title":"thought for the week september 24 2021","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwards.Subscribe NowI had the wonderful privilege the other week of holding a new grandson for the first time.Isn#t it amazing how a new-born infant can grab hold of your heart  I was filled with so much love and pride and I prayed that his le would be blessed.It so happened that the Gospel reading set for the Sunday after I met my grandson was, in part at least, about a little child.​Mark tells us Jesus was walking ahead of his disciples on the way to Capernaum. When they got there Jesus asked them: #What were you arguing about along the way #They couldn#t answer, for they had been arguing about which of them was the greatest. They were silent, because they#d been caught out.Then Jesus took a little child in his arms and said to them: #Whoever welcomes one such child in my name welcomes me, and whoever welcomes me, welcomes not me but the one who sent me.#Greatness, Jesus was saying to them, is found in welcoming and receiving into our arms someone vulnerable, powerless and dependent, regardless of age.Greatness is found not in what we have accomplished but in what we have done and given to #the least of these#, the hungry, thirsty, naked, sick, and imprisoned: the symbolic children in each of our lives.Greatness never makes itself superior over another.

Our greatness is revealed in our service and care of others.Max is doing well, by the way, and I can hardly wait to see him again.God bless you and yours, from biggest to littlest, today and always."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column september 24 2021","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwards.We would like to add our best wishes to Mr Peter Ciarella on reaching his th birthday.He is undoubtedly one of the best-known and loved people in the district, and his contribution to Lochgilphead over the decades is immeasurable.It#s amazing how the foresight and hard work of dferent groups of people, working independently for their own particular areas of interest, have resulted in a number of improvement schemes coming to fruition at the same time.Mid Argyll is looking forward to the completion of projects to upgrade the Lochgilphead swimming pool, front green and Kilmartin Museum.

We were delighted to welcome them to Argyll for their first performance as a quartet and for three of the four performers this was the first time they had performed in more than a year.The quartet # Andrew, Dean, Jack and Richard # introduced each piece, giving background to both the role of the saxophone and the composer, with many of the pieces arranged by the group themselves.Purcell’s #Festival Rondeau# was the dramatic opening, a work well-known across all age groups, so a perfect start to the concert.Following this was a work composed specically for a saxophone quartet in  by Jean-Baptiste Singelée, a friend of Adolph Sax who invented the saxophone. We were treated to the traditional Andante before moving onto the exciting Allegro.The third selection of pieces were all by Debussy. This was a surprising choice as the saxophone is not really associated with the Impressionist period, however, it showed the versatility of both the saxophones and performers. #Arabesque No.# was followed by #The Little Shepherd# which was delightful, calm and serene with only the sound of the river flowing through the trees and birds singing along. The jaunty #Cakewalk# completed this ied section.#Air on a G String# by Bach and known to many as a TV advert was the next offering. The opening descending bass line showed the depth and quality of the baritone saxophone in much more than just a supporting role. This music predates the invention of the saxophone by more than  years.Gershwin and a selection of show tunes from the swing era were just what we needed after the relaxing #Air#. The four musical songs, all showcasing dferent styles, certainly had the audience smiling, toe-tapping and singing along. In the final piece #I Got Rhythm# we were all moving to the music, including the quartet. Closing your eyes, you could imagine you were relaxing in a jazz club anywhere in the world.The next piece, #L’Arlesienne Exhibition#, is a collection of highlights for the saxophone in an orchestral situation. The music was composed by Hiroki Takahashi, with many familiar themes from film and TV # including The Apprentice # all thoroughly enjoyable.Gershwin’s #An American in Paris# portrays the many sights and sounds that Gershwin experienced there in the s. While it was composed for an orchestra which included saxophones and car horns, the music played by the quartet didn’t include any car horns # just skilled and imaginative saxophonists.A change of pace to enjoy some relaxed, laid-back music from West Africa followed with Will Gregory’s #High Le#. The repeated rhythms with the peace of Kilmory, the cooling air and the gentle river flowing was almost hypnotic and brought the concert to a finish.The audience cheered, clapped and blew their cars horns to ensure the quartet provided an encore. #Witch Hunt# by Ulrich Schultheiss was the encore # a dramatic and fiery work challenging all the performers and bringing a fantastic concert to a close.The quartet members themselves didn#t feel the cars were a barrier and said they #had a blast at a unique and special event#.MAAA thank the th Argyll Scoutsfor helping with the car parking. Traffic cones and hi-vis waistcoats were loaned by MacLeods and the wagon we used as a stage was from Ferguson#s Butchers. Picnic boxes were pre-ordered from Lucy’s Ardfern.

The GHK Goal Keeper was kept on her toes and made some valiant saves from the aggressive Reivers frontline of Katie Macdonald, Maartje de Zoeten, Mackenzie Crick and Felicity Walls.On the stroke of time another breakaway from GHK saw them complete the game with a - victory and all three points going to the Glasgow Team.Game two against Grove Menzieshill was a completely dferent story.

Unlike his brother Heinrich, who was expected to become a literary star, Thomas seemed destined for the boardroom. He cultivated that expectation, while secretly revelling in books and music. It was the first of the many tensions between his inner and outer selves that Toibin attempts to portray.Telling the story of a Nobel Prize-winning writer in a novel that spans his le is a mammoth and fraught task. It expects fiction to do the work of biography, yet with imaginative licence. The focus zooms in and out, crisp and prosaic in this passage, lingeringly descriptive in another. The reader must absorb the outline of Mannrsquos CV, while trusting the author to convey its subjectrsquos mind.Readers unfamiliar with Mann, who have perhaps only seen the film of Death in Venice, are in a better position than experts. No need to question facts, or interpretations, or wonder what sources Toibin used to come to his conclusions. For instance, Toibin tells us that Mannrsquos journals were destroyed before the Nazis could read them and learn of his proclivities. As Mann frets over their discovery ndashthey described his arousal at the sight of his naked son and his attraction to a teenage boy ndash it is unclearthis is a novelistic flourish, or rooted in truth. In a work whose essence is to capture the soul of a giant of th-century letters, such uncertainty is unsettling and troubling.Toibinrsquos acclaimed novel about Henry James, The Master, focused on a five-year period. The Magician, by comparison, covers almost three-quarters of a century, from Mannrsquos conventional upbringing in strait-laced Lubeck, to his final years in the USA, where he had fled to escape Hitler and his cronies.The opening chapters require concentration, and there is a stilted quality to the writing and a staginess to the dialogue that makes it hard ever to forget you are reading about a real person. It is a wholly perplexing novel, raising questions that are not answered. Yet the bones of the story are fascinating, no matter how told. The young Thomas Mann had no doubt that he was to become a writer. Nor that he was sexually drawn to men. In a far-sighted act of self-preservation, he marries the vivacious, high-born Katia Pringsheim. It proves to be an affectionate and contented union, with Katia tacitly understanding her husbandrsquos longings. The couple produce six children, enough to deflect suspicions about the novelistrsquos orientation, even after the homoerotic yearning he evokes in Death in Venice.Nicknamed the Magician by his children, with whom he is by turns playful and aloof, Toibinrsquos Mann is unknowable and opaque, passing like a sleepwalker through much of this book. A devoted patriot, he is devastated by Germanyrsquos defeat in the First World War. Resentment and bitterness cloud his judgement for too long. While his older children, especially the twins Erika and Klaus, are alive to the threat Hitler poses, he is slow to respond. It takes Nazi hecklers at one of his lectures to show how far his country has changed: ldquoHis own exalted literary reputation did not place him in an unassailable position, he realises. It is also clear that the Germany of which he remained proud ldquohad lost its place at the centre. Even so, he resists speaking out, for fear of the consequences for his wersquos Jewish parents, and his publisher. The prospect of his books being banned, of losing his readers, is unbearable.In the end, he steels himself. In denouncing the barbarism of Nazism, he decides to adopt a grandiose, theatrical tone: ldquohe would shower clause and subclause upon them. It is a rare moment of humour.After  pages, around the middle of the book, The Magician finally sparks into le, feeling less like a resume of the familyrsquos fortunes, and lingering on scenes that offer an insight, albeit fleeting, into the always contradictory Mann.Much follows, as the Manns flee to the USA and, on the eve of war, help family to extricate themselves ndash or not ndash from Europe. Erika joins them in America, where she writes a cabaret mocking the National Socialist Party: ldquoIf everyone did what I am doing, then Hitler would soon be painting our hallways at less than the going rate. Bisexual, like her father ndash her brother is gay ndash she makes a marriage of convenience with WH Auden. She is an often insufferable presence but, unlike the fictionalised Mann, could never be accused of being dull.Only rarely does Toibinrsquos version feel persuasive. It is as , in the attempt to plumb Mannrsquos anxious, tormented psyche, he forgets to add the ingredients that allowed the author of works such as Buddenbrooks, The Magic Mountain and Doctor Faustus to claim a world stage.Where the novel sings, however, is in conveying the power of music. Here, Toibin steps out of his biographical straitjacket and touches on something convincingly inspirational. When, for instance, Mann listens to a quartet in which his son Michael is playing, he is fired with admiration: ldquoThomas wished he had been able to do this as a writer, find a tone or a context that was beyond himself, that was rooted in what shone and glittered and could be seen, but that hovered above the world of fact, entering into a place where spirit and substance could merge and drt apart and merge again.By the novelrsquos end, one ought to feel drained. It has encompassed high drama and heartbreak ndash the suicides of two of Mannrsquos sisters and one of his children, and countless deaths ndash enacted to a backdrop of genocidal annihilation, in which he and his family are nearly consumed. Yet despite passages where it briefly ignites, its tone is cool and dutul, too closely bound to a litany of events to be fully absorbing. As a result, The Magician is more like a work of accounting than creative illusion."},{"url":null,"title":"makar-kathleen-jamie-invites-scots-help-create-collaborative-nature-poem-scottish-book-news","story":"The combined work is pegged to the forthcoming COP summit in Glasgow, when she says, ldquothe worldrsquos attention will be on Scotland and the global response to Climate Change.Jamie adds: ldquoThe collective poem will be composed of single lines submitted by anyone who lives in Scotland and who loves our planet.

Being asked to play so many positions would perplex some players, but Blair is confident that the -year-old could excel in several other departments too, such is his versatility.ldquoBlair is multi-talented, the coach said yesterday after naming his team for the game at the newly-renamed DAM Health Stadium. ldquoIf you look at the basics - catch-pass, running game, kicking game, defence - hersquos got all those things, and he is fortunate that they go along with his physical attributes of being tall and quick.ldquoWersquove talked about Blair in lots of dferent positions.

But hersquos someone who has got a really impressive skill set and we just want to get those best players out on the pitch. He suits what wersquore trying to do at the moment.There were certainly some encouraging glimpses of what Edinburgh are trying to do last week against Benetton, from new signings Ben Vellacott and Henry Immelman as well as established members of the squad such as Damien Hoyland.Those three and the rest of the back ision keep their places this afternoon, with the only two changes to the starting  being in the pack, where Lee-Roy Atalo comes in at tighthead in place of Luan de Bruin and Bill Mata s from injury at No . The Fijian takes over at No  from Nick Haining, who was himself injured last week.Jaco Van der Walt, the only senior specialist stand-off available to Blair, is on the bench, having missed out last week because of injury. Among those alongside him is lock Jamie Hodgson, who is also ing from a concussion sustained in the earlier defeat by Newcastle Falcons.Todayrsquos game will provide a far more accurate gauge of where Edinburgh are than either of their two pre-season friendlies, but Blair is convinced that the players have already bought into his plans. ldquoIrsquom confident in what wersquore trying to do, and Irsquom confident the players know what wersquore trying to do, he added. ldquoAnd I think Irsquove definitely seen enough in the last couple of weeks to allow us to be in a good position to perform in the game.Edinburgh : H Immelman D Graham, M Bennett, C Hutchison, D Hoyland B Kinghorn, B Vellacott P Schoeman, S McInally, L Atalo, M Sykes, G Gilchrist , J Ritchie, L Crosbie, V Mata.

It also provides guidance for mums and dads on testing, self-isolation, and vaccination.Read the letter in full, below. Dear parents and carers,With schools having been back for nearly four weeks, I want to commend the care, commitment and courage shown by everyone in playing their part in keeping our communities safe. The number of cases of COVID- across Orkney have been rising of late and have affected a small proportion of adults and young people who attend at some of our schools.On Monday this week, there were  positive cases linked to Stromness Academy and we now also see six positive cases at Kirkwall Grammar School.We have worked closely with Public Health colleagues in Orkney and, together, we have managed local clusters very effectively. This was only successful thanks to the diligence of parents, pupils and staff in following the mitigations in place and for managing these situations positively but cautiously.Whilst so much has changed over the past  months, the fundamentals within our schools have remained the same. Children and young people still come to school to learn, play and socialise with their friends.The easing of restrictions has left some relieved and others anxious. I want to reassure you all that staff are doing everything they can to make your child’s experience a positive one, in particular by implementing Scottish Government guidance to keep us all as safe as possible.I do understand that there will be a level of nervousness among some of you with regard to the recent transmission rates, on this basis, the Education team felt it may be helpful to share the following information with you: Mitigating measures include:• Distancing between adults and between pupils when required.A detailed list of the mitigations is published below.There has also been some confusion around testing and the dference between PCR and LFD tests. Only request a PCR test :• You are contacted by Test  ProtectLateral Flow Device Tests:• Please ensure that you log the results of your Lateral Flow Devicetest onlineyou test positive or negative, this helps give an indication of whether or not the virus is spreading. Parents who are concerned their children might have contracted Covid can complete a self-help guide on NHS Inform that will help them determinethis is the case.If you develop symptoms or you have a positive LFD test, then you must request a PCR test through the COVID Assessment Centre . To request a vaccination call:   . The COVID Assessment Centre opens at .am and closes at pm . After a positive LFD you must isolate until your PCR test confirms you are negative. If your PCR is positive there will be isolation protocols that you will have to follow the NHS Orkney team will help folk every step of the way.Unless exempt, current mitigations are:•Hygiene, Ventilation and Face Coverings • All hand and respiratory hygiene mitigations will continue to be encouraged, and an enhanced cleaning regime will continue to apply in buildings and vehicles.• Windows should continue to be opened regularly to maximise ventilation.• Face coverings will continue to be a requirement at all times for all staff and learners in secondary schools.• In primary school, all other establishments, adults will be expected to wear a face covering whenever they cannot maintain physical distance from other adults, children or young people.• In nurseries, adults will be expected to wear a face covering whenever they cannot maintain physical distance from other adults, including parents.• In primary schools, adults will also need to wear a face covering whenever they are moving around communal areas of the school, including corridors.• Only pupils aged  and over will be required to wear a face covering when travelling on dedicated school transport. Groupings and Distancing• The grouping of pupils and adults into discrete bubbles will no longer be required, but assemblies and other large gatherings will continue to be kept on hold for the time being.• There will be no requirement for children and young people to maintain physical distancing between each other, although this will continue to be encouraged in secondary schools.• The distance that adults are required to maintain from other adults, children and young people has formally been reduced to one metre, however schools will continue to encourage pupils and staff to maintain two metre distancing wherever possible. Nursery children are not required to keep a distance from adults or children in the setting.• Pupils using dedicated school transport will not be expected to maintain distancing between each other, but there will remain an expectation that drivers remain at least one metre distance from all passengers.• Parents and carers will continue to be discouraged from attending school premises except in cases where this is agreed with the school as being absolutely necessary. Vaccination, Testing and Self-Isolation• Adults and secondary pupils will be encouraged to take twice-weekly LFD tests and to record their results online.• Any adult, child or young person who develops the symptoms of COVID-, or who test positive must self-isolate immediately in line with NHS Guidance, and noty their school.• Anyone who is fully vaccinated identied by Test and Protect as a close contact of a positive case should self-isolate immediately and book a PCR Test. If the test result is negative and they remain without symptoms then they mayto school, whilst remaining vigilant.• Any young person aged between  years and  years four months, who is not yet fully vaccinated and who is identied by Test and Protect as a close contact of a positive case should self-isolate immediately and book a PCR Test. If the test result is negative and they remain without symptoms then they mayto school, whilst remaining vigilant.• Any adult aged over  years four months, who is not fully vaccinated and who is identied by Test and Protect as a close contact of a positive case should self-isolate immediately and seek a PCR test.  They should continue to self-isolate for ten days from onset of symptoms eventhe test result is negative. • Children and young people aged from five to  will no longer be subject to a blanket requirement to self-isolate for ten daysthey are identied as a close contact by Test and Protect. Instead, they should self-isolate immediately and book a PCR Test. If the test result is negative and they remain without symptoms then they mayto school, whilst remaining vigilant. Children aged under  will be exempt from this testing.• Schools and Early Learning Childcare settings will not be required to stand down classes in the event of a positive case being identied.  They will, instead, send parents and staff a #warn and inform# letter advising them of the facts and reminding them that there is no need to self-isolate unless contacted by Test and Protect and advised otherwise.• The Chief Medical Officer advises that children and young people on the highest risk list can now follow that same advice as the rest of the population.

While any benefit from the project will be intended for all members of the community, it will be a particular bonus to Orkney Agricultural Society , which hosts County Show in the park each August.According to the council, OAS had originally offered to contribute up to £, towards construction of the new road, which will aid in bringing livestock transport into the park in the run up to the annual show.Meanwhile, the recommendation put forward to islands councillors at a special general meeting, this Wednesday morning, was that OIC should cover  per cent of project costs. The proposal was that this would be up to a maximum sum of £,, to be met from the council’s Common Good Fund.However, after an intervention by Kirkwall West and Orphir councillor, Leslie Manson, councillors instead agreed to cover the whole cost of the new road — £, from the Common Good Fund, andnecessary, an additional £, from the Capital Projects Fund. It was also confirmed, at today#s meeting, that the project will not be required to go through a formal planning process, due to its status as a #permitted development#.This drew some concern from Kirkwall East councillor, Steven Heddle, who successfully called for an additional recommendation that any future projects concerning use or development of Bignold Park be put to the public for consultation.More on this story in next week#s The Orcadian.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

If people aged  and over haven’t opted out of donation, they will be considered a possible donorthey die in circumstances in which they could donate.Under the opt out system everyone has a choice — to be a donor, or opt out of donation — but it’s important to make that decision known.In Scotland, there are an average of around  people currently waiting on an organ transplant, however only around one per cent of people die in a way that makes organ donation possible.Scotland#s public health minister, Maree Todd, said: “Over half of adults have now recorded their donation decision — the highest percentage in the UK.“Donation remains a personal decision and everyone has a choice.  We are committed to continuing to raise awareness of the choices people have under the opt out system and the importance of making their donation decision known.“I would encourage people to make a decision about donation, record their decision on the NHS Organ Donor Register and tell their family and friends, so they know what you would want to happen.“We have made tremendous progress in increasing donation and transplantation in Scotland over the last decade, with the move to opt out part of a package of measures to reduce the number of people in Scotland waiting for a transplant at any one time.”Folk can register here: https:www.organdonationscotland.org .copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

On st April , Lachie was appointed as the first member of staff and director and went on to become the chief executive officer.: #At that time, the association had built four houses for affordable rent in Glendale. It now has a housing portfolio of  affordable rent and  shared equity properties.#In addition to the affordable housing stock, Lachie has expanded the association’s range of services beyond our tenants to the wider community by taking over the responsibility of the care and repair service from Shelter and establishing the handyperson service — the first in Scotland # to assist our elderly folk in Lochalsh and Skye remain at home for as long as is reasonably possible.#He also established our innovative energy advice service for the wider community to reduce household fuel costs.#He added: ”Through Lachie’s leadership, the association has grown from one to  members of staff who all have the highest regard and respect for this man.“I have never heard a bad word said about Lachie, either from the staff, the board or within the community in which he serves.#While unaware of Mr McIvor#s praise, Lachie was quick to commend his colleagues for their important contributions to those achievements.#We have a fantastic staff team # we really are blessed. None of this is down to me, it is down to working as a team.“In that I include the board which over the years has been absolutely fantastic in supporting ideas.#If the board didn#t think that taking on a handy person project or setting up care and repair, or energy advice service was good, these things wouldn#t have happened — they have been very open about the role that the association could play as a community anchor.”He added: #Some of the things that we do I think are fantastic and have been copied where in Scotland # because the notion that we would have handyperson employees installing telecom devices in people#s homes throughout the whole of the Highlands just wouldn#t have been thought of.#I have been really lucky with the quality and flexibility of the people I have worked with # both the board and the staff members.#Commenting on his successor, he went on to say: #Neil Clapperton was until recently the chief executive of Grampian Housing Association through in Aberdeen # so it is a relief to be able to hand over to an experienced person rather than someone from another discipline to be trained up by the existing staff and board.#I think with the senior management now led by Neil and with keeping the same people such as Iain McIvor as director of investment, and our new director of finance services, Graeme Coull, and of course Angus MacLennan as our technical manager — that#s a really powerful team to take the organisation forward.#I#ll miss the people, they are absolutely splendid.#Reflecting on his time, Lachie said: #The housing system in the Highlands and Islands has never been in a better position.“My ambition was to wipe out homelessness in Skye and Lochalsh before I retired, and while I have not quite achieved that we have made huge strides towards dealing with that dficult issue.#I am quite optimistic that I am leaving the sector in a good position and ready to meet the challenges that they have ahead.#Looking ahead to retired le, Lachie said:#My three children and my grandchildren are all resident in and around Glasgow, they are all busy people but I want to spend signicantly more time with them, and also my family from Uist # I have sisters and lots of relatives over there so I#ll have a lot more time to visit them.“And I want to carry on my work as a board member with Am Fasgadh .#The only bit of advice I#ve had about retirement that someone said to me was #When you retire do nothing, and then do something’. I will take a rest and recharge my batteries but then I will have a look at what the future holds.”Mr McIvor added: #On a personal note, I am proud to have known Lachie for over  years as my director and then chief executive officer.#He is also a true friend, as are his family, and through his guidance, support and good humour, I am a better person for knowing Lachie MacDonald.#I have no doubt in my mind that this could be said by anyone who has met this remarkable and modest man.”"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Flora-Mac-Innes-with-husband-Norman-and-other-family-members.jpg","title":"hebridean history families reunited by the sound of a","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineIn one astonishing example, that happened just after the launch of Tobar an Dualchais, a man whose father had died in the Second World War before he was born was able to hear his father’s voice for the first time.For most of us, we can only imagine what that must have been like: strangely recognisable phrases and subtle mannerisms or turns of phrase, along with deeper thoughts of how things might have been dferent…Whatever the case, we can be sure that for those who are able to reconnect or gain greater insight through the recordings of friends and family members long after they have passed is truly extraordinary and deeply personal.My mother, IsabelMacKenzie, had one of these experiences when she attended an event hosted by TAD in Lochboisdale in ..She of course immediately recognised her voice, although it had been some  years since her mother’s death.I never got to meet my grandmother. She died on Good Friday in  in the Sacred Heart Hospital in Daliburgh, South Uist. I was born six months later in the same hospital.I’ve always felt a special connection to her because I was named after her, although this almost didn’t happen.My motherthought she would name me ‘Fiona’. However, when our doctor, the highly regarded Dr Alasdair MacLean , asked what I was to be called and was told, he replied abruptly and conclusively declared that I was instead to be named after my grandmother. And that was that!It is a joy for me to be able to listen to my grandmother’s recordings. Her singing voice is quite similar to my mother’s, and through listening, I get a sense of the person she was..!Flòraidh was certainly hardy, like many women in those days.She gave birth to  children and my mother was the youngest of the ten that survived. She described her eleventh child as “gille mòr snog” . He was stillborn, and very little mention was made of him after his birth. until he was carried out by my grandfather who, with the other children in the family, took him to the cemetery in Baile, Eriskay.Already grateful for the opportunity to hear these recordings of my grandmother, I was truly amazed when I found recordings of her mother – my great grandmother, Mary Johnston.Although attempts had been made by family members over the years to locate these recordings of her, no one had succeeded until I happened upon them quite by accident.She was recorded in , shortly before she died, by Father Angus John MacQueen who was collaborating with John Lorne Campbell at the time and helping to build what now constitutes the ‘Canna Collection’.Mary Johnstonor ‘a Nì’ as she was known to her family, was born in Barra in  and was the daughter of Michael MacNeil of Castlebay and Anne Steele of Boisdale, South Uist.At the age of around four her mother passed away and she was taken to Uist to live with her auntie, whilst her father worked at sea..She tells how after her grandfather’s death her father was given an ultimatum:home to the family croft on Bernerayor it would be handed over to someone .Michael ed, promptly re-married, and Nì was sent back to live with him and her new stepmother..What isn’t mentioned in the recordings is that she was sent to the recently founded Orphanage for Roman Catholic Children in Bute where she trained as a cook.On herto Barra she met Ronald Johnston from Eriskay who was working in a shop in Castlebay and soon after they eloped to Glasgow. The fact that they were of a similar age to one another was considered undesirable at the time more conventionally, women tended to marry men a fair bit older than them.They had eight children together four girls and four boys – two of whom were killed in the Great War.The German aristocrat and photographer Werner Kissling took two marvellous photos of Nì during his famous filming trip to Eriskay in . The photos somehow manage to at once capture conflicting expressions of happiness, sadness, restlessness and contentment. A neat and handsome lady, she nevertheless seems considerably older than the  years she had already lived when Kissling visited.She is remembered as a kind woman who spoke often of le in Barra and the Barra Head islands, though she never set foot on any of them again after her marriage.It means a lot to me that I can listen to recordings of these two women on Tobar an Dualchais. Hearing their voices and listening to them sing songs and give descriptions of the places they lived gives me a stronger sense of who I am.are women, women’s voices are so proportionately under-represented. No one is to blame for this it is just a reflection of the time in history when so much of this material was collected.Looking at the present and to the future, I can see that there is a precious opportunity to speak with my own mother about her le, about themes more related to women, and to motherhood in particular.She herself gave birth to seven children in the s whilst working part-time as a physiotherapist. She was straddling a very traditional world while also trying meet the growing, and often conflicting, expectations of a modern professional woman.She, like so many other women of her generation, has an important story to tell and important insights to give."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/IMG-20210918-WA0002-1.jpg","title":"glory game kinlochshiel lift shintys camanachd cup for the first","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineKeith MacRae struck a hat-trick to seal a deserved victory in front of a bumper crowd # the bulk of whom had made the journey from the west.It might have been Shiel#s first Camanachd final in  years, but their players rose to the challenge in all areas of the pitch to edge out a Lovat team who were making their fourth appearance in the sport#s showcase in six years.After a cagey opening the west-coasters seized the initiative in the th minute # MacRae lashing home on the backhand from  yards after his brother John had pounced on a shanked hit-in from Lovat#s Drew Howie.Shiel grew in confidence after the opener and it took a magnicent ing save from goalkeeper Stuart Macdonald to deny John MacRae a second before Lovat rallied towards the end of the half.And with the interval fast approaching Greg Matheson found space on the left to send a rasping finish high beyond Josh Grant, the Shiel keeper, to square the match.The Kiltarlity side pressed hard in the early stages of the second period, but Shiel#s defence stood firm.And on the hour mark they broke swtly to restore the advantage. MacRae raced onto Jordan Fraser#s lofted pass and as MacDonald advanced the Shiel attacker kept a cool head to deftly clip the ball home and make it -.The goal knocked the stuffing out of Lovat, who struggled to create much in the way of clear chances thereafter. And deep into injury-time MacRae completed the fairy tale with another adroit finish for the hat-trick.There were no shortage of contenders for the Albert Smith medal for man of the match # but the award, now in its th year, went to defensive lynchpin Conor Cormack.After the match the -year-old hat-trick-hero, who previously feared he might have to quit the game after a succession of knee injuries, said: #It#s not really sunk it yet # at the final whistle we had people running to us and crying. It will take a while and maybe it will be a few days before it all hits home.#It#s something we all hoped hadn#t passed us by # you need a good run of games, and fortunately it has worked out for us this year. It#s an amazing feeling.#Kinlochshiel manager Johnston Gill, who has now led the club to the Premier League, MacAulay Cup and Camanachd Cup, added: #Lovat gave us a hard time of it, but we had Keith MacRae on fire today # the whole team were brilliant. #It was nip and tuck after they came back to - but I think we shaded the game as a whole.#We knew the threat they carried, but Fraser Heath was well marked by Finlay MacRae and Conor did a great job against Greg Matheson. #We got our tactics right and used our subs well # they were all outstanding.#It#s a fantastic day # most of the community is here with us in Oban # they are great for us, and give us fantastic backing. We will all enjoy it!#Meanwhile, earlier in the day Skye Camanachd also had a victory to savour as their under- team lted the Ken MacMaster Cup.Goals from Seonaidh MacLeod and Alasdair Stewart sealed a - win over Fort William."},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_4097188.jpg--.jpg?1632220580000\n","title":"ni businesses showcase their produce and services at london exhibition","story":"DOZENS of Northern Ireland businesses have showcased their products and services at an exhibition in London.The Westminster event is part of the Northern Ireland Offices centenary programme.Business leaders also attended a reception at Downing Street last Wednesday hosted by the prime minister.The government said it would provide businesses with an opportunity to network with international companies and investors.The exhibitors represented a cross-section of sectors within the Northern Ireland economy and included  start-ups.

By gathering as much information as we can, we will be able to help people and dogs live the best lives possible together.”The online survey asks dog owners about everything from how their dog behaves and what training they do with their four-legged friend, to questions about their relationship such as do they celebrate their dog’s birthday and do they tell them they love them. It also covers people’s post-pandemic plans for their dog such as are they hoping to take them into the office with them or will they employ a dog walker,they are ing to their workplace.The survey, which can be completed online at www.nationaldogsurvey.org.uk, also asks people to say how having a dog improves their le, what advice they would give to people looking to welcome a dog into their family and what one thing could Dogs Trust do to help them and their dog live happily together.Conor adds:“We always love to hear tales from owners who have adopted from us, and every single one of them has a dferent story to tell. We now want to capture the experiences of all local dog owners so we can build a picture of dog ownership today and what more Dogs Trust can do to help them and their dogs.“This will be the most comprehensive census of dogs and dog lovers ever completed and we would love iteveryone who is passionate about dogs could do their bit to help our four-legged friends of the future have the best lives possible.“What people tell us today will help us make sure we are able to do everything we can to support dogs and their owners for the next  years and more.”For more information and to take part in the National Dog Survey, visit www.nationaldogsurvey.org.uk Dog owners who complete the survey will get tailored behaviour advice sent direct to them.

With the case numbers still high, and the economic pressure on those businesses impacted by the remaining restrictions still being felt acutely, particularly across the arts, culture and hospitality sectors, we want to work to enable them to reopen to their maximum capacity as safely as possible and to remain open. “To facilitate this we are going to have further focused discussions with sector representatives on how we can work together to achieve this in line with the autumn winter planning needs. The sectors have some ideas we want to explore in more detail. We will meet again on Monday to discuss this issue further. “On international travel, we have decided to remove the requirement for Pre-Departure Testing for fully vaccinated arrivals from non-red list countries.

Having been obsessed with cars since I was a child, I was counting the days before I could get behind the wheel. “I was go-karting when I could barely see over one. I’ve been attending track days with my own car for a couple of years, but I’ve never raced and I’m so excited to get on the race track competitively for the first time.“Thanks to ski racing, I have an athlete’s mindset and an eye for the racing line, so I know I have as much chance of success as anyone  on the grid.”The all-disabled Team BRIT supports people with physical and psychological challenges in accessing motorsport through its racing academy.Earlier this year, James, who studies international relations with politics at Oxford Brookes University, went to meet the team’s crew at its Dunsfold base in Surrey.After being assessed at track days, the Co Derry man was offered a place as a rookie on the team and has now secured his official race licence.A Twitter post from Team BRIT read: “Big news. Say hello to our latest rookie, Paralympics GB ski star James Whitley… a long-time petrolhead. He’s been spending time with us on the track and is now ready to join the team”.Having been born without hands, the son of Tara Chichester-Clark and her husband Edward Whitley had reconstructive surgery on his limbs. It was partially successful, leaving him with some fingers but limited feeling.But that didn’t deter the youngster from taking up skiing when he was only four, and Eastbourne-based James was first offered a place on the British Disabled Ski Team at . Prior to that, however, at the age of six, he was involved in a serious powerboat accident on holiday when an outboard motor went over the top of the smaller boat James and his family were in. He suffered multiple broken bones and internal bleeding.As his mother Tara recalled, he was lucky to be alive.“Our boat sank with James trapped underneath,” she said“He sustained a great deal of internal bleeding, broken legs, ribs, jaw and had to be resuscitated on the lakeside.“It took eight hours of stabilising him at the hospital before they could take him in to surgery. “Following that, he had lost the feeling from the waist down and was in a wheelchair for several weeks. During this time, James was encouraged to contact the GB Paralympian ski team to improve his leg strength and help his recovery.”He made his debut for Great Britain in  and, five years later, made his World Championship debut in La Molina, Spain, where he finished th in the giant slalom.A year later, he made his Paralympics GB debut at Sochi , where he produced confident performances in the technical events, ranking th in the giant slalom and th in the slalom.Since then, key achievements have included top- finishes at the World Championships, as well as three Europa Cup titles, ranking second overall in the Europa Cup super-combined in Veysonnaz.Motorsport, however, is uppermost in his mind now.“I’m % committed to this new challenge and every race will be about pushing for the podium,” James said. “Longer term, I want to be with the team at Le Mans. There’s no reason why we can’t get there and be competitive.”There won’t be a language barrier since James speaks fluent French.

Furthermore, the estimated number of movies that began shooting declined by % to .The downturn had a knock-on effect on global revenue, which fell by % in  compared to the previous year.Yet, at such precarious times for the industry, the Ballymena actor is still pumping out big box office draws and topping Netflix’s movie charts.Over the past  months, the -year-old Taken star, who has rebranded himself as a not-to-be-messed-with action figure in his middle age, opened two films at number one.The Marksman, in which he plays an Arizona rancher who becomes the unlikely defender of a Mexican boy pursued by cartel assassins, knocked Wonder Woman  from the top spot on its release earlier this year. Daily Headlines Newsletter  EveningNewsletter Receive todays headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.  Enter email address   This field is required  Sign Up      A few months earlier, Honest Thief held the top spot at the box office for two weeks back-to-back, grossing .m from , cinemas on its first day. While revenue was down due to the pandemic, the film’s performance proved cinemagoers hadn’t given up on big screens.Not content with being the only actor to lend his name to two number-one box office hits since the pandemic kicked off, Neeson’s thriller The Ice Road was the most-watched movie on Netflix  hours after premiering at the start of the summer. An older movie, Unknown, originally released a decade ago, drew strong viewing figures on Netflix back in January this year, again ranking at number one.It doesn’t stop there. February sees the US release of another Neeson-fronted thriller, Blacklight, directed by Mark Williams. It sees him play a fixer for the FBI who is tasked with pulling undercover agents out of dangerous situations. He finds himself in the middle of a conspiracy when one such agent questions the people he is working for.The father-of-two is currently filming Retribution, a Speed-like thriller about a bank executive whose le is thrown upside down when a bomb is placed inside his car with him and his family. A few other thriller-type films are in the pipeline, currently at the pre-production stage.So what drives Neeson to be so prolic and why does his appeal endure  Film critic and lecturer Mike Catto said there were a number of reasons why directors and film fans alike are so Taken with the Northern Irish man.“From people who have worked with him, I’ve been told he is extremely hard-working, just gets on with it and there are never any tantrums He has a strong work ethic and still feels the impetus to work. If the work is there, he will take it,” he added.“Neeson is still in good health and shape, andwe look at Hollywood’s history, actors like James Stewart and Henry Fonda were still working into their s.“There are two strong reasons why his appeal is so enduring: firstly, his reliability. His movie A Walk Among the Tombstones wasn’t his greatest but still attracted an audience.“Secondly, his voice. It’s easily recognisable, in the same way Sean Connery had a distinctive voice. Put Neeson’s name above the title and people will come because they like that voice.”Catto said changes in the technology behind movie-making also meant that high-quality feature films could be made faster, using high-definition video and electronic editing. He said the advent of streaming services had prompted a demand for middle budget films that didn’t require massive sets or fancy special effects, and that many of Neeson’s movies fell into this category.“There are other actors who have many projects on the go at the one time, like Matt Damon or Kenneth Branagh,” added Catto.“Neeson certainly has a good few years left in him yet. I can’t see him leaping off roofs in  years, but as the movie Ordinary Love with Lesley Manville proved, he can be versatile.“If he feels physically and mentally capable of doing the roles, I think he’ll just keep doing them for as long as he can.”.app-box.app-box h.app-box a.app-box img Download the BelfastAppGet quick and easy access to the latest Northern Ireland news, sport, business and opinion with the BelfastApp.Related topicsLiam NeesonMost ReadSam McBrideOpinionA good man died after too much Covid misinformation – while his hero, lockdown sceptic Ivor Cummins, goes on making money from devoteesMan released from Donegal hospital by anti-vaccination campaigners against medical advice has died in hospitalMy le fell apart so fast... it can happen to anyoneDUP leader Donaldson calls for electoral pact among unionist parties to stop Sinn FeinFuel shortages: NI haulage company says protocol takes away ‘quite a bit of pressure’Top VideosPlay Warning Graphic Content: Scene of Dundonald shootingPlayVet who voiced food safety concerns in line for £m payout from StormontPlayHillary Clinton says Northern Ireland is a symbol of peace and hopeLatest Northern IrelandProtests take place across Ireland against UK Government legacy proposalsGreen Party councillor calls for Lisburn to go car free for a daySteve Strange: Music stars lead tributes after death of NI agent who was industry ‘titan’Brexit and lack of workers combine to hit food supplies in coming months...with Christmas dinner plate set to sufferBorn with no hands… but that won’t stop me driving for glory at Le MansLatest‘We need him’: Rory McIlroy drop decision explained by Padraig Harrington at Ryder CupGabriel Jesus gives champions victory and ends Cha’s unbeaten startWilliam introduces new BBC show on the environment as ‘moment for hope’Starmer: Watered-down Labour reforms will put party in better positionPadraig Harrington still counting on Rory McIlroy despite foursomes omission,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandBelfast BeatUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendNewsEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

An emphatic yes,” said Secretary Clinton.“I’ve always enjoyed being on university campus, talking with students and faculties, learning about their experiences and perspectives, but Queen’s is special, a university with global reach and local impact. A first class research institution, a centre for innovation and entrepreneurship in technology, business and health, an incubator for artists and activists. I’m looking forward to learning much more about this university’s exciting story and about the future you will create together.“But there was another reason why I agreed to become a member of this community,” she continued.

Bill and I were here to do what we could to support the search for peace, and to light the Christmas tree at City Hall.“It was also the first time I visited Queen’s for a reception right here in Whitla Hall. Representatives of the ious factions were here too. As I remember, the Catholic leadership stood by the band, Protestants stood by the food. It is fitting that today we are all together honouring a group of women who reached across those long-held isions to help make peace real, the Northern Ireland Women’s Coalition.Women like Bronagh Hinds, Professor Monica McWilliams, Jane Morrice, Pearl Sagar OBE. They formed their own political party in  in order to participate in the formal peace negotiations. Women did not have a seat at the table. A quarter century of bloodshed and stre and embedded sexism had discouraged most women from politics, but they were relentless in their commitment to peace. They had a great slogan too, ‘Wave Goodbye to the Dinosaurs’.“Throughout my career as First Lady, US Senator, Secretary of State, some of my most cherished memories are moments spent with the remarkable women of Northern Ireland, all waving away those dinosaurs.“Women like the late Pat Hume, a gracious, determined force behind the peace deal.“Women wanted the same things,” said Secretary Clinton.“Good jobs, good schools for their children, streets you could walk down safely, a future you could believe in.“But even here in Northern Ireland, the peace and progress so many worked tirelessly to achieve is incomplete.“The work of integration in housing and schools is far from finished.“Neighbourhoods remain ided. Poverty and unemployment persist. The dficulties of the past continue to threaten the present.“Divisions over Brexit and the Northern Ireland Protocol and proposed amnesty legislation might very well undermine a peaceful future.“A future that people voted for, fought for, and even died for.”Mrs Clinton said it remains for the people of Northern Ireland to shape the future.“I don’t pretend to have the political answers to resolve this impasse. That is up to the people of Northern Ireland,” she said.“But I do know this, the future of Northern Ireland will be determined by the power of communities coming together, like the one here at Queen’s.“Many of the students here today were born after the Good Friday Agreement was signed. They study together, play sports and join clubs together. They have long, deep conversations late into the night. These may be simple interactions but when considered in the context of Northern Ireland’s history, the idea of young Protestants and Catholics, unionists and nationalists, loyalists and republicans being one another’s friends, classmates and mentors shows it’s clear these relationships are transformative.”Mrs Clinton said the Good Friday Agreement remains a testament to the courage and faith of the people of Northern Ireland.“But we cannot take it for granted,” she warned.“Seamus Heaney said that sometimes people leave aside their cynicism, their bitterness, their hatreds, and hope and history rhyme. That is the choice the people of Northern Ireland made in .“I sincerely hope it is the choice you and countless others around the world will continue to make.“Peace is a process, not an event. Seamus Heaney also told us to believe a further shore us reachable from here.“The work here at Queen’s is far from finished but we can see that further shore,” she said.“Let us reach towards it together and prove to the world once again that we still live in a time when hope and history rhyme.”Mrs Clinton was appointed to the role for a five-year term in early  but her official installation was delayed due to the Covid- pandemic.As Mrs Clinton took part in the installation procession, a number of anti-war protesters, who had gathered outside, hurled insults and abuse.The ceremony also saw honorary degrees awarded to  leading figures in the worlds of business, politics, sport, the arts, policing and education in Northern Ireland.Among recipients were Derry Girls writer and creator Lisa McGee, former Police Service of Northern Ireland chief constable Sir George Hamilton and Ireland’s highest-capped female athlete, international hockey player Shirley McCay..app-box.app-box h.app-box a.app-box img Download the BelfastAppGet quick and easy access to the latest Northern Ireland news, sport, business and opinion with the BelfastApp.Related topicsQueen’s UniversityMore On Queen’s University PremiumDr Gail McConnell pens poetry book about coming to terms with father’s Troubles death PremiumRelentless cyber attacks on NI Civil Service uncoveredPopular writer Stewart Love who penned one of the first Troubles-related plays dies at Coronavirus NI: Students getting vaccinated will help ease disruption to their lives, says health minister as ‘jabbathon’ continuesTrial from Queen’s University leads to improved and money-saving way to treat eye diseaseMost ReadSam McBrideOpinionA good man died after too much Covid misinformation – while his hero, lockdown sceptic Ivor Cummins, goes on making money from devoteesMan released from Donegal hospital by anti-vaccination campaigners against medical advice has died in hospitalMy le fell apart so fast... it can happen to anyoneDUP leader Donaldson calls for electoral pact among unionist parties to stop Sinn FeinFuel shortages: NI haulage company says protocol takes away ‘quite a bit of pressure’Top VideosPlay Warning Graphic Content: Scene of Dundonald shootingPlayVet who voiced food safety concerns in line for £m payout from StormontPlayHillary Clinton says Northern Ireland is a symbol of peace and hopeLatest Northern IrelandProtests take place across Ireland against UK Government legacy proposalsGreen Party councillor calls for Lisburn to go car free for a daySteve Strange: Music stars lead tributes after death of NI agent who was industry ‘titan’Brexit and lack of workers combine to hit food supplies in coming months...with Christmas dinner plate set to sufferBorn with no hands… but that won’t stop me driving for glory at Le MansLatest‘We need him’: Rory McIlroy drop decision explained by Padraig Harrington at Ryder CupBruno Fernandes pays the penalty as Aston Villa beat Manchester UnitedGabriel Jesus gives champions victory and ends Cha’s unbeaten startWilliam introduces new BBC show on the environment as ‘moment for hope’Starmer: Watered-down Labour reforms will put party in better position,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandBelfast BeatUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendNewsEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Of those , cases, , were accepted as homeless.At constituency level Ms Eastwood, a Lisburn and Castlereagh representative, is dealing with a “crazy” amount of housing issues.“Throughout the pandemic the problems have been exacerbated,” she said.She said misconceptions still exist of homeless people on a street corner, wrapped in a sleeping bag with a can of beer in their hand. In reality, many have mental health issues and are self-medicating to cope.

Enter email address   This field is required  Sign Up      As a survivor of domestic abuse and someone who left the family home before she turned , she can relate to those experiences.She said that often young people are left to pick up the pieces in the aftermath of family trauma. While she achieved top grades and went to law school, she “hated it” and couldn’t process the trauma she had witnessed in earlier years.As a -year-old she wasn’t prepared for the lack of structure at university and ended up leaving the family home.After moving into student accommodation with a cousin, she quit a part-time job, split up with her long-term boyfriend, dropped out of university and didn’t take care of herself.Ms Eastwood had no money to pay rent or buy food and was reliant on others in the student house for hand-outs.Things spiralled further when she found herself in an “extremely unhealthy relationship” with an older man” which was “abusive, toxic and much more than that — I would now see him as a predator”.She added: “On the face of it I was probably regarded as an academically ‘smart’ student who had a lovely family, but I had no support to face the unresolved trauma I had experienced and lived with.“As a result, my le fell apart fast and I just ended up in really unsafe situations. Through lived experience I know it can happen to anyone.”She feels that services need to improve by taking a holistic approach to limit the number of people falling through the cracks.Placing homeless people —who often have a mental health issue and are seeking treatment for drug addiction — in hostels with other addicts where they get trapped in a “vicious cycle” should not happen, Ms Eastwood added.She said there needs to be a “dual diagnosis process” whereby people are offered detox and mental health treatment together.“We need more social housing. Councils, the Housing Executive, health trusts, the police and others need to come together to improve services.“We need early intervention at the same time someone makes an application.”.app-box.app-box h.app-box a.app-box img Download the BelfastAppGet quick and easy access to the latest Northern Ireland news, sport, business and opinion with the BelfastApp.Related topicsLisburn and Castlereagh City CouncilAlliance PartyMore On Lisburn and Castlereagh City CouncilBalmoral Show : A quieter affair, but visitors delighted to be back PremiumBalmoral Show preview: There is something for everyone as agri-food event sRotten shellfish dumped in Belfast for third time in a month… councillor calls for investigation PremiumNI firm behind Harrods and Wembley revamps upbeat after ‘tough  months’Lisburn and Castlereagh City Council drops £k DNA plan to snf out dog foulersMost ReadSam McBrideOpinionA good man died after too much Covid misinformation – while his hero, lockdown sceptic Ivor Cummins, goes on making money from devoteesMan released from Donegal hospital by anti-vaccination campaigners against medical advice has died in hospitalMy le fell apart so fast... it can happen to anyoneDUP leader Donaldson calls for electoral pact among unionist parties to stop Sinn FeinFuel shortages: NI haulage company says protocol takes away ‘quite a bit of pressure’Top VideosPlay Warning Graphic Content: Scene of Dundonald shootingPlayVet who voiced food safety concerns in line for £m payout from StormontPlayHillary Clinton says Northern Ireland is a symbol of peace and hopeLatest Northern IrelandProtests take place across Ireland against UK Government legacy proposalsGreen Party councillor calls for Lisburn to go car free for a daySteve Strange: Music stars lead tributes after death of NI agent who was industry ‘titan’Born with no hands… but that won’t stop me driving for glory at Le MansUlster Orchestra stages first concert after pandemic hitLatest‘We need him’: Rory McIlroy drop decision explained by Padraig Harrington at Ryder CupBruno Fernandes pays the penalty as Aston Villa beat Manchester UnitedGabriel Jesus gives champions victory and ends Cha’s unbeaten startWilliam introduces new BBC show on the environment as ‘moment for hope’Starmer: Watered-down Labour reforms will put party in better position,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandBelfast BeatUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendNewsEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Credit: Kevin Scott Belfast John BreslinSeptember   : PMFacebookTwitterEmailMillionaire broadcaster Stephen Nolan believes he is not a success in le because of a failure to manage his weight — and not having any children.In a candid interview, the television and radio presenter said he hated when people suggest he is a success because of his millionaire status.“I hate people suggesting I’m successful because I’m not,” the -year-old told the Sunday Times.“Being a millionaire is not a success to me. The two things I would consider successful would be to have a normal weight and children. I don’t have either.”As he ages, Nolan revealed he is more and more worried about his health. Several years ago, the presenter managed to reduce his weight from  stone to , but has since put most of it back on.“I’m a complete failure with my health. Weight has defeated me and continues to defeat me,” he said.“No matter how hard I drive myself in other things, I’m a total and absolute failure with my weight. It gets me down, it worries me. Now I’m getting older, it worries me even more. I can’t beat it. I cannot do it.” Daily Headlines Newsletter  EveningNewsletter Receive todays headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.  Enter email address   This field is required  Sign Up      The presenter, who fronts The Nolan Show on BBC Radio Ulster, Stephen Nolan on BBC Radio  Live and Nolan Live, which s to BBC on Wednesday, defended his more than £, salary, among the broadcaster’s highest. “I like earning money. I don’t think people in London should just be on the BBC’s Top Ten earning list. You should be able to sit in Northern Ireland, or in any of the nations, and punch in big figures,” he said.He also revealed libel suits have been filed against two more iniduals he claims abused him online.Nolan, recently awarded large sums totalling more than £, after successful actions against two other internet “trolls”, vowed he will spend money going after people he believes are trying to destroy him.A writ has been issued in the High Court in Belfast against a Northern Ireland-based businesswoman, while the second claim will be in the High Court in Dublin against an estate agent based in the Republic of Ireland, Paul Tweed, his solicitor, told the Sunday Times.Mr Tweed also represented former First Minister Arlene Foster, who was awarded £, damages over a tweet by Christian Jessen, the presenter of Channel ’s Embarrassing Bodies“I don’t want to hurt people. I don’t want to be this rich guy going after people, but I’m as vulnerable as anyone ,” he said. “Rather than buy a new car I will spend my money going after somebody who has set out to destroy me.”He added: “I get a lot of abuse about my presentation style. That’s acceptable. I get a lot of abuse about my weight. I talk about it, so there we go.“But when someone threatens to put a bullet in your head ... I let that go for a while, then I thought, ‘No’.

The decision comes following allegations of the former Derry  Strabane councillor of spreading misinformation regarding the Covid- pandemic. Although she had retired from practicing medicine back in , she ed to work to help NHS staff during the Covid crisis. googletag.cmd.push However, during that time, she had posted online about her scepticism of lockdowns and how serious the virus was to peoples lives. One post likened the vaccines administration to that of work done by the Nazis who experimented on humans in concentration camps. Dr McCloskey also featured in a nine-minute video where she said that many people have been “coerced, bribed or bullied” into being vaccinated against Covid- and that vaccines were “malevolent”. The GMC said: “The tribunal directed an -month interim suspension but all such restrictions are kept under regular review while a full investigation is carried out. “Doctors are unable to practice medicine in the UK while interim suspended. “These tribunals do not determine the facts of what happened, but undertake a risk assessment of whether temporary protection is needed.” The GMC investigated former Aontuacute councillor Dr McCloskey following a complaint made by Foyle MLA Sinead McLaughlin of the SDLP. She said: “I requested the General Medical Council to consider two social media videos posted by a Derry GP. It is essential that medical professionals provide patients and the general public with the best possible advice with regard to vaccinations. There is overwhelming evidence that vaccinations provide protection against the worst effects of Covid.     “I am extremely concerned that anti-vaccination and Covid denying propaganda is discouraging some of our population from being vaccinated. That is extremely damaging to the health of our population. “Derry continues to have a very high rate of Covid infection and the North of Ireland as a whole continues to suffer from a comparatively low vaccination rate. The medical profession obviously has a key role in tackling these issues.”   ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"--ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\".detachTo.detachTo   --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare  sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Down Memory Lane: Derrys Millennium Forum - ‘A place of hope’  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at River Inn, Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at River Inn, Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derry Death Notices - Friday, th September,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Dr Anne McCloskey featured in a nine-minute video where she said that many people have been ldquocoerced, bribed or bullied into being vaccinated against Covid- and that vaccines were ldquomalevolentDerry doctor Anne McCluskey suspended from practicing medicine after Covid claims overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Altnagevlin Hospital to move to -- visiting system overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derry Death Notices - Saturday, th September,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Kevin lsquoCrackrsquo McKeever is still well remembered by Derry City fans.

The families have rallied together in a stand against the UK Government’s intended amnesty for all those who committed conflict-related offences. googletag.cmd.push Emmett McConomy, brother of ten-year-old Stephen, killed by a plastic bullet fired by a British soldier, spoke to the crowd: “Nearly  years later, we have the British Government, namely Boris Johnson and Brandon Lewis, telling us and all the other victims of this conflict that he’s doing us a favour. “He’s drawn a line under the past for us. This he says will help the healing process and move us further along the road to reconciliation. “Well, I have a clear message for you, Mr Lewis and Mr Johnson, how dare you try and speak for me and try and tell me what is best for our family. Do not speak for me and my brother. Do not speak for Stephen and you surely do not speak for the people of Derry.” The proposed government amnesty would prevent prosecutions for conflict-related offences and close down present and future police and Police Ombudsman investigations, civil actions and legacy inquests. Other rallies were organised in protest of the amnesty today both North and South of the border. See Mondays paper for full coverage.

The families have rallied together in a stand against the UK Government’s intended amnesty for all those who committed conflict-related offences. googletag.cmd.push Emmett McConomy, brother of ten-year-old Stephen, killed by a plastic bullet fired by a British soldier, spoke to the crowd: “Nearly  years later, we have the British Government, namely Boris Johnson and Brandon Lewis, telling us and all the other victims of this conflict that he’s doing us a favour. “He’s drawn a line under the past for us. This he says will help the healing process and move us further along the road to reconciliation. “Well, I have a clear message for you, Mr Lewis and Mr Johnson, how dare you try and speak for me and try and tell me what is best for our family. Do not speak for me and my brother. Do not speak for Stephen and you surely do not speak for the people of Derry.” The proposed government amnesty would prevent prosecutions for conflict-related offences and close down present and future police and Police Ombudsman investigations, civil actions and legacy inquests. Other rallies were organised in protest of the amnesty today both North and South of the border. See Mondays paper for full coverage.

She co-founded successful online learning company Learning Pool in Derry in . Today, she works extensively with start-ups and scaling tech companies. She is one of the co-founders of cross-border social enterprise and female founder community AwakenHub and she is part of the EU’s flagship EIC Accelerator innovation team. googletag.cmd.push -------------------------------------------- A few weeks ago Digital DNA’s Simon Bailie asked me to write a short piece about Derry for DDNA’s Top Tech Companies in NIreport. Simon asked me to cover the Derry tech scene – how it’s altered in the almost  years I’ve been working in the city and perhaps more importantly, what the missing ingredients are that would make the Maiden City’s tech scene really sing. I enjoyed writing it and was surprised to find that no-one  has written about this. Here’s what I had to say in full. How much has the Derry tech scene changed  I began working in Derry in . I moved from Belfast where I’d been global CFO in one of QUB’s semiconductor IP spinouts.I’d spent a good bit of my time in the early noughties in Silicon Valley and Derry in  couldn’t have been further from San Jose. The only similarity was that the streets were completely deserted by .pm. When I told my friends in Belfast that I was taking a job in Derry they all tried to talk me out of it. I remember trying to recruit a team in  and talent was very thin on the ground. Most of the local workforce were lers in one of the FDIs or they commuted to tech jobs in either Belfast or Letterkenny.     The local tech scene back then was dominated by the prominent FDIs Seagate  Allstate , big fish Singularityand a never-ending raft of call centres and it was populated by revered avuncular middle-aged men like Bro McFerran and Dr Alan McClure. Anyone calling the HP or Expedia customer help lines back in the day would’ve been greeted by a Derry accent, way before it was trendy. We started Learning Pool in London in  and quickly moved the company to Derry because it was bootstrap-affordable and because of the ready talent graduating from Magee. We couldn’t afford to hire an experienced team so we recruited new graduates with the right attitude and trained them. We didn’t have an office so we took a few desks in theshockingly haphazard co-working space at the university. Even though the space was supposed to be reserved for new startups, a few companies had been renting in there forever so we ended up with desks dotted here and there in random parts of the floor. No-one in our team could sit together and the co-working space manager constantly shushed us whenever we took phone calls and harped on forever about the washing-up. We had a desktop PC in the corner with a paper notice sellotaped to the top of it which read DO NOT SWITCH OFF  Today there’s a stable of promising scaling tech companies choosing to base themselves in Derry. Established companies likeElemental Software  Newer entrants like medtech company Respiratory Analytics, cyber security companyITUSand caretech challenger startupInCharge. Many companies keep one foot in Derry and the other in Donegal, thus preserving their EU status for access to customers and funding. Catalyst Incopened its doors in  on the historic Fort George site just outside the city and has been a great formal addition to the fabric of the local ecosystem. Other active startup supports likeStartacusand new island of Ireland female founder community AwakenHubare anchored in Derry. Today, the local tech scene is younger, more female, less formal, more global, well educated and informed and definitely ambitious. A lot of newer founders have lived away from Ireland for a while but are electing tohome and settle down, build a business. Catalyst’s Co-Founders programme has uncovered some interesting nascent companies. Some of those new graduates that I recruited back in  or  have gone on to found their own startups. That’s how ecosystems work. The FDIs are still present but they’re less dominant today. They don’t have a lot of employee churn and just tick along in the background, largely behind closed doors. They bring employment to an area of Northern Ireland that badly needs it and they sponsor the odd event and programme. Many of the call centres seem to have been bought over and have disappeared. Innovation and all the interesting stuff happens in the smaller, agile companies around the edges and this is what we need more of. As well as the FDIs we now have the presence of indigenous scaleups like Kainosand FinTru. It would be great to see a few more like these moving in but high quality office space is an issue. Maybe not so important in the future we’re facing post-COVID. The traditional talent pool has extended from the Bann well into Donegal and in Derry I’ve worked beside people who’ve commuted daily from as far afield as Ballycastle and Creeslough. Missing Ingredients If it was Christmas morning and I could have three wishes to improve the tech sector ecosystem in the North West this is what I would wish for: - An ambitious cross-border university named after the late John Hume with campuses in both Derry and Donegaland strong links into the powerful North West diaspora that stretches from Philadelphia to London to Singapore. I’m always impressed by the vibrant startup scene that exists in Letterkenny as a result of the numerous overseas students and researchers who come to LYIT for academic reasons and end up staying. This new university to be fastened at the hip to a well funded and well resourced startup, student and alumni accelerator regime like Oxford University has withOxford Foundrywhich in turn connects firmly into sources of venture finance, a bit likeEDEMin the marina in Valencia - A Derry-Letterkenny- Sligo-Galway Economic Corridor along the Wild Atlantic Way to mirror the Belfast-Dublin corridor that was formally announced in the east of the island last month. This to connect the opportunities that will naturally flow from the new Magee Medical School to the vibrant medtech cluster of companies and investors in Galway and to link in with the newly reinvigorated Western Development Commissionand the string of Atlantic hubs the Irish State has invested in over recent years. I am encouraged by news of a new cross-border scaling hub led by Catalyst Inc  LYIT which will be built in the image of thePortershedGalway model - A focus placed on determining how Derry and indeed all of Northern Ireland can tangibly and quickly benefit from being so close to an EU border in the post-Brexit world. Can Derry compete with Belfast  This was a provocative question posed by Simon in his brief to me. In my view, this is not the right question and shouldn’t be part of anyone’s ambition. Any venture starting out in the new world should instead think about opportunities presented as a result of global changes that the past  months have fast tracked. It’s now genuinely possible to be a global company from Day  and utilise talent from any part of the globe. Barriers no longer exist. Cities and regions need to start thinking this way too. To ask Derry to compete only with Belfast would not be setting a big enough challenge. So, in conclusion,you’re looking for a friendly and affordable university city to start your tech business, where it’s possible to be in both the UK and the EU, an hour from London by air, where   of the population is aged - and is well educated, where government startup funding is readily available, close to some of Europe’s finest beaches, with top class local state schools and a long history and culture … then maybe you should take a look at Derry. And my final call to action, on  April  Jayne Brady started in a brand new post at Belfast City Council as Belfast’s Digital Innovation Commissioner. An engineer and former Venture Capital Partner, in the  months since Jayne started she’s made a massive dference and she represents Belfast at the digital and innovation negotiating tables in both Westminster and Dublin. In truth, although she works for Belfast City Council she does her very best to represent all of Northern Ireland. Isn’t it time we appointed a Digital Innovation Commissioner to do the same and really own this agenda for the NW region of Ireland and its citizens, present and future ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"--ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\".detachTo.detachTo   --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare  sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Down Memory Lane: Derrys Millennium Forum - ‘A place of hope’  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at River Inn, Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at River Inn, Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derry Death Notices - Friday, th September,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Dr Anne McCloskey featured in a nine-minute video where she said that many people have been ldquocoerced, bribed or bullied into being vaccinated against Covid- and that vaccines were ldquomalevolentDerry doctor Anne McCluskey suspended from practicing medicine after Covid claims overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Altnagevlin Hospital to move to -- visiting system overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derry Death Notices - Saturday, th September,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Kevin lsquoCrackrsquo McKeever is still well remembered by Derry City fans.

Going away to university or college is likely the first time many students are fending for themselves. They’ll be paying for books, meals, bills, rent and socialising on their own for the first time. googletag.cmd.push Eoin Clarke, Managing Director ofSwitcher.iehas put together these tips to help students manage their money. Banking -Choosing a student bank account can be tricky, especially as banks try to lure you in with exciting free perks. But don’t be fooled by flashy freebies think about what is important to you before choosing. Check which bank provides things like an overdraft, mobile app, internet banking or mobile payments, decide which features are most important to you and then make an informed decision. You may also be able to get astudent credit cardwhich could help you manage unplanned expenses, however only get oneyou are sure you are able to pay off your balance in full each month. Providers -When deciding who to go with for things like broadband don’t just go for the cheapest option. If you’re living in a property with other people you need a download limit that will stand up to the usage of everyone using it at the same time. Many broadband contracts are - months, compare to seeamonthly rolling contractcould be cheaper over the year so you won’t have to pay exit fees. Get the right cover-Make sure your belongings are protected at third level, shop around for good content andgadget cover. Mobile phones and laptops can be expensive to replace, covering them against loss, theft or damage could save you hundreds of eurosanything were to happen to them.      Budgeting -Creating a budget when heading off to college or university is key to make sure you have enough money left to make it to the end of term. Start by writing down all your incomings and outgoings, include things like nights out, bills, clothes, food, transport and any money you will earn or have saved. If something doesnt fit into your budget seethere is anything you can save on. Having a budget will help you work out what you can spend each month and ensure you don’t get into unmanageable debt. Be Savvy -Many retailers offer cashback or student discounts either through schemes like Unidays or just by showing proof you’re studying. Be sure to check whenever buying something - every little bit helps and you may be surprised how much you could save. Shop around -Before rushing out and buying every book on the reading list, have a look online to seeyou could buy them cheaper second hand. Students from the year above are likely to be selling books they no longer need. Many books are also available online or in the library so seeyou can access them for free before splashing out. Fraud -The beginning of term is prime time for students to get targeted by fraudsters so be extra vigilant. Before handing over any money, be sure to check what you are paying for. When renting property, only use recognised letting agents and never give out personal information to someone over the phoneyou are unsure who they are.ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"--ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\".detachTo.detachTo   --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare  sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Down Memory Lane: Derrys Millennium Forum - ‘A place of hope’  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at River Inn, Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at River Inn, Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derry Death Notices - Friday, th September,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Dr Anne McCloskey featured in a nine-minute video where she said that many people have been ldquocoerced, bribed or bullied into being vaccinated against Covid- and that vaccines were ldquomalevolentDerry doctor Anne McCluskey suspended from practicing medicine after Covid claims overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Altnagevlin Hospital to move to -- visiting system overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derry Death Notices - Saturday, th September,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Kevin lsquoCrackrsquo McKeever is still well remembered by Derry City fans.

Mickey attended St Columbs College, as did many from the south Derry area in those days.Like his siblings, he had a keen interest in all things GAA but his playing career was cut short following a serious motorcycle accident at the age of  years leaving him in a coma for six weeks. On his recovery, he worked as a shop man in Ballinascreen and later in Dunloy so was well known to many in those areas. Mickey and his we Nan later ran the shop in Moydamlaght, Moneyneana.After a number of years living in Magherafelt, to facilitate work in Enkalon in Antrim, Mickey ed to his beloved we Nans roots in Tamnaherin where they continued to raise their family. At his funeral, Fr McDermott noted that the gospel message of modesty was very apt with how much pride and love he had for his family.He was the loving father of Marie, Brian, Martin and Carmel, father-in-law of Fiona and Bronagh, the much loved grandfather of Lorcan, Darragh, Conor, Kian and Shea, son of the late Thomas and Mary and dear brother of Patsy, Margaretand the late Tommy and John.Mickeys other love of GAA continued throughout his long le and he travelled the country to watch Ballinascreen, Slaughtmanus and his beloved Doire, often accompanied by family and friends. On hearing of his passing, a friend said Mickey was a wonderful character. A true Gael. He never forgot his Ballinascreen roots. We will all miss him.Like all Derry Gaels, his best memory was the countys  All-Ireland triumph.Slaughtmanus paid tribute to him saying Mickey was a letime member and stalwart supporter of the Slaughtmanus GAC club, he was very knowledgeable about all things Gaelic football. He would always stop to talk to any fellow Gael about weekly results and news from teams and clubs around the countyMickey is my wes uncle and I can vividly remember our first conversation, a Sunday evening call to check the days results, performances and talking points. It didnt take long to realise he had a photographic memory. No detail was ever missed.“What Mickey didnt know was not worth knowing. a great and interesting conversationalist,” commented local GAA writer Bernie Mullan to me.In his later years Mickey worked in the car parks in Derry City, a role that allowed him to chat to many people, often leading to a few queues at the exit.When Derry released a yearbook in the mid-eighties Mickey penned an article on his memory of attending the final in Dublin, entitled: ...and they even came from Tobermore. The detailed account of before and during the match captured the emotions of the day with even a horse and cart forming part of the journey. googletag.cmd.push An clipping of an article written by Mickey about the  All-Ireland Final.Coming out of Owenbeg on Sunday night, Ballinderry stalwart Pat McGuckin spoke of Mickeys memory and knowledge for GAA, informing me of how he could recite – by heart – the dates of birth of Derrys  team who reached the All-Ireland final.Mickeys self built garden sheds were a treasure trove of newspaper clippings, photos and video tapes of matches, encapsulating his love and passion of all things GAA.Mickey also had a love of gardening with the family home always in pristine condition, with lawns and hedges manicured to the last detail.His gardening skills were well utilised during his time working with Martin Dolan laying lawns and gardens on many new housing developments in the Eglinton area where his legacy will live on.His family will miss him dearly, but the memories and esteem in which he was held is a hand of comfort.A gentleman. A le well-lived, who is now, as Fr McDermott pointed out, walking through the garden of heaven.ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"--ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\".detachTo.detachTo   --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare  sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Down Memory Lane: Derrys Millennium Forum - ‘A place of hope’  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at River Inn, Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at River Inn, Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derry Death Notices - Friday, th September,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Dr Anne McCloskey featured in a nine-minute video where she said that many people have been ldquocoerced, bribed or bullied into being vaccinated against Covid- and that vaccines were ldquomalevolentDerry doctor Anne McCluskey suspended from practicing medicine after Covid claims overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Altnagevlin Hospital to move to -- visiting system overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derry Death Notices - Saturday, th September,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Kevin lsquoCrackrsquo McKeever is still well remembered by Derry City fans.

It is envisaged the move might prompt counties to announce their line-ups before Friday. The Thursday morning registration, which prevents counties from making th-hour changes to their squad unless in an emergency, was voted in at Congress in Paacuteraic Duffy’s time as director-general as a way of combatting dummy teams. Penalties for not providing the -man list included the withdrawal of sideline privileges for the manager for one match and a fine of up to €, for the county board. Forfeiture is the punishment for fielding a player who has not been registered on the list provided to the referee. The lack of consideration in the rules for late injuries and sickness has been regularly condemned by managers and there have been some instances where less than  players have been available as the deadline for personnel changes had passed and injured men have togged out with no intention of being used.     Match regulations state for non senior inter-county championship games the teams are to be issued to the committee in charge for the official programme and media four days before the game although it is rarely respected, while for league games, the home county must receive team selection from the visitors no later than Wednesday prior to the fixture.

The financial support is helping firms across the nation to adapt, innovate and protect jobs. Here are two examples of how companies have been helped, and what support is available. googletag.cmd.push NORTHERN IRELAND IN NUMBERS , jobs furloughed through the Coronavirus Jobs Retention Scheme up to May  , claims amounting to pound million through the Self- Employment Income Support Scheme up to May  Across the whole UK  per cent of those eligible for SEISS made a claim. The average value of a claim is pound, Source: Her Majesty’s Treasury CASE STUDY  SHNUGGLE  Planning, forward-thinking and invaluable help from the UK Government has enabled a Northern Ireland firm to ersy and remain solvent. When Covid- struck, Newtownards baby product manufacturer Shnuggle’s owners Sinead and Adam Murphy were prepared thanks to advice from their export colleagues in China. Sinead said: “We reduced our out-goings, put on pause our marketing spend in the business. We just tried to protect the cash that we had. “The first impact was our customers that we sell to in Asia. They all went into lockdown so our orders and sales to them stopped. But also a lot of our production happens out in Asia so our factories went into lockdown. “Luckily we had bought a lot of stock beforehand. We were so relieved that we had, at least we could carry on trading with our UK and European customers.” With around half of the company’s sales in the UK and Ireland and half in the export business, Shnuggle had to rely on their local retail-base. Sinead continued: “Baby items were classed as essential goods which was a huge relief to us. This meant as long as we could socially distance within the warehouse we could continue trading and selling online. All of our business is supplying other retailers like John Lewis, Mamas and Papas, Amazon. But our online sales actually grew because everyone was at home and maybe an element of panic buying.”      CASH HELP: The Shnuggle team Shnuggle took advantage of the furlough and Coronavirus Business Interruption Loan Schemeschemes. Sinead said: “We furloughed five out of our  team, and were able to access the Business Interruption loan through Ulster Bank. “We were relieved to get the money in quickly, so we weren’t worrying about paying wages or our biggest overhead was our suppliers in China who were calling in all of their debts. “That was our biggest headache and stress, we owed signicant amounts of money to them and we didn’t have the cash as we needed time to sell our products.” Shnuggle also received a pound, Small Business Grant. Adam said: “Furloughing was brilliant, and the CBILS was the one that was the best for us because it meant that we could keep all our suppliers happy. “So even though we had a temporary dip in our sales, and obviously the inventory was sitting there ready to sell, it just kept us solvent and the cash flow moving. It’s really going to help us trade out of it, andall goes well, we should be able to get back into a reasonably strong cash position within the next six to  months. The loans coming in helped us to sleep at night.” The Government schemes also gave Sinead and Adam the freedom to ersy into the PPE market and the development of HeroShield Ltd, enabling local firms to unite to develop a protective face covering for key workers. This non-profit company designs, produces and distributes reusable visors.   ‘It’s surprisingly easy and money arrives quickly’ CASE STUDY  Q-MASS An unprecedented package of UK Government financial support has helped firms like Q-Mass in East Kilbride weather the coronavirus crisis. Director Ronnie Robertson said lockdown hit his company’s order book, but the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme has been vital to help them hang on to their valued staff. Ronnie said: “Before this, we had quite a good order book, with three to four months of work planned, so we were pretty worried where it was going to take us.” At first, he was worried how he would keep Q-Mass’  staff on the payroll, but then the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme was announced. It offers UK Government support to pay  per cent of staff’s wages up to pound, a month, and the scheme has now been extended until the end of October. Q-Mass manufactures bespoke parts for the oil, gas and defence industry so staff training is important. Ronnie said: “Our staff are very highly skilled. We’ve gathered a bunch of people here and trained them up and taken on apprentices. We do a lot of training, we’ve got good people, we train them a lot and we want to hang on to them.” He found applying for the furlough scheme quick and straightforward. He said: “It was surprisingly easy and we were surprised that the money came through relatively quickly.” Now staff at the firm who’ve been furloughed are gradually ing to work, with strict safety measures in place. Ronnie said: “We’ve put a day sht back on and we’ve still got a few office people working at home, with quite a few still on furlough.  ‘SURPRISINGLY EASY’: Q-Mass director Ronnie Robertson praises the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme “We’re just ticking over. We’re trying to cover our costs every month, trying to break even, to stay still. We’re looking at it thatwe can stay still we’re doing very well.” And because of the size of the building, maintaining a two-metre distance hasn’t been a problem for ing staff. Ronnie said: “It’s been really easy. We’ve got a big workshop with wide corridors and we’ve got a lot of the doors propped open internally so no-one has to touch doors or handles. We’ve got a few toilet areas with restrictions on them and a couple of one-way corridors, but the offices are open plan, so there’s no real need for people to be near each other. The workshop’s a big, wide-open space and we have to keep cleaning things like photocopiers and touch screens, but it’s been quite straightforward.” Now Ronnie’s looking forward to a brighter future. He said: “I feel like we’re on the side of the valley and we’re looking across to the other side and it looks absolutely fantastic.” Money for business and staff Here are some examples of the support available for businesses and workers. middot The Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme has enabled businesses to put employees on a period of temporary leaveand apply for a UK Government grant to cover  per cent of those workers’ usual monthly wage costs, up to pound, a month. middot The Self-Employment Income Support Scheme will allow eligible self-employed iniduals to claim a taxable grant of  per cent of their average monthly profits, up to pound,. middot UK VAT-registered firms have been given the option to defer VAT payments until the end of June.

Cllr Heaney, who represents the Foyleside ward, hailed the decision as “an important move” in helping motorists to transition from traditional fossil fuels – such as petrol and diesel – towards electric power. googletag.cmd.push The Parking Strategy for Derry City and Strabane District identied the need to review the current electric charging infrastructure and quanty the council’s future needs as one of its proposed strategic options. It is hoped that by changing the electric vehicle charging infrastructure in its off-street car-parks, the council is removing any potential barrier to visit and stay in the city Cllr Heaney said: “At the council meeting, we agreed to explore further the possibility of getting new and improved electric charging points for electric motor vehicles into all council car-parks throughout our city and district. “It is an important move as the council plays its part in tackling the climate crisis as we encourage and incentivise as many motorists as possible to move away from fossil-fuelled cars and into electric cars. We want to see this progressing soon. “I was delighted to support this proposal at the council’s Business and Culture committee. Recent figures have revealed that only . per cent of electric vehicles in the north are owned by residents of our council area. “The lack of modern and efficient electric vehicle charging points within our council boundaries is clearly a factor influencing this low figure.     “Council officers have now been tasked with scoping out how charging points can be installed in all council car parks which will massively increase the charging infrastructure, encourage the purchase of more electric vehicles and further decrease the carbon footprint within our city and district.” ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"--ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\".detachTo.detachTo   --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare  sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Down Memory Lane: Derrys Millennium Forum - ‘A place of hope’  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at River Inn, Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at River Inn, Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derry Death Notices - Friday, th September,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Dr Anne McCloskey featured in a nine-minute video where she said that many people have been ldquocoerced, bribed or bullied into being vaccinated against Covid- and that vaccines were ldquomalevolentDerry doctor Anne McCluskey suspended from practicing medicine after Covid claims overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Altnagevlin Hospital to move to -- visiting system overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derry Death Notices - Saturday, th September,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Kevin lsquoCrackrsquo McKeever is still well remembered by Derry City fans.

Opel’s ground-breaking powertrain technology and architecture means that the low, flat battery gives the Vio-e a stable centre of gravity and maximum cabin space. Designed from the ground up with both diesel and electric powertrains in mind, the Vio-e is based heavily on the Opel Corsa-e and its driveline fits comfortably between the chassis rails of the new Vio-e.     Power comes from a kW motor producing Nm of torque for smooth, swt and linear acceleration. The kWh battery is made up of  modules consisting of  inidual cells, while the larger kWh battery has  cells split over  modules.Cooling for the batteries comes from the van’s own in-cab cooling system, which Opel says helps to increase their range and letime. All Vio-e models come with three driving modes and switchable regenerative braking as standard.The standard on-board charger is a .kW single phase unit, while DC charging of up to kW is also supported.Trim and Body Options         Trim levels in the new Vio-e  van consist of Edition and Sportive models, both of which come with standard features such as driver and passenger airbags, electric parking brake, cruise control, full size spare wheel, .” colour dashboard display, remote central deadlocking, two side loading doors, electric front windows, electrically adjustable and heated door mirrors, -speaker audio with a USB inlet, Bluetooth, steering-column remote audio controls, and a DAB radio.Top-spec Sportive trim brings with it air-conditioning, ” colour touchscreen with smartphone projection, body coloured bumpers , LED daytime running lights, front fog lights, rear parking sensors, automatic lights and wipers, electrically folding door mirrors, acoustic windscreen and full-size wheel covers.Available with two body s and two roof heights, the Vio-e is just as flexible as a diesel van with a load volume of up to .m. Because the batteries are between the chassis rails, the total capacity of the load space is completely unchanged, allowing ,mm s in the L model and up to ,mm in the L when using the load-through bulkhead.Otherwise, the standard maximumcapacity of the van is ,mm for the L and ,mm for the L.Payloads are equally impressive, as replacing the engine and transmission with batteries and a motor doesn’t signicantly harm it’s capacities.All Vio-e vans have a gross vehicle weightof .-tonne, and depending on spec you can get a maximum ,kg payload out of a L standard roof height van with the kWh battery.Specying the larger kWh unit brings that figure down to ,kg.Those figures are just kg less than a diesel-engine Vio — a far cry from the disadvantage that battery electric vehicles used to have when compared to diesel-powered vans in the past.Test VanMy test van was a new Vio-e SportivekWh finished in stylish Moonstone Grey metallic paint. The three-seater Vio-e has storage under the passenger bench, while the driver’s seat comes with an adjustable armrest and -way seat adjustment. Being an electric van where the full amount of torque is available from just rpm all the way up to ,rpm, it is exceptionally quick off the mark.Unladen, the Vio-e accelerates with impressive urgency, and I have no doubt it would still prove fast even with a full payload on board.The top speed is limited to km h in order to preserve the battery range, but this is something that should not be of any concern to Vio-e drivers, as the van is more than capable of overtaking slower moving traffic with great ease.The regenerative braking system in the Vio-e is selected by pressing the ‘B mode’ button beside the gear selector, and this applies enough braking to activate the brake lights and slow the vehicle down before the driver presses the brake pedal.I loved the fact that the Vio-e is very car-like to drive, and the selectable Eco, Normal and Power driving modes ensure that there is a mode to suit every type of driver and every type of load. The Vio-e remains composed and comfortable when driven over rutted road surfaces, while body lean through bends is very well controlled.The Vio-e pulls away in silence, with just a hum from the on-board sound generator that is designed to warn others of your presence at low speeds, with just minimal levels of tyre and wind noise noticeable at higher speeds.Charging TimesCharging the Vio-efrom a domestic socket can take up to  hours, but this drops dramatically to . hours when charged from a .KW wall box charger .However, DC rapid charging from a kW sourcetakes just half an hour for the kWh battery and  minutes for the kWh version.Verdict  PricingOverall, the new Opel Vio-e is a genuinely impressive van to drive, easy to live with on a daily basis, offers fast-charging options and it is a good looking van too.In my opinion, this is the class-leading  van in the all-electric light commercial vehiclemarket right now, and deservedly so too.

The Formentor’s design inside and out is something quite dferent to what we have seen before, and brings with it a new dimension in style and sophistication. Being part of the Volkswagen Group means that Cupra has access to cutting-edge mechanicals and technology, and this has enabled the new Formentor compact SUV to hit the ground running, so to speak.  googletag.cmd.push   There is a lot of money and confidence behind the Cupra brand, and that is evident in the bold product plan promised by the company.Engine  Trim OptionsThe Formentor sits on the familiar MQB set of chassis components that also underpins other crossovers such as the Seat Ateca and VW Tiguan. Petrol engine options in the Formentor consist of a .-litre TSI with bhp and a .-litre TSI unit with a choice of ,  or bhp. The . TSI engine is available as a -speed manual or -speed DSG , while the . TSI comes with a DSG transmission as standard, with Cupra’s Drivesystem standard in bhp guise. A . TDIEVO engine is available with bhp and can be mated to a -speed manual or -speed DSG transmission, with the latter coming with Drive as standard.     Additionally, a .-litre e-Hybrid powertrain is available with a choice of bhp or bhp, both of which are mated to a -speed DSG transmission with promised fuel consumption as low as .l km on a combined WLTP driving cycle.There is a choice of two trim levels in CUPRA’s new compact SUV — Formentor and Formentor VZ — with the latter being the Cupra Formentor’s most powerful trim, named in reference to the Spanish word ‘Veloz’, meaning ‘fast’.The Formentor VZ trim offers high-performance powertrain options. Coming with ” alloy wheels, a ” Navigation system, autonomous assistance technology and performance bucket seats as standard.         Test CarMy test car was a Cupra Formentor . TSiDSGwhich was finished in stylish Graphene Grey Premium metallic paint with optional ” Exclusive Aero Black and Copper alloy wheels for an added dose of visual drama. Producing bhp and Nm of torque, the ,cc engine propels the Formentor from a standing start to km h in just .-seconds, on its way to a top speed of km h .Key standard features include full LED headlamps and Daytime Running Lights, rear ‘coast to coast’ light with welcome ceremony, front fog lamps with cornering , heat-insulated and tinted rear windows, leather-wrapped multi- heated sports steering wheel, dark aluminium glossy interior package, textile sport seats, keyless unlocking and ignition system, .” Digital Cockpit, ” Media System with DAB radio, Connect Online infotainment , rain and light sensor, heated front seats, adaptive cruise control, park assist, rear view camera, Drive Profile Selection, and auto high-beam assist, along with a suite of advanced safety systems.Optional extras fitted to my test car included premium metallic paint, black leather bucket seats, ” alloy wheels, hands-free electric tailgate, Dynamic Chassis Control, and Safe  Drive “L” . The sweet-revving petrol engine in my test car produces bhp and Nm of torque, enabling the car to sprint from -km h in .-seconds, with claimed fuel consumption as low as .-l km .As in other VW Group models, the .-litre engine is commendably quick to drop onto two cylinders to save fuel when cruising, and the process of cutting out and back in again is hard to detect. Composed and predictable handling is admirable, as is the Formentor’s ability to soak up road imperfections with ease.Impressive Sporty InteriorTake a seat behind the wheel of the CUPRA Formentor and you could be forgiven for thinking that you are in a hatchback rather than a compact SUV. The seating position is low, as is the base of the windscreen, so you feel like you sit much closer to the road — as you would in a performance-focused car.Selectable driving modes in the Formentor consist of Comfort, Sport, Cupra and Inidual, with each mode bringing a greater degree of aggression and engine noise that gets pumped through the cars speakers.Cabin space in the Formentor is excellent, with adults over six foot tall still able to sit comfortably in the rear seats. You could even sit three abreast thanks to the shallow transmission tunnel. The use of quality materials, with a grainy metal finish in the middle of the fascia, makes the cabin of the Formentor a pleasant and comfortable place to be, while bronze Cupra highlights on the air vents add a sense of occasion to every journey. The boot capacity of -litres in the Formentor . TSI can be expanded by dropping the rear seatbacks, allowing for even greater practicality when called upon.The Formentor scored a full five star rating in its Euro NCAP crash test, thanks in part to standard safety systems such as lane-keep assist, forward collision warning, predictive cruise control and driver alert warning.The new Cupra Formentor offers a more exclusive, contemporary vision of sportiness, which is instilled into an exquisitely sleek and bold design.

Mega Draw excitement is building ahead of Friday night’s extra special EuroMillions promotional event which has a guaranteed jackpot of € million. Since the EuroMillions game launched in Ireland in , there have been  Irish EuroMillions jackpot winners. If tomorrow night’s staggering € million jackpot is won in Ireland, we could see a new Irish winner added to the roll call of jackpot wins. googletag.cmd.push The National Lottery has advised players dreaming of winning big in the th September draw to continue to follow public health guidelines andplaying in retail, to buy their tickets early to avoid queues which will inevitably build in the hours leading up to the cut-off for ticket sales at .pm on Friday evening. Meanwhile, the Lotto jackpot roll continues and is now set to hit an estimated € million. The current Lotto jackpot has been rolling for over three months since Wednesday th June. So far this year, there have been five Lotto jackpot wins by players in Limerick, Kilkenny, Westmeath, Cork and Galway. In the history of the Lotto game in Ireland, only one jackpot in excess of € million has ever been won which was in June  when the Dan Morrissey syndicate from Carlow scooped a whooping €,,. A single winner of Saturday night’s le-changing € millionjackpot would find themselves at number two on the list of all-time highest wins since the game launched in Ireland in .     A National Lottery spokesperson said:“What a weekend we have ahead of us! We could potentially see two hugely le-altering amounts being won by National Lottery players in Ireland. Tomorrow night’s Mega Draw EuroMillions event with a guaranteed € million jackpot is creating incredible excitement amongst our players. If a player in Ireland scoops this astonishing amount, it would bring to , the number of Irish EuroMillions jackpot winners since the game launched in Ireland in . And of course, there is a huge buzz around this weekend’s Lotto draw with the jackpot heading towards an estimated € million, the spokersperon said. The current Lotto jackpot has been on an unprecedented roll without a winner since June and is now edging very close to reaching the current jackpot cap. The Lotto jackpot is currently capped at €. million and this represents the record breaking Lotto jackpot win by the Dan Morrissey syndicate in Carlow in June . Once the jackpot exceeds the cap, no more money will be added to the jackpot prize until it is won. The funds that would normally go to the jackpot will be distributed to the next lower prize tier at which there are winners. If the jackpot is won at an amount higher than €. million, that amount will become the game’s new jackpot cap. “With two incredible jackpots in both EuroMillions and Lotto just a day apart, we are encouraging players to purchase their tickets early as we expect there to be a big uptake in sales ahead of the draw times. We are reminding players that the cut-off time for sales for EuroMillions tickets is at .pm on Friday evening while the cut-off time for sales for Lotto tickets is at .pm on Saturday evening. Tickets can be purchased in-store, on the National Lottery app or atwww.lottery.ie, the spokesperson said.ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"--ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\".detachTo.detachTo   --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare  sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Down Memory Lane: Derrys Millennium Forum - ‘A place of hope’  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at River Inn, Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at River Inn, Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derry Death Notices - Friday, th September,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Dr Anne McCloskey featured in a nine-minute video where she said that many people have been ldquocoerced, bribed or bullied into being vaccinated against Covid- and that vaccines were ldquomalevolentDerry doctor Anne McCluskey suspended from practicing medicine after Covid claims overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Altnagevlin Hospital to move to -- visiting system overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derry Death Notices - Saturday, th September,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Kevin lsquoCrackrsquo McKeever is still well remembered by Derry City fans.

Mega Draw excitement is building ahead of Friday night’s extra special EuroMillions promotional event which has a guaranteed jackpot of € million. Since the EuroMillions game launched in Ireland in , there have been  Irish EuroMillions jackpot winners. If tomorrow night’s staggering € million jackpot is won in Ireland, we could see a new Irish winner added to the roll call of jackpot wins. googletag.cmd.push The National Lottery has advised players dreaming of winning big in the th September draw to continue to follow public health guidelines andplaying in retail, to buy their tickets early to avoid queues which will inevitably build in the hours leading up to the cut-off for ticket sales at .pm on Friday evening. Meanwhile, the Lotto jackpot roll continues and is now set to hit an estimated € million. The current Lotto jackpot has been rolling for over three months since Wednesday th June. So far this year, there have been five Lotto jackpot wins by players in Limerick, Kilkenny, Westmeath, Cork and Galway. In the history of the Lotto game in Ireland, only one jackpot in excess of € million has ever been won which was in June  when the Dan Morrissey syndicate from Carlow scooped a whooping €,,. A single winner of Saturday night’s le-changing € millionjackpot would find themselves at number two on the list of all-time highest wins since the game launched in Ireland in .     A National Lottery spokesperson said:“What a weekend we have ahead of us! We could potentially see two hugely le-altering amounts being won by National Lottery players in Ireland. Tomorrow night’s Mega Draw EuroMillions event with a guaranteed € million jackpot is creating incredible excitement amongst our players. If a player in Ireland scoops this astonishing amount, it would bring to , the number of Irish EuroMillions jackpot winners since the game launched in Ireland in . And of course, there is a huge buzz around this weekend’s Lotto draw with the jackpot heading towards an estimated € million, the spokersperon said. The current Lotto jackpot has been on an unprecedented roll without a winner since June and is now edging very close to reaching the current jackpot cap. The Lotto jackpot is currently capped at €. million and this represents the record breaking Lotto jackpot win by the Dan Morrissey syndicate in Carlow in June . Once the jackpot exceeds the cap, no more money will be added to the jackpot prize until it is won. The funds that would normally go to the jackpot will be distributed to the next lower prize tier at which there are winners. If the jackpot is won at an amount higher than €. million, that amount will become the game’s new jackpot cap. “With two incredible jackpots in both EuroMillions and Lotto just a day apart, we are encouraging players to purchase their tickets early as we expect there to be a big uptake in sales ahead of the draw times. We are reminding players that the cut-off time for sales for EuroMillions tickets is at .pm on Friday evening while the cut-off time for sales for Lotto tickets is at .pm on Saturday evening. Tickets can be purchased in-store, on the National Lottery app or atwww.lottery.ie, the spokesperson said.ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"--ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\".detachTo.detachTo   --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare  sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Down Memory Lane: Derrys Millennium Forum - ‘A place of hope’  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at River Inn, Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at River Inn, Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derry Death Notices - Friday, th September,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Dr Anne McCloskey featured in a nine-minute video where she said that many people have been ldquocoerced, bribed or bullied into being vaccinated against Covid- and that vaccines were ldquomalevolentDerry doctor Anne McCluskey suspended from practicing medicine after Covid claims overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Altnagevlin Hospital to move to -- visiting system overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derry Death Notices - Saturday, th September,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Kevin lsquoCrackrsquo McKeever is still well remembered by Derry City fans.

Reporter: Gary Ferry Sept   addthis, A player who never let his team mates down, Kevin ‘Crack’ McKeever remained well known and well thought of throughout the city long after he stopped wearing the red and white of Derry City. Long-term City fans have been remembering ‘Crack’ this week following his sudden death at just  years of age, remembering a player who played in numerous positions for his team, with never a complaint. googletag.cmd.push A lelong civil servant, Kevin also worked for many years in Derry Crown Buildings and had two spells with his home town club during his playing days. He was part of the team which played in the club’s first ever league game in the League of Ireland, against EMFA in  at Buckley Park in October , and he ed to the Brandywell in  for a much longer spell. He made  appearances for Derry City overall, scoring  goals, and he has remained a popular figure locally since. With Portadown, Kevin spent just over four and a half seasons at Shamrock Park, scoring  goals in  appearances. He made  appearances scoring  times during the clubs’ first title winning season in   and a further  appearances scoring twice in the   double winning season. A minute’s silence will be held at the Brandywell tomorrow night in memory of the midfielder, ahead of the game between Derry City and Longford. Peter Hutton, who played alongside ‘Crack’ for two years at Derry, still remembers his first encounter of a man Portadown fans called ‘Big Tree’. “He was a lovely big fella,” he said. “My first recollection of Big Crack was when I made my debut for Coleraine when I was  or  in the Bass Irish Cup semi-final. We played an unbelievable Portadown team and Crack was playing in the middle of the park with Roy McCreadie and boys like Joey Cunningham and Alfie Stewart and boys like that.     “They beat us - and I remember this boy in the middle of the park with the long hair. He asked me afterwards was I from Derry and only then did I realise that he was from Derry himself.” Hutton and ‘Crack’ eventually became team mates a few years later, and while he was never the star of the team, he was someone everyone could rely on when needed. “He would have dropped into defence or midfield or just play wherever he was asked,” Hutton recalls. “It was the same at Portadown as well. He was held in high regard up there by the supporters and the players who thought the word of him. It was exactly the same at Derry, he was versatile and he would have just gone in and done a job anywhere. “Week in and week out he would have given you a seven or right out of ten he would never have let you down anywhere he was asked to play. He would just have got on with it and was low maintenance for managers he wouldn’t have been a fella demanding to be playing or causing ructionshe wasn’t picked.” FAI Cup memories ‘Crack’ was left frustrated when it came to the FAI Cup during his time at Derry. He played in the  - loss to Sligo Rovers, and was then an unused substitute in the  success against Shelbourne. He was never allowed to forget that loss against Sligo by team mates who needed little excuse for a bit of fun. “He loved the craic and the banter and the camaraderie in the changing rooms,” Hutton recalled. “He played in the final where we were beaten by Sligo. We always slagged him because it seemed that any chance we had in that game fell to Crack and he obviously didn’t score because we were beaten -. He got dog’s abuse off the players for it, but it was just in jest. “Obviously he didn’t get blamed for it but he did get dog’s abuse from the boys in the changing room for the chances he did miss. He scored in the next game we played against Sligo after that and he just got more abuse because he couldn’t do that in the final. He was just a lovely big fella who loved his football and he was just a nice fella to be around.” Funeral arrangements Kevin’s funeral will take place from his home,  Templegrove, tomorrowat .am to Holy Family Church, Ballymagroarty for Requiem Mass at .am. Interment afterwards in the City Cemetery.ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"--ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\".detachTo.detachTo   --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare  sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Down Memory Lane: Derrys Millennium Forum - ‘A place of hope’  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at River Inn, Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at River Inn, Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derry Death Notices - Friday, th September,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Dr Anne McCloskey featured in a nine-minute video where she said that many people have been ldquocoerced, bribed or bullied into being vaccinated against Covid- and that vaccines were ldquomalevolentDerry doctor Anne McCluskey suspended from practicing medicine after Covid claims overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Altnagevlin Hospital to move to -- visiting system overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derry Death Notices - Saturday, th September,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Kevin lsquoCrackrsquo McKeever is still well remembered by Derry City fans.

Reporter: Gary Ferry Sept   addthis, A player who never let his team mates down, Kevin ‘Crack’ McKeever remained well known and well thought of throughout the city long after he stopped wearing the red and white of Derry City. Long-term City fans have been remembering ‘Crack’ this week following his sudden death at just  years of age, remembering a player who played in numerous positions for his team, with never a complaint. googletag.cmd.push A lelong civil servant, Kevin also worked for many years in Derry Crown Buildings and had two spells with his home town club during his playing days. He was part of the team which played in the club’s first ever league game in the League of Ireland, against EMFA in  at Buckley Park in October , and he ed to the Brandywell in  for a much longer spell. He made  appearances for Derry City overall, scoring  goals, and he has remained a popular figure locally since. With Portadown, Kevin spent just over four and a half seasons at Shamrock Park, scoring  goals in  appearances. He made  appearances scoring  times during the clubs’ first title winning season in   and a further  appearances scoring twice in the   double winning season. A minute’s silence will be held at the Brandywell tomorrow night in memory of the midfielder, ahead of the game between Derry City and Longford. Peter Hutton, who played alongside ‘Crack’ for two years at Derry, still remembers his first encounter of a man Portadown fans called ‘Big Tree’. “He was a lovely big fella,” he said. “My first recollection of Big Crack was when I made my debut for Coleraine when I was  or  in the Bass Irish Cup semi-final. We played an unbelievable Portadown team and Crack was playing in the middle of the park with Roy McCreadie and boys like Joey Cunningham and Alfie Stewart and boys like that.     “They beat us - and I remember this boy in the middle of the park with the long hair. He asked me afterwards was I from Derry and only then did I realise that he was from Derry himself.” Hutton and ‘Crack’ eventually became team mates a few years later, and while he was never the star of the team, he was someone everyone could rely on when needed. “He would have dropped into defence or midfield or just play wherever he was asked,” Hutton recalls. “It was the same at Portadown as well. He was held in high regard up there by the supporters and the players who thought the word of him. It was exactly the same at Derry, he was versatile and he would have just gone in and done a job anywhere. “Week in and week out he would have given you a seven or right out of ten he would never have let you down anywhere he was asked to play. He would just have got on with it and was low maintenance for managers he wouldn’t have been a fella demanding to be playing or causing ructionshe wasn’t picked.” FAI Cup memories ‘Crack’ was left frustrated when it came to the FAI Cup during his time at Derry. He played in the  - loss to Sligo Rovers, and was then an unused substitute in the  success against Shelbourne. He was never allowed to forget that loss against Sligo by team mates who needed little excuse for a bit of fun. “He loved the craic and the banter and the camaraderie in the changing rooms,” Hutton recalled. “He played in the final where we were beaten by Sligo. We always slagged him because it seemed that any chance we had in that game fell to Crack and he obviously didn’t score because we were beaten -. He got dog’s abuse off the players for it, but it was just in jest. “Obviously he didn’t get blamed for it but he did get dog’s abuse from the boys in the changing room for the chances he did miss. He scored in the next game we played against Sligo after that and he just got more abuse because he couldn’t do that in the final. He was just a lovely big fella who loved his football and he was just a nice fella to be around.” Funeral arrangements Kevin’s funeral will take place from his home,  Templegrove, tomorrowat .am to Holy Family Church, Ballymagroarty for Requiem Mass at .am. Interment afterwards in the City Cemetery.ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"--ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\".detachTo.detachTo   --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare  sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Down Memory Lane: Derrys Millennium Forum - ‘A place of hope’  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at River Inn, Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at River Inn, Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derry Death Notices - Friday, th September,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Dr Anne McCloskey featured in a nine-minute video where she said that many people have been ldquocoerced, bribed or bullied into being vaccinated against Covid- and that vaccines were ldquomalevolentDerry doctor Anne McCluskey suspended from practicing medicine after Covid claims overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Altnagevlin Hospital to move to -- visiting system overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derry Death Notices - Saturday, th September,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Kevin lsquoCrackrsquo McKeever is still well remembered by Derry City fans.

Pic by George Sweeney, nwpresspicsReporter: Gary Ferry Sept Email: gary@derrynews.net  addthis, Derry City  Longford Town  Goals from Jamie McGonigle, James Akintunde and Junior Ogedi-Uzokwe earned Derry City a comfortable win over Longford to move within three points of Sligo Rovers in third place. In a one-sided game, the Candystripes were too strong for the visitors. A fairly low-key start at the Brandywell ended when Derry City took the lead on  minutes. It was entirely preventable from a Longford point of view as Eoin Toal’s high ball forward was flicked on by Junior Ogedi-Uzokwe into the path of defender Joseph Manley. The centre-half hesitated however and Jamie McGonigle took advantage, charging the ball down and racing clear to finish past Lee Steacy for his second goal in a week. googletag.cmd.push It was all Derry City and they doubled their lead just before the half hour mark. This time McGonigle turned provider, as his ball in from the right picked out Will Fitzgerald in the area, and his touch set up James Akintunde, whose shot from  yards took a big deflection off a Longford leg to wrongfoot Steacy who could only watch as the ball rolled past him into the net. The Longford goalkeeper got his own slice of luck moments later as the Candystripes threatened to finish the game as a contest. Junior looked a touch ambitious when he lined up a free kick  yards from goal, but it was spilled by Steacy into the path of McGonigle, who would surely have made it - had an awkward bounce not taken the ball away from him at the crucial moment. The dynamic of a comfortable game almost changed just minutes into the second half when Darragh Nugent burst forward from midfield, into the area and around Nathan Gartside, but shanked his effort wide and over of the open goal.     That was as good as it got for Longford however, and Derry got their third goal nine minutes from time. Evan McLaughlin’s pass picked out the run of Danny Lafferty in behind the visitors’ defence, and although his volley was brilliantly parried by Steacy, the ball fell for Junior, whose shot into the ground bounced over the goalkeeper and into the net for -.

Pic by George Sweeney, nwpresspicsReporter: Gary Ferry Sept Email: gary@derrynews.net  addthis, Derry City  Longford Town  Goals from Jamie McGonigle, James Akintunde and Junior Ogedi-Uzokwe earned Derry City a comfortable win over Longford to move within three points of Sligo Rovers in third place. In a one-sided game, the Candystripes were too strong for the visitors. A fairly low-key start at the Brandywell ended when Derry City took the lead on  minutes. It was entirely preventable from a Longford point of view as Eoin Toal’s high ball forward was flicked on by Junior Ogedi-Uzokwe into the path of defender Joseph Manley. The centre-half hesitated however and Jamie McGonigle took advantage, charging the ball down and racing clear to finish past Lee Steacy for his second goal in a week. googletag.cmd.push It was all Derry City and they doubled their lead just before the half hour mark. This time McGonigle turned provider, as his ball in from the right picked out Will Fitzgerald in the area, and his touch set up James Akintunde, whose shot from  yards took a big deflection off a Longford leg to wrongfoot Steacy who could only watch as the ball rolled past him into the net. The Longford goalkeeper got his own slice of luck moments later as the Candystripes threatened to finish the game as a contest. Junior looked a touch ambitious when he lined up a free kick  yards from goal, but it was spilled by Steacy into the path of McGonigle, who would surely have made it - had an awkward bounce not taken the ball away from him at the crucial moment. The dynamic of a comfortable game almost changed just minutes into the second half when Darragh Nugent burst forward from midfield, into the area and around Nathan Gartside, but shanked his effort wide and over of the open goal.     That was as good as it got for Longford however, and Derry got their third goal nine minutes from time. Evan McLaughlin’s pass picked out the run of Danny Lafferty in behind the visitors’ defence, and although his volley was brilliantly parried by Steacy, the ball fell for Junior, whose shot into the ground bounced over the goalkeeper and into the net for -.

See post punk would’ve done Adam, Art-Rock  googletag.cmd.push They released their debut album in  and their new one Peter Gabriel is out this week. Oh, and Gavin and Rio are now James Cunningham and Tom Doherty. James is a kopite so we won’t be talking to him, but I did ask Tomwhat he thought ofInvaderband’s first album  “Excellent that was why I decided to join up.” Do you think youll ever be able to play in a band with a bass player that enjoys football  “It’s good to have a bit of banter with him especially when we beat ‘Pool at Anfield.” What was it like making a record during lockdown  “Strange more so with not being in studio for  years.” Apart from the Nerve Centre online gig, how much do you want to get out and play live  “Can’t wait for album launch on  October first live gig with Jamsie in band”. They’re playing Bennigans on October th and you should head down.     I suppose the most important question and the one on everybody’s lips isare you a better drummer than others because you support Everton  “Obviously.” I recently asked Adam he feltInvaderband have improved since bringing an Everton fan in to play drums  “I do, yes. Tom is a brilliant drummer and he’s really enjoying it which has kind of reinvigorated the rest of us. Re: Everton. I asked him about this, and he said something about toffees. I’ve no idea. Football is for morons.” About his writing songs for a while,do you have a pile from the s you can just use, or do you still write away  “Yeah, I don’t need to write anymore because I have such an archive of ones from the s. That’s why they’re so good.“ The Beatles were recording I Want You ’ the day I was born, so it’s in my Northern English blood.” It’s almost like he’s lording it over us that the English colonised Ireland back when Adam was young, but while we’re on the subjecthow awful were the Beatles  “Only a moron would ask that question.” I know what you’re thinking, does Adam know what the word moron means  Probably not but as we’respeaking of terrible,you really like the Darkness  “The word you’re looking for is love. The Darkness are easily the most exciting band on Earth. No-one  comes close”. At this point I expect loads of people to have fired the paper in the bin, but I can’t stress strongly enough that this is not what we should judge Adam on.” We once enjoyed a fizzy pop at the Northern Ireland Music Prize in  when both Invaderband and Our Krypton Son were up for album of the year. It’s become a total nonsense but Invaderbands single I Wont Remember You is up for Best Single at this year’s NI Music Prize!  Invaderband drummer Tom Doherty  And they’re thankful for the recognition and have posted “please” vote for us here:shorturl.at ajzDLMany thanks!#nimpon their socials, which isn’t as cringeworthy as saying nothing and giving the impression that you’re entitled to it. Adam claims to be a Pavement fan and put me to the test and asked what my favourite song is…Stereo, for those that are interested… anyway he ridiculed me for not picking a more obscure one. At least I think that’s what he was doing but coming from a Beatles fan the point was lost, after all this is a man who once said Joy Division were hopeless. New Order even worse. I know, I know, but seriously, give Invaderband a chance, they’re very very good, check them out atinvaderbandand Facebook.

Any chemistry student is automatically tutored in such hazards, the campaignersrsquo letter continues.ldquoThis is not a new subject and CIL , had it been so worried about it, should have acted decades ago on the mercury issue. Your concerns now ring hollow and you are using the issue to pursue your own interests in the modernisation of lighthouses.Campaigners have asked CIL to provide evidence of what training was given to lighthouse keepers in mercury usage and what so-called Material Safety Data Sheets on mercury were and are supplied to lighthouses in its jurisdiction.They say they are not impressed with CILrsquos progress when it comes to environmental heritage matters, pointing to the many changes which have taken place at St Johnrsquos Point over the years, including a reduction in use of the borm Fresnel lens to single lens and the removal of the original mechanics that powered the rotating lens.Other changes highlighted by campaigners included the abolition of keepers and attendants and the planned reduction in maintenance of the Killough stationrsquos walls and outbuildings.The letter continues: ldquoWhilst several of these changes may be understandable, you go too far with the removal of the heritage rotation system and in the employment of LED as the light source. You must surely be aware of thegrowing concerns in the environmental community worldwide about LED lighting.ldquoThe Lecale Lightkeepers will further resist your plans for St Johnrsquos Point, but we urge you to take note of the facts and of the strong local opposition to your plan.Campaigners say they are prepared to cooperate with CIL and others in developing suitable preservation plans for the historic lighthouse, including the engine room, while the organisation maintain itrsquo important role as an Aid to Navigation.Their letter adds: ldquoKeeping the existing lens rotation system and a health and safety review of your LED plans are, however, prerequisites to our cooperation..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/22September2021-GoDigital.jpg","title":"Downe U3A members enjoy fun day out  ","story":"MEMBERS of Downe UA had a marvellous and unusual day out at Crawfordrsquos Rock, near Kilkeel, recently.Local businesswoman Michelle Wilson took them, armed with collecting bags, on a foraging trip along the shore.She pointed out the dferent types of seaweed, telling which of them are best for cooking, which are ingredients of skin care products and which she recommended for a healthy seaweed bath.With their collected seaweeds the group then retreated to a gazebo on the shore where they were served up some shlauch mdash or shlucht mdash seaweed with seaweed bread and cod roe.This was followed by many courses of local produce, langoustines, mussels, crab toes, haddock landed fresh in Kilkeel that morning, then steak, potatoes, seaweed and chilli chocolate, ending with Crawfords Rock Seaweed Companyrsquos award-winning peppermint and kombu tea.The group agreed that it had been a day to remember.

legal and financial reasons, developing the facility at this location was simply not a viable option.If the council forged ahead with the plan for Dunleath Park, it would have to pay compensation to Dunleath Estates, based on the current commercial value of the land required to house the new cinema and associated parking.Alternatively,the existing lease is amended to allow the construction of the cinema, around one third of the income would have to be paid to Dunleath Estates with the remainder of the cash used specically for the playing fields, in keeping with stipulations laid down by the

now has no idea what the future hold and fears what may happen when winter sets in and he has no help to light his fire in the morning.Local community worker Billy Walker, who is fighting the decision to remove Mr Heaneyrsquos home help assistance, said the pensioner cannot believe he has been singled out for such unfair treatment.The community worker said he understand the Down Lisburn Trust is strapped for cash to provide a number of community care services, including those aimed at specically helping elderly people.STRANGFORD mdash Pensioners have finally been granted free travel across Strangford Lough following a drawn out campaign by local politicians.Regional Development Minister Gregory Campbell announced the decision to include the Strangford to Portaferry crossing in the free

Championship campaign with an impressive win over last yearrsquos runners-up Carryduff on a sun-drenched Saturday evening.Despite being considered slight underdogs before the contest, the green and white outfit proved they were anything but as they found the back of the net three times in the opening half.Goals from Oran Cunninghamand captain Conor McGrady put the Hoops too far in front at the interval, with the Carryduff men left frustrated at their missed chances.There was a notable turnout at the Darragh Cross venue, with waves of supporters from both sides allowing their voices to be heard throughout the duration of the match.Despite Carryduff winning the throw-in, it was Downpatrick who opened the scoring through a Jarlath Brannigan free after three minutes had been played.Brannigan doubled his tally just two minutes later in what was a determined start from the Hoops.However, this would be no stroll in the park as Josh Connery dummied his marker to send Carryduffrsquos first effort over the bar after some silky work from team-mate Owen McCabe.Downpatrick goalkeeper and joint captain James Deeny displayed pin-point accuracy with his kick-outs countless times throughout the match but perhaps needed the opening minutes to settle any nerves.A wayward punt upfield was gobbled up by Carryduffrsquos Pearse McCabe who relayed the ball quickly to Cian Clinton to level the scores.Caolan Mooney made his presence known with his usual rapid pace and precision. The former Rostrevor and current county player drew a foul before Conor McCarron calmly converted to put Downpatrick back in front.It was Carryduffrsquos turn to showcase their county talent as Daniel Guinness again levelled the tie with an emphatic point before captain Joe McFlynn swung the match back in their favour.However, with a minute to go to the first water-break Downpatrick got the reward for their relentless work in the middle of the park.McGrady and Mooney swarmed the Carryduff midfield with a barrage of tackles before some quick passing allowed the ball to enter into the hands of Downpatrickrsquos young forward Oran Cunningham.The Downpatrick number  made no mistake in blasting his effort past opposing lsquokeeper Mark Hynes to give his side a two-point lead.This advantage didnrsquot last until the quarter as Carryduff replied with two well-taken scores to bring the contest even.A few wides from both sides were observed after the water-break before Conor Doherty curled his left-footed free in-between the posts for Downpatrick.With  minutes played on the clock it was Cunningham again who would prove the major dference after his long-ranged effort looped over the head of Hynes and into the back of the net to double his tally.Hynes could be excused for this as Cunninghamrsquos effort struck most around the pitch as a cross rather than an attempt at goal.Nevertheless, Carryduff kept plugging away and answered with a James Guinness point.Conor McGrady saw his effort at goal crowded out by the determined opposing defenders before Gerdie Collins saw his effort drt over the bar to restore Downpatrickrsquos four-point lead.Mooney pointed again for the Hoops before McGrady added his sidersquos third goal of the half after the green and white forward line took advantage of a defensive mix-up.Daniel Guinness tried to rally his team as best as he could, soloing past three RGU shirts before registering the final point of the half. Half-time: Downpatrick - Carryduff -.Whatever the management team of Paddy Doherty, Shane OrsquoNeill and DJ Morgan told their Carryduff side during the interval must have struck a chord as they started the second half with clear intent.Despite a James Guinness wide, points from McCabe and McFlynn chipped away at the deficit for the purple, gold and black side.Cunningham was unlucky not to hit a hat-trick of goals after his lobbed effort was fantastically cleared of the line by Daniel Coogan.RGU followed this up with two efforts which both veered wide, before McFlynn again pointed for Carryduff leaving the score - to - in favour of the Downpatrick side at the second water-break.It was clear that legs were beginning to tire in the final quarter after a gruelling physical showing from both teams meant more and more chances went begging.Downpatrick finally registered their first point of the second half through another Doherty free.Carryduff refused to go quietly and were given added encouragement when RGUrsquos Tim Prenter was shown a black card with five minutes remaining.However, the frustration continued for both Carryduff and James Guinness as his effort veered wide of the target again.Deeny was rewarded for keeping his concentration after making an impressive save with his feet to deny Carryduff a certain goal in the dying moments of the game, although he could do nothing about the converted free a minute later.Mooney fisted over the bar in the next run of play for Downpatrick before Carryduff substitute Joe Tunney completed the scoring in the last passage of play.After the match, Downpatrick manager Aidan Robinson reflected on his sidersquos winning performance.ldquoIn the first half we worked incredibly hard, we turned the ball over a lot at the halfway line which we got a lot of scores from and we managed to get the goals, he said.ldquoWe built a good  for ourselves and spoke at half-time about kicking on from that, but we didnrsquot really manage to.ldquoI think in the third quarter of the game we were pretty flat and Carryduff got back into the tie, but we got over the line and we will learn from that.He added: ldquoIrsquom very happy with the result and very happy to be in the next round.Downpatrick: J Deeny, E Rooney, A Doherty, R Murphy, T Smyth, J Bell, C Doherty, D Turley, C McCarron, T Prenter, G Collins, C McGrady, J Brannigan, P Turley, C Mooney.Subs: A Og Robinson, M Fitzpatrick, O Cunningham, S Bell, T Loudon, T McNeill, N Cunningham, D Brannf, T Savage, C Boyd, R Og Quinn, C Farrell, R Quinn.Carryduff: M Hynes, D Coogan, C Cassidy, C McCullagh, L Toal, J Connery, D Guinness, B Cox, P McCabe, O McCabe, J McFlynn, C Clinton, S McGonigle, R Beatty, J Guinness.Subs: T Connery, M McGrath, P McConnell, C Sherry, R Reilly, C Cunningham, R Boyle, J Tunney, M Lawson, C Rooney, J Henry, D Connelly, D Connor.Downpatrick -Carryduff -MORGAN FUELS SFC ST ROUND.prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/22September2021-Joanne.jpg","title":"Joanne organising event to thank Air Ambulance staff  ","story":"A LOCAL show jumper is organising a fund-raising campaign as her way of saying thank you to the Air Ambulance.Joanne Clough was airlted to hospital after suffering a serious head injury. A year on, she has launched the lsquoHorse Powered Take Offrsquo campaign and competition to raise vital funds for Air Ambulance NI.On September  last year Joanne was competing in a show jumping competition at Ardnacashel Equestrian Centre near Comber, when a serious accident meant she needed urgent medical care.Joanne was warming up on her horse, Juno, when the horse seemed to become spooked and jolted, then began bucking uncontrollably, throwing her from the saddle. As she fell to the ground, Joanne hit her head on a brick wall.Joanne, who lives near Crossgar, said: ldquoI have no memory of the event and apparently lost consciousness. Having spoken to others, I know that the show at Ardnacashel was then stopped, and the organisers along with first aiders on site came to my side and called for an ambulance.ldquoEveryone was really supportive and helpful to ensure myself, my horse, my helper and my seven year-old daughter, Erin were looked after.The Air Ambulance carrying the Helicopter Emergency Medical Service Teamlanded in the fields beside Ardnacashel. The team treated Joanne at the scene before transferring her to the Royal Victoria Hospital, Belfast.Joanne remained in the hospital for the next  hours, having tests for potential brain injuries, which were even more pertinent as Joanne had undergone brain surgery to remove a tumour in August .Joanne sustained three fractures to her cheek, damaged the iris of her right eye, resulting in blurred vision, and lost her short-term memory for a couple of months due to severe concussion.It has been a long road to recovery, but now Joanne is starting to feel back to normal. She said: ldquoThe scars and fractures on my face have healed, along with the fatigue, weakness and confusion, but my balance remains something that I am continuing investigations for as my eyesight remains imperfect.ldquoMost importantly for a horsey girl, Juno has been treated for pre-existing injury in the sacroiliac joint in her back, which had caused her to react the way she did on the day. After a sincere apology from her, I am slowly gaining trust and confidence in her again in the saddle.Joanne continued: ldquoThere are no words to describe the gratitude I feel for the assistance of the Air Ambulance NI team and crew that day. Had they not acted so quickly, treated me with such level-headed efficiency and taken me to the hospital so swtly, I have no idea how I might have ended up.ldquoA head injury cannot be underestimated and to have been saved from potential disaster by the medical team in this way is a miraculous success. I owe them my everything and to demonstrate my gratitude, I am running a nationwide equestrian campaign and competition to raise awareness and funds for Air Ambulance NI.

Due to the restrictions in place, actors only metthey were in the same scene.Declanrsquos cousin, Aroacuten Holden from Downpatrick, was the editor for the film who helped piece each scene together. Aroacuten also introduced Declan to a number of others who assisted in creating the short, and therefore was referred to as ldquoan invaluable help by the young director.The short continues to enter numerous film festivals in the hopes of adding more honours, including ceremonies in England, Scotland and the USA.Meanwhile, Declan is currently directing a new featurefilm based in Belfast named lsquoThe Trick Roomrsquo, which entails the story of a cross-community cricket team.To keep up to date with the latest news surrounding Shine, visit @shine_shortfilm on Instagram or check out https:www.imdb title tt ..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/22September2021-Jockeys.jpg","title":"Locals among the prizes at Downpatrick meeting  ","story":"IT was a good day for local owners and trainers at Fridayrsquos penultimate meeting of the year at Downpatrick.They were successful in three of the seven races on the card, that featured four over hurdles, two chases and a bumper.

There is also the potential to add morethey are required.While three options have been drawn up, members of the local authorityrsquos Active and Healthy Communities Committee favour one that involves reconfiguring a meeting room and foyer into one large, open space with a new extension to the front to a  square metre multi-purpose room.In addition, two changing rooms are to be knocked into one with a  square metre kitchen area.A third changing room is to be converted to provide a so-called changing places toilet and there is also a store area for the meeting area.Asking the public for its view mdash which must be submitted online by Wednesday, September  mdash council officials say they recognise there is a need renovate the existing centre to meet current demands and services the community expects.In addition, Rowallane area councillors have highlighted concerns that currently, only one activity can take place at the centre at a time due to the current layout. They also recognise the need to offer additional space for extra activities.As part of the consultation process, residents are asked to complete a small online questionnaire, with all information used by the council to determine the best way forward.News of the proposal to upgrade the community centre comes after the local authority was asked to address its under investment in the market town and ensure that enhancing leisure facilities was a critical component of its future investment plans.Earlier this year, the need for ultra-modern leisure provision topped the agenda during an online meeting between local politicians and senior council officials who were asked to examine the potential of extending and upgrading the existing community centre at Windmill Street or a complete new-build, potentially on available land at the townrsquos Langley Road or at the Newcastle Road.Major new leisure provision has recently been provided across the council area, including Downpatrick, Saintfield and Newry, with plans in the pipeline for signicant investment in new leisure services in Newcastle.Politicians say that while Ballynahinch has missed out on major local authority investment over recent years, the organisation needs to address this now to cater for the needs of local people and sporting organisations.They argued that the current community centre needs major improvement or potentially replaced and that funding must be earmarked to allow this to happen.Politicians say itrsquos vital that Ballynahinch is a key part of any future council strategy when it comes to leisure activities.Several councillors believe the current Ballynahinch Centre requires signicant investment to meet the needs of local people and while many favour a new-build, they recognise that this is unlikely in the short to medium term.Moving forward, they say Ballynahinch cannot be left behind given that it has missed out on major funding for a signicant number of years and that ratepayers in the town and surrounding area deserve nothing less.The consultation closes at pm on Wednesday, September  and to take part, log on at https:tinyurl uejtmpc.

The show required proof of Covid double vaccines or other tests to gain entry but even so it could have adopted an even stricter approachThe Alliance MLA Sorcha Eastwood says in a tweet, quoted above, says she has loved it since her aunt took her when she was in P.My memory of Balmoral goes back even further, to when I was about three and my grandfather, James T Kernohan, worked at the King’s Hall for the Royal Ulster Agricultural Society .I was reminded of that yesterday as I walked through the major amusement park rides that they have now at the show.   \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues. Please try again later.Submitting...There was nothing like that when I was a child. It was enjoyable enough to clamber up the vast, then state-of-the-art, combine harvesters that they had on display.It was good to see Balmoral having expanded in such ways.It was grey and at points drizzly at Balmoral yesterday yet the atmosphere was happy — perhaps due to the yearning of people to be able to get back to such gatherings. I was struck by Balmoral’s Covid requirements: either proof of full vaccination, or proof of a recent negative NHS Lateral Flow test, or proof of antibodies from PCR test.These seemed to be to be responsible requirements for an event of many people in close proximity. Indeed they seemed to me to be a minimum, because proof of a negative Lateral Flow test on its own is not a strict requirement, due to the possibility of ‘ negatives’ .I agree with Colum Eastwood, SDLP leader, on vaccine passports.A curious feature of Covid is the bitterly ided way in which many people approach the topic.Hardcore anti lockdown believers morph into anti vaxxers.Zero Coviders want severe shutdowns and dismiss any attempt to assess the overall cost of that tactic.And both sides seem to be, at best, selective in use of statistics.For example, I have been since the beginning a mild lockdown sceptic. This was not because lockdown doesn’t work — it obviously doesyou deprive people of all human contact. My concern was whether coronavirus was worth such drastic measures. This is still not clear, because we still do not know the exact societal cost in loneliness, mental illness, impact on non Covid NHS treatments, impact on economies, ruined livelihoods, impaired education and so on.In particular the enduring inequality of it all. The way the public sector is untouched and politicians won’t even countenance, say, a % pay cut to non frontline public sector workers to help fund the devastated self employed.Or the inequality of much of the population living through confinement in houses with ample outdoor space, and others stuck in flats with no garden. These are among reasons we must avoid third lockdown. Yet hardcore lockdown supporters rarely seem to acknowledge these problems. They dismissed the importance of statistics that showed the massive age gradient to Covid, in particular the almost non existent risk to the under s. Yes, the Delta iant has somewhat changed that, and there is a worry with long Covid, but even so it is overwhelmingly fatal only for people who are already gravely ill or nearing end of le.But those of us who accept that reality should be embracing vaccine requirements, and yet many lockdown sceptics are anti such an approach, talking of freedom of choice rather than compulsion. But they should embrace compulsion, in order to ensure freedom of action and freedom of movement!The value of the vaccines is clear in Northern Ireland hospitals intensive care stats. Some % of people in ICUs are entirely unvaccinated, while only % of the adult population is without even one jab.Yet these statistics are turned on their head. It is said that % of people in ICU are double jabbed which proves they don’t work. In fact, given that % of adults in NI have had both doses, it shows you vaccinations slash risk of a severe response to Covid . I was slow to get double jabbed because, in my s, I felt at low risk and the vulnerable people I care about had already had both doses before I became eligible. I soon realised that I was not thinking hard enough about my possible role in spreading infections. I have had both jabs since summer, and think it is a fair bargain for society to open up extensively but give preferential access to people who have two doses.I understand the dismay of people who have loved ones in care homes, and who got their double doses so that they could safely visit, and yet are seeing that resident potentially cared for by staff who have not protected themselves against Covid in the way the relative has.This is all the more painful given how people were not able to see visit home residents for so long.It is a tricky issue because there is already a shortage of care staff. Even so, England is right to move to compulsion for such carers in the coming weeks.• Ben Lowry: A sunny autumn day in Co Down banishes some of my equinox gloom• Ben Lowryis News Letter acting

But not long ago there was strong Eurosceptical sentiment south of the borderThe ‘It’ in question being his Holy Grail-like obsession to create a pan-European army.In the middle of last week the French President once more floated the idea of an EU-wide military force of around , personnel. This time around Macron’s recooked proposal was prompted by the sting of betrayal after the Australians reneged on a deal to buy French submarines opting instead to purchase American made subs. This switch by the Aussies was in large part due to Down Under joining a new military alliance in the Pacic alongside the United States and the UK.   \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues. Please try again later.Submitting...Henry McDonald is a formerand Observer Ireland correspondent and author of books including a biography of David Trimble and INLA: Deadly DivisionsIf Macron’s dream of an alternative European army ever does become reality there is one nation within the EU family of nations he definitely cannot rely on: the Republic of Ireland.The corner stone of Irish foreign policyis military neutrality. Ireland never joined Nato although it has a long and commendable record in sending its military around the world on UN peacekeeping duties. None the less the odds of the Irish Defence Forces providing recruits to a new pan EU army in the foreseeable future are remote.Amid all the gushing, uncritical public discourse in the Republic regarding all things EU these days it is worth remembering that not very long ago there was a powerful Eurosceptical sentiment south of the border. Twelve years ago, in the first referendum on the Lisbon Treaty Irish voters rejected the treaty by .% as opposed to .% who backed the drive towards greater EU integration.One of the principal reasons why Ireland initially voted No was over fears about threats to Irish neutrality and concern about conscription into a European army. Although it was debatableLisbon actually entailed any compulsion to join an EU military force the spectre of it was enough to chill a signicant segment of the Irish electorate.The Dublin government at the time sought to allay these fears but also make the Irish vote again in a second referendum, which was in itself a massive anti-democratic con trick. As someone who reported from the frontline of the later protests against EU imposed austerity measures on the Republic after the Celtic Tiger collapsed and the state headed towards national bankruptcy I often wonder what that second vote would have beenit had been held in the middle of the economic shock treatment being applied from Brussels, Frankfurt, Berlin and the IMF.During those days of protests in  and  I followed tens of thousands marching through Dublin demonstrating against the EU and European Central Bank’s austerity-imposed cuts on Irish public services. I can still hear the speeches from public commentators denouncing the bureaucrats in Brussels, Angela Merkel in Berlin and the bankers at the ECB in Frankfurt on s such as one outside the GPO in O’Connell Street. It’s funny to listen to some of these same voices now in the post-Brexit era lavishing their praise and support on the EU while engaging in some old-fashioned Brit-bashing.In Northern Ireland too there are lots of these voices articulating a misty eyed, sentimental longing to be back in the EU. Nationalists meanwhile are using the enticement of EUas an argument someone for a United Ireland wrapped inside a reunited Europe. As someone who didn’t actually vote for Brexit I am still perplexed over the suspension of critical faculties when it comes to what the EU does in practice as opposed to its rhetoric.Having reported  years ago during that Holy Week of negotiations leading to the Belfast Agreement I cannot recall and none of my colleagues from the time can either the letters E and U being mentioned. Aside from peripheral peace building projects and welcome structural funding, the EU was not a major player in the torturous discussions that eventually created the Good Friday Agreement. Their interference post Brexit in Northern Ireland’s politics and in particular the imposition of the Protocolhowever has the potential to unravel that settlement.For its own economic and strategic interests the EU has used Northern Ireland as a means to punish Britain for leaving the union. By doing so it has generated a widespread perception across the unionist community that the EU is now in league with one side in a ided society – Irish nationalism, north and south. Before Brexit the EU at least had a positive reputation for being neutral on the Northern Ireland question.Irish foreign policy neutrality will undoubtedly prevail evenPresident Macron ever gets his way and establishes his EU army. With the imposition of an Irish Sea Border and the refusal, at least so far, of Brussels to compromise on frontier checks including even medicines EU neutrality in Northern Ireland no longer exists. • Henry McDonald Sep : Row involving President Higgins confirms that those who want a tolerant Ireland are being marginalised• Ruth Dudley Edwards Sep : New NIO minister is a Gay Catholic Tory who will listen to unionist fears• Owen Polley Sep : Dublin would be horriedfaced with an all-Ireland state• Other articles by Henry McDonald below, beneath that information on how to subscribe to the News Letter:• Henry McDonald Sep : Journalists should shun this Dublin-funded study into how the media uses language• Henry McDonald Sep : The cross border policing pursuit plan has not been thought through• Henry McDonald Aug : INLA’s biggest propaganda coup since Wright murder• Henry McDonald Aug : Irish nationalists can’t rely on Biden, as Kabul shows——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

Please try again later.Submitting...Sir Jeffrey DonaldsonThe leaders of the Church of Ireland, Catholic, Presbyterian and Methodist churches said the service was to “explore the opportunity to deepen the work of reconciliation in a context of respectful dialogue”.Presbyterian Church Moderator Dr David Bruce told the BBC that church leaders had not received communication from Mr Higgins when they sent the invite.He added: “We are not saying that Michael D Higgins, the president, did not raise these issues. We are saying that he didn’t raise them with us.”Sir Jeffrey said the church leaders’ statement showed that there was “no known diplomatic attempt” to alter anything about the event.He added: “The rejection of this event by the Irish head of state signals to unionists that the presidential office does not respect Northern Ireland as an entity and has little or no interest in a shared future with unionism.“Such a stance demonstrates how far the office under Michael D Higgins has drted from the shared future principles it once espoused. This disrespect for the existence of Northern Ireland indicates that Michael D Higgins’ office is really a united Ireland champion rather than a leader of reconciliation.”The DUP leader continued: “This saga has been a sad reflection on many years of outreach by unionists like me and others. I have travelled theand breadth of the island showing respect and explaining unionism.“I have stood in gardens of remembrance with my head bowed to show respect for people who were opponents of the Union. But I recognised that to take those steps was important to heal ision.“Rather than reciprocate on this occasion, Michael D Higgins has not only devalued and undermined such steps, but he has set back north-south relations to the detriment of the office which he holds.”Last week Mr Higgins said his decision to decline the invitation to the service had come after six months of consideration.He said: “That’s the beginning, so it isn’t a sudden decision, the decision is the outcome of a consideration.”He also challenged the DUP criticism of his decision.“It’s a bit much, to be frank with you. I have gone up to Northern Ireland to take part in events,” he said.“There often has not been a great deal of traffic down from the DUP people who are criticising me now.”More from the News Letter: Click here: Devout Christian and ex-DUP councillor Alan Graham says he was “haunted” Rihanna’s ‘We Found Love’ as he recalls shoot  years on Click here: DUP minister - We must urgently let more immigrants come to work in Ulster’s food industry Click here: ‘British scum’: BBC Nolan caller from Belfast explodes at former top Tory over Universal Credit Click here: Both praise and scorn as DUP minister Michelle McIlveen caught in ‘gender neutral tampons for schools’ quandary Click here: DUP minister launches scheme for ‘pupils who menstruate’ – avoiding any mention of females Click here: Top Orangeman: Michael D Higgins is an irrelevant foreign head-of-state Click here: Investigation of dissident republican-linked charity still unfinished three years onA message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

Firstly, a permanent resident within the property needs to be in receipt of one of the following benefits, such as:Armed Forces Independence PaymentAttendance AllowanceCarerrsquos AllowanceChild BenefitConstant Attendance AllowanceDisability Living AllowancePension Guarantee CreditIncome-related Employment and Support Allowance Income-based Jobseekerrsquos Allowance Income SupportIndustrial Injuries Disablement BenefitMobility SupplementPersonal Independence PaymentSevere Disablement AllowanceTax Credits Universal CreditWhat is EC  Funding The Energy Company Obligation or ECO is the name given to the UK Governments programme to make houses more energy efficient on a nationwide basis.The current ECO scheme, ECO, is scheduled to run until  March  and is focused exclusively on lower-income households, a wide range of benefit recipients qualy for improvements in their homes energy efficiency, with measures including new heating systems and boiler upgrades, external insulation, internal insulation and loft insulation as well as double glazing and more.What does the process involve First, fill in the Grant Eligibility Survey to seeyou qualy for the free boiler. Providing you are eligible, the team at First Choice Energy Ltd will speak to you on the phone and then come out and survey your home. This will include things like measuring your floor space, checking the thermostats on your radiators, identying the brand and model of your current gas boiler and asking some general questions regarding your property. A survey generally takes no longer than an hour.When itrsquos time to install a new boiler, your previous boiler will be replaced with a new gas-fired condensing boiler and the floor insulation will be fitted by a carpenter. Although the process sounds messy and time-consuming, on average it takes no longer than a day. And of course, the cost to install the boiler and install the floor insulation is covered by the grant.Will I need to pay any contributions Householders that are eligible for free boiler grants have no obligation to pay back any installments. Plus there are no terms and conditions to be met other than the basic qualying criteria.Why do I need a new boiler Your boiler may be on its way out, or not working properly, so now is the time to act. With energy bills more expensive than ever, your boiler needs to be heating your home for the lowest possible cost. A boiler installed around  years ago will most likely be around -% efficient. So, by upgrading this old boiler to a new one, the carbon savings will be signicant enough to warrant the cost and therefore will qualy under the free boiler scheme.Boilers installed in the UK are required to be condensing boilers. These are far more efficient than traditional boilers as they release gas at just  degrees Celsius , therefore requiring less energy to generate the same amount of heat.What happensI am not eligible The team at First Choice Energy may be able to help you with other grant schemes or offer advice and guidance on how to help with any problems you could face.For more information visit First Choice Energy Ltd or email: Firstchoiceenergylimited@gmail article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log Brought to you byFIRST CHOICE ENERGY s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"Comments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

Only Grey seals occur regularly in Pembrokeshire, where they are present all year around.ldquoAbout half the worldrsquos population of Grey Seal breed on our coastline and the total number in West Wales, mostly Pembrokeshire, is estimated to be about ,, with some , pups being born each year.ldquoThe breeding season is vital for our seal colonies here in Pembrokeshire, and we ask that visitors do not access the Blue Lagoon and that they follow the guidelines laid out by the Seal Alliance and Pembrokeshire Marine Code when on the coastal path.Paul Renfro from the Pembrokeshire Coastal Forum said: ldquoThe Pembrokeshire Marine Code recommends remaining at least m away from the seals, though they can be disturbed at any distance so itrsquos important to be responsive to their behaviour.     ldquoIf a resting seal looks up or turns to looks at you then you are close enough at whatever distance you are at. Seals can be particularly sensitive to disturbance after periods of stormy weather and during the breeding season so we recommend giving them extra space at these times.How to avoid disturbing sealsTo avoid disturbing seals at this very important time of year, National Trust Cymru recommends adopting the following strategies:Sssh, stay quiet: Channel your inner David Attenborough and speak with a low voice and encourage your children to do the same. Noisy dogs can frighten seals soyour four-legged friend is a bit chatty, please leave them at home when you visit a seal breeding area.Donrsquot get too close: Ensure you stay at least  metres away from sealsand never come between a seal and her pup, or a seal and the sea. Doing so will cause distress to both the mother and pup.Keep dogs on a short lead: Keep your dog on a short lead. Do not allow them to run loose or play with balls, frisbees or sticks anywhere near a breeding colony as this will cause them distress.What to doyou see a seal in distressIf you spot a lone seal pup on a beach itrsquos probably not in distress. Seal pups are often left alone on the beach whilst its mum goes off to catch dinner.Never approach the seal. It will cause further distress and may be dangerous for you and the Seal.Look to see how many people there are about. In most cases when seals are in distress itrsquos due to contact with curious and well-meaning visitors.If you are still concerned, contact conservation group Welsh Marine Le Rescue   or   who will be able to offer you further guidance. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

She was loving mother of daughter Julie mother-in-law of Colin , and devoted nanny of Lily, , and Isla, seven. Tandragee-born Sally and Bessbrook man Billy lived at Knockview Drive, Tandragee and were married for  years.The funeral service was on Monday at Tandragee Presbyterian Church where more than  mourners gathered in the church and adjoining church hall to pay a final lasting tribute to Sally. The service was conducted by the minister the Rev Mark McMaw, assisted by the Rev Stephen Kennedy, minister of Buckna Presbyterian church, Broughshane, and nephew of Billy.Danny Kennedy, brother-in-law of Sally, paid a fulsome tribute to a woman, who, he said, was respected and loved in Tandragee and in the wider community.He said: “This tribute was, in large measure, composed by Billy himself and I do want to convey the deep emotions expressed in it. Sally and Billy were married  years and Billy has described her as ‘a highly principled woman’ with very sterling qualities and positive attitude to le.“Sally was the youngest daughter of three to Daniel and Elizabeth Berry, of Scarva Road, Tandragee. Her sisters Jean , Tandragee and Betty , Loughgall and their families featured strongly all through her le, to the very end. “Sally’s father sadly died at the age of  when Sally was just . After leaving school, she worked at Sinton’s mill before working at Tayto where she was a much-valued member of staff for  years, forming close friendships with colleagues that endured long after her retirement.“Sally and Billy met on the local dance scene in around . They both enjoyed dancing to the Irish showbands and Billy was attracted to Sally’s natural good looks, radiant smile, and always well-dressed appearance. They had good and happy times together tripping the light fantastic!“They got engaged in October , and were married on July , , in Ballymore parish church, Tandragee. Sally, from the Church of Ireland Billy a Presbyterian. It was a mixed marriage! Sally became a Presbyterian and was a communicant in the Tandragee congregation.“For a short time, they lived with Sally’s widowed mother at Scarva Road, before moving to Cornmarket Street where they resided until moving to the newly built development at Knockview Drive in . By then, they had a young daughter, Julie, who was just six months when they moved to Knockview. “The Kennedy’s of Knockview were a close family of three, with Julie very attached to her mum especially. Sally and Julie were soul mates, and the bond became closer when Julie, after her marriage to Colin Beattie, had two daughters Lily and Isla. Sally loved her grand-daughters they were her pride and joy and, in recent times, when they visited the care home to see their nanny after Sally’s stroke, her joyful reaction was obvious. The girls would sing and converse lovingly with their nanny.“Sally was intensely proud of her home it was her castle and she enjoyed making it a special place for her family. She was very supportive of Billy in his career as a journalist with the News Letter, working long hours as news editor in Belfast during years of the Troubles. Sally, as a loyal Tandragee lady also encouraged Billy in his role with the loyal orders in the Bessbrook area.“Even though she had little interest in sport, Sally was also supportive of Billy’s considerable football interests with Linfield Football Club, as a director for  years. But she could read Billy like a book and when Linfield lost, she would quickly ask when he arrived home occasionally looking disconsolate from Windsor Park - ’Well, did the Blues get bate today ’ “Sally had a dry wit and enjoyed a laugh. She also was very supportive of Billy’s frequent travels to the United States for several decades for research for  books he wrote on the Scots-Irish Ulster-Scots migration and settlements. Sally, indeed, was in America with Billy on the day of the   attacks in New York and Washington in . They were in Knoxville in East Tennessee with an Ulster-Scots group.“Sally enjoyed good food, best holidays and she liked to dress in fine clothes. Over their time together, many happy holidays were spent in Portrush, Bournemouth, Scotland, Spain, Italy , United States and Canada. The  Canada holiday was particularly enjoyable as they travelled over the Rocky Mountains by train from Calgary and Toronto to Vancouver. It was the holiday of a letime!. “Sally, like Billy, also loved American country music and enjoyed going to concerts in Belfast to hear the leading American singing stars. She was also a fan of Daniel O’Donnell, and, of course a big Elvis Presley fan.“Sally’s stroke on April , , was a harsh, le-changing blow to not only herself, but to Julie and Billy also. She lost her speech and was immobilised down the right side. Her time spent in hospital and in Rosemount care home in Portadown lasted two and a half years, but the medical and nursing staff there provided top quality care which complimented the love and devotion of her family. “She became an integral part of Rosemount, and the family is indebted to everyone there for their   work with a special lady, who was a model patient in challenging circumstances.”Danny added: “Most importantly, Sally was a woman of simple dedicated Christian faith who every night got down on her knees to pray to God, her Saviour and friend. Her values were of the highest standard. Sally will live on in our hearts and her memory will be cherished by all who knew and loved her as a devoted we, mother, mother-in-law, grandmother, sister and aunt, and friend to all those who came to know her. In Billy’s words - ‘Sally was a class act, loved and respected by everyone in her own family and wider community. “Sally loved her family her family loved her. We thank God for her le and His goodness to her. We believe that Sally, as a person of faith, the scripture verse from nd Corinthians, printed at the bottom of her death insertion is appropriate - “absent from the body, present with the Lord”.”Danny expressed thanks to the Rev Mark McMaw and the Rev Stephen Kennedy for conducting the service and the organist. Ryan Harris. Thanks were also offered to care home staff at Rosemount home for caring so well for Sally over the duration of her stay.

struggling to find new management for Portadown marketThree months after failing to attract any bidders, Armagh City, Banbridge and Craigavon Borough is set to re-release the tender for the management of Portadown town market.By The NewsroomFriday, th September , : amUpdated Friday, th September , : am  \"       \"  Following discussions of the matter at a meeting of Council’s economic development and regeneration committee on Tuesday, September  a Council spokesperson told the local democracyreporting service the tender will be advertised the week ending Friday, October .“The tender will be advertised until Friday, October  and Council would ideally like to have an operator in place by January , , subject to statutory approvals,” said a Council spokesperson.“Once the tender has been advertised, interested parties will be able to apply through theeTenders NI portal.”During the committeemeeting, members were provided with an update on the regeneration of Portadown town centre and the role a high quality local market will play in this.They were advised that following Council’s decision to bring its service level agreementwith the market’s former operator, Portadown , to an end, five expressions of interest were receivedfrom parties interested in operating and managing a market in the town.Following a public consultation a tender was advertised on Friday, May  and closed on Friday, June , no tenders were receivedas part of the procurement process.Since then, Council has been in ongoing consultation with traders in Portadown to reassure them of Council’s plans to locate the market in a section of the Magowan West car park.It is understood Council is keen to see the market operate two times a week with optional daytime or evening operational times.Commenting on the report, Councillor Lavelle McIlwrath askedCouncil had consulted with the former market’s traders.Council’s head of regeneration, Nicola Wilson said Council has had a “busy summer” talking to traders and businesses through its consultation hub but had not been involved in direct consultation with the previous market’s traders.“In relation to the consultation with the existing market traders, we have not done that as we did not think it was an appropriate thing to do,” said Ms Wilson.“They are looking for a covered market space and that is not something we are going to be able to provide for them.“We have spoken to a lot of the town’s traders and a lot of the traders along Woodhouse Street as well to clary what we really want.“We will soon be in a position to go out with a tender that is more precise and detailed, I think that was probably one of the stumbling blocks in our first attempt to get a market provider in.“We are looking for an appropriate organisation to come in and provide the market service and that agent will be the one that will be liaisingwith the markets traders to try to develop what they need within the offering they have.”Read this - Club rallies round after

These changes will bring all Western Trust Hospital sites back in line with the regional Department of Health visiting guidance for the first time since the beginning of the fourth COVID surge in mid-July. Commenting on the new guidance, Western Trust Executive director of Nursing, Primary Care and Older Peoples Services, Dr Bob Brown, said: “As a Trust we recognise the importance of visiting patients in Hospitals and that it can be a great support, particularly for older people. “We want to be able to facilitate safe, secure visiting in as controlled and risk managed a way as possible and for that reason, looking at the transmission rates and evaluating risk assessments from across all of our Hospitals, from Monday, September  we will implement consistent visiting arrangements in all Trust facilities for one visitor per patient for one hour, once a day. “Some exceptions will be made in special circumstances, for example, given the clinical vulnerability of the patient group, particularly in the haematology setting, visiting in the North West Cancer Centre will continue to be restricted to assessment on an inidual basis involving the patient, family and team.” It has also been announced that these conditions will also apply to both COVID and ICU wards, where in the interests of patient safety visitation will be by inidual negotiation with Ward Managers on a case by case basis. More frequent visiting in exceptional circumstances, such as at the end of le will continue to be permitted, as will visiting for birthing partners to maternity services, each in an inidually risk assessed way. Paediatric wardsin Altnagelvin and South West Acute Hospital will continue to permit a parent to be at the child’s bedside, again ensuring this is risk assessed and in a COVID- secure way. This position will be reviewed again on Friday, October . The Western Trust is also encouraging members of the public to complete lateral flow tests before visiting any of its premises to provide confidence to both visitors and staff that visitors are not COVID positive and to help the Trust maintain COVID safe environments for all. These visiting arrangements will remain under constant review and may change in response to any further increase in infection rates impacting on any particular department, eg an inability to retain a COVID- secure environment of care. The safety of patients and staff will always be to the forefront of any decision made, the Trust says. Patients have been reminded only to attend AE alone, where possible. Children and vulnerable adults can be accompanied by one person.\",\"keywords\":\"Western Trust,visiting,restrictions,--\",\"articleSection\":\"News\",\"publisher\":,\"image\":,\"description\":\"THE Western Trust has announced that all of its Hospital sites are to move to the same lsquo--rsquo visiting restrictions, , with effect from Monday, September  .\",\"author\":,\"dateCreated\":\"--T::Z\",\"dateModied\":\"--T::Z\",\"datePublished\":\"--T::Z\" cmspos   *** Handle jQuery plugin naming conflict between jQuery UI and Bootstrap *** .widget.bridge@-webkit-viewport @-moz-viewport@-ms-viewport @-o-viewport@viewport - Twitter, Inc.
