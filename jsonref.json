Later, the women and children were forced on trains to be taken to Auschwitz.Her family arrived together. But her two younger sisters, Rivka, ten, and eight-year-old Etta, and her toddler brother Ben-Zvi were too young to work so they were taken to the gas chamber immediately, along with their mother Shlima.Only Rachel and her brother Chaskiel, 16, were spared.

But a delay forced their SS guard to listen to their cries, as they called out: ‘Why can’t you help us?’ Mrs Levy said the female guard gestured for them to run away and she hid among kitchen workers. She and thousands of other inmates were later forced to walk for 21 days from Poland to the concentration camp Bergen-Belsen in Germany in the last months of the war – the so-called ‘Death March’.Once inside Belsen, she was met by unimaginable scenes of horror, as piles of bodies were left to rot. Her aunt died in the camp and Mrs Levy contracted typhoid.Liberation came in April 1945, when British soldiers arrived. Mrs Levy and her brother Chaskiel were reunited and came to Britain.Daughter Shelley, 56, said her mother still suffered nightmares after reliving her experiences but was delighted to learn she would be honoured for her work.BEMs were also awarded to Walter Kammerling, 95, Gabrielle Keenaghan, 92, Ernest Simon, 89, George Hans Vulkan, 89, and Ann and Bob Kirk, 90 and 94, who were all brought to Britain as children to escape Nazi-occupied Europe.

Small change, however, for a man who in 2001 invested £25 million in a small loss-making Chinese messaging service called Tencent. That stake is now worth more than £100 billion.         The Grade II-listed house’s Palladian façade of golden limestone was reckoned to be one of the prettiest in the country         Bekker’s concept is to make the estate as self-sustaining as possible — or, as one of his staff told me this week: ‘We want to give everyone the “full banquet”: to provide everything they need.’The ethos is to celebrate all things Somerset with gusto. The meats and cheeses come from neighbouring farms. So, too, the locally-quarried Blue Lias stone used in the garden.At the moment the beef sold in the farm shop comes from a handful of local suppliers. In time, the estate will rear its own cattle.Alongside the butcher is the cheese counter, where the same concept has been given an added twist. In order to provide home-grown mozzarella, The Newt has located a nearby herd of buffalo.Craftsmen are still at work on the main house, which is being turned into a hotel with 23 bedrooms, a spa, gym, bar and restaurants. It will open for business at the end of August.Much of the grounds, however, along with café, cider press and shop, have been opened. Locals have been invited to test everything from the quality of the food to the crisp dry ‘cyder’ being made in state-of-the-art cellars.The gardens, however, take centre stage and this week I was given a sneak preview. It is a mind-blowing experience — every sensation is tested: sight, taste, hearing, touch and smell.         Judging by the comments from fellow visitors, this remarkable attraction may soon rank alongside great British gardens such as Sissinghurst in Kent, Great Dixter near Rye, East Sussex, and Tresco Abbey in the Isles of Scilly         Craftsmen are still at work on the main house, which is being turned into a hotel with 23 bedrooms, a spa, gym, bar and restaurants. It will open for business at the end of AugustJudging by the comments from fellow visitors, this remarkable attraction may soon rank alongside great British gardens such as Sissinghurst in Kent, Great Dixter near Rye, East Sussex, and Tresco Abbey in the Isles of Scilly.Most likely its key rival will be the Lost Gardens of Heligan in Cornwall, restored in the Nineties after decades of neglect. Indeed, the Newt’s director of horticulture Iain Davies, who oversees 18 garden and woodland experts, was previously at Heligan.Unlike Heligan, however, the gardens here had not been abandoned for years. Horticultural writer enelope Hobhouse, who created the Queen Mother’s garden at Walmer Castle in Kent, established the centrepiece, a parabola-shaped walled garden, in the Sixties. But she left after her marriage to Sir Arthur’s son Paul broke down.Just as she had been inspired by the beauty of the winemaking region in her native South Africa, Karen Roos fell in love with the countryside of Somerset. The egg-shaped Parabola has been restored with discreet terracing and an extraordinary collection of trained apple trees, arranged in a maze.All the apple-growing counties of England are represented — so, too, are Wales, Scotland and Ireland. Some of the saplings are arranged into elaborate designs, one remarkably representing the double helix of DNA. They’re a masterclass in showing how, with the right expertise, you can train a fruit tree into any shape.A clue to the thinking behind this celebration lies in a Latin motto inscribed into the stone paving: ‘from the egg to the apple’ or from start to finish.         A hazelwood fence announces our arrival at the colour garden. This is a homage to the last horticulturalists to till the soil here, Canadians Nori and Sandra Pope, who spent 20 years restoring the gardens with swathes of colourful blooms         Yet for all its modern twists and new-build look, the estate still has the air of a lost paradise. In part it is because of the bucolic setting and also, perhaps, the clutch of chickens looking on hungrily as I sample a slice of freshly made cake — apple, naturallyThe phrase inspired the Bekkers and their team to create an historical timeline for the estate, with a garden shaped by ideas and traditions from past to present.‘The idea is to transport visitors,’ says my guide, garden director Arthur Cole. ‘There are so many things to look out for.’Entry to the estate is down an elegant, twisting boardwalk, from where you alight in the threshing barn, which looks hundreds of years old but is brand new.But then that is the conceit of the place. Just outside the café is an area shaded by 20 semi-mature London plane trees. Each was brought in by lorry nearly fully grown. Elsewhere, an entire yew hedge was shipped from Belgium.Step through the courtyard and there is a farm shop to the left and a shining steel cider press to the right, a contraption that would not look out of place in Charlie and the Chocolate Factory.Yet for all its modern twists and new-build look, the estate still has the air of a lost paradise. In part it is because of the bucolic setting and also, perhaps, the clutch of chickens looking on hungrily as I sample a slice of freshly made cake — apple, naturally.Leaving the Parabola you pass through beds of fragrant herbs. The path meanders through campions, wild pea, yarrow and cowslip. The Prince of Wales, who has done so much to champion gardens, would love it.‘The wildflowers provide food for our bees,’ says Arthur.Food for the guests, meanwhile, comes from the kitchen garden where there are rows of Iberian garlic and beds of asparagus. Arthur plucks a petal of a California poppy. ‘Try this, it’s edible,’ he says. Everything that’s grown is on the menu in the garden cafe.The watchword is ‘no-dig gardening’, to prevent the break-up of nitrates in the soil which happens when forks are plunged into the earth. Only gentle aerating of the ground is permitted.A hazelwood fence announces our arrival at the colour garden. This is a homage to the last horticulturalists to till the soil here, Canadians Nori and Sandra Pope, who spent 20 years restoring the gardens with swathes of colourful blooms.We enter via the red garden, where native poppies are broken up with bold strokes of purple provided by lobelias.Next stop is the water-edged Victorian Fragrance Garden — marked by a Queen Victoria penny coin set into the ground — where violets and roses jostle with rows of box.And here is the reason for the estate’s name. Sculptures of two giant newts are pushing their way through a brick end-wall.The estate is home to a colony of 2,000 newts — all three UK species: great crested, palmate and smooth. Many of the water features have strips of timber to provide ladders for the newts, whose presence as protected species resulted in delays to the project.Another coin heralds the next stop. It is a pre-World War I George V penny, and it marks a cottage garden inspired by the designer Gertrude Jekyll.The Newt is a sumptuous illustration of sensitivity in design. In the Parabola, unlike many a garden, there are no steps, so it can be reached in a wheelchair.Soon there will be educational tours and a garden museum is planned. There will also be one other unique feature: a dedicated Great Western Railway carriage for visitors travelling from London Paddington by train.One visit scarcely does it justice — I had no time for the woodland walks, nor to visit the marl pit created by digging out lime-rich deposits. It has left an island which the garden folk say evokes Avalon, the site of Camelot where King Arthur died, said to be somewhere in Somerset.It is an extraordinary hybrid: think the Daylesford farm shop crossed with a National Trust museum, with a slice of the Royal Horticultural Gardens at Wisley thrown in for good measure.What is perhaps even more remarkable is that, for all the attention to detail, the owners have bought the place not for themselves, but for the public. Some days the Bekkers can be seen pottering around the gardens in raincoat and straw hat just like their paying visitors."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a8cc1602dd33207e6ec8b8ed0f6f352fee663bd5/0_661_4200_2519/master/4200.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=24f93e33a67bcfa9b3fb4d8727a2cee7","title":"buy a classic guardian photograph golden eagle on the isle of mull april 2008","story":"This week in our  Print Shop series, photographer Murdo MacLeod captures the intensity of a golden eagle at a sanctuary A young, wild golden eagle on the Isle of Mull stares down Murdo Macleod.

Get your hiking boots onIt’s hard to think of another state so richly blessed in the beautiful scenery department, and California seriously rewards travellers who take on its hiking trails. With big-hitter national parks such as Yosemite, Kings Canyon and Sequoia, Joshua Tree and Death Valley all easily drivable from San Francisco, Los Angeles and San Diego, California is an ideal destination for those wanting to mix up a culture-crammed city break with awe-inspiring outdoor adventures.2. Eat the street at an iconic farmers’ marketCalifornia is deservedly proud of its fabulous fresh produce, with a farm-to-table dining scene that makes it the envy of the rest of the world. For Californians, the weekly farmers’ market has become a social institution akin to attending church, so plan to make a meal of visiting the Ferry Building Marketplace in San Francisco or San Luis Obispo’s friendly downtown market. San Diego in particular has made an art form of farmers’ markets, with countless neighbourhood markets popping up across town. If you’ve only got time to do one, make a Sunday pilgrimage to the LGBTQ-friendly, progressive neighbourhood of Hillcrest for their weekly 175-vendor market.3. Be put in your place by big treesSoaring coast redwoods (Sequoia sempervirens) lace the coastline from just south of Big Sur to the Oregon border and beyond. Humboldt Redwoods state park is where you’ll find some of the oldest and tallest, and it’s easily accessed off Highway 101.“Farmers’ markets are a great way to support responsible travelling,” says Flight Centre’s Brown. “It’s pretty easy to do in Cali, as it’s the largest agricultural producer in the US.”4. Sip Chardonnay by the seaCalifornian wine is popular around the planet, but it really does taste better when you’re staring out at the crashing waves of the Pacific. A favourite spot is the clifftop restaurant of Nepenthe in Big Sur, where you can choose from more than 400 local tipples.5. Go vintage shopping in Joshua TreeThe other-worldly landscape of Joshua Tree national park is the area’s main draw, but a cluster of quirky desert communities are well worth lingering in. Close neighbours Pioneertown, Joshua Tree and Yucca Valley are all worth a snoop, and keep a particular eye out for the excellent vintage shopping on offer. Local designers and makers are showcased at Shop on the Mesa, while Hoof \u0026amp the Horn does excellent vintage gear, and The Station is a great spot to linger over a latte after finding some retro treasure. Rise with the birds at the weekend to snaffle bargains at the Sky Village Swap Meet before the sun gets into its stride.6. Cycle the beach path from Santa Monica to VeniceSanta Monica and the neighbouring, more hipster, Venice are LA’s best-loved city beach communities. Grab a Breeze bike and cruise down the coast, past the kitsch pier amusements, skateboarders, beachfront bars and fitness fanatics working out at Muscle Beach.7. Take a taco tour of LAWhat Indian food is to Londoners, Mexican cuisine is to Angelenos. The best taco trucks are found in the traditionally Hiic neighbourhoods of Echo Park and Los Feliz, as well as downtown. Stalk cult taco trucks Guerrilla Tacos and Korean-infused Kogi BBQ on Instagram (@guerillatacos and @kogibbq) to gorge like a local.8. Immerse yourself in San Francisco’s colourful cultureFew cities can claim the cultural clout of San Francisco – synonymous, as it is, with beat poetry, jazz and alternative rock, the 1970s counterculture movement, and LGBTQ voices. For literature lovers, sipping a beer in the Vesuvio Cafe beloved by beat generation writers Jack Kerouac and Allen Ginsberg, as well as the likes of Bob Dylan and Dylan Thomas, will send a shiver down your spine. The famous City Lights bookstore is literally next door.“The murals of San Francisco are an Instagrammer’s dream,” says Brown. “The Mission district has the highest concentration of street art of any neighbourhood in the world.”9. Breakfast with the stars in MalibuLA’s Malibu Farm Pier Cafe at the end of the pier is one of the best positioned beach cafes on the planet. If you can tear your eyes away from the sea views, you’ll spot local celebrities sipping Vietnamese coffees and nibbling avocado on toast behind oversized sunglasses.10. Laze by the pool in Palm SpringsA playground for the rich and famous since the Brat Pack made it their home in the 1950s, Palm Springs is a must-visit for lovers of modernist architecture, poolside bars and luxury hotels.

Daphne du Maurier resented Rebecca until her dying day, and JK Rowling didn’t rebrand herself as Robert Galbraith for nothing. But when your name is Elizabeth Gilbert and that book is Eat, Pray, Love, the reactions are extreme utter adoration or visceral loathing, with little in between.In her third novel, it is spring 1940 and 19-year-old Vivian Morris has dropped out of her Ivy League college and been “banished” to a New York City in the midst of will-we-won’t-we-join-the-war indecision. But as Vivian puts it, “exile in New York is no exile at all”. The city is all glamour and excitement, with a hysterical edge familiar to readers in a contemporary world on the brink of global crisis.Sent to live at her bohemian Aunt Peg’s down-at-heel mid-town theatre, The Lily, Vivian falls headlong in lust with a colourful world that has little in common with her privileged Wasp upbringing.Worldly showgirl Celia Ray, streetwise leading man Anthony Roccella, grande dame Edna Parker Watson and her beautiful-but-dim actor husband Arthur, along with Hollywood wheeler-dealer Billy Buell, are like nothing and no one Vivian has ever encountered before. She’s not slow to cast off the moral and emotional shackles of her strait-laced, buttoned-down upbringing, embarking on a series of affairs and acquiring for herself a very different sort of education from the one that her parents would have deemed appropriate.If this all sounds like something straight out of vaudeville, it is. And intentionally so. This is a work of historical fiction, and Gilbert’s prose, while not immaculate, zings with the mood of the era. In fact, like Gilbert’s previous novel, A Signature of All Things, it’s so true to life in places – including real historical figures in the story – that it occasionally feels like pastiche.But Gilbert is nothing if not emotionally intuitive, and while City of Girls is unquestionably a sexy, glamorous romp, its similarities with vaudeville end there. The plot bristles with moral intent: Vivian’s fall, when it inevitably comes, is complete and damning and utterly gendered, its repercussions shadowing the rest of her life. Yet Gilbert wouldn’t be the woman she is – one who “spoke her truth” and left her husband to embark on a relationship with her female best friend, even as the friend was dying from pancreatic cancer – if she was to allow her female characters to be destroyed by society’s disapproval. And it’s at this point that the novel’s true heart is revealed.Gilbert has long since severed her bond with shame – and thank goodness. In other hands, this novel could have had all the adventure and enjoyment, but none of the depth instead she makes it into a glorious, multilayered, emotionally astute celebration of womanhood.It would be easy to dismiss City of Girls as joyous escapism, and God knows there’s little enough of that around right now. But look more closely and what you’ll see is an eloquently persuasive treatise on the judgment and punishment of women, and a heartfelt call to reclaim female sexual agency. “At some point in a woman’s life, she just gets tired of being ashamed all the time,” says Vivian as she looks back on her life. “After that, she is free to become whoever she truly is.” Let’s hope Gilbert is right.• Sam Baker’s The Woman Who Ran is published by HarperFiction.

Unlike Theresa May, the former shop worker and union organiser is far from a household name – but she should be. Her story tells us much about the battle women fought to secure political representation and the way they were treated when they arrived in Westminster. It also tells us something about women in politics today.Ninety years ago today Bondfield made history when she became the first female cabinet minister.Bondfield was a trailblazer at a time when men dominated politics. She declared that she was taking on the role of minister of labour in 1929 not for herself, but for all women.In many ways Bondfield could not be more different from May. And yet her career also ended in failure, which is why so little about her is remembered today.I was three months old when Margaret Thatcher became prime minister and, while I never agreed with her politics, it never occurred to me that a woman could not lead our country. Today nearly a third of MPs are women. Only three women had served as MPs before Bondfield. And there were no Labour women at all for her to follow in the footsteps of. She was forging her own future.Bondfield’s story is deeply moving. She was the 10th of 11 children, brought up in poverty in Chard in Somerset, and became a shop assistant at 14. She spoke from the heart and from experience when the spoke about grinding poverty and appalling working conditions.Her interest in politics was triggered by the exploitation of female workers by their male masters. One evening, as she read about a shop workers’ union in a newspaper wrapped around her chip supper, she became determined to change things. She joined the union and rose through its ranks to become its assistant secretary. In 1923 she was elected to parliament.In a sign of the male-dominated times, Bondfield’s maiden speech was described in the press as “the first intellectual speech by a woman the House had ever heard.” And very quickly Bondfield made her mark.Ramsay MacDonald appointed Bondfield Britain’s first female cabinet minister in 1929 – something she considered part of the “great revolution” for women. But it was a period of rising unemployment, and her policies put her at loggerheads with her former union colleagues and Labour MPs. MacDonald’s austerity split the party and triggered Bondfield’s resignation in 1931 after her proposed solutions to the crisis – means-tested benefits – were flatly rejected. “How can you means-test someone who has no means?” Ellen Wilkinson, the Labour MP and leftwing darling, challenged Bondfield.Just like May, Bondfield’s efforts to fix a seemingly intractable problem were bitterly condemned by her own party. As a lonely political figure she had few comrades to come to her aid. Last summer I spoke to Theresa May. Talking about why she wasn’t part of the traditional Westminster cliques, she said: “I didn’t do that. Some people would say, of course, that’s been one of my problems over the years I haven’t done it in the way that the men did it.” Parliament is a clubby place, and if you don’t have people watching your back your political fall can be as steep as your rise. Bondfield’s career, like May’s, ended in accusations of betrayal.Bondfield’s fate did not go unnoticed by a young Labour activist, Barbara Castle. When Harold Wilson offered Castle the role of minister of labour four decades later, she declared she wouldn’t be “Maggie Bondfield mark two”. Yet Castle’s own policy, “In Place of Strife”, which aimed to reduce days lost to strikes, almost did for Castle what the depression did to Bondfield’s career. Although Castle survived in the cabinet, her chance to become leader of the Labour party was gone for ever as MPs and unions condemned her approach.Bondfield lived for much of her life with Mary Macarthur, a trade unionist and suffragist, and died in a nursing home in 1953 at the age of 80. A lonely end to a remarkable life. The former prime minister and Labour leader Clement Attlee gave the address at her funeral.Much has improved in terms of the representation of women in Westminster and conditions for female workers. However, we still have not had a female Labour leader – a source of huge shame to my party – or a female chancellor of any political shade. Women still own less, earn less and are more likely to live in poverty.The challenges today for women in public life are different but real. The level of abuse online, the death and rape threats and indeed the murder of a female MP would have been unthinkable for Bondfield.Every generation has new battles to fight, and while today in parliament there is a sisterhood of cheerleaders for issues neglected by men, as Prof Mary Beard writes: “Our model of political power remains resolutely male. Only when we can shut our eyes and see a tough, eloquent and resplendent woman will we know the revolution is truly complete.”• Rachel Reeves is Labour MP for Leeds West and the author of Women of Westminster: The MPs Who Changed Politics"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1e42f7621d7a8fa7a664a6d361b463ec52bfbfd2/0_270_3600_2161/master/3600.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6d9cae24bbaae8db27ccc1c1385af49c","title":"pregnancy endurance test human","story":"You can keep your Tour de France or your Arctic treks, growing and pushing out a human is the hardest work a person can doWhen Harry spoke to the press in his dazed and delighted way after Meghan had given birth, he said: “How any woman does what they do is beyond comprehension.” I guess he meant labour, childbirth, that everyday agony and ecstasy that is part of women’s lives. How do we do that? After months of feeling not too grand while exposed to every myth going and being told what to eat, wear and how to behave, we have to get the baby out somehow. It’s what we do.Some women love being pregnant, some really don’t. Some sail through feeling mostly normal others are sick, exhausted, permanently worried and just want it to end. Being pregnant is an ordinary thing that happens to women and yet it is absolutely extraordinary. Few tell the whole truth about it, as so often we are told to enjoy what is the most dangerous and precarious rollercoaster we will ever get on.I remember a woman telling me when I was first pregnant that the whole deal was like “a major car accident” and that it would take me two years to get over it. Wow, thanks mate. Luckily I was young enough to carry on life as normal – but each woman is different and each pregnancy is different. None of us are helped by exhortations to be blooming, nor by the assumption that we have joined some communal petting zoo in which strangers can pat our bellies or give us unsolicited advice about cheese and wine.Some women are traumatised by the whole experience because it is so primal, so totally blood and guts (have you ever seen a placenta?) and yet we have built an entire culture of fluff and cuteness around baby stuff as if in complete denial. Growing another person inside you and then pushing them out or having them cut out of you (if you think I am being too graphic, I wonder if you know where babies come from) is as basic as it gets. Let no one tell us that female biology is somehow a construct. Uterus transplants remain a while away. Try telling a woman in the throes of labour that biology is optional and she may well deck you.So far, so female. But to be a woman is so often to be told what you already instinctively know by a man in authority. This time by one Herman Pontzer of Duke University, North Carolina, in a journal called Science Advances. He has been reviewing the world’s most physically demanding pastimes. Obviously one is the Tour de France. Days and days on a bike more than 2,000 miles and years of training to get a yellow top. These guys are working at maximum lung capacity. What heroes. What an endurance test.The human ability to extract energy from food shows us the limits of what our bodies can do. Certain athletes are burning several times the amount of calories at peak performance than they are at their resting metabolic rate. And guess what? So are pregnant and breastfeeding women, who are of course pregnant for a lot longer than the duration of the Tour de France. “If you think about pregnancy, it is the ultimate endurance activity,” concludes Pontzer.Apparently, Ironman triathlons and polar trekking don’t come close to the body energy expenditure of being pregnant, with rates levelling off after 20 or so days on the road. What is key is the metabolic resting rate: marathon runners perform at 16 times theirs, cyclists at five times and an Antarctic trekker at 3.5 times. In contrast, a pregnant woman, who is usually working and carrying on as normal, is functioning at 2.2 times her resting rate. But she will do this for 280 days, something these mega athletes could only dream of. No one cheers pregnant women over the finishing line. None of us get a trophy.A normal pregnancy is not an illness but it certainly feels like an endurance test: perhaps I didn’t need a study to tell me that, but we have one anyway.Growing new humans is the hardest work any of us do. We don’t need medals for it, although some actual support would be nice. Yes, I am looking at you guys who don’t offer seats on the bus to pregnant women. Yes, I am looking at all you employers who think maternity pay is unearned and optional. And yes, I am looking at a culture that still valorises motherhood as an idea but does little in reality to support it.The pregnancy endurance test is emotional as well as physical – I’m sure another study involving bears and woods will come along soon to confirm that. Meanwhile, men will continue with their amazing feats of endurance – showing us the great strength that humans are capable of – while the rest of us simply get on with it. It’s beyond comprehension all right."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/304d0e087810e4968a898f9c79605329523ba3ec/0_0_2000_1200/master/2000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=21b17e9b2da686bd7e072e51832f39ae","title":"ashes to ashes 20 how womens cricket developed to embrace new formats","story":"Ahead of this summer’s Women’s Ashes tour, Kalika Mehta takes a look back at the tournament’s history, from its unofficial beginning in the 1930sAlthough women’s competitive cricket dates back to the foundation of the Women’s Cricket Association (WCA) in 1926, it wasn’t until eight years later that an England team set sail for Australia for their first “unofficial” Ashes tour.With the hosts refusing to pay travel expenses, the team consisted of players who could afford the considerable £80 – nearly £5,000 in modern-day terms – charged by the WCA. If that didn’t rule out a large enough section of society, married women were also barred from selection – on the grounds that it would not be appropriate for them to be away from home for a six-month tour.The youthful team – all were under 25 – set off for Australia with a squad of seven teachers or future teachers, two secretaries, an art student, a lawyer, a nurse, and three “ladies of leisure” – plus Myrtle Maclagan, who was employed by the army.Having agreed to not smoke, drink, gamble or find themselves “accompanied by a man”, England’s players were also far more prepared than their Australian counterparts, who only began searching for players 28 days before the first Test was due to begin.Unsurprisingly, England romped to victory. All-rounder Maclagan sent down a searing spell to earn figures of 7-10 and rattle out Australia for 47 in the first innings – picking up the first five-wicket haul in a women’s international in the process.Maclagan followed that up with another impressive milestone, hitting 72 of the visitors’ first-innings score of 154. Though the home side were more resilient with the bat at the second time of asking, England comfortably knocked off the required 32 runs to secure a nine-wicket win.The second Test at the historic Sydney Cricket Ground followed much the same pattern. Maclagan’s century in England’s first innings was the highlight of a match that saw the visitors requiring just 10 runs in the second innings.Although this eight-wicket victory sealed the series, there was no trophy for England captain Betty Archdale to raise in triumph – the WCA’s founding constitution, set out in 1930, proclaimed that “no member of any affiliated club shall take part in any cricket challenge cup or prize competition”.England retained the Ashes on home soil in 1937 after a drawn series and the second world war put paid to the scheduled 1939-40 Ashes it wasn’t until the winter of 1948-49 that England’s players set out for Australia once more. This time around, the hosts were much better prepared. The team were fitter and more skilful, and the crowd of 17,025 across three days in Adelaide – still the highest for a women’s Test in Australia – cheered on a comprehensive 186-run victory, which gave the Australians a 1-0 lead in the three-match series.Australian all-rounder Betty Wilson – who turned down three marriage proposals during the  of her international career in order to continue playing cricket – was the undoubted star of the Test. Her brilliant knock of 111 – ended by run-out – was followed by a six-wicket haul, then 3-39 in the second innings.Although the following Tests were more competitive, two draws earned Australia’s women their maiden Ashes series victory. Scoring 268 runs and picking up an impressive 16 wickets across the three matches, Wilson stood head and shoulders above the rest of the players. But still no trophy.It took 34 more Tests and more than 64 years for England and Australia’s women to have something to fight over. In 1998, a miniature bat was burned in a wok in the Harris Garden at Lord’s on July 20, and the ashes were placed in a small wooden trophy.Also in the wok was a copy of the WCA constitution and rulebook – the WCA was finished, having voted to merge with the newly formed England and Wales Cricket Board, and it seemed only right that its “no prize” rule go up in smoke.England were unable to break Australia’s dominance at that stage, however, and the Southern Stars retained the Ashes until 2005 (which some will remember as a good year for the men too).In 2013, the Ashes changed from being Test-only to consist of one Test, three one-day internationals and three T20 Internationals. Six points were awarded for a Test win, or two points for a draw, with two points awarded for a limited-over win and one for a draw.Although the Test match in 2013 was drawn, England triumphed in two ODIs and three T20s to win the home series 12-4 and reclaim the Ashes. A second – but closer – series win followed in Australia, less than six months later, before the format was tweaked in 2015 to reduce a Test win to four points Australia have won then retained the Ashes since.While so much of women’s sport struggles to emerge from the shadows of the men’s game, or strives to emulate it, the Women’s Ashes has always forged its own path, with four-day Tests – an option often discussed for the men’s game – and now an exciting multi-format competition that has opened up new audiences.But it would be nothing without the players, and these days those players come from all walks of life.

I had not intended for it to be the focus of my time in Kyiv, but leading up to my departure it became an obsession. My arrival in Kyiv on 25 April 2018 was maybe happenstance of planning but I was impelled to head straight from the airport to Slavutych. This was the town built to replace Pripyat and host the evacuated personnel of the Chernobyl power plant, after the decision was made to continue power production following the disaster. All of the Soviet republics were called upon to hurriedly help with the construction of what would eventually be the last atomic town.Liquidators. This term became my obsession. They were the people who had tended to the Chernobyl fallout. A lesser known name for them was “the green machines”, a reference to the colour of their uniforms and the fact that, where machines would fail because of the unimaginably high levels of radiation, they would not.What I saw in Slavutych at 1.24am, the time when the nuclear reactor in Chernobyl power plant exploded 32 years ago, was a solemn outpouring of raw emotion. Representatives of the church, scientists and members of the army mixed to pay tribute to a group of people who fought an invisible war against the atom. Later that day, at the town museum, a group of liquidator veterans had gathered for me to interview and photograph them. Following those encounters, I made my way to the home of another man, Iakov Mamedov. “There were 12 people in my hospital ward, only four survived. The others were just covered and taken away.”I knew I had to go to the exclusion zone. I had been in contact with the head of communications of the power plant and eventually was given approval to enter the plant and take photos. It is very simple to get to the zone as a tourist, as many operators organise day trips from Kyiv, but I wanted to go alone. Vitali was appointed as my guide to organise my itinerary and make sure I did not go where I should not. The 19-mile radius exclusion zone includes the site of the nuclear power plant, but also abandoned villages, a children’s holiday camp, the Duga military radar and it is inhabited by a group of people known as “resettlers”. After the accident, the zone was completely evacuated and locals were told they would have returned to their homes within two or three days. Residents , however, were never officially allowed back. Some people decided the need to stay in their home was greater than the risk of living in a radioactive area and illegally made their way back.Soon after entering the exclusion zone, I discovered my permission to visit the station had been overturned. On the same day, in Chernobyl town – where 1,500 people still work, servicing the power plant – my guide and I remained locked in the local museum, and had to jump out of a first-floor toilet window to get out. Then I blew a tyre, which meant changing it under what I paranoically assumed was radioactive rain. It felt like a post-Soviet cloud of bad luck was following me in my every move.The source of the nuclear fallout, now encased in a steel and concrete sarcophagus, can only be photographed from one angle, with tourists dutifully disembarking from their tour buses to snap the shot.Nearby, there are cooling lakes full of oversized fish. They used to be farmed to feed bears for the local fur industry, but after the accident the furs were too contaminated to be worn and the fish were left to their own device.The people working at the power plant do so usually for 10 days at a time, to service, monitor and safeguard the power plant, which is about five miles away.Resettler Vasiliy Semyonovych Razumenko at his home in the exclusion zone. Vasiliy claims to be 113 years old, although records say he is 95. He used to work at a shipyard in Odesa.“Tell them this old bastard is still alive,” were his parting words. “Those men in the shipyard I worked with, tell them Vasiliy is still breathing.”Hanna has looked after her younger sister, Sonya, since she was born. They live on their small farmed land, food brought by the military police and donations from tourists.Pripyat is the closest town to the power plant. It used to be the shining example of Soviet modernity, with nuclear scientists from around the world visiting it every year. In the centre of the abandoned town sits the amusement park that was supposed to open on 1 May 1986. The rusty ferris wheel has become iconic of the Chernobyl dystopia.The very nature of the disaster means that everything is frozen as it was at the time of the accident and nothing should be touched because of fear of radiations.The exclusion zone covers around 1,000 sq miles. From the area, about 91,000 people were evacuated. Within the zone, there was a secret military facility containing part of the Duga radar system, a Soviet missile defence radar.The location that interested me the most was a children’s holiday camp that lays abandoned just off a main road in the zone of alienation. I had not seen many photographs of it before, but it seemed to sum up the thousands of innocent lives that had been affected by the Chernobyl accident, and the reasoning behind the unquestioning sacrifice of the liquidators.What at first had seemed to me illogical self-sacrifice, not unlike the nonsense of going to war, started to make sense in this abandoned Soviet paradise."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ac9e47da54e2f5310435e703d014c78857de565f/0_265_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a3dc3db79708dfe7d8b56a87f84bdb9d","title":"the week in wildlife in pictures","story":"White tiger cubs, urban deer and many millions of ladybirds"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/129276a111cd0b6ec7546cea834413bf60d00363/0_2763_6275_3762/master/6275.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=316a148803bf0e4fc4b420bad59d8f94","title":"manolo blahnik shoes meet inspiration wallace collection","story":"Designer’s footwear goes on display alongside 18th-century works at Wallace CollectionManolo Blahnik may be the world’s most famous shoe designer, his heels immortalised in the hit TV show Sex and the City after being given their own storyline.

In total, 10 rooms will be adorned with more than 160 pairs of shoes, each exploring a theme in Blahnik’s work, which has been heavily inspired by art and the Wallace Collection in particular.The exhibition will culminate in the Great Gallery, which houses a selection of masterpieces – including works by Titian and Velázquez.The exhibition comes shortly after the milliner Stephen Jones’ exhibition at the Royal Pavilion in Brighton this year, which saw his fashion creations adorn furniture in every room of the landmark and attracted droves of visitors to admire the splendour of King George IV’s famous pleasure palace.Blahnik, who celebrates the 50th anniversary of his eponymous brand next year, hopes his historical collaboration will entice “curious millennials” to the collection. “It’s a wonderful moment to do it.” An Enquiring Mind: Manolo Blahnik at the Wallace Collection, London, from 10 June until 1 September"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1ba5bc94643a33d6eb207ab8f9408f2e183c8592/1147_482_3387_2032/master/3387.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a9b5a1f18f44e06f8e2ffd9d7158e8df","title":"the best bronzers sali hughes","story":"The barely perceptible trace of iridescence is just enough to make skin appear healthy and vitalHere’s why.

It’s the perfectly flattering golden brown for anyone who thinks themselves too white for realistic bronzing. Maui Nights is an unusual, yet tonally correct, deep, burnished bronze, that illuminates dark brown skin sublimely (bronzer’s job is not to darken, but to warm).

Oh, and it makes a fast, easy eyeshadow (fluff over lids to just beyond the crease). It is also cruelty-free.As utterly perfect as the Becca bronzer is, I know from experience that I’ll have lost many of you at the mere mention of glimmer. Matte seems less risky.

But as a new film reveals, things didn’t turn out quite as hopedIn 1991, the Soviet Union finally crumbled under the weight of its own contradictions. As the walls came tumbling down, it looked as though a space was finally opening up for young people to express themselves after the crushing conformity of the communist years.“For us it was awesome when the Soviet Union fell, because we could fool around,” says artist Illya Chichkan. “And that’s exactly what we did. We experimented with psychedelics and psychotropics. We tried everything.”But things didn’t turn out quite as hoped. The brief window of opportunity that followed communism’s demise soon descended into the dangerous anarchy of unbounded capitalism. As for the stories of the cohort of Russians who attempted to articulate a new youth culture in those chaotic years, they’ve become the basis for director Clayton Vomero’s film 3OHA, which is about to receive its UK premiere at Sheffield DocFest.The first half of the film is dedicated to stories of what the 90s generation went through.Troitsky, who became one of the nascent Russian club scene’s key figures, recalls organising the legendary Gagarin party in 1991: “I had been following the electronic scene in Riga, then Leningrad, then we brought the first rave to Moscow in December.”Another organiser, Igor Shulinsky, pushed out into the world of publishing with Ptyuch magazine. “We tried to do something like the Face magazine at the time,” he says in the film, acknowledging the fact that magazines such as NME, the Face and Melody Maker had been smuggled across borders during the 80s to feed a fervent hunger for another life. “We were like a bible for many people from all over the country. We did what we wanted, we had no taboos. We published everything we were interested in.”But while some embraced the freedoms, which were being enacted against an increasingly violent and rackety background, others noticed that their understanding of the capitalism that was freeing them was sketchy at best.Artist Vova Vorotnyov says: “Everyone was copying the west. They took the western stereotypes and the western mentality as they perceived them. And of course we’d been living behind the iron curtain so a lot of information was not reaching us.”Increasing violence was also rendering much of the country ungovernable. As Vomero notes: “It was more dangerous in the 1990s than it had been in the 1980s. People lived through a broken and horrible state, and people like Shulinsky and Troitsky endured that and insulated themselves by creating clubs and magazines.”There had been a period, Vomero says, when “there was a very short window of about two or three years where there was a moment of people being able to potentially build something, but the temptations of money and success were also great and so new that it was just two years that passed so quickly.”Many of Troitsky’s generation “had a lot of regret for not having taken over ministries, of not having become the people that redid the train lines, did the things which would have had a long lasting effect politically and governmentally and institutionally.” The second half of Vomero’s film fast-forwards to the present, and follows the current generation in Moscow, Kiev and St Petersburg, crushed by the repressions of Vladimir Putin’s modern gulag. The class of 1991 seem incredibly glamorous and with far more agency over their lives than their contemporary counterparts, whose narrow lives encompass illicit street meetings to hawk knock-off trainers on Moscow streets, or discussions of Crimean culture in dusty Kiev apartments. But Vomero’s lens treats the latter’s efforts to create ersatz visions of the west – dancing along to silent music videos in overgrown urban wildernesses while they capture themselves on Instagram – with sympathy.And he captures the terrible pathos of a young couple discussing the possibility of a trip to Los Angeles – which is as likely as a trip to outer space – so poignantly that it has you choking back the tears. The current generation are left untethered at the end of the film, snapping selfies in front of western fashion outlets that remain as untouchable for them as they were for their forebears.• 3OHA screens at Sheffield DocFest on 8 and 11 June"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b6d6fe8c668cd088492c838bb14b31e2d2186c53/0_384_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bf496769773b604ab1f7bc2e1d9cea74","title":"four russian picnic recipes alissa timishkina","story":"Bundle up a basket with a refreshing cold soup, a buckwheat salad with a side of pickles, and a semolina cake to finish4 hard-boiled eggs, peeled1 large cucumber10 radishes1 bunch dill1 bunch flat-leaf parsley1 bunch chives200g canned or cooked chickpeas, drainedSalt and black pepper800ml Turkish ayran or kvass 4 tbsp soured cream (if using kvass) 4 tsp horseradish cream or eastern European mustardFinely dice the eggs, cucumber and radishes.

Close the jar tightly and leave to ferment, out of direct sunlight, and at room temperature, for four to 10 days. Open the jar daily to let the cucumbers ‘burp’. You will know the cucumbers are ready when the brine starts to darken. Once you are happy with the degree of fermentation, transfer the jar to the refrigerator. The cucumbers will keep in the cold for a few months.375g semolina375ml milk or kefir80g unsalted butter, softened, plus extra for greasing3 eggs150g caster sugar1 tsp vanilla extract15g baking powder1 pinch saltClear honey or ginger syrup, for drizzling (optional)Mix the semolina with the milk or kefir in a bowl, then let it soak for an hour at room temperature.

The grey of the weather and the ticketing and organisational chaos outside suddenly felt a lot less important to a heaving Parc des Princes bowl.With La Marseillaise echoing round the stadium with gusto, tears in the eyes of many a French player evident, finally the football was starting. “We knew that it was going to be a very emotional evening, but we managed it well,” said Renard. “When you have 45,000 people singing the French national anthem, obviously it drives you forward, but we really made the most of the crowd’s support.”Diacre blocked out any feelings on the atmosphere though: “I refused all emotion tonight. I will let emotion affect me later on in the competition. I have prepared as if I were a player. There’s no room for emotion tonight,” she said.In the second minute France made their first chance. Griedge Mbock Bathy’s crossfield pass found Eugenie Le Sommer on the touchline, she slipped a square pass to an onrushing Henry who laid off to Kadidiatou Diani but her shot was blocked, it fell to Henry though who whipped a shot across goal just wide of the far post. Soon France’s hard work paid idends, centre-back Kim Do-yeon, filling a gap left by Jang Sel-gi was robbed by Henry on the right and she raced clear finding Le Sommer with a perfectly weighted cut back to side foot in to send the excitable crowd wild.With a goal relieving the nerves the crowd seemed calmer. But the home side continued to push a jittery South Korean defence. On 29 minutes Les Bleus looked to have doubled their lead, but the first ever VAR referral of a Women’s World Cup intervened. A short corner from Gaetane Thiney was pinged into the box by Henry, flicked across goal it fell behind Bathy but she hooked her leg back and volleyed in. The delighted French celebrations at the lovely finish were shortlived as Bathy was ruled offside.Less than 10 minutes later, though, and Bathy’s defensive partner, domestically and internationally, Renard secured the second. Another Thiney corner from the right was lofted into space by the far post and an incoming 6ft 1in Renard headed powerfully past Kim.On the stroke of half time Renard scored another, this time a corner from the left was almost placed onto her head near the penalty spot and, with Hwang Bo-ram attempting to mark her, she powered the ball over the head of the defender and to the right of a stationary Kim.With the bookies’ inclusion of Renard in their top-scorer odds looking decidedly less unlikely, the second half got under way.With complacency starting to drift into France’s dominant performance the South Koreans carved out their best chance of the game. Another substitute Lee Min-a, almost looked confused at being played clean through between Renard and Bathy but she could only put her shot disappointingly wide of Sarah Bouhaddi’s right-hand post.South Korea manager Yoon Deok-yeo apologised to their fans for the disappointing performance. “In Korea there are people that watched the match at a late hour so I would like to say sorry to the football fans in Korea,” he said.“Today’s match showed how strong France is, I cannot pinpoint one player, many of the French players showed very aggressive performances in a good way. Especially on both wings, Cascarino and Diani, those player have great technique and they are very fast so it was very hard for my players to mark those players.”The French were still in control, and Henry capped an commanding performance with a stunning effort. Picking up a pass from Le Sommer she pushed forward before slamming a swerving right-footed shot from 20 yard into the corner.France have underachieved at major competitions in the past decade, given the quality of their squad. But now, on home soil, there is a feeling that finally everything is clicking. And, with the chance to be the first country to hold both the men’s and women’s World Cup’s at the same time on the cards, this performance showed Les Bleus are not letting the pressure get to them. “We’ve won tonight’s match but this is just one step on the road,” tempered Diacre. “We have six more steps to take if we are to go all the way. We need to keep our feet on the ground and continue working.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f230549bdd1db1fa8248385adb8226a26ed91d62/34_0_4416_2649/master/4416.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0e3697cdb460e3bdef4408029a2a95a6","title":"maurizio sarri to sign three year deal with juventus next week","story":"Maurizio Sarri is set to join Juventus on a three-year contract after securing his release from Chelsea.The Italian’s agent, Fali Ramadani, met with the Premier League club on Friday and came to an agreement with the Chelsea hierarchy that means Sarri is free to join Juventus. The Serie A club, champions in Italy for the last eight seasons, are confident they will not have to pay a fee for the 60-year-old, who was a rival to the Turin club when coach of Napoli.Sarri only joined Chelsea last summer after three years at Napoli, replacing compatriot Antonio Conte but despite winning the Europa League and qualifying for next season’s Champions League, last season was an uneasy campaign in west London. Chelsea also reached the Carabao Cup final, but lost that against Manchester City in a game that will be remembered for the farcical scenes that followed the goalkeeper Kepa Arrizabalaga refusing to be substituted before the penalty shoot-out.The news of Sarri’s departure, although long anticipated, came on the same day that Real Madrid announced the signing of Eden Hazard, Chelsea’s star player, for an initial £88.5m, which could rise to as much as £130m.The club are also facing a two-window transfer ban from Fifa after being found guilty of breaching rules regarding their dealings with overseas players under the age of 18. Chelsea confirmed on Friday they have appealed the decision to the Court of Arbitration for Sport.To replace Sarri, Chelsea will now look to former Juventus manager Massimiliano Allegri, Nuno Espírito Santo of Wolves, Javi Gracía of Watford, Laurent Blanc, a free agent since being sacked by Paris Saint-Germain in 2016, and former player and all-time leading goalscorer Frank Lampard, who led Derby to the Championship play-offs in his first season in management."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f565569684756c110dea4a4520ad84cfe86b5b5d/0_0_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fc952905859cf43028c3eed64205d314","title":"nikita parris exciting england football womens world cup 2019","story":"The leading scorer in WSL history draws on her 2015 selection heartache to help fuel England’s World Cup ambitionsFour years ago Nikita Parris was in Egypt, being woken up in the early hours by her mum to watch England play at the World Cup in Canada. “It was sometimes 1.30am over there,” she says. “I got on the laptop in my hotel room. Myself, my mum and my sister all crowding around, watching it, hoping the wifi was strong enough.“They would wake me up. My mum would say: ‘Nikita, time to get up, the game’s on in half an hour …’ My mum was my alarm clock. She’s always been there for me.”It would have been a shock if Parris, who last month joined the Champions League winners Lyon from Manchester City, had been omitted from Phil Neville’s squad this time. But four years ago it was a different story.“I knew I wasn’t going but I wanted to make sure all the girls going into the tournament were best prepared to push on. I went into the training camp to make sure they had the sort of test they were going to get from the American forwards, French forwards, Canadian forwards to make sure that in those moments of pressure they knew they had already done it in training against me. Mark spoke to me after that and he said I would be a massive part of his plans.”Despite having no expectations, missing out hurt. “It was massively disappointing but I respected his decision because I hadn’t been around the squad for long enough,” says Parris, now the leading scorer in Women’s Super League history. “I hadn’t really shown what I was capable of. I didn’t have that length of time to show anyone.”The way she was told mattered. Neville has spoken extensively in the buildup to this tournament about his frustrations with how he was told as a player he was not going to World Cups. If Sampson had got it wrong, Parris might not be about to embark on her second major tournament.“Mark and I sat down,” she says. “He had hot chocolate. I had a coffee. I remember the moment because ultimately it determined to me which way I would go. Would I give up or would I knuckle down and ensure I made the next World Cup or the Euros? That’s what my plans were. I knew I would break into it if I put everything into it and put my best foot forward.”This season Parris has helped Manchester City to a domestic cup double and chased Arsenal’s Vivianne Miedema for the Golden Boot in the league but eventually finished three goals behind on 19. The 25-year-old’s challenge now is to make sure she is mentally ready for the world stage.“It’s not something I’ve experienced before but ultimately I don’t really think of that,” Parris says. “My whole thought process going into this is that I’m best prepared, no matter what the moment is, and to really show what I can do. I’ve got friends, teammates around me to make sure I don’t overthink the situation.”Dealing with the expectations of a nation is hard, but she welcomes the pressure. “I think they should be excited,” she says. “We have got a lot of quality, a lot of different talents and great depth. Each and every game could be different. The gaffer isn’t afraid to mix up the squad and it will bring a different element. It’s an exciting time for English football.”With the team having made two semi-finals in four years, in Canada and at Euro 2017, the pressure is high. Parris, though, throws the 2009 Euros finals into the mix too. “The girls in ’09 won silver – it’s time for gold.“We’re under no illusions how hard that is going to be. We’ve put so much hard work in. Our journey has not been easy but we played some of the best teams in the world on American soil in the SheBelieves and came out winners so we have it in us to compete. We’re ready for it.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4cf8bb4ff90a7ebbb3ff8ede5f0770a242172092/0_0_1200_720/master/1200.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=39a3dfea8520d276ebab07fb8758bbf3","title":"blind date georgie matt","story":"What were you hoping for?I had checked out the restaurant beforehand and was hoping for an amazing meal… with a side of banter from Matt thrown in.First impressions?I walked down the stairs and our eyes met across the room.

I have always seen it somewhat differently, as a kind of street version of Cirque du Soleil, suitable for only the skinniest kid with a death wish. Walking towards a cul-de-sac full of low walls, I am disbelieving.“Even someone carrying a lot of extra weight?” “Yes, as long as you start with what they are able to do safely.” “Even the strongest man on Earth?” “Yes, as long as you allow for his muscle ratio.”We come to some walls. Pearson wants to start with focus and flexibility exercises warming up has never been more important, especially when you’re not 17. You can land pretty heavily even if you don’t fall off, and this is all concrete, remember. We do a fiendish exercise of rotating one knee while tracing a shape with the other, and rotating one wrist while drawing a box with the other. “It doesn’t look very much like a box,” he says, affably. I want to make a nitpicking point about the degree to which any shape made with a wrist resembles a box, but he is right whatever its challenges, I suck at this. Which is a shame because, for some reason, I already love it.You know how sometimes there’s a rail on a low wall, for no reason you could name? The basic starting point is to be able to balance on that rail with one foot. It sounds easy, but it ain’t. I manage 10 seconds on one leg, about six on the other. I’m beyond smug. It took about 20 minutes to achieve this.The basic jump, meanwhile, is a step vault one hand planted on a low wall as you go over it, the opposite foot lands on the wall your inside leg tucks underneath yourself, and then you’re over. It’s not as easy as it sounds, but it’s not so hard that you can’t master it. There’s a lot of swinging round parking signs and scaffolding poles it’s physical but not technical.You could lose hours just making a routine and trying to speed up: step vault, swing round a pole, step vault, shimmy along a wall for a bit, jump off. It’s the least prissy of any sport I’ve tried in this complicated urban structure – it looks like a car park, but it’s not big enough – we spend ages just toeing round railings, trying to get past pillars and bikes, hanging off scaffolding.One minute I am covered in grease, the next in dirt. We climb laterally along a wall, inches off the ground, holding on to ledges. Anything that is too high to vault, you have to approach with a cat leap. Just run at the wall as long as there’s something at the top to grab and your first foot places high enough, you’ll make it.“That’s great, you’re actually bleeding,” Pearson says. It’s true, I have a tiny nick on my wrist. I’ve never been so delighted with myself and yet I don’t know how to get down.If you’re frightened to do something, try making it harder for yourself by closing your eyes. When you go back and try it the easy way, you’ll be able to do it."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8593cc0ea701f790e82e065ff7b6bf1647fe8a51/141_105_2305_1383/master/2305.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=83b4c4959d6cf2d2720d4fa2cffad91e","title":"romesh ranganathan trolling non vegans","story":"I’ll never post anything provocative online again. Oh, who am I kidding?I was recently asked to do two promo videos for the BBC – one was a simple video of me trying to smile for five minutes straight and the other was of me doing a rant about Avengers spoilers. So far, so social media. I finished the two videos and one of the team said: “Well, you did those so quickly, you can do another one if you fancy.” I decided there would be no harm and thought it would be funny to do one trolling non-vegans about the way they hate vegans.When I finished, I asked the team if it was OK. They told me that it was great and should provoke some discussion. What I didn’t realise was that this actually meant my social media timelines were going to be taken over for the following week with vegans telling me how great I was and meat eaters telling me that I was the worst scum of the Earth and that my time to pay would come soon.I was pretty taken aback by the level of vitriol thrown in my direction, but the truth is I have only myself to blame. I said something deliberately provocative – that people hate vegans because they’re better than everyone else – and was surprised when people were provoked. I had forgotten that there is absolutely no place for nuance, context or any kind of grey area when it comes to social media. Every time you venture on to it, you get caught in the crossfire of arguments raging back and forth, even though I cannot recall a single time on Twitter when somebody has said: “You make a fair point, I agree with you now.”It did, bizarrely, give me a slight admiration for Piers Morgan and Katie Hopkins, two professional trolls who deliberately antagonise and upset people in order to maintain relevance. They must be inundated with abuse all day, every day, but I imagine they feed off it like hatred vampires, using the fire of the abuse to forge another made-up opinion for the masses.What could I have done to avoid this? And should I want to? The clip has had more than a million views, compared with the smiling video’s 12, which is presumably just my mum watching it and then showing it to her friends. So what does that mean? Well, it certainly means I won’t be doing the smiling thing again, but should I do more videos as inflammatory as my vegan diatribe?The truth is, I don’t know. I have said much more provocative things in standup comedy and there have been no issues at all. Obviously, this is because I am speaking to a much smaller group of people, but essentially the context is everything. The audience know they are watching a comedian who is saying things that they might not agree with, in order to make them laugh. There is no such understanding when @Carnivore12 pops up on your timeline, saying: “Look at what this grass-munching twat is saying.”So the lesson has been learned. I am never going to trust the internet again. You will see me express provocative views only on comedy shows, on stage and in this column. And probably another video, who am I kidding? Vegans are the future, and if you eat dairy and meat you don’t care about the planet.

It’s the kind of damage I would normally blame on the tortoise, but the plant in question is in a raised bed, well out of his reach.My wife comes back from the shops, and finds me staring.“Oh dear,” she says.“It can’t be a slug,” I say. “Unless it’s a slug the size of a ski boot.”“It’s probably the squirrel,” she says.“Would a squirrel eat radicchio?” I say, wincing, as I always do, whenever I have to say “radicchio” out loud.“Dunno,” she says. “I bought two nice-ish bottles of rosé, so you can take one to poker.”“I can’t bring rosé to a poker game,” I say.“Why not?” she says.“Because it’s poker,” I say. “It would put me at a huge psychological disadvantage.”“Don’t be silly,” she says. I stare at the razed plant and I think: radicchio and rosé – how did I get here?An hour later I walk down to the new beer shop on the corner. When it first opened I wondered if I would ever become the sort of person who makes a special trip to buy beer now I’m such a regular customer that the owner waves to me whenever I walk past. He talks me through some of the hundreds of beers available: strong beer, weak beer, white beer, cloudy beer, local beer. I purchase what I think will be a psychologically advantageous selection.“Do you need a bag?” he says.“No, I have one,” I say, unfolding the M\u0026ampS shopper I’ve got tucked under my arm. I think: what is happening to me?When I get home, I add a cold bottle of rosé to the bag.On Sunday morning I wake with a lingering sense of shame. Radio 4 is playing, and my wife is sitting up in bed looking at her phone.“Why are we listening to church?” I say.“I’m waiting for the news,” my wife says. “How was it?”“I lost,” I say. “Badly.”“Oh dear,” she says. “How much?”“I’m not going to tell you,” I say.“Do we need to sell the car?” she says.“Technically the car is no longer ours to sell,” I say.“Maybe I don’t want to know,” she says.“The financial loss, though considerable, was nothing compared to the personal humiliation I suffered in defeat,” I say.“Just give me a rough idea,” she says.“I was so soundly crushed I had to leave early,” I say. “Because my sad presence was bringing everybody down.”“Christ,” she says. “How much?”“But you know what?” I say. “I was not the only person to bring rosé.”“I told you,” she says.“And the food was amazing,” I say. “Alex made this salad with pomegranate seeds in it.”“For poker?” she says.“I know, right?” I say. “In hindsight, it was the kind of meal I would have happily paid £70 for at a restaurant.”“Did you lose 70 quid?” she says.“I’m not ready to talk about it,” I say. “The memory is still too raw.”“That’s ridiculous,” she says.“I cried a little in the Uber on the way home,” I say. “I think the driver had seen worse.”I have a long bath and two coffees, and my mood lifts. I think about how much more hungover I’d be if I’d won. I find two more razed plants in the garden, but decide life is too short to worry about a squirrel that likes radicchio more than I do.My wife and I leave the house at midday to meet friends for lunch. As we reach the corner, my phone pings.“What is it?” my wife says.“It’s an email to the poker group, saying that somebody left an M\u0026ampS shopper behind.”“That’s my favourite bag!” she says.“I’ll pick it up later,” I say.We turn left. The owner of the beer shop is standing outside his premises. When he sees me he breaks into a broad smile and waves, and I smile and wave back.

The suspension will be reviewed “at least every 28 days”.Investors won’t be able to access their investments until the suspension is lifted.Woodford will probably need to build up a big pot of cash ready to meet redemptions when the fund reopens – easily several hundred million pounds, experts think.Existing investors will continue to own units in the fund, and they are being reassured that their money is safe. But there’s no certainty at all about what it will be worth.When the fund reopens, its value will depend on the share prices of the fund’s underlying companies. So if the share prices of those companies have risen, your investment will be worth more than it is today. But if the value has fallen, then so will your investment.“No exceptions are envisaged at this stage,” the company says. But if you are facing a real crisis, it’s worth giving the firm a try to see if they might budge for you.Investors who have a direct debit are free to cancel it. Otherwise, most will have their money collected as usual and held in cash. You may want to check with the platform you use, or your IFA.Others may have exposure via their self-invested personal pension “wrapper”. You might want to check what your money is invested in.The fund may be suspended, but it’s still being actively managed. However, on Thursday, Nicky Morgan, chair of the Treasury select committee, asked Woodford to waive the fund’s fees while it was suspended. Hargreaves Lansdown will waive its platform fee for the time being.These are “big, big” questions, says Adrian Lowcock, head of personal investing at investment firm Willis Owen. Clearly there are likely to be people queueing to get their money out when the fund reopens, putting more pressure on Woodford. But, says Lowcock, at the moment “it’s a bit like a 24-hour Twitter storm”, with emotions running high and a lot of criticism flying about. Woodford will now be restructuring the fund’s portfolio, and we need to wait and see how things look once he has done that, he adds.Investors almost need to look beyond all this and ask themselves whether Woodford “is the manager for you”. Lowcock says: “If the answer is no, you need to sell at some point. If he isn’t for you, he shouldn’t be in your portfolio.”When the fund reopens, if a lot of money flows out, this could clearly have an impact on the share prices of the fund’s underlying companies. So, all in all, pulling your money out on day one might not necessarily be the best call – but who knows?Willis Owen has suggested these three: Man GLG UK Income, Threadneedle UK Equity Income, and Troy Asset Management’s Trojan Income.That has not been disclosed, but it’s almost certainly several hundred thousand people.There’s no reason to think this will happen, but ultimately, if you have an investment with a firm that has failed, you might be eligible to claim from the Financial Services Compensation Scheme (FSCS), which provides cover of up to £85,000 per person per firm. But you would need to show, for example, that you were badly advised – the FSCS says: “We do not cover poor investment performance.”Woodford Investment Management in the first instance. If you are unhappy with its response, you can go to the Financial Ombudsman."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e64d7a1b832b010a84fe36ece2474b2627aea446/0_331_4795_2878/master/4795.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0f6ff2af2478fa2f320fc679bf057583","title":"travel spending put your kids cash on a card before they go","story":"Teenagers heading abroad should be looking at prepaid bank cards – but which ones?•‘Tui took £260 off my prepaid card after I didn’t use it for six years’No one forgets their first solo trip abroad, but if you want to remember it for all the right reasons, it will certainly help if you have the right plastic in your wallet or purse.Over the coming months, thousands of parents will be waving off their kids as they head off on holiday with friends or go travelling.But don’t let them make the mistake of using high-charging UK bank cards when they arrive.Make a load of shop purchases and a handful of ATM withdrawals in Spain or further afield using some debit and credit cards, and the charges could easily add up to more than the cost of a cheap flight.It’s much better to arm them – or yourself – with a card that won’t charge £2 every time you wave and pay, or cost more than £9 to take out the equivalent of £200 from a cash machine. Money has spent this week trawling the market and come up with the best value cards.The three standout cards, in our view, are Caxton FX Black, Sainsbury’s Bank Cash Passport and WeSwap. All will let you load multiple currencies – up to 18 in the case of WeSwap – and each allows you to make fee-free purchases in shops, and free ATM withdrawals – provided you are getting out the currency you have loaded on.In each case, the card is free, and there are no fees to reload cash – which is typically done online or via a mobile phone app. Each card allows the user to move money between the currencies held, at the prevailing rate that day. It is important to choose the card that holds the currency of the places you are visiting.Bank card expert Andrew Hagger, who runs MoneyComms, says: “It’s definitely worth applying for your cards a few weeks in advance so the traveller and their parents are comfortable with how they work and how to top them up.“Both the parents and the traveller should make a note on their phone of the 247 assistance telephone number in case there are any issues or the card is lost.”He says both Caxton and Sainsbury’s will issue a second card for free in the event that the first is lost. WeSwap charges £4.95.Users should be aware that prepaid cards aren’t suitable when hiring a car, as most car hire companies will require a credit card to cover the excess deposit.And don’t just forget about the card when you return home, warns Hagger, as some cards impose a fee if it isn’t used.Caxton doesn’t, but Sainsbury’s cardholders pay £2 a month after 18 months of inactivity. Don’t use these cards in the UK, as charges can apply.So, which card? WeSwap may be the cheapest, and it certainly looks good, but overall the Caxton card would be our first choice, not least because it is long established.The Sainsbury’s card can be delivered to your local store, making it a good last-minute choice, and it is easy to get back the balance post-trip.Lastly, if the parent has a credit card, they should consider adding a second card to their account in their son’s or daughter’s name – assuming they trust their offspring not to run amok with it. Home bank cards are a useful back-up to carry, too.After all, you don’t want to get that call in the middle of the night: “I’ve lost my wallet, and I’m stuck in XXX with no money.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/792822c55215d15ab1b14d39e44ecba6d2a087bf/531_81_2330_1398/master/2330.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=689199bd483c349b3048f9fbb84821ed","title":"dr john tribute","story":"The trailblazer who injected New Orleans R\u0026ampB with sinister psychedelia will live on as an icon of curdled idealismFor a few years after the Summer of Love, record stores were thick with hastily knocked-together concept albums about astrology or Indian mysticism or the occult, designed to cash in on the audience’s supposedly expanded consciousness. Here, it seemed, was another: a session musician reinventing himself as Dr John, singing songs about Louisiana voodoo thick with New Orleans slang and Creole patois, clad in a flamboyant Mardi Gras headdress and facepaint. Yet Gris Gris was anything but a novelty record. It was both one of the most extraordinary debut albums of the 60s and the beginning of a solo career that would last 51 years.Its presentation certainly courted the psychedelic market – Dr John billed himself as the “Night Tripper”, a lysergic honorific that nodded to the Beatles – but the music bore almost no relation to anything else in rock music at the time. Instead, it boasted an innovative, brilliant and at times unsettling synthesis of New Orleans musical traditions – jazz, funk, rhythm and blues – made by a man steeped in both the city’s culture and the darker side of life. He certainly sounded like he knew of what he spoke: all the lyrics about serpent spirits and curses and witch doctors, which should have seemed like hokum, sounded authentically ominous and disturbing in Dr John’s coolly menacing drawl.Mac Rebennack was nearing 30 when he transformed himself into Dr John and released Gris Gris: he had already packed a lifetime’s worth of musical experience and incident into his 27 years. His father’s connections as a record store owner in New Orleans’ Third Ward enabled him to sneak into local recording sessions: by 13, he was a professional musician, playing organ in strip clubs in the Third Quarter and performing with Professor Longhair, a local pioneer whose blend of blues, boogie-woogie and Afro-Cuban rhythms, Rebennack would later claim, “put the funk into music”.By 16, he was a session guitarist and occasional producer, working out of Cosimo Studios and playing in a succession of bands. He even had a local solo hit in 1959, a brooding Bo Diddley knock-off called Storm Warning, but Rebennack was also trouble: his career as a guitarist was ended when his finger was injured by a gunshot at a gig in Jackson in 1960 he became a heroin addict and dealer he was involved in running a brothel. In 1963, he was sentenced to two years for drug offences, and on release shifted operations to Los Angeles, where a contingent of exiled New Orleans musicians – led by arranger Harold Battiste – were making headway as session players.Rebennack became a member of the most revered Hollywood session group of all, the Wrecking Crew, playing with everyone from Sonny and Cher to Frank Zappa, but professed himself dissatisfied and homesick. Pining for New Orleans, he created the character of Dr John, loosely based on the legend of a 19th-century Senegalese freed slave turned New Orleans voodoo king, the music inspired by the disparate sounds Rebennack had heard at a spiritualist church in the Lower Ninth Ward. Here, he claimed, “Hindus and Buddhists, Jews, Christians, Masons, even voodoos” all worshipped together. He initially developed the idea for singer and actor Ronnie Barren, but when Barren balked, Rebennack took on the role, surrounding himself with fellow New Orleans expats and recording Gris Gris in late 1967.The music Rebennack and Battiste concocted for the album was so out of step with prevalent trends that Atlantic Records boss Ahmet Ertegun initially refused to release it. In Rebennack’s retelling, Ertegun dismissed him as a “boogaloo motherfucker” when their paths crossed in the studio. But when it finally did come out, Gris Gris oddly chimed with the times. It sounded like it was recorded live, which clicked with the shift away from psychedelia to something more earthy and traditional, exemplified by the rootsy Americana of the Band’s Music from Big Pink, on release the same year.Moreover, 1968 was the year that flower-power idealism curdled: it was a year of rioting, violence and upheaval, of Sympathy for the Devil rather than All You Need Is Love. That suited the album’s sinister atmosphere perfectly. Its flatly astonishing closer, I Walk on Gilded Splinters, offered up eight minutes of crawling malevolence and threatening braggadocio: if you took the title as a reference to needles, as plenty did, it sounded remarkably like a sneering, screw-you defence of Rebennack’s drug use, a distant Louisiana relation of the Velvet Underground’s Heroin. The live show Rebennack devised to support the album was a sensation, involving dancers wearing nothing but body paint, the singer disappearing in a puff of smoke and voodoo rituals. In St Louis, they were arrested after a band member bit the head off a chicken on stage.If anything, Gris Gris’ followup, Babylon, was even further out: the lyrics more political and apocalyptic, the time signatures off-kilter, many of the instruments made by the eccentric inventor and composer Harry Partch. Rebenack and Battiste fell out after its recording, the latter protesting that his former collaborator was “a hopeless drug addict”. Certainly, Rebenack’s life seemed to be unravelling. During the making of 1970’s Remedies, he was committed to a psychiatric hospital, but escaped. Released unfinished, the album was as otherworldly and evil-sounding as ever, as demonstrated by the supremely disturbing 17-minute Angola Anthem. On arrival in London shortly after its release, Rebenack was feted by fans from the rock aristocracy, Mick Jagger and Eric Clapton among them, but recording sessions on which both featured descended into chaos – “everything was confusemental”, as Rebenack characteristically put it – and The Sun, Moon \u0026amp Herbs was scythed from a projected triple album into a mere seven tracks.And yet Rebenack survived, even thrived. Pragmatically retiring the theatrical excesses and sonic weirdness of his Dr John persona, 1972’s Gumbo saw him charging masterfully through a selection of New Orleans R\u0026ampB classics – Professor Longhair’s Tipitina among them – while its follow-up, In the Right Place (1973), pared him with funk band the Meters and legendary producer Allen Toussaint to striking effect: the album was his biggest US hit and the raw groove of Right Place, Wrong Time his biggest single.It was a commercial peak he never scaled again. Desitively Bonnaroo attempted to repeat its predecessor’s formula with diminishing returns. Thereafter Rebenack’s albums became increasingly sporadic and variable in quality – 1979’s Tango Palace saw him unexpectedly, perhaps ill-advisedly, dabbling in disco – although he remained in demand as a sideman, working with everyone from Rickie Lee Jones to Van Morrison. He kicked drugs in 1989, and released In a Sentimental Mood. It wasa good album, his drawling vocals added real licentiousness to Makin’ Whoopee and a dissolute air to Accentuate the Positive, but a world away from Gris Gris and Babylon.He was finally persuaded to don his Mardi Gras headdress once more by Jason Pierce of Spiritualized, on whose 1997 album Ladies and Gentlemen We Are Floating in Space Rebennack guested. The same year he released Anutha Zone, supported by a starry cast of younger British musicians – Supergrass, Paul Weller, the Beta Band, Martin Duffy of Primal Scream – all clearly in thrall to the Dr John myth and the strangeness of his first three albums. In truth, Anutha Zone never really matched the innovation or menace that characterised his earlier work 2012’s Locked Down got him a lot closer, boasting a spacey, swampy production courtesy of the Black Keys’ Dan Auerbach and noticeably better songs, not least the fantastic Eleggua and Revolution.But in his later years, Rebennack seemed more comfortable as a simpler artist or a kind of living reliquary of New Orleans musical practice, cutting tributes to Duke Ellington and Louis Armstrong, collections of Johnny Mercer standards and two strong albums inspired by the devastation wrought on his home town by Hurricane Katrina. He wore his elder-statesman-of-the-Big-Easy status well, genially pleading drug-related amnesia when asked by interviewers about the late 60s. (“I was tore down all that time … It’s hard for me to look back … It all falls into some grim abyss.”) But if he claimed not to remember it himself, it’s still likely to be the thing he’s best remembered for: not as the traditionalist he was at heart, but a visionary artist who took local traditions and transformed them into music that sounded like nothing else on Earth."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0ace827823da61c96ca61870b635f98b24878b76/0_203_2997_1798/master/2997.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7463a82175d32e112443e075a757a2d9","title":"china other tiananmens podcast","story":"Hundreds of Chinese cities were involved in the student-led demos in 1989. ’s Lily Kuo discusses the uprisings outside of Beijing.

I have said all along that we would put to parliament our proposals on a customs union on a trade relationship and the dynamic protection of consumer and workers’ rights.“As our conference resolution agreed last September, we would then be prepared to put that to a public vote. We are not at the stage yet where parliament has actually voted on that. I think it would be much better if there was actually a general election.”Corbyn’s comments came as the internal Labour row about Brexit warmed up after the party’s disastrous result at last month’s European elections.There has also been unease from some Labour MPs and Jewish campaign groups about Forbes’ election. The new MP had previously apologised for liking a Facebook post that said Theresa May had a “Zionist slave masters agenda”, saying she had meant to “like” the video of children praying in solidarity with the victims of Christchurch attacks, not the accompanying views.The Times reported on Friday that the Labour MP Louise Ellman was calling for an investigation. She said: “These serious allegations must not be brushed under the carpet. Lisa Forbes should be suspended while the Labour party carries out an investigation.” The paper said the Labour MP Margaret Hodge had also put in an official complaint about Forbes.The Jewish Labour Movement said Forbes needed to go “far further” to demonstrate to the Jewish community that she was not racist. The Times reported that the group was calling for Forbes’ suspension.Phillips added: “Lisa ignored and endorsed antisemitic things, I’ll take her explanation and apology at face value and look forward to her proving, as others have, that actions not excuses alone can heal. But with every case the party’s values chip away and our ability to stand up against hate erodes.”Haigh, who worked closely with Forbes, said the emergence of the postings was a low point for the campaign. She said: “The whole campaign team were really upset when the posts that Lisa had mistakenly engaged with came to light and that was definitely a very difficult point for the campaign. But Lisa fully accepts they were wrong. She is really, really sorry.“I will be working with her to engage with the community and deepen her understanding and help her to be an ally in the future.”On Brexit, grassroots activists are organising for constituency Labour parties (CLPs) to pass motions demanding a second referendum in the run-up to the party’s autumn conference – the same process that laid the groundwork for the shift in policy last year.Mike Buckley, of the campaign group Labour for a Public Vote, said: “Hundreds of CLPs are already set to debate motions for conference calling for the party to back a new referendum, and to campaign for remain. We’re confident of winning in September – but would much prefer the party to shift now. If we don’t, we’ll lose more voters over the summer and we won’t be able to oppose no deal as effectively.”The Labour MP Clive Lewis, of the pressure group Love Socialism Hate Brexit, tweeted in response to the Peterborough result: “We’ve blunted our opponent’s momentum with an overwhelming home field advantage. Now we must arm our activists with the radical policies they need to finish the job in the long slog ahead, including a public vote”.Party insiders said tensions between Corbyn’s office and those pushing for a more full-throated anti-Brexit stance were running high.The shadow foreign secretary, Emily Thornberry, was dropped as Corbyn’s usual stand-in for prime minister’s questions this week after she spoke out about Labour’s strategy for the European elections. On polling day last month, Thornberry said Labour was “not clear on the one single thing that people wanted to hear”. She was replaced at the dispatch box by Rebecca Long-Bailey, a rising star on the left of the party and a staunch Corbyn loyalist.Meanwhile, there is growing chatter about the possibility of the party’s rules being changed to create a second deputy leader, alongside Tom Watson, who has pursued a vocal campaign to toughen Corbyn’s Brexit position.The proposal was mooted last year, but dropped at the last minute because of fears that a vote among party members could be used as a proxy referendum on Labour’s Brexit policy.A source close to Watson said: “Lashing out by expelling Alastair Campbell, publicly humiliating Emily Thornberry and challenging Tom for the deputy leadership is not the way to resolve this situation.“No matter how many punishment beatings are meted out, Tom will continue to speak out for what he believes in – a confirmatory ballot and a broad church Labour party that is avowedly pro-European.”However, one close ally of Corbyn suggested the idea of challenging Watson may just have been “loose talk” in the aftermath of the European elections shock, which was then being “actively briefed by Corbyn’s opponents” to “add to the sense of victimhood” on the right of the party.In Peterborough, amid cheers from supporters, Corbyn called for Tory leadership contenders to give the general public a chance to vote them out of office. “On the day that Theresa May ceases to be leader of the Conservative party, my message is to all the squabbling contenders for the Tory party leadership: bring it on. We are ready for a general election at any time,” he said.Farage left the count through a back door minutes before the result was announced. But Greene said the Brexit party had made a significant breakthrough, despite not winning. “We have shaken up British politics with none of the data that is necessary to win a parliamentary election,” he said. “We’ve had two parties ruling for decades that’s not happening any more.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5d3c86e9cd458d52cb9d1df72f9aeff669130a3f/0_117_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a6d4d36b224e09690fde67a3c0682148","title":"greens would not seek alliance in event of snap general election","story":"Other parties will have to come to us, says co-leader, as Greens enjoy rise in electoral fortunesA buoyant Green party would not automatically seek out a so-called progressive alliance with bigger left-leaning parties if there were a snap general election, the party’s co-leaders have said.Berry, who became co-leader with Bartley last September, taking over from Caroline Lucas, said: “There’s a very good case in many constituencies for us to be seen as being in the strongest position to beat the Brexit party.“The other parties would have to come to us, and we wouldn’t be giving anything away in talks. It isn’t our job this time to start anything. We already did that.”Overtures by the Greens to the Lib Dems and Labour before the 2017 election to avoid splitting the anti-Conservative vote through constituency-based pacts came to nothing, and a similar idea for the European elections last month fell foul of what Bartley called “game playing”.He said of any future deal: “On any issue where there’s common ground, we’re always willing to have a conversation. But at the same time, it’s going to have to be a very robust conversation. We are offering something very different.”The party has had a successful few months, thanks to a combination of some remain-minded supporters abandoning Labour, greater public awareness of environmental issues following the Extinction Rebellion protests, and the spread of ideas the party has championed, such as a four-day working week and a “green new deal”.The co-leaders said the surge was also the result of many years of patient organising at a local level, building up what Bartley called a “network of field organisers”.Berry said: “When the local election results came in, every time it was, ‘Yes, I’ve been there, Jonathan’s been there, I recognise those people, I know why they won.’ It wasn’t a protest vote, a flash in the pan, a single issue. It was our hard work all year round that’s leading to the results.”The conference this weekend in Scarborough will feature a celebration of recent successes, but also new policy proposals, including a formal endorsement of the global climate strike – a planned series of protests in September – spearheaded by the teenage Swedish activist Greta Thunberg.Other initiatives will be new ways to measure the strength of the economy and transport policies based around the £50bn-plus saved by scrapping HS2.Bartley said: “We think it’s time to pull the plug on the project and put that money into the rail revolution that we need – cross-country and city links, getting more freight on to rail, electrifying lines, plus new bus routes for rural communities.“And to find an alternative to short-haul flights, to get people out of their cars. If we’re going to make this move to a zero-carbon economy, we’re going to have to think very differently about this infrastructure. And we’re the only party putting forward this programme.”While much recent coverage of politics beyond the established parties has focused on the Brexit party – which is topping Westminster polls, in which the Greens are fifth – Berry and Barclay said the rise of Nigel Farage’s party presents an opportunity.“We’re the antidote to the Brexit party,” Barclay said. “We’re the party that hasn’t compromised. And all the other parties have compromised.“There’s an issue of trust. A lot of Labour voters came to us in the European elections because they were disappointed in Labour’s position on Brexit, and didn’t trust the Lib Dems because of their record.”If some of these switching voters backed the Greens in the local and European elections, it could become a habit, he argued: “Just going back three months, we knew that this could happen, but we were in a very different position. And this is the nature of politics now, you just do not know what is round the corner.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ce96b19333b21dcf30a17b70d1471d056ba079f2/0_443_1242_745/master/1242.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c9d960c0dfd93f00c260513fb8738b2e","title":"jeremy corbyn to drop social mobility as labour goal","story":"Party leader says idea has failed and calls instead for social justice commissionJeremy Corbyn is dropping the idea of social mobility as a goal for the next Labour government, saying he would instead create a “social justice commission” with the power to audit policy.In a shift being billed by Labour strategists as the rejection of 40 years of political consensus, Corbyn will say on Saturday that pursuing social mobility “has failed, even on its own terms”.Speaking at a Labour education event in Birmingham, the party leader will promise to replace the idea that the brightest, most talented young people must have the opportunity to succeed, with a demand that all children be allowed to flourish.“For decades we’ve been told that inequality doesn’t matter because the education system will allow talented and hard-working people to succeed whatever their background. But the greater inequality has become, the more entrenched it has become,” he is expected to say.“The idea that only a few talented or lucky people deserve to escape the disadvantage they were born into, leaving in place a social hierarchy in which millions are consigned to the scrap heap, results in the talents of millions of children being squandered.”Labour would replace the social mobility commission, which is chaired by Dame Martina Milburn, with a social justice commission, the party said.The watchdog would publish “social justice impact assessments” of government policies – including green papers, white papers and legislation. It would also publish advice to ministers about how best to pursue social justice.Corbyn’s move is the latest evidence of his team’s determination to reshape Labour – and underlines his belief that the Tony Blair and Gordon Brown governments did not do enough to shake up the economic system.Enhancing social mobility has been the aim of governments on both sides of the political ide. Blair’s close ally Peter Mandelson memorably said he was “intensely relaxed about people getting filthy rich as long as they pay their taxes” – though he has since admitted he has become more concerned about inequality.Labour is keen to show that its thinking has developed since Corbyn and his advisers drew up the 2017 general election manifesto.Theresa May made it her goal shortly after becoming prime minister to create a “great meritocracy” in Britain, not least by expanding grammar schools – a policy that was quietly dropped after the Tories lost their majority in 2017.At the Birmingham event the shadow education secretary, Angela Rayner, is expected to say: “Focusing only on a lucky few leaves inequality entrenched and those from disadvantaged backgrounds with few opportunities to get on. That was the damning verdict of the government’s own social mobility commission, which Tory ministers have shamefully ignored.”She will embrace the legacy of past Labour governments, saying: “The Tories like to talk about people like me who had a difficult start but got on in life as evidence that anyone can succeed on their own. But actually my life shows the exact opposite. Any success I have had is thanks to Labour governments that provided the council house, minimum wage, tax credits and Sure Start children’s centre that enabled me to achieve it.

Until now, the space station has only been used for research and development.“We are so excited to be part of Nasa as our home and laboratory in space transitions into being accessible to expanded commercial and marketing opportunities, as well as to private astronauts,” said astronaut Christina Koch, in a Nasa tweet.“Enabling a vibrant economy in low-Earth orbit has always been a driving element of the space station program, and will make space more accessible to all Americans,” Koch said. “Transitioning toward this new model of business is an important step to allow Nasa to move full speed ahead in landing the first woman and the next man on the moon.”The new directive will allow private astronauts to spend up to 30 days in low-Earth orbit aboard the ISS through trips planned by private companies. Nasa said it believes it can accommodate up to two privately funded, short-duration missions a year with, essentially, space tourists.Private astronauts will have to reimburse the government for the costs to the space station, including $11,250 a day for life support and toilets, and $22,500 a day for food, air and medical supplies. However, astronauts will have to pay a private company to get to the space station, and those tickets will probably cost millions.Eventually, Nasa hopes the space station will be just one of several “commercial and free-flying habitable destinations in low-Earth orbit”. For now, Nasa is making one space station port available for commercial uses “for a finite period of time”.The move is part of a broader push by the Trump administration to end government funding for the ISS, and allow commercial enterprise to fund what is now astronauts’ home in space.“Nasa is opening the International Space Station to commercial opportunities and marketing these opportunities as we’ve never done before,” the chief financial officer, Jeff DeWit, said in New York, according to the BBC.Other details, such as exactly who would be eligible to buy a ticket to the ISS, were not disclosed.Last year, a committee formed by the Trump administration floated the idea of allowing astronauts to appear in marketing, such as on cereal boxes, for commercials to be filmed in the space station or even for extra-terrestrial rover vehicles to have logos in the way that racing cars do. The committee is headed by an attorney who works in government relations for the space tech firm Maxar Technologies.“Commercial companies will play an important role both here in low-Earth orbit and around the moon, working with Nasa to test technologies train astronauts and develop a sustainable human presence,” said Koch.Astronauts have lived aboard the space station for more than 18 years conducting thousands of experiments. The ISS costs Nasa roughly $3bn to $4bn a year to operate, according to the Verge."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5ab309586e55bd02f5ee85455752643cf5918b5e/0_2614_3370_2021/master/3370.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=28f1928947d8c7bea65c453b3c93bace","title":"share your experiences of sure start childrens centres","story":"Whether you helped set up the programme in your area or your family used a centre near you, we would like to hear your storiesThe flagship Sure Start programme has saved the NHS millions of pounds through the benefits it has brought to children including some of the most deprived areas and reducing the number of those taken to hospital, according to a study.Research by the Institute for Fiscal Studies “found that where Sure Start offered high levels of service in poor neighbourhoods in England, visits to hospital to treat injuries fell among all children of primary school age, and by a third of all 11-year-olds”.Tracy Brabin, the shadow early years minister, said: “This research shows the critical role Sure Start plays in children’s health, as well as their development.

While true prevalence can be tricky to determine, data published by NHS Digital shows episodes of anaphylactic shock in England due to adverse food reactions rose steadily from 1,362 in 2011-12 to 1,922 in 2016-17. The culprit, some scientists have suggested, could be substances known as advanced glycation endproducts, or AGEs.AGEs occur naturally in the body, but they are found in high levels in highly processed foods, as well as other sources such as cooked meats. They form when sugars react with proteins or lipids. High levels of AGEs in the body, which it has been suggested can result from consuming AGE-rich foods, have previously been linked to a number of conditions including diabetes and rheumatoid arthritis.Now a small study by researchers in Italy has shown that children with food allergies have higher levels of AGEs in their bodies than healthy children without allergies. Children with respiratory allergies showed no such differences. The team also found that children with higher levels of AGEs consumed more food containing such substances.“They are consuming a lot of snacks, a lot of hamburgers, a lot of French fries, a lot of commercial foods full of AGEs,” said Roberto Berni Canani of the University of Naples, who led the research presented at the annual meeting of the European Society for Paediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition in Glasgow.Canani said the team’s research using cells suggested AGEs might directly interact with with immune cells, and they also seemed to have a detrimental effect on the gut barrier.However, the study is small – involving just 23 children with food allergies, 16 with respiratory allergies and 22 healthy children without allergies – and does not prove that consuming more junk food, or having higher levels of AGEs, causes food allergies. What’s more, as Canani pointed out, many other factors are thought to be involved in the rise in food allergies, with possibilities including problems with the gut microbiome.John Warner, professor of paediatrics at Imperial College London, who was not involved in the research, said the latest research was too small to take into account other factors that could be behind the observed link.“I could suggest a number of more plausible explanations for the findings,” he said, noting that children eating a lot of junk food are less likely to be eating a Mediterranean diet high in fresh fruit, vegetables and fish that has been shown to reduce the risk of allergy. “There are also likely to be other differences in lifestyle of those on a so-called high junk intake including greater exposure to tobacco smoke and other pollutants,” he said, adding that psychosocial circumstances might also be important.Dr Andrew Clark, a consultant in paediatric allergy at Addenbrooke’s hospital, agreed more research was needed, noting that while it might be worth avoiding junk food for many health reasons, it was too soon to say that food allergies was one of them."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6b0d7a069b47937d6f4d878f2c42a365370a1c19/27_0_2328_1397/master/2328.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6bd94c31209cb9abf0a42a2c371fd699","title":"eoin morgan england openers bangladesh cricket world cup","story":"They came into the World Cup as the arguably the most feared opening batting partnership around, having spent the past two years tearing up new ball attacks to give England enviable starts.But two games into the tournament, Jason Roy and Jonny Bairstow find themselves needing to consider the early deployment of spin – a challenge which their captain, Eoin Morgan, expects to continue against Bangladesh on Saturday.Wet weather in Cardiff and a green-tinged pitch that has spent the past two days mainly under cover would normally point to seam from both ends first-up.But with the Bangladesh captain, Mashrafe Mortaza, having tossed the new ball to off-spinner Mehidy Hasan in both their opening fixtures so far – the victory over South Africa and the near-miss against New Zealand - it would not be a massive surprise if the tactic was repeated once more against the hosts.And why not? South Africa’s Imran Tahir removed Bairstow caught behind in the first over of last week’s opening game – a ploy Faf du Plessis claimed to have devised 12 months out from the match - while Shadab Khan trapped Roy lbw on the sweep to kickstart Pakistan’s march to victory.Both men are leg-spinners, of course, but if Mashrafe wants to truly replicate this movement away from the right-handers, rather than Mehidy’s off-breaks turning into them, then he does also have the left-arm of Shakib Al Hasan at his disposal.Two days of rain have hampered England’s training in the lead-up to Saturday’s match. As well as moving nets indoors, where the true bounce can be misleading, it has meant that the one area in need of improvement since Monday’s Trent Bridge defeat – fielding – has been denied additional outdoor work.Morgan was confident that his side remain well-drilled, however, and fancies the days off between matches sees them refreshed.His own approach here was to “watch a lot of horse racing” and, bar checking the scores at the end of each day, get away from too many thoughts about cricket.Clear minds will certainly be required. The captain insisted that defeat by Bangladesh would not prompt “panic stations” but, given Australia and India lie in wait towards the back end of the group stage, they could do without making them must-win matches by suffering a second defeat here. As well as a collective response in the field, Jofra Archer must also come back from his first setback in England colours. While the fast bowler did not bowl terribly in Nottingham, figures of none for 79 and a fine for an “audible obscenity” serve as a reminder that, for all his talents, he remains a newcomer at this level.Learning from defeat was very much a theme of Morgan’s pre-match press conference and typical of a captain who prefers to break cricket down into its processes and skills, rather than issue rallying war cries before a big match.That said, the marketing tagline for England’s World Cup campaign has been “Express Yourself”, something Morgan devised himself. The question now is whether this sentiment can truly transfer to the pressure of tournament cricket, or a more gnarled approach might be required at times.“It is going to be a difficult game,” Morgan added. “Bangladesh are a good side. I think people underestimate them. But we certainly don’t.”The World Cup suffered its first washout on Friday, Pakistan and Sri Lanka picking up a point each after their match at Bristol was abandoned without a ball being bowled."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/965058585dde04841c3e41e11371403d2560563f/252_0_5173_3103/master/5173.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=da105c771059de18ca75568f6ec06c2f","title":"talking horses mud loving safe voyage can land haydock prize horse racing tips","story":"Sir Dancealot had a productive time last year and one can easily see why he would start favourite at Haydock for the John Of Gaunt, the feature race on this low-key Saturday. But he has had a few chances on soft without ever seeming to enjoy the experience and it will be properly testing at Haydock.A few of his rivals make much more appeal on this ground but Safe Voyage (3.35) looks the pick of them. A Listed race winner over this course and distance last time, he has shown a deep love for the mud.1.25 Beverley It has been an unusually slow start to the season for Richard Hannon, whose 16 winners in May is about half what he usually manages, but this last week has been a lot more encouraging. We can hope for a revival from his Qaysar, who is winless for over a year but showed promise in a much hotter Ascot race last time.1.45 Haydock A refugee from Luca Cumani’s yard, Prejudice has moved across Newmarket to join the in-form David Simcock stable and should be able to show a lot of improvement now that he’s three. He’s a brother to the classy Postponed and a half-brother to God Given, who went so close in the Lancashire Oaks over this course and distance both of them were comfortable on a soggy surface.2.00 Beverley Moon Of Love is the unknown factor here but this is a stiff task for a filly’s first outing and Execlusive could make her experience tell. From the Archie Watson yard that does so well with its juveniles, she showed talent in scoring here last month and one imagines the trainer already had this target in mind.2.10 Newmarket It took him a couple of runs to find his form but there was a lot to like about Gabrial The Wire’s success at Doncaster and he may be able to make it a quick double from a 6lb higher mark. He wouldn’t want dramatic amounts of overnight rain but the forecast for Newmarket is not so bad as elsewhere.2.25 Haydock The comfortable winner of Listed races on her last three starts, True Self is the sort of Willie Mullins-trained mare that one does not lightly oppose. This Group Three race should be easily within the scope of the reformed hurdler and the ground has come right for her now.2.45 Newmarket A fortnight ago, What A Welcome was going past his rival in a close finish at Goodwood but the line came about an inch too early. That was a big step forward on his seasonal return and shows that Pat Chamings’s handicapper, a prolific winner last season, is ready to go in again. This stiffer track should help.3.00 Haydock The worry here is Danzeno, who hacked up in a handicap on Sunday and would be a danger to all if able to run to a similar level just six days later. That is asking a lot of the eight-year-old, however, so Stake Acclaim is probably the way to go, having had a more conservative 57 days off since his first success of the year.3.15 Beverley If Moon Of Love lets him down, Richard Fahey may still have a two-year-old winner on the card with Summer Sands, who was green before running on into third in a hot race at York’s Dante meeting. Oh Purple Reign was runner-up in the Woodcote eight days ago but this step back in trip is not certain to help and nor is the forecast rain."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/781ef30150b9d481ecc85c5274362596d2b29454/0_94_1615_969/master/1615.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3b5dc82409021ea5aa55ae010862d375","title":"scenic cycle routes europe readers tips","story":"Our tipsters weave their way through mountain ranges and alongside rivers and the sea, mixing family-friendly trails with thrilling climbs and downhill stretchesCycling round all or part of Lake Constance delivers maximum scenic delights for minimum effort.

It’s not always good for the cause Reese Witherspoon has been sharing snaps of her Big Little Lies castmates – and, possibly, actual mates – on Instagram for months now. Her 17.8 million followers have seen them going bowling, catching a movie and goofing around for “Galentine’s Day”. Last week, however, came the squad-shot supreme: Witherspoon, Zoë Kravitz, Laura Dern, Shailene Woodley, Nicole Kidman and new addition Meryl Streep arm-in-arm and laughing it up, as they posed for photographers at the NYC season two premiere. Her caption read: “The power of sisterhood and friendship is limitless! So proud to work with these remarkable ladies. Can’t wait to share Season 2 of @biglittlies with y’all! June 9th on @hbo”.That down-home “y’all”, the girl power platitudes and all of it wrapped up with a seamless plug? To say Witherspoon’s Insta is “on brand” hardly begins to cover it. Big Little Lies’ movie-star cast has always been a draw, but since debuting on US television in 2017, it has positioned itself within a sorority of shows that not only centre on female friendship, but depict these relationships as the ultimate in glamorous empowerment. In Amazon Prime Video’s The Bold Type, junior employees of a Cosmopolitan-like women’s magazine love, laugh and like each other’s posts in an idealised version of New York. In BBC Three’s Clique, a group of students in Edinburgh experience an accelerated version of complex, intriguing female friendship.The settings differ but the message is the same one we have been absorbing since Carrie Bradshaw first got splashed on a Manhattan sidewalk: you may have the adoring family, the fulfilling career and the designer wardrobe, but who are you without your girls? And what Sex and the City originated has now been perfected: Big Little Lies pulls off glossy TV feminism with all the type-A aplomb of Witherspoon’s character, Madeline, organising a PTA fundraiser.You would be forgiven for assuming this was a show about something entirely different. The first season was adapted from Liane Moriarty’s 2014 novel by Ally McBeal creator David E Kelley and told the story of a murder investigation in a wealthy Californian town. By the end of the first season, however, that mystery element had been sidelined, and in the opening episodes of season two, it’s barely even paid lip service to. When we return to Monterey, on the first day of a new school year, the lie told by the central characters doesn’t seem quite so “big little” any more. The events of last season are important, but mainly because of how they threaten to drive a wedge between the five women, and much less because of any palpable anxiety over the police or Perry’s mother, Mary Louise (Streep), discovering the truth about his death.Meanwhile, season two’s stabs at social commentary are tellingly facile. There is Bonnie’s visiting mother (Crystal Fox) briefly skirting around whether her daughter’s feelings of isolation might be connected to her being the only black person in town. Or the line from Madeline’s daughter, Abigail (Kathryn Newton), about college kids “mulling a sex change”. It’s the kind of dismissive jibe that a grumpy middle-aged dad would come up with, and sounds odd coming from the mouth of a supposedly cool and conscientious teen. Elsewhere, the dialogue is as quippy and emotionally astute as ever, but the best scenes aren’t those that further the plot they’re those in which the women are together in any configuration: bonding, or bitching, or bonding-through-bitching.And if you are not here for those central relationships, then you must be here for all their luxe lifestyle trappings. Celeste, Renata and Madeline’s beachfront mansions have been the subject of numerous property porn write-ups in interiors magazines, while Monterey itself has become an increasingly popular destination, much to the delight of the city’s tourism officials, who have devised special tours. The opening credits sequence, featuring the five women driving central California’s spectacular coastal routes is clearly also a boon for Sky Atlantic’s official show sponsors, car manufacturers Volvo.There’s more: the season one soundtrack album reached No 1 on the US’s AmericanaFolk chart, and this season, HBO is partnering with $215-a-month, women-only private members’ club The Wing on screening events and a “custom retail capsule” comprising items from female-owned clothing and accessories brands. All in all, it is something of an inside joke that in season two Madeline has started a new career as a real-estate agent: “Oh my gosh!” she tells Bonnie (Kravitz), “in Monterey it is like printing money! I should have done this years ago!” It is difficult to determine the level of intention, but by depicting gal pals in an Insta-filtered glow, Big Little Lies may have stumbled – or strutted – on to TV’s most compelling commercial opportunity yet: female friendship as a commodity.Product placement and sponsorship are not new, but as on-demand television services render the traditional 30-second spot obsolete, both brands and TV production companies must get creative. Since Big Little Lies’ viewers are being sold to all the time, in ways more or less overt, it makes sense that the show often has the look of high-end advertising. Or, more specifically, of sponsored content from an influencer’s Instagram feed. Most specifically, it looks like one of Reese Witherspoon’s posts promoting her “steeped in southern charm” lifestyle brand, Draper James. (Last summer Draper James launched its new “Madeline” dress, inspired by Witherspoon’s character via an Insta-posted pic of Witherspoon modelling the dress on set.) All of which contributes to a fake sense of closeness between the viewer and its characters.“The intimacy and bond of strong female friendships is a rich emotional territory for brands because, if they get it right, they will gain value and loyalty, creating customers par excellence,” explains Dr Cui Su, former advertising creative and current head of advertising at Falmouth University. “Consumer feminism is so trendy at the moment that the girlfriend’s gaze is much more powerful than the male gaze. It’s considered un-feminist to care about what a man thinks, but for your circle of girlfriends that’s a different story you want their approval.”Nowhere does this trickle-down “femvertising” dynamic play out with more sinister elegance than on social media, where brands mine and infiltrate women’s social networks. “It’s pretty much Facebook and Instagram’s business model,” says Cui. “As a girlfriend, it’s almost obligatory to ‘like’ all your female friends’ posts. Platforms profit by selling this engagement to advertisers so their algorithms encourage this mutual female surveillance by pushing the visibility of such posts in the feed.” And “mutual female surveillance” could almost work as the town motto for gossipy Monterey, couldn’t it? At the very least, Draper James should turn it into a $40 slogan T-shirt.Of course, Big Little Lies is not the only popular TV show to have built such successful “synergy”, as the branding execs like to say. When Stranger Things returns for a third season next month, you may notice Will Byers, Eleven and chums are more than usually thirsty for New Coke, a famously failed recipe tweak that Coca-Cola withdrew from the market after only three months. It was Netflix and the Duffer brothers who approached the soft drinks giant with the idea for a limited run of New Coke cans – not vice versa, according to Barry Smyth, Netflix’s head of global partnership marketing. The tie-in suggested itself because of season three’s setting during the 1985 New Coke era, plus it fits perfectly with the show’s defining nostalgia for a 1980s childhood. Nostalgia may also be the secret sweetener in Baskin-Robbins’s two new Stranger Things-inspired flavours: Eleven’s Heaven (waffle cone-flavoured ice-cream with chocolate-coated sugar cone pieces) and Upside Down Pralines (chocolate ice-cream with praline pecans and a chocolate caramel-flavoured ribbon).These mechanisms are most effective not with pre-teens, or now-grown children of the 80s, but with the Big Little Lies target audience. They complement a sales technique that has been used on this demographic for decades. According to one psychological theory of advertising, “compensatory consumption” is triggered when we are presented with an image of perfection – typically, the airbrushed body of a model – made to feel inadequate by comparison, and then prompted to compensate for perceived inadequacies with a purchase. It’s the oldest trick in Don Draper’s Big Book of Selling Stuff to Women.What’s new about the Big Little Lies model is how it roots out not our insecurities about our looks, but deeper insecurities about the quality of our intimate relationships and our associated self-worth. The most sophisticated and successful femvertising campaigns – such as Boots’ Here Come the Girls, or Dove’s Real Beauty – do both and are thus able to trigger compensatory consumption without ceding the feminist high ground. Big Little Lies, however, seems to focus on that latter, deeper kind of push-pull engagement. On Instagram, BLL fans are simultaneously invited to feel a part of the cool clique, as cast members share intimate behind-the-scenes photos, and pointedly excluded. Being one of 383,000 followers to like a photo is not the same as being one of “these remarkable ladies” in said photo, is it?Does all this undermine the various claims made for Big Little Lies as empowering TV? (New York Magazine called it “a commentary on gender bias”). Professor Rosalind Gill of London’s City University is currently collaborating with Dr Sara De Benedictis at Brunel and Dr Bridget Conor at King’s on a paper about “feminist gloss” in television. “The ‘gloss’ idea speaks both to the emptying out of feminism as something superficial and the high production values,” says Gill. She feels ambivalent about the shows in question: “It is really good to see women’s friendships being foregrounded and forms of relating that are not – or not only – about meanness, rivalry or competitiveness. At the same time, I think the shows invite us into a highly limited world of privilege and glossy empowerment that doesn’t suggest any need to change the structures of racialised, patriarchal capitalism.”While gloss can be a viewing pleasure unto itself, the fact of the Monterey Five’s nice clothes, nice cars and (likely) All Access membership at The Wing doesn’t make their emotional lives any less interesting. Even more than in season one, season two contains its own critique of the ultimate emptiness of consumerism and materialist values. In an early scene, Mary Louise (Streep) introduces a series theme of “the wanters” v “the contented”, when she says to Madeline: “Y’know, there are people in life who content themselves with what they have, and then there are others who just … who just want.” Later, Renata’s husband Gordon (Jeffrey Nordling) enrages her by saying: “We’re creatures of want. Me, you, especially you.” Even as it turns friendship into the ultimate lifestyle accessory, Big Little Lies knows that the bonds of female solidarity can’t ever be entirely commodified, because real friendship and community are beyond price. But at its chardonnay-swilling best, Big Little Lies also explores another connected, less trite truth of contemporary human nature: we know money can’t buy love, so why doesn’t that stop us from trying?Season two of Big Little Lies starts Sunday 9, 2am, Sky Atlantic repeated Monday 10 June, 9pm, Sky Atlantic"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a268f4a6a50686132ba9a189dfdf1b23c3af0a8f/0_1238_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=13f3d8d3eb30b9f945fb40b739ffce57","title":"no such thing overshare hosts britain most candid podcasts julia davis vicki pepperdine fi glover jane garvey","story":"From Julia Davis and Vicki Pepperdine to Fi Glover and Jane Garvey, double (and triple) act podcasters share the stories behind their irreverent showsAs Twitter became too angry and the news cycle too tense, it is no accident that I fell face first into the unfettered joy of podcasts – light, illuminating chat and people enthusing about their passions. I listen to them in the dark, just as I used to listen to DJ Tom Ferrie on BBC Radio Scotland in the 80s. There is something so soothing about a warm duvet, a blacked out room and a link between you and some strangers who are on your wavelength. Now my radio is the iPhone under my pillow.I find that podcasts are so personal, they are actually quite difficult to “sell” to a friend. For example, I love Something Rhymes With Purple presented by Gyles Brandreth and Susie Dent. It’s a podcast about semantics. No, come back. It’s brilliant! Here are two people who love language and take enormous pleasure in discussing how “scurryfunge” means to rush about tidying before guests arrive, or how “pandiculating” is stretching and yawning at the same time. Brandreth, of course, is also a hive of royal anecdotes and eccentric off-topic chat. I have loved him since I was a little girl when he wrote practical joke books, teaching children how to make an apple-pie bed. Now, I can listen in as he and Dent discuss their student days and family lives.As a Radio 4 presenter, I often think double-act, chitchat podcasts like these capture the essence of how studios feel before recording starts. Before people begin to read scripts, self-edit or worry they are not keeping things broad enough. With podcasts the hosts can be as obscure or gorgeously self-indulgent as they desire. Only the most cynical podcasters tailor their content for mass-market numbers the best ones have a “This is us: like it, or shove off” attitude.Dear Joan And Jericha, with Vicki Pepperdine and Julia Davis, is so wilfully filthy and dark that I think twice before sharing it with friends. Here the world’s worst, least sympathetic agony aunts take on bleak sexual problems, such as what to do if your partner only wants to kick your vagina with his athlete’s foot-ridden toes while he reads the rugby results. It makes Davis’s previous television output look like The Good Life. It is wholly strange, clever on a dozen levels and makes me gasp for air laughing.I’ve been a guest on Fortunately... with Fi Glover and Jane Garvey, which was marvellous as I was a big fan, and I can confirm that this podcast really is just two friends chuntering waspishly about fellow BBC talent and their own lives. They don’t set out to be cool, shocking or candid, and by default they are all three.My very favourite podcast has one host, but a changing roster of guests. On Looks Unfamiliar, Tim Worthington and friends ruminate over obscure things from the 70s and 80s that they remember, but, vitally, no one else seems to. (Not Spacehoppers or Um Bongo – more like Big Daddy’s thwarted Saturday morning show, or the Boots Global Collection makeup range). I do not know a single other soul who listens to it, and I’m happy that way.Podcasts can be far ruder, more irreverent, sillier or unfocused than any other medium. They can be uploaded to a global platform sounding like a bit of a dog’s dinner, the presenter streaming with cold and the sound levels thoroughly wonky. As a listener, I care little. I know these teams are doing this mainly for love and for the happiness of being heard. And we get it for free – normal 21st-century rules and expectations do not apply here.It’s exciting. We live in interesting times. If I ever get out of bed, I may possibly see them. Grace DentActors and writers Julia Davis and Vicki Pepperdine have been friends for more than 20 years, working together often. Mainstays of the British comedy scene, they are probably best known for the black comedy Nighty Night. Their podcast, Dear Joan And Jericha, in which the duo play local radio agony aunts who tackle listeners’ sex, life and relationship issues in an entirely inappropriate manner, became a near instant word-of-mouth hit when it was launched a year ago, and went on to win best comedy at the 2019 British Podcast Awards.Series one (a snappy eight 20-minute episodes) calls to mind the absurd sex tips from women’s magazines, mixed in with your mum’s most insensitive and outrageous off-hand comments. In true Davis and Pepperdine form, it is filthy. It’s not just the hilarious improvised asides that have won the podcast a multitude of fans, but the way it openly addresses messy sex, bodily functions and anatomy, as well as emphasising that it’s not always men who are responsible for exacerbating women’s insecurities.Why did you want to start a podcast?Vicki: Well, we didn’t even think about a podcast in the beginning. We were just playing around with ideas.Julia: The characters emerged. We didn’t want anyone to tell us what to do, which is what happens in TV.What are your red lines – where wouldn’t you go?J: It comes down to the tone of it. You can go almost anywhere. But you can listen back and go: “That’s actually really sick and distressing.” It’s whether or not you are still finding it funny.V: I think there’s something about talking very openly about what, for years, has been a sort of no-go, gynae area – young women in particular seem to be emboldened by it.Who are your podcastradio heroes?V: I listen to My Dad Wrote A Porno. I think that’s great.J: Derek and Clive. I’m a massive Peter Cook fan. Obviously they’re not podcasters. I think, similarly to Vicki, I didn’t listen to a lot of podcasts. On a train I always just want to look at people and listen to their conversations.What has been your favourite episode to date?J: That’s a really hard one. The godson one we quite liked. I certainly can’t remember whole episodes. We like it when we get a bit carried away describing men. Going into the detail of their physicality.V: Inappropriate appraisals. We try to group the subjects, so there’s not three vaginas in every episode.J: Although there probably is a vagina in every episode.Is there such a thing as an overshare?J: I would say no.V: I don’t think we could ever overshare with one another. It’s a bond of trust.J: I would say that, with any really close friend, you should be able to say anything. Whereas our parents’ generation – I’m sure my mum, who is no longer here, didn’t have anything like that. And that must be quite horrible. Because you want someone to say, “I get things.” But we’ve definitely recorded things that we think, “That’s gone sick in a way we don’t find funny.”V: We don’t censor ourselves when recording, and then sometimes it’s come out in a way that might be misinterpreted. So we edit.When can we expect the new series to be out?V: We are towards the end of recording it, so we don’t know exactly yet. But it will happen. That’s as precise as we can be. We record it in Julia’s kitchen. We thought it was going to be just for us, and it turns out people like it.Broadcasters Jane Garvey and Fi Glover are the co-hosts of Radio 4’s hit podcast Fortunately... Each week they share musings on their lives, from pet deaths and garden hose repairs to the trouble with HRT patches, before being joined by a radio, TV or podcast star such as political journalist Laura Kuenssberg or actor and comedian London Hughes. It’s like sitting in on a tipsy conversation in a BBC green room.Radio 4 listeners will be familiar with both hosts – Garvey presents Women’s Hour and Glover The Listening Project – but the podcast is far more intimate than the station’s usual output, earning it a devoted fanbase.What is the story of your friendship?Jane: I knew of Fi for a while before we met. We both worked at 5 Live but I avoided her. I didn’t like her because I was quite jealous. I thought Fi was a bit of a metropolitan know-it-all. But I knew she was good.Fi: Well, I’ve always loved and admired Jane. We worked in the same station but were at different ends of the day. Then we hosted the Radio Festival together in 2013. We just had such a laugh.J: There’s a low bar set for women being funny, so I think the fact that we didn’t need scripts and were moderately amusing was enough to gain us a reputation as a pair of wisecracking broads. Eventually, we recorded a pilot.What can you get away with on the podcast that you can’t on the radio?F: Quite a lot actually. They’d never let us take the piss out of each other if we were doing the Today programme together.J: Not much joshery on that show is there?F: That’s the joy of podcasts. There’s a very clearly defined structure to a radio show. Podcasting zigs and zags all over the place, and I think that suits the way lots of women talk to their friends.Did you expect the show to become so popular?J: Yes, we were expecting massive success. Absolutely massive.F: Come on, let’s leave it Jane.J: OK, yes, sorry. To be perfectly honest, I’m angry that I didn’t spot the obvious gap in the market. We talk about serious things, but we also talk utter shit, as you do with your female friends down the pub. The fact that no one spotted that’s what women wanted – because for years, women had to put up with just men talking at them – is almost a failure of radio.Who is your dream guest to have on the show?F: I’d do Debbie Harry.J: Deborah, she prefers. I know because she was on Women’s Hour. I couldn’t speak, I was agog, one of the worst interviews of my life.F: Was she worth it?J: I don’t know, because I couldn’t think of a single thing to ask her. So yes, I could make amends for that terrible interview.Do you show different personalities in the podcasts?J: I’m substantially more restrained on the Hour. On the podcast we give away more of our real selves. Like that I’m a hopeless case, a nervous wreck, I’m riddled with anxiety, irritable bowel syndrome, single.You have become these unlikely role models…F: I don’t think either of us would say we’re role models but we’re working women who have managed to produce families in various shapes and sizes. There’s nothing perfect about either of our lives – and perhaps that’s refreshing.Monty Onanuga and Sadia Azmat were friends well before they became the co-hosts of No Country For Young Women, a BBC Sounds podcast discussing life and love as British women of colour. It is now in its second series each week they are joined by a special guest (model Munroe Bergdorf, comedian Nish Kumar and singer Grace Carter have all made appearances) covering topics such as polyamory, dating as a Muslim, self-care and body positivity.The joy of the show lies in the duo’s rapport. If it sounds like listening to a conversation between old friends over a cup of tea, that’s because it pretty much is – the young women used to work together in banking. Azmat went on to become a standup comedian, and was spotted by the BBC. They asked her to propose a co-host for a possible podcast, and she knew just the person to call.Why do you record in a cafe?Monty: For access to food.Sadia: So it’s less formal and more impromptu. We don’t want to sound presentery.M: We’re not broadcasters by trade, so a studio would make us feel like it’s work. But it doesn’t feel like work when we catch up in a coffee house and have a chinwag.Monty, you regularly speak frankly about sex. Why do you feel so passionately about doing this?M: Among my friends I am the one who speaks most graphically about sex. It winds me up that it’s OK for men to enjoy sex and share their experiences. But if a woman does so she’s “easy”. I don’t subscribe to that narrative and I want to encourage young people to understand what turns us on. In fact, I want all people to do that – I am pretty sure I have some aunties who don’t know where their clitoris is and some uncles who haven’t found it. We’re all discussing mental health at the minute well, a good shag works wonders.You still work at an investment bank – have the two worlds collided?M: When we first started the podcast, I used to catch the train home with our chief operating officer, and of course we’d talk. I told him about the show and he promoted it on the office newsletters, even though I’d just spoken to Sadia about how I’d given someone a blowjob.Sadia, you’re a Muslim woman with a podcast that discusses sex. Has this made you the subject of criticism from the community?S: Not much. Although I did recently write an article (“Horny Muslim women like me aren’t supposed to exist during Ramadan”) and got a couple of “you’re going to burn in hell” type of messages. All I said in the article is that trying to keep sex and sexuality hush-hush is not good.I do like challenging the image that Muslim women are all covered up, repressed and don’t enjoy sex. I provide balance. But I’m not a representative of Islam. I’m just me.M: We’ve grown up in cultures that tell you, “Don’t do this, don’t do that,” but we live in a country where we’re a mishmash of cultures and you can find what’s right for you.S: The pressure isn’t fair. I’m tired of being a brown person who is not allowed to fail, and has to be perfect to everyone all the time, when people are fluid, and who they are and what they need changes.I’m interested in the idea that being mediocre as a woman of colour is a revolutionary actS: Yes! It reminds me of something Chris Rock said. On his street he lives with Jay-Z, one of the most successful rappers in the world, and Mary J Blige, one of the most successful singers in the world. And his white neighbour is a dentist. It would be great to not have to work twice as hard.M: We shouldn’t settle for mediocre, though.S: I guess it’s more about failure. As an Asian child I wasn’t allowed to get Cs and Ds. I had to get As.M: Right. We should be allowed to discuss failure. On our podcast we do.S: And without doom and gloom. Neither of us is crying about the cards we’ve been dealt.Marvin Abbey, Keith Dube and Tazer Black have known each other for so long, it’s not quite clear exactly how they first met. But since 2016, they have co-hosted 3 Shots Of Tequila, an unfiltered, banter-packed weekly podcast where the conversation can go anywhere. A typical episode might flit between international politics and celebrity news, all the while discussing the presenters’ own lives as young men navigating sex, family and friendships.They also act as agony uncles to their listeners, who send in dilemmas for the trio to solve, and the conversation continues online under the hashtag #3ShotsofTequila. They have created a dedicated community that over the last three years has helped them sell out Shepherd’s Bush Empire, tour international music festivals, and land themselves an exclusive streaming deal with Spotify.Why do you think the podcast is so popular?Keith: Because it’s real, and organic. We are ourselves. When we were putting it together, the image I had in mind was James May, Richard Hammond and Jeremy Clarkson. If you look at the dynamic between them, whatever they talk about is interesting because of how they interact. We can’t say we speak for all men but we definitely speak for some.Marvin: The trendy ones. It’s a black voice as well – I feel, in the UK, the voice of the youth and of certain groups isn’t heard on podcasts.You’re friends in real life. How do you keep it fresh? Don’t you get sick of each other?Tazer: We are sick of each other.K: It’s because we’re around each other so much that we always have fresh content. Marv can tell a story and I can say, “I was there, but that’s not how it happened.”As a voice of youth, especially young black men, do you feel any pressure to represent?K: Nah, we just be ourselves. We want to show anyone who listens that you can be yourself.M: I feel like, if you think about it too much it’ll mess you up.T: We represent people from our area. A lot of our fans have grown up with us so they’ve heard our struggles.M: It’s why we can’t lie. People know us too well we’d never get away with it.You guys talk a lot about sex and relationships on your podcastM: If I’m active, we’re all active.K: Excuse me, I’m a pillar of my community.What do your families think of the podcast?K: My sister listens my mum’s not allowed.M: My mum and dad do not.M: They are now, but they don’t listen. My dad asked me where to find it. I told him to search for BBC Proms.K: My dad asked me, “How do you listen?”, too. I thought, “What do you mean how do I listen? You don’t!” Mind your business, Dad.Since Ed Miliband resigned as leader of the Labour party in 2015, he has been steadily transforming his reputation from unrelatable gaffe-magnet, to an insightful, warm and genuinely funny media personality. The key to this shift is Reasons To Be Cheerful, the podcast he co-hosts with broadcaster Geoff Lloyd where, far from the grip of political advisers, Miliband gets to be himself.Each week, Reasons focuses on ideas and social movements that might make the world a better place, from universal basic income to robust transgender rights. It includes appearances from academics and activists, while also providing ample time for the ramblings of Lloyd and Miliband, whose warmth, rapport and gentle ribbing of each other has helped to catapult the show to the top of the podcast charts. Alongside the regular podcast is a live show that travels around the country.Tell me about your friendshipEd: It’s what Geoff’s wife calls our “late-in-life friendship”.Geoff: It’s the first great bromance of the 21st century.E: Other than Brangelina?G: I don’t think that’s a bromance, Ed. More straight romance. Anyway, I interviewed Ed on a radio show in the run-up to the 2015 general election. It was considered one of the best interviews Ed had done.E: I was nearly human in it.G: Eighteen months later I was thinking of starting a podcast and thought, “I know who will have some time on his hands.”Everything felt a bit depressing – the country ided, the insanity of Trump. I thought, “What about a podcast with some optimism?”E: Also, I wanted to find a way to promote the ideas I cared about and this seemed like a good way to reach people.Why have you never covered Brexit?G: Because what’s there to be positive about?E: If you want to know about Brexit you can read the newspapers, listen to radio. I think what people feel viscerally is there are all these other things that aren’t being addressed. We’re trying to fill that gap.In the podcast, there is a setup called the Geoffocracy, what is that?E: The Geoffocracy is where Geoff is the supreme, benign-ish ruler.G: You keep saying benign-ish, but I would definitely be benign.E: So, we always ask our guests at the end of every interview what they would do in the Geoffocracy. It’s a good mechanism to force them to ask what’s actually going to solve the problem.What’s next for the show? Will you take it international?E: We’ve actually got a little spin-off which will come out later this year – a book club. Increasingly, publishers come to us with interesting books which don’t quite fit into our format, so we’ll be making another podcast focused on books and authors. We also want to make all the research that goes into each show available for listeners who want to find out more. And on the international front, we did Reasons To Be Icelandic.G: Ed and I went into the geothermal hot spa together which took our relationship to the next level. We made a video but Ed is suppressing it.E: I refuse to release it.Tolani Shoneye was working at Buzzfeed as a journalist when, inspired by the men’s podcast 3 Shots Of Tequila, she asked on Twitter if any other young women would be interested in creating a similarly unadulterated chat about life and sex for women.She whittled down the responses, eventually arranging a meet-up in a pub with Audrey Akande, then a PA at an advertising agency, and Milena Sanchez, a former retail worker. The chemistry between the three was instant. An hour-long meeting turned into a five-hour laugh-fest and the podcast was born. The name is taken from a Whitney Houston quote. Each week the trio discuss relationships, health, race and more, with refreshing frankness. They also include episodes dedicated to their listeners’ problems. Their approach is carefree, raucous and sisterly.How would you describe the podcast?Tolani: It’s like a women’s group chat, so things you would say to your friends. Filthy, but also inspirational.What inspired you to get started?T: I listen to a lot of podcasts and felt there was no one who sounded like me. It was just white men’s voices, doing documentaries or reporting.Audrey: My reasons were a bit more selfish. This was like therapy, to just get into a room and talk.You started your podcast on your own. How did it feel sending that first episode out into the world?T: I turned my phone off. I was so nervous.A: I was the opposite, I was looking at Twitter every second. And the reception was brilliant. We had 3,500 plays on the first day.Milena: I don’t think any of us understood what was going to happen.T: That’s the beauty of audio: it can be makeshift. Our first episodes are awful…M: Our first 10 episodes.T: The sound quality is awful, I can’t believe people listened to it. It was trial and error.Have you given any bad advice to your listeners?A: We’re quite good at saying we don’t know the answer if we don’t, because some things are above our pay grade.M: But we have the hashtag on Twitter, so if people do think we’ve given bad advice, they can tell us.T: And they tell us. I once made a comment about flushing tampons and all these people started sending me links about why I shouldn’t.What’s the feedback you get from male listeners?T: One of the funniest bits of feedback we’ve had was from a guy at a party. He came up to us and said, “Oi, you lot. Stop giving girls confidence.”A: We get that a lot from guys. They often say, “Stop spilling the secrets, stop telling women to leave us.” I think our male listeners are more open about listening to us now. I respect them you have to have balls to listen to us.T: And they definitely come to our live shows to meet girls.Do you feel like role models, and is that a lot of pressure?T: The role model thing is a bother to me. I am problematic. I’m aware I am a flawed inidual. I don’t want people saying, “I’m going to do this because Tolani did it”, because I really don’t know anything.M: When people say they look up to me, I think, “Please don’t, that’s a bit scary.” We’re human so you can hear our journey from episode one – you can hear how our opinions have changed.Listening to the three of you, there is obviously a lot of love, but you also make fun of each otherA: We argue, we fight, we get on with it. If someone’s got a problem we say so.T: I wonder if it is a cultural thing, too. We’re all second-generation immigrants, but within our cultures we talk about our issues. My mum won’t say, “Let’s have a cup of tea.” She’ll say, “What’s good? Let’s fight.”• Julia Davis and Vicki Pepperdine interviewed by Hannah Jane ParkinsonIf you would like a comment to be considered for inclusion on Weekend magazine’s letters page in print, please email weekend@the, including your name and address (not for publication)."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a54bedd80a0ef8734ff5c4f2237c5b5b0c9dcc7a/0_273_5196_3118/master/5196.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1b7f719de1952f5935b41b64ea3295b7","title":"chinese government blocks guardian website","story":"Censorship comes after bans on Washington Post, NBC, HuffPost and Wikipedia ’s website has been blocked in China, amid a crackdown by the country’s authorities on international news websites to coincide with the 30th anniversary of the Tiananmen Square massacre.The Chinese government has regularly restricted coverage of the incident, where the military turned on protesters in Beijing who were taking part in nationwide pro-democracy demonstrations.Other media outlets that have been blocked in recent days include the Washington Post, NBC and HuffPost, according to the monitoring service GreatFire.org. Wikipedia has been banned for several weeks.The censorship often appears to be ad-hoc, with the ’s website apparently going offline for Chinese users after the 4 June anniversary of the massacre, which was marked by extensive coverage on the ’s website and in its print edition.China’s development of a distinct internet culture, with its own form of heavy-handed state regulation, is challenging the traditional vision of a unified global internet. Western web and media companies have often faced a choice: comply with the censorship rules as a cost of doing business in one of the world’s biggest economies – or stop doing business in China.As a result, Facebook and Google, which dominate much of the rest of the world’s web usage, are blocked in the country, with Chinese internet users instead using services such as Weibo and WeChat, which are regularly censored.The British embassy in Beijing this week issued a statement in the name of the foreign secretary, Jeremy Hunt, to commemorate Tiananmen Square but said it had been deleted from domestic social networks.“We also tried to post this statement on our Weibo channel but it was deleted instantly each time and the posting function on our account has now been temporarily suspended,” said the embassy’s press officer Ashley Rogers. “Despite the challenges, we will always stand up for our values and the right to protest peacefully.”The financial information provider Refinitiv, a joint venture between Blackstone and Thomson Reuters, was also caught up in the censorship. This week, it removed Reuters news stories about Tiananmen Square from its Eikon terminals in China.According to Reuters, this came after pressure from the cyberspace administration of China which threatened to suspend the company’s service if it did not comply. The impact was felt outside mainland China, with some users in Hong Kong finding they were unable to access the stories.Although Reuters’ news ision expressed concern about the removal of factual news reports, Refinitiv said it had to comply with local laws. The rival terminal service Bloomberg has previously faced accusations of censoring news stories in order to ensure the future of its profitable terminal business in China."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8c1b0fa292d84822503c3f65194307f306174d8a/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6a854202e3ea358d5fdec7c6bde68849","title":"el chapo the last of the cartel kingpins","story":"As the capture and conviction of Mexico’s notorious drug lord has shown, taking down the boss doesn’t mean taking down the organisation. By  Jessica LoudisJust after midday on Tuesday 12 February, word came down that the verdict was ready in what had been widely described as the trial of the century. “United States of America v Joaquín Guzmán Loera” had lasted approximately three months – it took prosecutors that long to present what they described as “an avalanche” of evidence, which had taken more than a decade to compile. The government called 56 witnesses, the defence called only one: an FBI agent, who finished testifying within an hour.There was little expectation that Guzmán would mount a convincing defence. The diminutive 61-year-old (his nickname, El Chapo, means “shorty” in Spanish) was known around the world as a leader of Mexico’s Sinaloa cartel, and the most high-profile drug kingpin since Pablo Escobar. In addition to smuggling thousands of tonnes of cocaine, heroin, marijuana and synthetic narcotics across the US-Mexico border, he had successfully pulled off two dramatic escapes from prisons in Mexico. He has been the subject of dozens of books, two popular TV series and, in 2009, was included in Forbes magazine’s list of billionaires. The following year, that same magazine named Guzmán one of the world’s most-wanted fugitives, second to only Osama bin Laden. As Guzmán’s lawyers liked to tell anybody who would listen, even before their client set foot in Brooklyn, he had already been convicted in the court of public opinion.When he was captured by Mexican marines on 8 January 2016, Guzmán became the prize feather in the cap of the country’s law enforcement. Barack Obama called Mexican president Enrique Peña Nieto to congratulate him on the arrest, and in a move that could be interpreted either as a parting gift to Obama or a peace offering to his successor, Guzmán was extradited to New York on 19 January 2017, a day before Trump took office. Jack Riley, a retired Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) chief who recently published a book about his role in Guzmán’s arrest, told me that in the view of US authorities, catching El Chapo was an important warning to criminals around the world. Regardless of where you are, if you are breaking American laws, “eventually, we’re going to get you”.Americans spend around $109bn on illegal drugs each year, and Bloomberg estimates that the Sinaloa cartel makes at least $11bn in annual sales to the US. But while Mexican cartels regularly appear in the US media, most people are unfamiliar with the circumstances that contributed to their rise. It is not common knowledge that Mexico launched its own war on drugs in the mid-2000s, or that the biggest cartels are sophisticated operations worth billions of dollars. Nor are many people aware that cartels are increasingly responsible for fentanyl, a form of synthetic heroin, entering the US. In an address to the media after the verdict was handed down, US government officials emphasised this point and the role of illegal fentanyl in perpetuating the opioids crisis.While the workings of his business may be a mystery, Americans have heard of El Chapo. By the time he appeared in court in 2018, he was a late-night TV punchline, a symbol of extreme wealth and an escape artist with a talent for leaving law enforcement with their hands empty.At the trial, Guzmán was found guilty of all charges against him, including the most serious – having engaged in a continuing criminal enterprise. He will be sentenced at the end of June, and is almost certain to be jailed for life. His lawyers are seeking a retrial on the basis of jury misconduct, but the chances of that happening are slim.When I was in Mexico City this spring, a month after the verdict, talk of the trial had already died down. Guzmán’s image had mostly disappeared from the magazine covers on display at the news kiosks that dot the streets of the capital. While people could still name the Sinaloa cartel’s leaders and lieutenants, they were more interested in the newer cartels, such as Jalisco Nueva Generación or the local La Unión. Many people didn’t want to discuss El Chapo at all. “Narco fatigue” – the exhaustion that comes with being oversaturated by news and pop culture about the drug trade – had long ago set in. Over the past 13 years, Mexico’s internal war on drugs has dominated the media, resulted in the deaths of over 100,000 people and failed to stop narcotrafficking.Guzmán’s arrest did not magically rid Mexico, or the US, of violence or drugs. Above all, his trial demonstrated how disposable any single person is in the larger machinations of the narco-state. There has never been a clear definition of what exactly constitutes a cartel, and as smaller, more transient gangs replace larger organisations, going after leaders like Guzmán seems increasingly pointless. Rather than reducing the levels of violence and trafficking in Mexico, that approach – the so-called kingpin strategy, employed by Mexico and the US – has enabled new forms of crime to flourish. As Ismael “El Mayo” Zambada, Chapo’s longtime partner, said in 2010 in a rare interview with the Mexican news magazine El Proceso, the problem of narcos isn’t going away: “As soon as capos are locked up, killed or extradited, their replacements are already around.”Since the early 1990s, the US has targeted cartels via their leaders. It is a fairly straightforward idea: take out the head of an illegal organisation and the rest will collapse. The approach was developed to bring down the Colombian cartels, and in that case, it had some success. When Pablo Escobar was shot to death by Colombian police in 1993, his cartel went down with him.But even as the structures of organised crime have evolved, US law enforcement has generally stuck to this top-down model. If they are not killing drug lords, they are using the American judicial system to make examples of them. Since 2001, when Mexico’s supreme court agreed to allow the extradition of criminals so long as they would not face the death penalty or life in prison (this ruling was amended four years later to permit life sentences), dozens of narcotraffickers have been extradited to the US, including members of the Tijuana, Beltrán-Leyva, Sinaloa and Los Zetas cartels. If Guzmán ends up in the supermax prison in Florence, Colorado, as he is expected to, he will share the facility with former Gulf cartel leader Osiel Cárdenas Guillén.While Sinaloa has historically been, and still remains, Mexico’s most powerful cartel, the world it came up in no longer exists. Between the early 90s and the mid-2000s, the Sinaloa, Tijuana, Juárez and Gulf organisations were mini-monopolies, with borders that more or less stayed the same. Then, with the start of Mexico’s drug war in 2006, that arrangement started to fall apart. As Mexican and American authorities took out cartel leaders, groups fractured and new ones emerged. Previously, the Zetas, whose leaders came from the special forces of the Mexican army, had been a mercenary group in the employ of the Gulf cartel. Now they became an autonomous organisation. Jalisco Nueva Generación, which had been linked to Sinaloa, morphed into one of Mexico’s most ferocious cartels. Splinter groups and gangs that had originated in prisons or as local militias began to gain power.This fragmentation altered the way cartels do business. To distinguish themselves in a crowded field, the new groups pioneered the use of sadistic, headline-grabbing violence. They also ersified. Whereas an old-school cartel might have once only sold drugs, the upstarts are expanding into different forms of crime. The Zetas are notorious for stealing petrol from nationalised pipelines and selling it on the black market – a business that Sinaloa previously dominated, as journalist Ana Lilia Peréz documented in her book El Cartel Negro. The Santa Rosa de Lima cartel also specialises in petrol theft, known nationally as huachicol. Protection rackets are common. And cartels are kidnapping and extorting migrants on their way to the US border. In 2010, the bodies of 72 Central American migrants were found on a ranch in the north-eastern state of Tamaulipas. According to the lone survivor of the massacre, an 18-year-old Ecuadorian, the Zetas murdered the group when they refused to either pay for their freedom or serve as cartel hitmen.At the same time, older cartels are expanding and decentralising. According to law and economics scholar Edgardo Buscaglia, Sinaloa has a presence in 54 countries and Jalisco Nueva Generación, one of Mexico’s fastest growing cartels, is said to have branched out throughout the Americas. Maintaining such operations requires a vast and erse network of legal fronts and elaborate systems of money-laundering. To illustrate this point, the journalist Diego Osorno recently noted that the most popular brand of milk in Sinaloa is made by a company owned by Guzmán’s colleague El Mayo. The Sinaloa cartel operates on such a large scale – connecting manufacturers and distributors, bankers and businesses and extracting money at each step – that there is no longer a single face of the organisation. Buscaglia told me that that if I wanted to see the “sophisticated” side of the Sinaloa cartel, I should visit a particular gated community in Argentina. I wouldn’t find any gangsters flashing guns, he clarified, only the wealthy managers of the cartel’s legal operations in that country.This fragmentation also means that cartels and low-level gangs are harder to police and prosecute. Paradoxically, there are also more mini-kingpins to capture. And once they are in the US, narcotraffickers can cut plea deals and help prosecutors capture their former bosses and colleagues. Captured Mexican narcos generally have few qualms about cooperating. A good outcome might mean a radically reduced sentence and half their fortune waiting for them on release. An even better outcome might resemble that of Andrés López López, one of the former leaders of Colombia’s Norte del Valle cartel. In 2006, López had an 11-year sentence knocked down to 20 months after working with authorities. Now based in Miami, he has written three books about trafficking, one of which was adapted into a wildly successful TV show in Latin America. His most recent book, which was also optioned for television, is a biography of El Chapo.I first went to the Guzmán trial in early December, and began to go more frequently as a broader picture of cartel operations came into focus. In building the case, prosecutors approached it like a classic mafia roll-up, offering leniency to each captured narco and gradually working their way up the chain until they reached Guzmán. As Miami defence attorney Joaquin Perez, who has represented many extradited narcotraffickers, told me, it was a “significant effort for a fait accompli”.It also made for good theatre. There were accounts of diamond-encrusted guns and cocaine stash houses in fancy Brooklyn neighbourhoods, million-dollar smuggling submarines capable of evading police radars and elaborate schemes to outwit US law enforcement. Week after week, witnesses described in intricate detail the inner workings of la oficina (the internal nickname for the cartel): its lavish displays of violence and wealth, its complex transportation networks and how Mexican authorities were systematically paid off. In search of material, screenwriters and actors showed up at the trial.Tabloid headlines advertised the “wacky world” of the trial, and newspapers ran lists of its most bizarre disclosures. By the time the prosecution rested after 11 weeks of testimony, jurors had heard from Juan Carlos Ramírez Abadía, AKA “Chupeta” (lollipop), a formerly handsome Colombian kingpin who had undergone such extensive plastic surgery to stay in hiding that his face looked like a rubber Halloween mask Jorge and Alex Cifuentes-Villa, brothers and Colombian career criminals who had worked closely with Guzmán and Lucero Guadalupe Sánchez López, Guzmán’s mistress and one-time accomplice. Jorge Cifuentes-Villa described attempting to kill a man with a poisoned sandwich, and Alex told the jury that Guzmán had allegedly boasted about bribing former president Peña Nieto for $100m. (Peña Nieto’s former chief of staff described this claim as “false, defamatory and absurd”.)Yet to many of the seasoned narco corresponsales, the trial offered few newsworthy revelations. “Everything that was astonishing to American audiences was not to Mexicans,” said David Brooks, the US correspondent for the progressive Mexican newspaper La Jornada. Mexican readers were no longer scandalised by accounts of extreme wealth or violence. Besides sex and infidelity, which were of universal interest, Brooks told me that the stories that landed with his readers were ones that named names, confirming that long-suspected officials had taken bribes or worked both sides of the table.The more I spoke with the Mexican journalists, the more I became aware of the underlying issues going unaddressed in the courtroom. There were few mentions of the consequences of the war on drugs, which had led to the deaths of thousands of Mexicans. And because it was being held in the US, some saw the case as a finger in the eye of Mexican sovereignty, a serious injury to national pride. (There was some irritation over the fact that Guzmán was being tried, as several journalists grumbled, in a court where the judge couldn’t properly pronounce his name.)At the same time, nobody seemed to think the trial should have been held in Mexico, where the police and judicial systems were too weak to guarantee that Guzmán wouldn’t escape jail for a third time. Again and again, I spoke with journalists and academics who described corruption in Mexico as something like a tide, a force that grew steadily and drew everything towards it. Police were underpaid, crime was lucrative and the government was compromised by the cartels. Political corruption, usually through campaign contributions or by laundering money through public procurement projects, is standard. When I asked people in Mexico City about the enthusiasm surrounding the new president Andrés Manuel López Obrador, who took office in December 2018, I often heard that his willingness to take on corruption was his main selling point.The basic problem in Mexico, Buscaglia told me, is that nobody is policing the courts. Mexico doesn’t audit judges or prosecutors, and lacks independent monitoring agencies. Despite recent reforms to the criminal justice system, Buscaglia does not think that Mexico currently has the capacity or political will to execute major organised crime cases like Italy did with its famous “Maxi trial” in the late 1980s. There, Sicilian prosecutors indicted 475 mafiosi over a six-year period. That, he added, indicates the most significant difference between Mexico and Italy: organised crime didn’t infiltrate the Mexican state – it helped shape it. “Politics in Mexico,” Buscaglia likes to tell people, “is the most sophisticated form of organised crime.”Did the state shape the cartels, or was it the other way around? The standard narrative is that the cartels infiltrated the state, blurring the lines between police, politicians and traffickers. Others contend that government authorities exaggerated the power of the cartels in order to blame them for their own transgressions. It is possible some version of each is true. Either way, there is no single force in control.There has never been a hard ide between the state and traffickers in Mexico. In the 1920s, farmers began growing poppy to meet US demand for opium, and after the second world war, representatives of what would become Mexico’s Institutional Revolutionary party (PRI) were rumoured to have made handshake deals with smugglers, allowing them to export illicit crops across the border in exchange for a cut of the profits. The PRI was the de facto government for most of the 20th century – the novelist Mario Vargas Llosa once called Mexico under the PRI “the perfect dictatorship” – and during its tenure, politicians generally took a lax attitude towards the drug trade, regarding drugs as more of a health issue than a criminal one.By the 1980s, narcos had solidified their power by vying up trafficking routes and letting groups run their own territories. At the time cocaine trafficking was starting to become big business in Mexico. When the US DEA began targeting Colombian cocaine distribution routes between the Caribbean and Miami, the cartels had found an alternative in the Mexican “trampoline”. Traffickers started moving shipments across the porous US-Mexico border, and American officials redirected their attention to Mexico. From 1985 onwards, US operations in Mexico became more aggressive, following the kidnap, torture and murder of a DEA agent by the Guadalajara cartel. With the cold war receding, drugs replaced communism as the enemy No 1 of the American people.The Americans did not find the Mexican authorities the most co-operative of partners in the “war on drugs”. By the 80s and 90s, writes the sociologist Luis Alejandro Astorga Almanza, “it was practically impossible for society to ignore the unbreakable links between police and traffickers”. Particularly in states such as Tamaulipas, cops would moonlight as traffickers – and traffickers as cops – with the tacit blessing of local authorities and elites. “Various governmental structures seem to have been born captured by the illicit interests of their own creators,” writes Carlos Antonio Flores Peréz, a social anthropologist who studies the institutional protection of the drug trade. US army intelligence cables from the 80s and early 90s reveal that American officials were fully aware that all over Mexico, officials, politicians and state and federal police were in on the take.In April 1989, Miguel Ángel Félix Gallardo, the former police officer who founded the infamous Guadalajara cartel, was arrested, but like Escobar, he continued to run his cartel from prison. That year, his most powerful lieutenants – one of whom was a young Guzmán – assembled in Acapulco and were each assigned a territory. El Chapo and El Mayo took the Pacific coast. This kingmaker moment ushered in a new era, and preceded yet another big shift. Instead of continuing to accept cash from weakened Colombian suppliers, Mexican narcos began demanding payment in cocaine so they could go into business on their own. Before long, they went from being couriers to distributors, which was far more profitable, and overtook their former employers as the world’s biggest traffickers.While agreements between cartels and Mexican authorities had previously kept violence between the two at bay, by the late 80s these relationships were strained. With the US putting more pressure on the Mexican government to target traffickers, the old arrangements dissolved. Under these new circumstances, violence became common among gangs, writes Sinaloan historian Froylán Enciso, and “a way of confronting the government”.Still, it rarely spilled into public view. So the country was stunned when in May 1993, a Mexican cardinal was killed in a shootout between the Tijuana and Sinaloa cartels at Guadalajara airport. Although it was later discovered that Tijuana sicarios had mistaken the cardinal’s car for Guzmán’s – they were retaliating for a Sinaloa attack that killed nine Tijuana members – he was initially blamed. A nationwide manhunt was called, and with Guzmán splashed all over the papers, he became a household name in Mexico.In June 1993, he was captured in Guatemala, extradited to Mexico and later sentenced to 20 years in jail for drug trafficking and murder. But for the next eight years, until he escaped in 2001 – allegedly hidden in a laundry cart pushed by a guard – Guzmán, like Félix Gallardo before him, continued to run his business from jail without any difficulties.While this pattern played out across the US, Sinaloa’s power and logistical strength were concentrated in Chicago, the main hub from which they distributed drugs around the country. Cartel operations were so well organised, said Riley, that “you could hit a house with 50 kilos of heroin in it, and two doors down you could hit a house with $5m in it, and neither of the people running the houses even knew the other existed”.Calderón’s announcement initiated what would become one of the deadliest periods in Mexican history. With billions in funding from the US, Calderón pursued his own version of the kingpin strategy, deploying the military to fight cartels and targeting their leaders. During his six-year tenure, 25 of Mexico’s “most wanted” – two-thirds of the entire list – were arrested or killed. As cartels pushed back, extortion and kidnappings spiked, and the number of homicides reached an average of 20,000 a year. “In this new atmosphere of fear,” wrote novelist Juan Villoro in an essay about the era, “10,000 companies offer security services and 3,000 people have had chips inserted under their skin so they can be located if they’re kidnapped”.Despite this violence, Sinaloa seemed to receive less attention from the authorities than other cartels. An investigation by the US broadcaster National Public Radio (NPR) reported that between December 2006 and May 2010, Sinaloa members were arrested at significantly lower rates than those of rival groups. A congressman from Sinaloa also told NPR that the government “has been fighting organised crime in many parts of the republic, but has not touched Sinaloa”. Explanations for this varied from low-level corruption in the armed forces to more elaborate conspiracies involving the government – accusations that Calderón told reporters were “totally unfounded”, naming various Sinaloa members that the government had arrested.In the next general election, in 2012, the PRI retook power and Peña Nieto became president. Although his administration retreated from the kingpin strategy, in 2014, more than a decade after he had first escaped from prison, Guzmán was recaptured and sent to the maximum-security Altiplano Ffederal prison. The following year, he escaped once again, before he was recaptured for the final time in 2016. “Mission complete,” tweeted Peña Nieto.Drug trafficking and cartel violence affect both the US and Mexico, but when it comes to addressing them, the US government has typically strongarmed Mexico into following its lead. Long before the overt bullying of the Trump administration, American officials were known to pay little heed to Mexican sovereignty. Yet even when US violations of that sovereignty pertained to the trial, they were rarely discussed in court.Even in less dramatic instances, the “business as usual” of international law enforcement is fraught. Writing for El Proceso, J Jesús Esquivel described the Guzmán trial as having exposed “betrayals, corruption, lies and regular violations of Mexican sovereignty by DEA agents”. Esquivel also zeroed in on cooperating witness deals that the justice department offered to certain traffickers, including Vicente Zambada Niebla, the son of El Mayo and Sinaloa’s heir apparent. “El Vicentillo” was one of the trial’s most anticipated witnesses. He was flown in from Chicago, where he had yet to be sentenced on his own trafficking charges, and took the stand in dark blue prison clothes. In a five-hour testimony that the New York Times described as a spectacular betrayal of his father and birthright, Zambada Niebla gave a detailed insider account of cartel workings, describing how the organisation spent at least $1m a month on bribes to police and politicians, and detailing a failed plot to use a government petrol tanker to transport South American cocaine to Mexico.For taking the stand against his “compadre”, as he politely referred to Guzmán, the 44-year-old was promised a shorter sentence and a possible path to US citizenship. Others were given similar offers. The Cifuentes brothers, who sent tonnes of drugs to cities all over the US, may serve less than 15 years for their cooperation. Even Chupeta, the Colombian trafficker who confessed to having ordered the killings of 150 people – and to having personally shot one man in the face – may be free in 10-15 years for his testimony.In his plea agreement, Zambada Niebla also agreed to forfeit $1.37bn (yes, billion) to the US government, although it is highly unlikely any money will actually change hands. Since narcos don’t purchase property or open bank accounts in their own names, it can be difficult to locate assets, and if the money is in Mexico, US authorities rarely bother to track it down. Of course, there is no public information about how many narcos are in witness protection, or whether those living under assumed identities have managed to recoup some of their former fortunes. But it is not far-fetched to assume this could happen: on 30 May, a federal judge in Chicago sentenced Vicentillo to 15 years in prison. With time served, this leaves him with five years to go, which may be further reduced for good behaviour.Outside the courtroom, away from the trial, the US-Mexico relationship is also defined by a kind of mutual obliviousness on the part of each country’s citizens. David Brooks, the Jornada reporter, told me there is still “mass ignorance about what’s happening next door”. In Mexico, he observed, Trump coming to power “reinforced every stereotype of America for the past hundred years”. At the same time, while there are 35 million Mexicans in the US, Americans are generally ignorant of what’s happening below the border. One thing that has gone notably unnoticed, according to Brooks, is the victory of left populist López Obrador. Since he took office in December 2018, Mexico has entered “a moment of potential transformation”, which, if the new president follows through on his promises, could reshape the way Mexico deals with drug trafficking.A month after the verdict, I met journalist Ioan Grillo in the middle-class area of Roma in Mexico City, several blocks from the house where Alfonso Cuarón had shot his Oscar-winning film, and next to a Sinaloan seafood restaurant. Grillo had recently written an opinion piece rejecting the idea that Guzmán’s conviction was a victory in the war on drugs. “To bring a real sense of justice, you’d need something like a war crimes tribunal,” he observed. Grillo was building on a point that had been made repeatedly by members of the Mexican press at the trial – the case did not seem not to acknowledge how the war on drugs led to thousands of deaths and profoundly altered Mexican society.There were mixed feelings in Mexico, Grillo added – not about whether Guzmán should go to jail, but about what justice should look like, what closure his conviction could offer and what the whole trial ultimately meant. This was the biggest trial in a drug war that has lasted more than a decade, and it didn’t even take place in Mexico. No actionable evidence against any officials had emerged, and Grillo said most Mexicans were not particularly surprised to hear any of the corruption allegations that the case brought to the surface.It is clear the public wants reform, but the question is whether López Obrador will be able to do anything about the corruption that has for so long hobbled the state, including parts of his own administration. Three days after Guzmán’s sentencing, López Obrador visited Badiraguato, the kingpin’s hometown. Guzmán is by no means a popular figure in Mexico, but in Sinaloa, one of the country’s most dangerous regions, T-shirts with his face on them are sold in markets and he is widely regarded as a local hero. In a state where the federal government is largely absent, El Chapo is credited (without any evidence) with building roads and providing social services. After he was apprehended for the second time in 2014, hundreds of people turned out to demand his release.

The socio-economically deprived suburb at the bottom of New Zealand’s South Island is in the crosshairs of the nation’s first-ever “wellbeing budget”, a radical economic plan for the country devised by Jacinda Ardern to improve the lives of the poorest citizens.For the first time the annual budget puts social wellbeing indicators ahead of GDP when it comes to spending decisions. From now on, the health of New Zealand will not be measured by growth alone, but instead by the overall wellbeing and prosperity of its nearly 5 million people.It is a tall order. New Zealand has the highest youth suicide rate in the OECD, the fourth highest rate of family violence and diseases of poverty seen no-where else in the developed world.Harvey, 67, a gruff but loquacious former seaman, hopes the wellbeing budget will transform his suburb, where many locals battle mental health issues and crime is prevalent. He returned to New Zealand from Australia because of rising racism, and says his native country is now more “equitable” than its neighbour across the Tasman Sea.“It was a good start, because you can’t get all your Christmas crackers in one day,” he says.When finance minister Grant Robertson announced the budget last week he said it would make New Zealand “both a great place to make a living, and a great place to make a life.” Vicky Freeman, 40, who appeared on the front of the budget document with her daughter Ruby-Jean, says the priorities of the budget are “solid” a record NZ$1.9bn for mental health, NZ$1bn for child wellness, and a record NZ$320m to combat domestic and family violence.Despite gracing the cover of the budget, Freeman and her daughter no longer live in New Zealand, having relocated to Australia in December after the high-cost of living in the country’s largest city of Auckland proved too much.“We do need help for people that are mentally ill and committing suicide. We need to help the children, we need to bring up Kiwi children better. I really hope this makes a difference in people’s lives. I hope they’re not just saying stuff and won’t follow through,” Freeman says.But the praise has not been universal. At Child Poverty Action Group, which campaigns on behalf of more than a quarter of New Zealand children who live in income poverty, there was disappointment.Spokeswoman Jeni Cartwright described the budget’s mental health focus as “an ambulance at the bottom of the cliff” that instead of tackling entrenched poverty issues in New Zealand, it was throwing money at the end result of long-term, inter-generational deprivation.“We were looking for significant improvement to people’s incomes, and we didn’t see that,” says Cartwright.While Harvey remains “hopeful” about the government’s commitment to helping the country’s most vulnerable people, he remains concerned that structural change – such as the introduction of a capital gains tax – have been ruled out by Ardern.“I agree with putting money into a wellbeing budget but they are periphery things,” says Harvey. “This country is run by the rich to exploit the poor and lets face it, and say it, and plan for it.”Robertson admits inter-generational transformation will take decades, but the building blocks of changing New Zealanders lives from the bottom up have now been put in place.“Our North Star is now reflective of a broader set of values,” he says.“The answer, in my view, is that the government wasn’t sufficiently valuing those things … if it wasn’t being valued it wasn’t being measured. And if it wasn’t being measured it wasn’t being done.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1884e3e02f029e079adf7c0a0126f142ac9f8d34/0_0_2187_1313/master/2187.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=099fb5427a2d9d256f785510be21614c","title":"us imposes sanctions on irans largest petrochemical group","story":"PGPIC hit with economic penalties because of its ties to Revolutionary Guards, US treasury saysThe United States has hit Iran’s Persian Gulf Petrochemical Industries Company (PGPIC) with economic sanctions due to its ties with the country’s Revolutionary Guards (IRGC), the Treasury department has said.The move aims to choke off financing to the country’s largest and most profitable petrochemical group and extends to its 39 subsidiaries and “foreign-based sales agents,” Treasury said in a statement.Those include UK-based NPC International and Philippines-based and NPC Alliance Corporation that are controlled by PGPIC.“This action is a warning that we will continue to target holding groups and companies in the petrochemical sector and elsewhere that provide financial lifelines to the IRGC,” Treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, said in the statement.Treasury warned that international companies continuing to partner with PGPIC or subsidiaries and sales agents “will themselves be exposed to US sanctions.”Following Donald Trump’s decision to abandon the 2015 nuclear deal negotiated by his predecessor, US efforts over the past year to choke off Iran’s economy have angered allies as foreign companies get caught up in the dispute.Several countries have halted oil imports from Iran, while Europe has tried to design a mechanism to continue trading with the country without violating US sanctions.Treasury said it is penalizing PGPIC due to its links to the economic arm of the IRGC, known as Khatam al-Anbiya. The holding company has awarded contracts to Khatam al-Anbiya “generating hundreds of millions of dollars for an IRGC economic conglomerate that stretches across Iran’s major industries.”The new sanctions come as the Trump administration has increased economic and military pressure against Iran both because of its nuclear and missile programs as well as its support for proxy groups in Syria, Iraq, Lebanon and Yemen.Washington in April branded the IRGC a terrorist organisation, the first time it has taken the step against part of a foreign government. The move meant anyone who dealt with the Revolutionary Guards could face prison in the United States.The new sanctions prohibit the firm and its subsidiaries from accessing the US market or financial system, including through other foreign companies, and blocks all funds or property that is in the United States or held by a US firm.The penalties could extend to “any foreign financial institution that knowingly facilitates a significant financial transaction or provides significant financial services for entities designated,” the statement said.“By targeting this network we intend to deny funding to key elements of Iran’s petrochemical sector that provide support to the IRGC,” Mnuchin said.Tensions between Washington and Tehran have escalated further in recent weeks after Trump last month deployed additional troops to the region and resumed arm sales to Saudi Arabia to protect against what the United States said was the threat of an imminent attack.Trump on Thursday said he would be willing to reopen talks as long as Iran agreed to give up nuclear weapons. But Tehran ruled out talks until the United States is ready to “return to normal.”Three analysts and a former Treasury official said the latest sanctions will likely have only a modest effect because non-US companies already shy away from doing business with Iran’s petrochemicals sector because of existing sanctions.Suzanne Maloney of the Brookings Institution think tank described the latest US sanctions as “a natural next step in what I think is a deliberately redundant array of restrictions.”“The administration is banking on the overlapping authorities and obstacles to compound the pressure on the Iranians and create a sense that the entire economy is off limits,” she said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/43d3534461ed6f84420cbf3bbe91c0125ffc19a9/0_416_5376_3226/master/5376.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=00f70e8f849554e59d7e3386646d5656","title":"d day landings remembered on 75th anniversary in pictures","story":"Veterans and world leaders have attended ceremonies to mark 75 years since allied troops landed in France during the second world war"},{"url":null,"title":"a baby born today the climate and their future","story":"Life-support systems that nature provides – an intertwined web that sustains humans, plants and animals – are at risk of unravelling in a matter of decades.Deforestation, intensive agriculture, overfishing, development and other human activities are breaking the bonds that combine to make a healthy planet. Their destruction, fuelled by rampant consumption and obsession with economic growth, is accelerating.“The evidence is crystal clear: nature is in trouble. Therefore we are in trouble,” declared Sandra Díaz, who co-chaired the completion of a global assessment of bioersity published this week.There is a dual threat to life on Earth: species loss and climate change. The Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Bioersity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES) ranked the main factors causing species loss: changes in land and sea use exploitation of organisms climate change pollution and invasive alien species.These are “eroding the foundations of our economies, livelihoods, food security, health and quality of life worldwide”, and climate breakdown could soon become the main driver.Nature is being destroyed at such a rate that a million species are at risk. On the day the IPBES report made headlines, Dr Allan Mee of the Golden Eagle Trust checked for sightings of the Ring Ouzel in the MacGillycuddy’s Reeks in Co Kerry, one of just two of its remaining habitats in Ireland. “No birds located. Sad but likely witnessing local extinction of the species, once found in 28 Irish counties,” he tweeted. Pádraic Fogarty of the Irish Wildlife Trust replied: “This is mass extinction unfolding before our eyes.”How is the potentially lethal cocktail of bioersity loss and climate disruption going to impact on coming generations in contrasting parts of the globe? Equally, what does it mean for an animal that dominates the Irish landscape (the cow), and the majestic lion, not critically endangered yet rapidly disappearing?The baby born in IrelandConscious of what the next generation is facing, Australian Jim Scheer helped set up the FridaysForFuture climate action movement in Ireland, which is driven by young people. As for the babies of today, “their freedom is limited”, he believes. As a child, “the most I had to worry about was, ‘is there air in the tyres of my bike?’” he says.They are facing a whole different world of realities, a place where the First World problem of “where will I go on my holidays?” may be replaced by “where is my next meal coming from?”The issues weigh heavily on the current generation of young people, he believes, which is why “coming together to grieve” – a feature of recent protests – matters, and is part of telling the truth. There is much frustration too at the inaction of elders.“Uncertain” is the future of that child, says climate activist Dr Lorna Gold. Hope is emerging through the climate movement but, looking at the timelines required for transformational shift, there is “more and more uncertainty”.Children growing up in Ireland will be relatively protected, by location, wealth and assets they will have access to, “but even in the best-case scenario, it will be a diminished world.”This will be due to loss of species and a more complicated world, disrupted by climate and associated conflict, where Dr Gold fears the freedom to explore and travel in relative peace is undermined. It’s a place of learning from the internet rather than real life. The pluses will be better local connectedness with “their own earth” and nearby food production.That Irish child will never hear the corncrake or the curlew, says climatologist Prof John Sweeney, and, as they grow, they will be confronted with hard choices on lifestyle and mobility. The fossil fuel-driven car will be forced out by regulation, he says, but different ways of getting off the island, for example, will be needed if aviation does not overcome its emissions issues.By mid-century, most will live in green cities with an almost total absence of the private car. The transport revolution will be in urban areas but slower to come to the countryside until battery technology improves, Sweeney notes.A near zero-carbon world will mean less air pollution. Clean energy in their home and workplace will mainly come from offshore wind.A downside will be more extreme weather events attributable to climate change more intense storms and rainfall, increased flooding with sea level rises – and yet water shortages in summer.The child born today in Ireland – and the adult they become – will cope far better than their counterpart elsewhere.The developing world babyA baby born today in a developing country, on the other hand, will be at the frontline of climate disruption, says Christian Aid Ireland policy and advocacy adviser Jennifer Higgins. They will have to contend with stronger cyclones, warmer days and nights, more unpredictable rains and longer heatwaves.“Here in Ireland we will have the resources and ability to adapt and deal with these unprecedented weather events, but in many parts of the world, going to Tesco to stock up on sliced pan won’t be a possibility.”They will be the ones who will suffer the worst consequences of our inaction on climate change. “Sustained periods of unseasonably heavy rain can have a damaging impact on agriculture, causing the loss of topsoil and serious nutrient leaching,” says Higgins.In Ireland, save for the odd hosepipe ban, water is always on tap for domestic, industrial and agricultural use. “But in the developing world, where most people depend on agriculture to earn a living or just stay alive, it’s a scarce and precious resource.”Those living in coastal regions will suffer a loss of coral reefs, which half a billion people rely on for fish. For those born among indigenous communities in tropical rainforests, not only will they lose their homeland – already being eroded by increasing industrialisation – but there will be loss of habitat that acts as the lungs of the earth and regulates rainfall.Children will be most susceptible to the increasing diseases that a changing climate will leave in its wake, she adds. Their education may be disrupted when schools are used as shelters when disaster hits their communities.If temperatures increase in already hot areas, it will diminish scarce resources to sustain life and will force many to become refugees.But this may “dwarf numbers caused by conflict or political and economic necessity. When their land becomes uninhabitable because of drought, flood or sea-level rise, they will have to seek a safer place to live,” Higgins predicts.It may be a world where techniques such as conservation agriculture transform crop production and smartphone technology helps drive rural economies backed by deployment of cheap solar PV. But extreme weather events will continue to threaten food production, as seen with recent cyclones in southern Africa.Gold fears a business-as-usual approach means such circumstances can become an intractable problem very quickly, and says solutions are beyond most communities on cost grounds. Therefore the child is facing increased malnutrition, chronic hunger, dependency on external aid, and political instability – an existence marked by inequality and injustice.The IPBES report starkly outlines how indigenous peoples and the poorest are most reliant on land and sea for survival. The combination of land grabs by multinationals facilitated by corrupt governments, extreme climate events and bioersity loss add up to a very bleak future for their offspring, Gold concludes.The future of the cow Humans are not the only beings whose lives will change. The IPBES report emphasises that the effects will be felt first among animals and other living things.In Ireland, there are currently more cattle than people, and they are the most common large animal. For many, the cow (for beef and milk) is the bellwether of Irish agriculture and rural life. For others, it’s the problem because of associated carbon emissions.Teagasc’s head of communications, Eric Donald, says cattle numbers are currently a matter for inidual farmers. With no quotas, no policy instruments are in place. In future we are likely to have fewer beef and more dairy cattle.On emissions, Donald says there is wide acceptance of the need to implement mitigation measures – a process is already in train.Having a grass-based system to feed those cattle will be critical to sustainable farms from an environmental, economic and social perspective, Donald adds. Ireland will need to find export markets for 80 to 90 per cent of its product. Meat consumption may decrease on an inidual basis and there may be a shift to plant-based diets, but increased population growth will mean “demand won’t drop significantly”.But cattle will have to compete for space due to a more erse range of crops, land being used for bioenergy and afforestation (increasingly native woodlands and not just on marginal land) that will act as important carbon sinks, and hedgerows ensuring better bioersity and pollinator capacity.To question beef consumption may currently be an Irish “no-no”, but the reality is the consumers of tomorrow will be confronted by a wide range of new plant and synthetic proteins that will taste surprisingly good and be cheaper, which is likely to mean less red meat is consumed – in line with health guidelines.Eric Donald defends the pursuit of higher genetic quality as a means of increasing efficiency and lowering emissions, especially “because lifetime productivity is better”. With extending grazing seasons, it’s the key measure in improving farm sustainability guidelines. It also complements changes in fertiliser use and slurry management.But John Sweeney says the Irish cow is “reaching limits in terms of genetics”. Like pedigree dogs, they are less able to cope with change and stress compared with native species.Unquestionably, there will be fewer of them, he believes, “if we want to maintain bioersity for future generations”.Expansion in the cattle population has coincided with deterioration in water quality, with widespread glyphosate contamination (one study has found 20 per cent of Irish adults have traces of the herbicide in their urine), nitrates pollution and an emerging ammonia problem.“Continued expansion of the national herd is not compatible with this report. That’s where the crux comes.”The future of the lionJennifer Higgins joins in a lament for so many endangered mammals.Of all species threatened, IWT campaign officer Pádraic Fogarty is shocked by the latest indicators for hippos, giraffes and lions. In particular, “it would be an absolutely travesty if lions were to go extinct . . . The magnificent animal has permeated our culture and imagination, from children’s stories to the pillars on Trafalgar Square.”But maps don’t lie. In 1950 there were 400,000 lions in the wild. Today there are 23,000-39,000 lions in all of Africa, which is “extremely low” in global terms, when once they lived in Ancient Greece and North Africa, and became extinct in Greece only around 100BC.Outside of southern Africa, numbers of lions in 23 unfenced reserves in 11 countries are estimated to have dropped by 62 per cent between 1993 and 2014. Asia is home to a small subpopulation in the Indian state of Gujarat, where numbers are growing, but it’s just a pin on the globe.“There is no data to say that lions are about to disappear, but their populations are shrinking fast,” he explains. The species is classified as vulnerable but the slide into the “endangered” and then “critically endangered” categories looms, while “threatened with extinction” is applied to its current status.For Fogarty, the same pressures apply to other mammals, but the lion’s wellbeing is further undermined by gametrophy hunting and false western-world notions that it is somehow good for population numbers. All told, we are facing a scenario where lions will “shrink to a few corners of the planet”.What to doThis is not going to be sorted by putting bird tables in back gardens. The Ipbes report shows nature-based solutions can help bring “transformative change”, but there is a greater systemic problem.In the past 50 years, the human population has doubled, the global economy has grown nearly four-fold, and global trade has grown tenfold, together driving up the demands for energy, food and materials.Thinking that endless economic growth is possible and not valuing the essential services provided by nature is a delusion leading to catastrophe, Sweeney believes.“Until we get away from euros and cents and GDP, we will be in a cul-de-sac . . . Unless we rethink how we value the services provided by the natural world and include them explicitly in a wellbeing measure, we delude ourselves that a sustainable future is possible.”That was the core message in a submission this week to EU leaders meeting on the future of Europe by the European Environmental Bureau (EEB) and more than 200 academics, including John Sweeney, policy experts and civil society groups.There is an onus too on iniduals to act, according to EEB vice president Attracta Uí Bhroin. “It’s not enough for us to sit on the sofa and watch David Attenborough’s latest breathtaking and terrifying documentary and shake our heads. Every politician coming near your front door needs to know environmental sustainability is your priority, and must be Europe’s priority.”Fogarty hopes people now see the connections between climate breakdown and mass extinction, that they are two sides of the same coin. “We have all of the solutions to hand, but what we’ve been lacking is any sense of urgency to get on with it.”He senses momentum moving in the right direction, though the lack of a response from the Taoiseach or any Government minister “makes me feel that they are still hoping it’s an issue that will go away. We can’t really afford this level of disengagement when we need to be getting on with things.”Scheer is brutally frank about future voters born today. “I don’t think people get a choice of what games they play.”They will have to be focused on survival. “It feels as we have handed them a shitstorm.”As for the current generation, too many are stuck in business-as-usual mode. There is a need to raise consciousness quickly. “Ignorance is not a choice” given the IPBES report. “It’s not an opinion, it’s scientific. It’s happening.”Kevin O\u0027Sullivan is Environment and Science Editor and former Editor of The "},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3918682.1559939489!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"archdiocese and gaa put 19 acres in drumcondra up for sale","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tAerial view of the Drumcondra portfolio.More than 19 acres of land in Drumcondra, Dublin, part of a site being sold by the Catholic Archdiocese of Dublin to the GAA, are now on the market and expected to attract bids of €100 million or more. The development could include up to 1,200 apartments and other residential accommodation.The details of how the profits from the property venture will be split between the two organisations have not been clarified.The archdiocese announced in November 2018 it had entered into exclusive negotiations with the GAA to sell the former Holy Cross seminary and adjoining lands.Spokespeople for the archdiocese and the GAA were not prepared to elaborate on details of the financial arrangement. “We agreed that we wouldn’t comment until they sorted out their end,” a GAA spokesman said.A brochure prepared for potential bidders says the GAA is selling the “Drumcondra portfolio”, while retaining lands adjoining the site to develop extensive sporting and recreational facilities, and a new hotel.The 19.12 acres between Clonliffe Road and Lower Drumcondra Road are being sold by way of a “structured best bid process”, with the potential for up to 1,200 apartments and the conversion of existing listed buildings into more residential accommodation. Some 10 per cent of the residential units will be for social housing and a further 10 per cent for affordable housing.In recent weeks the brochure produced by selling agent Hooke and MacDonald, which describes the GAA as the vendor, has been circulated to interested parties.\u0026nbspThe State is still awaiting payments of hundreds of millions of euro to the Redress Scheme, established to compensate people who suffered abuse while in residential institutions run by religious congregations.The congregations affected entered into a legally binding agreement in 2002 to make €128 million in contributions, and a further voluntary agreement to contribute an additional €352 million in the wake of the 2009 Ryan report.As of last month, €231 million had been paid.Interested partiesProperty sources predicted substantial interest from home and abroad.Irish-listed housebuilders Glenveagh and Cairn Homes could be expected to run the rule over the project, with privately backed players such as Pat Crean’s Marlet and Cork-based Michael O’Flynn also likely to look at the site, along with international real estate investors such as Kennedy-Wilson.A masterplan for the site “envisages a new residential quarter with over 1,200 apartments and local neighbourhood centre, together with extensive sporting and recreational facilities and a hotel, on adjoining lands”, the brochure says.The brochure says the private rented sector is “the most vibrant part of the Irish property investment market” and has “considerable potential for growth”.Despite Dublin having restrictions on rent increases, “average residential rents in Dublin are currently rising by 7.8 per cent per annum”, the brochure says.Any future plans for the property must have “significant elements of legacy and community gain” and will “need to display creative factors that lift it above most development projects in the city”.The Drumcondra deal comes at a time when religious congregations have also put a number of valuable development sites in Dublin on the market. Ageing religious members and a strong property market are among the factors driving the phenomenon."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3918469.1559925336!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"vast sums at stake as catholic church responds to rising property market","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tAerial view of the Drumcondra portfolio.What factors are driving some of the largest land deals in Dublin?Declining congregational memberships the collapse in new entrants to the priesthood the housing crisis property values the cost of caring for the elderly and a Papal encyclical are all part of the mix.Whether it be the sale of 19 acres in Drumcondra, in an auction where the guide price is in the region of €100 million, or the sale for €3.5 million of an old retreat house in Howth with grounds that slope down to Dublin Bay, the tills are ringing as the institutional Catholic Church responds to a rising property market.The process is being driven by a desire by the church and its numerous orders to address the issue of legacy while also providing for the elderly priests, nuns and brothers who make up an ever-increasing proportion of the Irish religious.And while it is the major land sales that attract the most attention, there are also a large number of smaller deals going on where congregations are handing over property for uses such as social housing, the provision of services, and the housing of refugees and asylum seekers.A lot of congregations have been left with institutional properties that are expensive to maintain. Often, however, they are located on surrounding lands that are ripe for development.“The orders are looking at legacy,” said an experienced property adviser to religious congregations, who did not want to be named. “Some of them see their mission continuing through the use of lay people, and they need money for this.”Redress schemeAnother reason for selling is to fund donations to the State’s redress scheme for former residents of religious-run institutions.The scheme, which was set up in the early 2000s, envisaged 18 congregations providing more than €400 million in money and land to help fund the scheme.But the financial crash intervened. The pick-up in land values in recent years has renewed interest in selling property and contributing to the scheme, according to the source.Age is another huge factor. Many of the congregations have memberships where the average age is well in excess of 70. If they want to arrange their orders’ affairs, they know that time is not on their side.Sr Liz Murphy, secretary general of the Association of Leaders of Missionaries and Religious of Ireland (Amri), said the factors driving the sales included the necessity to pay into the redress scheme, and other costs that arise from the congregations’ pasts, which she did not want to specify, as well as the shift away from living in institutions to the community.The ownership of the old institutions can be “burdensome”, she said. “It is a bit like downsizing. It is a generational shift.” For some congregations, the decision to sell can be “heartbreaking”.Sr Murphy, a former provincial leader of the southern province of the Sisters of Mercy, has studied the issue of “institutional demise” and very much sees the position of the congregations in Irish society in terms of the cycle of life.The need to pay for the care of elderly priests, nuns and brothers, some of whom have returned to Ireland after a working life abroad on the missions, is another factor.“They are people who have worked hard, over many years, and they deserve to be looked after now,” she said.ValuationsOne of the “major, major concerns” for congregations, she said, was “valuing land and property”, as per the papal encyclical Laudato Si, which is focused on climate change, ecology and “care for our common home”. It very much guides decisions by the congregations in relation to land use and the management of buildings, Sr Murphy said.The congregations have invested significantly in retreat and conference centres. “That is money that is extremely well spent. It provides an opportunity for people to refresh their souls.”Property has also been transferred to provide for social housing. Currently 14 properties owned by Amri members are being used for the housing of refugees and asylum seekers.Ageing memberships mean costs are continually rising, while income for almost all congregations is falling. Figures that can be accessed on the website of the Charities Regulator show most orders are running annual deficits.Fr Martin Kelly, provincial of the Spiritans (or Holy Ghost Fathers) in Ireland, said the average age of his congregation at the end of last year was more than 75 years, and that its annual expenditure greatly exceeded income.“Our recent decision to sell property at Cross Avenue, which is adjoining but not part of Blackrock College, arises in that context.”Below are some properties that are up for sale or have been sold recently by the Catholic Church in Dublin.Sandford Road, Dublin 6Offers in excess of €55 million are being sought for 10.4 acres of land which formed part of the Jesuit order’s now closed Milltown Park educational campus.Cross Avenue, Blackrock, Co Dublin More than €20 million is being sought for a three-acre site beside Blackrock College. It is being sold by the Spiritan congregation, who are the trustees of the college, and the proceeds are to be used for charitable work, as well as paying off debts.Stella Maris Convent and Retreat House, Howth HeadA price tag of €3.5 million has been put on this property, which includes grounds of 1.6 acres that drop down to Dublin Bay.The Religious Sisters of Charity said the sale was due to “the inability of our ageing congregation to continue our retreat work, a decline in numbers attending and the need to spend money to modernise the building. We have decided to sell and use the proceeds of the sale to go towards some of the charitable work our congregation carries out at home and abroad.“The sale will enable us to continue that important work whilst also supporting the care of our sick and elderly sisters.”Clonliffe, DrumcondraThere is a price tag of €100 million on the 19 acres that have been put up for sale in Drumcondra, with a new residential quarter for the city being envisaged for what once used to be the Dublin Diocesan Seminary.Clonkeen College, Deansgrange, Co DublinThe decision of the Christian Brothers to sell part of the land beside Clonkeen College for €18 million led to the school’s board of management issuing proceedings in the High Court. The case was settled last year, with the amount of land being given to the school being increased by half an acre. The playing fields were sold to builder Paddy Durcan Snr.Our Lady’s Grove, Goatstown, Dublin 14Campaigners opposed the development of lands beside Our Lady’s Grove Primary and Secondary Schools, on Goatstown Road, which were sold by the Congregation of the Religious of Jesus and Mary in May 2017 for an estimated €13 million. The campaigners were unhappy with the loss of green space and playing fields beside schools in the area.All Hallows, DrumcondraAll Hallows in Drumcondra was a training college for priests from the mid-1800s. The trustees, in deciding to sell the property in 2015, opted to sell it to Dublin City University, so it could continue to be used as an educational institution, rather than sell the property and its grounds for residential development.Mercy Convent, Cork Street, Dublin 8A value of €1.6 million was put on a convent gifted by the Mercy Sisters to the Sophia Housing Association in the social housing organisation’s 2017 accounts. The same accounts record that it has, over recent years, been gifted a property worth €397,134, in Ballincar, Co Sligo, by the Daughters of Wisdom two properties in Castlecomer, Co Kilkenny, worth €205,000, by the Presentation Sisters as well as property in Killinarden, Tallaght, Dublin 24, worth €550,000, by the Daughters of Charity.Holy Faith Convent, KillesterThe MKN Property Group is planning to build 79 “residential units” on 2.4 acres sold by the Holy Faith order in 2017.

Photograph: Michele TantussiReuters\u0026nbspLife is beginning at 40 for Germany’s Greens as, for the second time in a week, an opinion poll crowned it the country’s most popular political party.The news caused elation among party’s MPs in the Bundestag on Friday – and added to speculation of a premature end to chancellor Angela Merkel’s struggling grand coalition.Germany’s governing parties, once political giants, now together command just 37 per cent support. Some three-quarters of Germans are dissatisfied with the fourth Merkel administration and third grand coalition since 2005.As the coalition parties struggle – one with its new leader and the other with none – the Green Party has received an early present six months before its 40th birthday: a tripling of public support since the 2017 federal election.Founded in January 1980 from Germany’s pacifist and environmental movement, it served as a junior partner in Berlin for seven years until 2005.But its junior days may be over after doubling its European election support to 20.5 per cent. A week ago, for the first time ever, the party pulled ahead of Merkel’s ruling Christian Democratic Union (CDU) in an opinion poll. Those who dismissed that as a statistical fluke have now been silenced by a new Deutschlandtrend poll, for Germany’s ARD public television. It shows the Greens nosing one point ahead of the CDU to 26 per cent.That poll was released an hour after a second poll, for Germany’s second public broadcaster ZDF, also placed the Greens on 26 per cent – one point behind the CDU.The Green Party is no stranger to opinion poll surges and slides but the three surveys, on foot of a Europe-wide surge, suggest to Robert Habeck, the party’s co-leader, that Germany is following a shift into a new political era.IndependenceHe sees his party’s success in its independence from a high-tax, low-tax, left-right political model that has left the CDU and Social Democratic Party (SPD) “trapped in the 1980s”.“The economic model – the question of ever-more consumption – remained untouched but now the ecological question is breaking through,” said Habeck. “The ecological question is not just suddenly there, it was deliberately kept down the whole time.”Voters appear to agree: 27 per cent of Germans believe the Greens have the answers to important future questions, according to the ARD poll, compared to 12 and 2 per cent who trust the CDU and SPD respectively.What makes this Greenquake different is its spread to unlikely corners of Germany.In its postwar history Bavaria has been firmly in the hands of Merkel’s Christian Social Union (CSU) allies. In rural regions like Frankonia, the Greens were mocked as finger-wagging city slickers with unrealistic notions. No more. Green Bundestag MP Manuela Rottmann, elected for the Lower Franconia region, notices new, older voters at her events rethinking the kind of politics Germany needs.For them fair milk prices or the cost of monoculture, single-crop farming on bee populations are not abstract topics for talk shows. They are part of the reality they see around around them in rural Germany.“The push for ever-more consumption held postwar society together, but now people are asking: ‘is there a meaning to life beyond consumption?’” said Rottmann.Climate-change angerNewer Green voters are motivated by their children’s and grandchildren’s climate-change anger. Others are calling time on postwar Germany’s glut of cheap food – a response in part to the trauma of wartime hunger – as an unacceptable burden on animals, farmers and the environment. Even Germany’s holiest of cows – the car – is no longer untouchable.“Some 20 years ago when we discussed public transport people thought ‘they want to take our cars from us’,” said Rottmann. “People saw mobility then as a freedom but now, increasingly, as a burden. They are asking why they have to be so mobile and whether it would be good to do something for regional areas as well as urban centres.”The two public television surveys brought further bad news for Berlin’s ruling coalition. Support for CDU leader Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer has slumped 12 points to just 24 per cent. Meanwhile the ARD poll put the SPD, a week after its leader resigned, in fourth place behind the far-right Alternative für Deutschland (AfD)."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3919613.1559978367!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"us sanctions target iran s largest petrochemical holding group","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tAn oil production platform in the Soroush oil fields alongside an Iranian flag in the Persian Gulf. Photograph: Raheb HomavandiFile PhotoReutersThe United States sanctioned Iran’s largest petrochemical holding group on Friday for indirectly supporting the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), a step it said aimed to dry up revenues to the Iranian military unit but that analysts called largely symbolic.Friday’s sanctions targeted the Persian Gulf Petrochemical Industries Company (PGPIC) for providing financial support to the economic arm of the IRGC, a military organisation in charge of Iran’s ballistic missile and nuclear programmes.The US treasury department said Iran’s oil ministry last year awarded Khatam al-Anbiya, the IRGC’s economic and engineering arm, 10 projects in the oil and petrochemical industries worth $22 billion (€19.4 billion), four times the official budget of the IRGC.The new sanctions come as the Trump administration seeks to increase economic and military pressure on Iran both because of its nuclear and missile programmes as well as its support for proxy groups in Syria, Iraq, Lebanon and Yemen.US president Donald Trump antagonised Iran, and dismayed key US allies, when he last year pulled out of a 2015 agreement between Iran and world powers under which Tehran curbed its nuclear program in return for easing some sanctions.US-Iranian tensions have heightened further since April because of Washington’s moves to cut off Iran’s oil exports, its deployment of an aircraft carrier strike group to deter any Iranian attacks on US interests, and recent attacks on Saudi, Norwegian and Emirati tankers that Washington blamed on Tehran.Iran has denied responsibility for the May 12th attacks on four tankers off the United Arab Emirates coast.The US treasury said it had also sanctioned the PGPIC holding group’s network of 39 subsidiary petrochemical companies and foreign-based sales agents. PGPIC and its units have 40 per cent of Iran’s petrochemical production capacity and account for 50 per cent of Iran’s petrochemical exports, it said.“This action is a warning that we will continue to target holding groups and companies in the petrochemical sector and elsewhere that provide financial lifelines to the IRGC,” US treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin said in a statement.AnonymitySenior Trump administration officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, described the sanctions as the latest examples of a broad economic clampdown on Iran’s economy that would help dry up funds for the IRGC, a key part of its military.“This would continue to have a very chilling effect on the prospects for any future recovery for the Iranian economy,” one official told Reuters, saying the petroleum and petrochemical industries “have been serving for the last 40 years as a kind of institutionalised slush fund for the IRGC.”US persons are already barred from nearly all dealings with the Iranian economy, so the latest sanctions largely apply only to non-US companies and iniduals.Three analysts and a former treasury official said the latest sanctions will likely have only a modest effect because non-US companies already shy away from doing business with Iran’s petrochemicals sector because of existing sanctions.Under sanctions reimposed on November 5th after Trump left the Iran nuclear deal, anyone carrying out a significant transaction in Iranian petrochemical products could already be hit by a menu of sanctions, including being barred from the United States.Friday’s step makes P6GPIC and the 39 affiliates “specially designated nationals,” a status that effectively blocks US persons from dealing with them. Further, anyone who does so themselves risks becoming a “specially designated national.”Suzanne Maloney of the Brookings Institution think tank described the latest US sanctions as “a natural next step in what I think is a deliberately redundant array of restrictions.”“The administration is banking on the overlapping authorities and obstacles to compound the pressure on the Iranians and create a sense that the entire economy is off limits,” she said.The former treasury official, who asked not to be named, said the new sanctions would have little effect because most multinationals had already ceased dealing with Iran, and described them as “a public relations” move.“It’s a good way of keeping the political pressure on the front page,” the former official said.–ReutersRead more about the Donald Trump administration"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3918675.1559938031!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"rise of the brexit party could make the uk s eu departure less likely","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t Boris Johnson said  the Conservatives must deliver Brexit by October 31st to neutralise the Brexit Party. Photograph: Daniel Leal-Olivas  AFPAhead of the start of the Conservative leadership contest next week, the Peterborough byelection result has exposed in the starkest terms the predicament in which the party finds itself.In a marginal seat that has passed between Britain’s two biggest parties for decades, the Tories were pushed into third place behind Labour and the Brexit Party.Labour’s 31 per cent was the lowest vote share for a winning party in a byelection since 1945. But the Brexit Party’s almost 10,000 votes came mostly from the Conservatives, with Labour losing much less support to the Liberal Democrats and the Greens.More than a fifth of the 313 Conservative MPs at Westminster have majorities smaller than 5,000 and the Brexit Party represents a mortal threat to each of them. Boris Johnson argued on Friday that Peterborough means the Conservatives must deliver Brexit by October 31st to neutralise the Brexit Party.But Jeremy Hunt warned that risking an election before Brexit was delivered by threatening to leave the EU without a deal would allow Jeremy Corbyn “to sneak through the middle”.Peterborough was a setback for the Brexit Party, fresh from its success in last month’s European Parliament elections and full of bluster about its chances in a general election. Peterborough, which voted almost two to one for Brexit, in a byelection triggered by the criminal conviction of the sitting Labour MP, was probably the easiest target the party will ever find.VolunteersLabour owed its victory in large part to its superior ground game and to a small army of committed, well-organised volunteers from Momentum, which supports Mr Corbyn’s leadership. Mr Corbyn said on Friday that Labour had not yet reached the point of shifting its Brexit policy towards unequivocal support for a second referendum.But that change in policy is coming, probably soon after the election of the next Conservative leader. If the Labour leadership doesn’t move first, the membership will make the change at the party conference in September.\u0026nbspBacking a second referendum with a view to remaining in the EU would cost Labour votes in some Leave-voting constituencies. But if the Brexit Party is still around at the next general election, it could take enough votes from the Conservatives to allow Labour to hold such seats on a lower vote share, just as it did in Peterborough.A Labour government, with or without the support of smaller parties, would be unable to deliver Brexit without a second referendum. So the rise of the Brexit Party would have had the effect of making Britain’s departure from the European Union less likely.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

In June 1944, as a Switchboard Operator recently trained in the new technology of VHF radio, 17-year-old Marie Scott practically skipped down all 350 of them, deep into the tunnels underneath the cliffs of Fort Southwick.Living, working and sleeping in the tunnels was not very pleasant: eight-hour watches in a 24-hour duty, then off for a day. For the staff of the Naval Command headquarters just outside Portsmouth, the fetid air and lack of natural light underground meant the steps provided welcome exercise on their way back to the surface.Day and night meant nothing to Marie and her colleagues: the wireless operators, plotters, planners and telegraphists from across the services, who sat at their stations in the windowless offices or slept in small, cramped rooms on three-tier bunks.Even so, they knew their hardships were nothing compared to the men they would be speaking to on the other end of their wireless sets. They’d been informed on June 4 that a big operation was planned for the next day, but hadn’t been told why a 24-hour delay meant that it would now be starting on the sixth.Marie Scott at Southwick House, Portsmouth. She was a 17-year-old switchboard operator on D-DayWhatever was happening up there on the surface, in the air and on the sea off the south coast of Britain, the nine WAAFs, Wrens and Auxiliary Territorial Service personnel in Marie’s section knew this was no rehearsal it was the real thing.“I grew up on that day,” Mrs Scott says. “I became aware of the reality of war.”General Dwight D Eisenhower, Supreme Commander of Allied Expeditionary Forces in Europe, had arrived in Southwick House on June 2 to establish his headquarters for the invasion. Chosen because of its proximity to the port, and to the underground naval command headquarters dug into the cliffs, Southwick House had been requisitioned for the Royal Navy’s navigation school earlier in the war.The date for D-Day was dictated by the weather. With a full moon and suitable tide, the period June 4 to 7 was optimal, with a few days from the 18th as Plan B.If they didn’t go in June, the next suitable tide was not until September and by then the secret would have undoubtedly slipped out. The Germans knew an invasion was coming - the mass of Allied vehicles, manpower and ships meant it was only a matter of time - but they didn’t know where, and they didn’t know when.But there was a problem. The British and American meteorologists had different ways of doing things and couldn’t agree on the most suitable date. The situation was not helped by the fact that James Stagg, Eisenhower’s chief weather adviser and a civilian later given the notional rank of Group Captain in the RAF so as to be more readily accepted by the military, was actually a geophysicist.An intense rivalry had developed between him and the weathermen. Meteorology at this time was more art than science and there hadn’t been any significant advances in the subject since the First World War.  On June 4 Stagg recommended to Eisenhower that the weather was so bad, with high wind and cloud cover, that D-Day, planned for June 5, should be postponed.Eisenhower asked his component commanders their view. “Chancey,” said Air Chief Marshal Leigh Mallory, the air commander. “Do-able but risky” thought Sir Arthur Tedder, Eisenhower’s deputy. General Montgomery, the overall ground force commander, in charge of all British, American and Canadian troops (and later Polish forces) was unequivocal in his belief they should launch.Eisenhower made his decision. “OK, we’ll go,” he said to Stagg. A signal sent to London and Washington stated ‘Halcyon plus five’ (Halcyon being the code word for June 1). The invasion was on.Despite knowing an attack was coming, the remarkable success of Operation Fortitude, under General George Patton’s First US Army Group, had convinced the Germans that any attack in Normandy would be just a ersion for the main assault at Pas-de-Calais.General Patton was considered by the Germans to be the best allied general and therefore certain to be the commander of the coming invasion. He based himself in Kent, with real soldiers bolstered by dummy equipment available for the eyes of German intelligence.Operation Fortitude worked so well that even after D-Day the Germans held many of their best troops in the Calais area expecting a second invasion.Further afield Britain’s secret agents, the Special Operations Executive (SOE), were doing their bit. In some areas, the Germans were using carrier pigeons to send messages. The SOE put birds trained to fly towards Britain in German army pigeon lofts so the messages were delayed or simply disappeared. The French resistance blew up the radio land lines, to force the Germans to use other means of communication which, with Enigma cracked, enabled the Allies to listen in.Pigeons had a vital role in the war Dummy paratroopers were dropped across Seine-Maritime, Calvados and Manche and an SAS team, parachuted into the Cotentin peninsula five miles west of Saint-Lo, installed loudspeakers to play combat noises, including explosions and the sound of soldiers swearing.  The RAF’s 617 Squadron - made famous by the Dambusters raid in 1943 - dropped strips of metal foil known as ‘window’ miles away from Normandy. German radar operators were fooled into thinking they were seeing an approaching naval fleet, where in fact there was none.The deception plan was working. Just as well, there was no way now of stopping the vast armada of ships and aircraft departing on the biggest operation of its kind ever mounted what Eisenhower later called “the great crusade”.Having made his decision, Eisenhower was rendered temporarily powerless as the massive machine of war stirred into action.On the afternoon of June 5, he had been driven to Greenham Common to visit the troops of the 101st Airborne Division, a force expected to have one in every two men killed, wounded or captured. He handed out cigarettes and talked to them about fly fishing a photo from the time captures him with hands aloft, as if explaining how to cast.Eisenhower gives the order of the day to US paratroopers on June 6, 1944 Returning to Southwick House he stood on the ridge to watch the deployment. It was said to be the only time he showed emotion a certain moisture around the eyes. New challenges would face him in the future, but nothing ever again on the scale of D-Day.Just after midnight on June 6, paratroopers from the British 6th Airborne Division, the first of 23,400 airborne troops, jumped into Normandy. The German artillery battery at Merville needed to be silenced before it could fire on to the beaches where British and Canadian forces were due to land a few hours later. Two bridges over the Caen canal and the River Orne were to be seized to prevent German reinforcements arriving from Calais.The glider-borne assault on the bridges was so successful - 15 minutes from landing to capture - they were renamed Pegasus and Horsa Bridges, after the emblem of British airborne forces and the gliders they had flown in on.Lieutenant Herbert Denham ‘Den’ Brotheridge, killed just after midnight on the 6th while leading a charge to seize Pegasus Bridge, was the first allied soldier killed on D-Day.Pegasus Bridge: No 1 glider (in background) piloted by Jim Wallwork landed within feet of the planned targetAt 02:40 Field Marshal von Runstedt, commander of the German Army in France, was told of fighting in Normandy, but still believed the main invasion would be at Pas-de-Calais.Although the potent 21st Panzer Division was available, Hitler was asleep at Berchtesgaden and his staff were too nervous to wake him up to order the reinforcements, as they still thought the fighting was a ersionary raid.It was another two hours before Von Runstedt ordered the 12th SS Panzer Division into action, but his decision was rescinded at 06:30 by General Jodl at the Armed Forces High Command, who still wanted to wait for Hitler to wake up.Assault routes into Normandy - DDAYIn the early hours of June 6, the invasion fleet arrived at the assembly point south of the Isle of Wight called Area Z - better known as Piccadilly Circus - and passed through a lane cleared in the German minefield which extended to Norway. It then turned south, towards the Normandy beaches.At 04:30, an hour after the assault troops had started cross-decking into the landing craft far out in the English Channel, struggling to descend the nets into vessels that were pitching uncertainly below them, and just as Von Runstedt was ordering the Panzer reinforcements, two British X-class midget submarines surfaced off the Normandy coast.For the preceding two days, each craft and their five-man crew had sat silently, waiting for the invasion. Their mission: erect 18-foot telescopic masts equipped with navigation lights and radio beacons to guide British and Canadian landing craft to the beaches.Canadian soldiers from 9th Brigade land with their bicycles at Juno Beach in Bernieres-sur-Mer on D-DayAs H-Hour approached, the time of the ground invasion, rocket launcher barges started firing salvoes onto the beaches in a bid to clear the minefields. On Gold, Juno and Sword beaches in the British sector, where 61,715 British and 21,400 Canadian soldiers were to land, 20,000 rockets blasted the sand, with a similar number fired at Utah and Omaha beaches in the American sector, where 73,000 US troops would be arriving shortly.  However, Forward Observers out at sea struggled to see through the clouds of smoke and brick dust being thrown up from the coast by the naval gunfire. Consequently, much ammunition was wasted on targets randomly picked off the map. As the landing craft approached the beaches, smelling of diesel, sweat and vomit, the men geared themselves for the imminent assault unaware that much of the German coastal defence remained intact.Security around the operation had been rigid. The secret map board in Southwick House, depicting the coasts of England and Normandy and which showed all the locations of the deployed forces, covered an entire wall.Produced by carpenters at Chad Valley toys in Birmingham, the section was one small part of a larger piece that had been ordered, showing Britain and the entire European coastline from Norway to Spain.When the carpenters had erected the section they commented that the invasion was obviously planned for Normandy. “Yes,” came the answer, “and you’re going to jail.”Allowed to do odd jobs around the house by day, the two men were locked up each night. They had only planned to stay for the weekend but were kept at Southwick House until September. History does not record what they told their wives upon their return.Not even the tea ladies were allowed in. One Wren, Marsi Taylor (known as Aunt Marsi),  had worked in the headquarters throughout the war but had never seen the map room before visiting in 2014.Two bizarre security incidents had particularly concerned the authorities and show how seriously efforts to deny the plan’s discovery by German spies had been taken.In early 1944 codewords related to D-Day were revealed in the ’s crossword puzzle: Gold and Sword were dismissed as commonly-used crossword answers, but then more exotic words started to appear.On May 22 came the clue ‘Red Indian on the Missouri (5)’. The answer: Omaha, codename for the beach to be taken by the 1st US Assault Division. Then, on May 27, came Overlord, the name for the entire Normandy campaign. Coincidence? Perhaps.But on May 30 came Mulberry (the floating harbours used in the landings) and on June 1 the solution for 15 down was Neptune (the naval assaults onto the beaches). Alarm bells rang and MI5 visited Leonard Dawe, the ’s crossword compiler, who later said “they made me sweat”.Troops landing on D-Day at Sword beach. The picture was taken from a photo reconnaissance Mustang aircraft of II (Army Cooperation) SquadronThe second case involved Helen Duncan, a spiritualist and clairvoyant. She was the celebrity mystic of her day and had supposedly given seances to King George VI and Churchill. She was also a con artist who used to spit out fluid claiming it was ectoplasm, while her husband rattled the windows.She claimed she could talk to the dead through the spirit of an Able Seaman who had been on HMS Barham, a battleship sunk in the Meditaerranean with the loss of 861 men. The Admiralty was concerned as it had not released the details of HMS Barham’s loss.In the febrile and paranoid security atmosphere ahead of D-Day, Duncan was put under surveillance and later arrested after a seance attended by two superstitious naval officers who thought she might reveal the secrets of the imminent invasion. She was acquitted of fraud but found guilty of witchcraft under the 1735 Witchcraft Act and sentenced to nine months in Holloway prison.D-Day 75 years on | Read moreAt 06:30 US troops from the 1st and 29th Divisions landed over a four-mile front at Omaha beach. The US 4th Division put ashore the first of 23,250 men on Utah beach at the same time.Immediately there were problems at Omaha. Many landing craft missed their targets or were swamped in the choppy seas. Of the 29 Duplex Drive tanks (modified Shermans with floats) in the first wave, 27 sank. German resistance - from the 352nd Infantry Division - was stronger than anticipated.On one landing craft a flamethrower operator had been hit and his weapon exploded, blasting him into the sea and spewing blazing fuel over the decks. The vessel caught fire and continued burning all day, periodically lit up again by detonations from exploding 20mm Oerlikon ammunition.At 07:25 the British 3rd Division landed at Sword beach, intending to take the town of Caen and the Carpiquet aerodrome by nightfall. The seizure of the La Breche strongpoint covering the beach took three hours and cost the South Lancashires 107 men killed. On one part of the beach a solitary French girl was seen wading through the surf to help wounded men out of the water.Five minutes after Sword, Gold beach was assaulted by the British 50th Division who must hold the position to allow the two Mulberry harbours - vast prefabricated structures vital for offloading the two million troops and critical supplies - to be established.Marie Scott, manning her VHF Switchboard in Fort Southwick, was shocked when the soldiers on the beaches started radioing back. “When they passed their message you could hear gunfire, cannon fire, all the sounds of war,” she said.“Suddenly you realised that this was the reality of war. Men were dying there. And at 17, and being rather naive, I don’t think it had fully registered, until the moment I got the first message back and could hear the sounds of war.”British troops take positions on Sword beachAfter hours without a decision, and with Hitler still asleep, at 07:40 General Edgar Feuchtinger unilaterally ordered his 21st Panzer Division to reinforce the eastern beaches. Hitler woke up an hour and a half later, but regarded the news from Normandy as excellent, still thinking - thanks to Operation Fortitude\u0027s chain of deceptions - that the morning\u0027s events were a cover for the real invasion at Pas-de-Calais.The assault on Utah progressed well, even though the tide had taken the landing craft a mile south of their intended positions. Brigadier General Theodore Roosevelt Jr, the 56-year-old son of the former president, was in the first wave.Meanwhile, wading towards Sword beach, in a bid to rally the men of 1st Special Service Brigade, Piper Bill Millin struck up Hieland Laddie as his Cameron tartan floated around him. The man behind him was hit and sank, but Millin kept going. Once ashore he did not run, but walked up and down the beach, blasting out a series of tunes, including The Road to the Isles. German prisoners later admitted that they had not attempted to shoot him because they thought he had lost his mind.Piper Bill Millin strikes up Blue Bonnets as 1st SS Brigade Commandos wade ashore at Ouistreham on Sword beachThe 3rd Canadian Infantry Division landed at Juno beach at 07:45, having had H-Hour delayed by 10 minutes due to rough seas. But even then some craft were late. As a result, many hit obstacles submerged by the tide and the coxswains could do little to prevent the landing craft becoming entangled. The Engineers struggled to clear a path and almost a third of the vessels were destroyed by mines. They took heavy casualties.Likewise, the situation at Omaha was becoming desperate. Vehicles were stuck in the deep water and wounded men on the beach were drowning as the tide came in. General Bradley, commander of the US First Army and in charge of the assaults on Omaha and Utah, watched the chaos from the cruiser the USS Augusta. He came close to stopping the operation and considered erting troops from Utah.Pinned down on Omaha, Colonel George Taylor, commander of the US 16th Infantry Regiment, shouted to his men: “Two sorts of people are going to stay on this beach, those who are dead and those who are going to die. Let’s get the hell out of here!” There were hundreds of bodies on the beach and floating in the water. Commonwealth personnel, nearly all British and Canadian, outnumbered the Americans on D-Day. Of the 156,000 men landed in France on June 6, 73,000 were American, and 83,000 were British and Canadian, while the Commonwealth naval contingent was twice that of the Americans. The Germans were formidable opponents, and by this stage of the war the British Armed Forces were tired, having been fighting for nearly five years. The Americans wanted to get the job done and some questioned why it was taking Britain so long. But in truth the country was almost exhausted and close to bankruptcy.In late 1943 the Home Secretary, Herbert Morrison, had told Churchill that Britain was unable to replace any battle casualties. Consequently, Montgomery was fighting the war with the Army he had, rather than the one he wanted, and morale was fragile. He was criticised after the war for excessive caution, but the priority at the time was to preserve his fighting power. He had been told by Churchill to win well and sufficient for Britain to maintain her world power status.Ron Smith was a 19-year-old electrical technician on Landing Craft Tank 947 when he left Gosport early on D-Day. He thought at first it was another rehearsal, like he was used to in Scotland, but the skipper said they were going to France instead. “Do we need a passport?” asked one of the crew.The craft landed on Sword beach at 07:30, closed up, at action stations, carrying six 80-tonne Churchill tanks, with a rocket ship behind Ron blasting the mines on the beach. “I don’t reckon a whelk could have survived on that beach,” he said.Ron Smith, who was on landing Craft Tank 947 which was sunk by shellfireRon’s landing craft was hit by shellfire. The third tank was immobilised, blocking the exit ramp, and the torpedoes on the landing craft exploded, killing a number of men on board. They managed to get off the beach but the craft was partly submerged, due to the damaged tank on the ramp, and was mistaken for a submarine on their way back to Portsmouth.Despite the shock of the action Ron, now 94, was impressed with the whole operation. “It was beautifully organised,” he said, “if you can say that in a war.”Back in Eisenhower’s headquarters at Southwick House there was a frenetic atmosphere. The map room was a hive of activity and noise, with telegrams coming in, phones ringing and signals presented to staff officers. Along one wall a huge gantry seated service men and women reporting the progress of the landings. The room was enveloped in a fug of cigarette smoke.People rushed to put things on the map - and remove them. Sybil Parker, a Wren working in the headquarters, had a Canadian boyfriend called Captain James Morley. Sybil watched as the small wooden marker denoting his ship was removed from the map board after being hit by enemy fire. She found out 10 weeks later that he had been killed on D-Day at Juno beach.Sybil Parker only learned her beloved had died when his ship was removed from the big map In the middle of it all was Eisenhower. Under huge stress, he ate little and slept even less, surviving on five packets of cigarettes a day and a lot of coffee.  Billetted in tents in the grounds of Southwick House, Eisenhower relaxed by reading cheap cowboy books and was known to have a volcanic temper that disappeared as quickly as it had flared.With his political master, Roosevelt, 3,000 miles away in Washington, Eisenhower was under great pressure from Churchill. Repeatedly dragged to Chequers, he was served tepid Irish stew, for which he developed a lifelong aversion, and had to endure Churchill’s rambling, alcohol-fuelled monologues.Churchill could be a “terrible pest” in the words of Field Marshal Alan Brooke, Chief of the Imperial General Staff. He had turned up at Southwick House unannounced on May 3 with General Charles de Gaulle. His force of nature character was unwelcome, as was his earlier insistence that the British and Canadian beaches should be called Goldfish, Jellyfish and Swordfish. He was told men shouldn’t have to die on a beach called Jellyfish. It was changed to Juno and fish was dropped from the objective names.  The first tanks enter Sword Beach, near Ouistreham Churchill’s extraordinary ability to lead was beyond question, but he did have one particularly concerning trait: a desire to be in the thick of the action. A soldier at heart, he was never entirely happy allowing the admirals, generals and air marshals a free hand and often wanted to see things for himself.His insistence on being able to watch the beach assaults for himself aboard HMS Belfast  and then set foot on the French coast presented Eisenhower with one of his more delicate diplomatic conundrums. He elected to speak to Alan Lascelles, Private Secretary to King George VI, who, in turn, took the matter to the Monarch.Winston Churchill visiting the Normandy landing beaches in France with Field Marshal Montgomery the month after D-DayThe King wrote a letter to Churchill. It read: My Dear Winston, I want to make one more appeal to you not to go to sea on D-Day. Please consider my own position. I am a younger man than you. I am a sailor and as King I am the head of all three services. There is nothing I would like better than to go to sea, although I have agreed to stay at home. Is it fair that you should then do exactly what I should have liked to do myself?He went on:  You will see very little but you will be at considerable risk. You will be inaccessible at a critical time when vital decisions might have to be taken. However unobtrusive you may be, your very presence on board is bound to be a very heavy additional responsibility to the Admiral and Captain...Churchill stayed at home.De Gaulle likewise was a prickly house guest. He had just arrived from Algiers and was livid to be told about the invasion - which his staff had had no part in planning - and that Eisenhower, rather than he, was to run a provisional government in France.That the US Treasury had been printing ‘French occupation dollars’ was a further point of tension. De Gaulle, already deeply suspicious of what he saw as an Anglo-Saxon plot to marginalise France, objected to the term ‘occupation’.It was at this point Eisenhower’s true greatness shone through. He had the ability to calm things down and was the embodiment of a coalition soldier, able to hold together a very fractious group.Eisenhower had walked in the gardens of Southwick House with De Gaulle. They smoked, and the American let the Frenchman, whom he outranked by three stars, harangue him about the plan. In an inspired moment, Eisenhower tuned and said “General, do you have any further advice for me?”De Gaulle, acknowledging Eisenhower’s patience and position, then said “Mon General, if I were you I would delay no further” and he left. Churchill departed also, in a huff because he had not been allowed to interfere in any way. He said to the staff “good luck and God speed, but I’ve been told not to talk to you,” before storming off.By early afternoon Juno, Sword, Gold and Utah beaches were largely stable and the situation at Omaha was improving, although many hours behind schedule. Lord Lovat and his Commandos, accompanied by piper Bill Millin, had relieved Major John Howard and the 2nd Oxfordshire and Buckinghamshire Light Infantry at the Bénouville bridges. Georges Gondrée, proprietor of the Café Gondreé, approached with champagne for Lovat. He was waved away with the words: I\u0027m working.The forces of 50th Division had pushed inland four miles from Gold beach towards the town of Creully and 47 Commando Royal Marines had taken Port-en-Bessin to close the gap with the US forces at Omaha. Caen, home to 60,000 civilians, was bombed at 13:30 by over 70 B-24s of the 2nd Bombardment Division in an attempt to cut German communication lines. Despite a leaflet drop over the town earlier, warning civilians of an Allied air attack, there were many casualties.Winston Churchill talking to British and Canadian troops in Caen, in July 1944  At 15:00  the first sections of two massive artificial harbours code-named Mulberry headed across the Channel. Built of concrete and steel they were critical in the resupply of the Allied forces. It was not until 20:55 that the town of Arromanches, south of Gold beach, was captured, enabling the safe deployment of the Mulberry harbours. Reinforcements started to arrive by glider in the evening. Operation Mallard launched 250 gliders, with RAF fighter escort, in support of the British 6th Airborne Division. Denzil Cooper, then a 23-year-old Sergeant in the Glider Pilot Regiment, flew the third aircraft into Ranville at 21:00, towed behind an Albemarle. Horsa gliders were designed so that the tail could be detached once on the ground, for the easy deployment of the vehicles or men inside.Approaching Ranville in attack formation, he saw the tail of a neighbouring glider suddenly drop off, causing the aircraft to plummet to the ground. “I thought, hmm, that’s the end of them,” he said.Aerial view of pieces of the Mulberry Harbour at Arromanches, built to help troops and machinery onto the beach By the end of the day the 159,000 Allied troops, marines, airmen and naval personnel ashore had successfully established four sizeable beachheads. The invasion front remained vulnerable to German counter-attack, and there was still terrible fighting ahead, but a crucial step had been taken towards liberating Europe.Professor Richard Holmes said of the Normandy campaign: “The forces of a mighty coalition had entered the continent of Europe and mistakes not withstanding, struck a telling blow at its occupiers. They deserve our gratitude.”A month after D-Day, on the afternoon of July 11, Eisenhower found a handwritten note inside his wallet. It had been written on June 5 as he was driven to Greenham Common to visit the 101st Airborne Division.He had prepared the note in case the landings were repulsed and the operation had failed, in a bid to shield his staff from criticism.   The note said: Our landings in the Cherbourg and Le Havre area failed to gain a satisfactory foothold and I have withdrawn the troops. My decision to attack at this time and place was based on the best information available. The troops, the air and the navy did all that bravery and devotion to duty could do. If any blame or fault attaches to the attempt it is mine alone.As the longest day - as D-Day became known - drew to a close 4,413 Allied soldiers were dead. German losses are thought to be between 4,000 and 9,000. The whole Normandy campaign lasted 77 days (Montgomery had expected 90) and resulted in the destruction of the German 7th Army and 5th Panzer Army.In total 209,672 Allied soldiers were killed, wounded or listed as missing. This casualty rate, including the Germans and civilians, was 6,674 killed a day, each day of the Normandy campaign- a rate that exceeds the attrition rate of Verdun, the Somme and Passchendaele during World War One. An infantry Platoon Commander had a one-in-seven chance of surviving longer than two weeks.Casualties and Deaths - DDAYMarie Scott is now 92, and on June 5, 2019 will be presented with the Legion d’honneur, France’s highest award, as a mark of the respect France continues to have for the men and women who helped liberate the country.Mrs Scott says the significance of D-Day dawned on her only in retrospect. “To have been awarded the Legion d’honneur was remarkable, almost unbelievable, truly overwhelming.“But in comparison to the men who landed on the beaches and were injured or died, there is no comparison.”The  values your comments but kindly requests all posts are on topic, constructive and respectful.

They are still not getting a seat at the table.”London teenager Stephen Lawrence, who was murdered in a racist attack on April 22, 1993, aged 18Ms Watson works through the trust set up in the name of the murdered London teenager to help disadvantaged BAME youngsters fulfill his dream of becoming an architect.But she points out that  less than a quarter of board members of FTSE 100 companies are women, and less than seven per cent come from black, Asian or minority ethnic backgrounds.At the same time  black graduates are around twice as likely as white graduates to be unemployed and only 1 in 15 people in a management position are from BAME backgrounds.Particularly damning is the fact that at the time of his death in 1993 ethnic minority youngsters like Stephen had only a 1 per cent chance of becoming an architect and that figure is now slightly lower.“Something has changed visually in terms of more ethnic minority people like me being recognised, and that is welcome, but the reality on the ground is very poor when it comes to people’s opportunities.  We have a lot of work to do,” added Ms Watson. “With the help of everybody in this country we’ll start to see the real change that Stephen wanted to inspire.”Others from an ethnic minority to be recognised in this year’s Queen’s Birthday Honours include Nimco Ali and Leyla Hussein, who receive OBEs for their work at the forefront of the global campaign against female genital mutilation (FGM).Nimco Ali, who has been awarded an OBE in the Queen\u0026#39s Birthday Honours List for services to tackling FGM and gender inequalityMs Ali and Dr Hussein, who are of Somali origin, both suffered FGM at an early age and have dedicated themselves to ending the practice and encouraging women to take the lead in speaking out against it.Dr Hussein, the global ambassador for the UK aid funded The Girl Generation, which is helping to build an African led movement against FGM, said: “FGM is not a cultural or religious practice, it is actually violence against women to stop them experiencing pleasure.“I hope other places around the world will see the government funding and recognition our organisations receive as a great example.”Also recognised is Simon Woolley, the founder of Operation Black Vote, who receives a knighthood for his work in encouraging BAME communities to take more part in the political process Cush Jumbo, the star of The Good Wife, who receives an MBE and Chris Ramsey, who receives an MBE for services to football and ersity in sport.Mr Ramsay’s work as a coach with Tottenham Hotspur, Queens Park Rangers and England’s under-20 and under-17 squads paved the pay for other black coaches in the game. But he warned that the racism he experienced as a footballer in the late 70s and 80s “has never gone away”.All those who survived the horrors of the Holocaust should be honoured before it is too late, a leading campaigner has said after seven survivors were named in the birthday honours list.Walter Kammerling, 95, Ernest Simon, 89, Gabrielle Keenaghan, 92, Ruzena Levy, 89, Ann and Bob Kirk, 90 and 94, and George Hans Vulkan, 89, will all receive British Empire medals for their dedication to Holocaust remembrance and education, which has seen them tell their painful stories to more than 100,000 schoolchildren around the country.Holocaust survivors George Hans Vulkan, Ernest Simon, Walter Kammerling and Ruzena Levy, at the Jewish Museum LondonOther survivors have been recognised in the past, but with many now frail and elderly there is an urgency to the need to make sure all are honoured, particularly at a time of rising anti-Semitism, Holocaust denial and hate, said Karen Pollock, chief executive of the Holocaust Educational Trust.The number of direct Holocaust survivors still alive in Britain is now estimated by the trust to be in the “low hundreds”.Ms Pollock said: “Though smaller in number, there are still survivors who continue to share their testimony, they work hard to educate about the holocaust, who have yet to receive national recognition, and I hope that they too will be rightly recognised while we still can.It is my view that all survivors who have not yet been recognised for their efforts should be.Mrs Levy, 89, who survived the Auschwitz Nazi death camp in German-occupied Poland as a teenager, continues to speak in schools despite suffering nightmares every time she shares her memories of the ordeal.She said: It all makes me suffer, by the fact that I think about it too much beforehand and certainly relive it afterward, but I\u0027m glad to do it, I get very good feedback from children, lovely letters and reports from teachers (about) how much good it has done, and that is satisfying.The 89-year-old, who now lives in Golders Green, north London, added: The honour is a great surprise and appreciated by me and my family, and I\u0027m proud for them.Mrs Levy\u0027s daughter, Shelley, 56, said: She feels that it\u0027s very, very important and she\u0027s running out of time, and she needs to make the most of every day and talk when she can.”Comment: Do we really blame God for leading us right into temptation?Comment: Theresa May was hailed as the new Margaret Thatcher.

It\u0027s such an honour.Olivia Colman as Queen Anne, in The Favourite, for which she won an Oscar for best actressNorwich-born Colman, 45, came to prominence after playing Sophie in Channel 4’s cult comedy series Peep Show, before starring in ITV’s crime drama Broadchurch, BBC drama The Night Manager and films including Hot Fuzz, Tyrannosaur and The Iron Lady, where played Margaret Thatcher’s daughter Carol, opposite Meryl Streep.She recently said that playing the real Queen has been far harder than her role in The Favourite, “because everyone knows what she looks like, everyone knows what she sounds like, everyone has an opinion on whether the casting is right”.Fellow actor Simon Russel Beale, 58, receives a knighthood for services to drama. The stage actor, described as one of the finest of his generation, said: It is a very great honour and I think my mother, were she alive, would be very proud.Establishment honours might have been anathema to the musicians who came out of the punk rock explosion of the 1970s, but four decades on they are finding recognition at the palace.Elvis Costello, 64, whose songs, including Oliver’s Army, (I Don’t Want To Go To) Chelsea and Pump It Up, frequently aimed pointed barbs at British manners and institutions, is being awarded an OBE.Elvis Costello, pictured at the Royal Garden Hotel, London, in September 2018The honour comes after Costello was forced to cancel a string of concerts last year to recover from a “a small but very aggressive cancerous malignancy”, after which he urged fans to heed their doctor’s advice, saying: “It may save your life. Believe me, it is better than playing roulette.”Another child of the punk movement, Feargal Sharkey, 60, the former frontman of The Undertones, is also accepting an OBE.Sharkey and his band of fellow Derry teenagers created a joyful counterpoint to the darkness of the Northern Ireland Troubles, with songs such as Teenage Kicks and My Perfect Cousin chronicling love, rejection and adolescent angst.At the other end of the cultural spectrum Joanna Trollope, 75, the author whose work inspired the term Aga Saga and whose stories of middle class people living unexceptional lives revealed depths of passion and intrigue, is to be made a CBE to add to her OBE.Rachel Whiteread, 56, the artist and sculptor famous for her casts of objects, particularly that of a Victorian terrace house which won her the Turner prize, is being made a Dame.Other stars of entertainment being recognised on this year’s list include Cush Jumbo, the British star of the US drama The Good Wife, who receives and MBE, and Alistair Fothergill, the producer of the acclaimed Blue Planet and Planet Earth series, who receives an OBE.They have become one of the nation’s favourite tea-time treats, even featuring in the opening ceremony of the Commonwealth Games.Now the man who invented the Tunnock\u0027s Teacake is to receive a knighthood in the Queen\u0027s Birthday Honours list.Boyd Tunnock, the head of the Uddingston-based firm which produces the snack, receives the honour for services to business and to charity.Tunnock\u0026#39s managing director Boyd Tunnock walking past a picket line outside Tunnock\u0026#39s factory in Uddinston, when the workforce held a one-day strike over pay in 2010Mr Tunnock, 86, said: When you get to my age, very few things surprise you but this certainly did and I am deeply honoured and grateful to Her Majesty The Queen. Our primary purpose in life is to help others who are less fortunate than ourselves. Our country is full of very worthwhile causes that we can all make a contribution in some way.He developed the famous treat, consisting of a small round shortbread biscuit covered with a dome of Italian meringue filled chocolate  in 1956, after his father challenged him to come up with something new.Retired RAF bomber pilot Tony Cunnane revealed in 2014 how Tunnock\u0027s Teacakes became a favourite ration snack of the V bomber nuclear deterrent flight crews based at RAF Gaydon, after they found they expanded at high altitude when one was left unwrapped and exploded on the instrument panel.The teacakes took centre stage at the 2014 Commonwealth Games opening ceremony in Glasgow, with dancers dressed as teacakes performing at the start of the show, leading to a huge rise in sales the next day.There was controversy in 2016 when Tunnock\u0027s faced a boycott campaign from supporters of Scottish independence after mistaken allegations that the firm had removed the Scottish lion and other national branding from their products.Mr Tunnock, 85, was criticised last year when he donated a Rolls-Royce car to Glasgow City Council at a time when it faced cuts in public services.He confirmed he was behind the gift, saying he just wanted to do “a good thing” for the city.Comment: Do we really blame God for leading us right into temptation?Comment: Theresa May was hailed as the new Margaret Thatcher.

Certainly not our parents. We knew that there were strong levels of parental demand for an alternative approach to schooling in the local area, Jane Smalley, the school\u0027s founder and head teacher, told The Times. “What parents coming to us have so strongly embraced is a combination of the educational philosophy that we offer, the family-centric ethos of the school, the quality of our teaching and, of course, the flexibility to holiday as a family at a time to suit them.”The  values your comments but kindly requests all posts are on topic, constructive and respectful.

The licence itself cost 4.6 million euros (£4.1 million).The construction board will also have to pay 36 million euros (£32 million) over 10 years to cover public costs incurred by its activity.Perhaps the world’s most famous unfinished landmark, the basilica will eventually have 18 towers, including a 172.5-metre central spire, making it the tallest building in Barcelona, around two-and-a-half times the height of Notre-Dame and 60 metres taller than St. Paul’s Cathedral.The foundation added that the licence is “the result of a combined effort between Barcelona City Hall and the Sagrada Família, who have worked closely together over the last two years”.As recently as 2016, municipal officials were shocked to discover that the request for a permit had been pending since 1885, when Gaudí, having taken over the project from Francisco de Paula del Villar, submitted his plans to the town hall of Sant Martí de Provençals, a village now part of Barcelona, but never received a reply.Financed solely by private donations and ticket sales, construction has been intermittent since Gaudí was fatally run over by a tram in 1926 and revolutionaries set fire to the crypt during the Spanish Civil War in 1936, partially destroying the original designs.Nevertheless, the Sagrada Família has become Barcelona’s most-visited monument, welcoming 4,5 million people in 2017, and was named a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2005.  The  values your comments but kindly requests all posts are on topic, constructive and respectful.

Her team kick off their debut Women\u0027s World Cup campaign with a clash against England on Sunday.Author Theresa Breslin, who has written more than 50 books, was awarded an OBE, while Robin Ticciati, principal conductor of the Scottish Chamber Orchestra, received the same honour for services to music.Comment: Do we really blame God for leading us right into temptation?Comment: Theresa May was hailed as the new Margaret Thatcher.

Brexit is greatly exacerbating sector’s problemsClick to followThe IndependentFord is set to close its engine plant in Bridgend next yearSo it’s goodbye Bridgend. With carmaker\u0026nbspFord shutting its engine plant down there, at the direct cost of 1,700 jobs, not to mention all the roles that will be lost in the supply chain, the future for the town looks bleak.\u0026nbspAll that talk about the\u0026nbsp“special relationship” with the US with Donald Trump in town and yet South Wales is losing out to Mexico.\u0026nbspThat’s where the cost advantage lies.\u0026nbspFord to close Bridgend plant in 2020 with loss of 1,700 jobsFears Ford factory could close costing 1,500 jobsFord warns no-deal Brexit will force it to reconsider UK presenceFord is apparently saying it isn’t Brexit. And maybe Bridgend would have been doomed without it. But the company has previously warned that it would have to consider its UK presence in the event of no deal.The problem with Brexit\u0026nbspis that it imposes a cost penalty on every manufacturer in Britain.\u0026nbspThat penalty is theoretical at the moment because we aren’t yet out of the union. But companies like\u0026nbspFord have to look years into the future and without any clear idea about how it will all end up, they’re reliant on worst-case scenarios, such as the imposition WTO style tariffs on goods going in either direction.\u0026nbspWhere the decision on a plant is a marginal one, and even a not so marginal one, Brexit will inevitably tip things over the edge. There is clear evidence that it is already playing a deeply detrimental role when it comes to decisions about investment\u0026nbspmanufacturers are making.Earlier this week,\u0026nbspEY’s regular report into foreign direct investment found a\u0026nbsp35 per cent fall in the money coming into UK manufacturing when compared with 2017. The most recent set of Purchasing Managers’ Index figures showed the sector is now shrinking as the wider economy stagnates.The GMB union, which is doing its best to support its members through what will be a miserable process, says 500,000 manufacturing jobs have gone over the last decade.\u0026nbspMany more redundancies are pending. There are Jaguar’s woes, the closure of Honda’s plant in Swindon, the Sword of Damocles hanging over British Steel.\u0026nbspSet against that, the government’s much-vaunted industrial strategy would be considered a miserable failure except that, as events have rather served to prove, it doesn’t really have one.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.Business news: in pictures Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.110 No deal, no tariffsThe government has announced that it would slash almost all tariffs in the event of a no-deal Brexit.

It is still an important part of the UK economy. Particularly in certain specialist areas, Britain is rather good at it, and it still provides thousands of well-paid jobs in places where there aren’t many of those to be had, where there aren’t many alternatives. Places like Bridgend.\u0026nbspTo avoid more of them being plunged into the horror facing that town, this government, or more likely a future one run by people with a little more concern for working people and their jobs, needs to do more than just talk about an industrial strategy.

Given that many of the people who incur them are under financial stress, that can only be seen as welcome development.\u0026nbspThis sort of policy work can take time (overdraft fees have been a sore point for years), but the FCA is, as a rule, fairly good at it.\u0026nbspCampaigners I have spoken to have also given it high marks for the work it has been doing on financial exclusion, for example. And prior to its overdraft reforms it had capped the interest rates imposed by payday lenders and followed up by clipping the wings of the rent to own sector.\u0026nbspSo, good at policymaking bad at supervisory practice?\u0026nbspThe criticism faced by the watchdog has extended beyond the Woodford mess, about which it could argue that such funds sometimes underperform and investors’ assets are still there. They’ll be able to get their money out once the fund\u0027s illiquid holdings\u0026nbspare sold, albeit probably at a substantial discount.\u0026nbspTake the collapse of bond firm London Capital \u0026amp\u0026nbspFinance, whose unregulated mini bonds left thousands of people out of pocket. It has led to the creation of a judge led inquiry which will, among other things, consider whether the FCA should have intervened at a much earlier stage.\u0026nbspThe regulator has also taken heat over the handling of complaints from small businesses about Royal Bank of Scotland’s Global Restructuring Group, and whistleblowers at Lloyds Banking Group. And there are other such examples.Set against that is the fact that the watchdog employs 3,700 people, of whom just 900 are involved in the frontline supervision of nearly 60,000 firms. Its remit also keeps expanding. Claims management firms and funeral plans are both being added.\u0026nbspIt begs the question: Does the FCA’s apparent slow footedness stem from its failure to effectively utilise its resources? Or does it have enough?Chief executive Andrew Bailey has a case to answer on the former. A couple of years ago one of his first big decisions was to set up a windy review of its mission, which really ought to have been obvious.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.Business news: in pictures Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.110 No deal, no tariffsThe government has announced that it would slash almost all tariffs in the event of a no-deal Brexit.

The company provides automotive and and industrial parts worldwide and the Llanelli plant employs over 200 people. Juergen Ziegler, chief executive for Europe, said that while Brexit was not the only factor, it has brought forward the decision to relocateThe number of cars built in the UK in April plummeted by almost half compared with a year ago, with the drop exacerbated by manufacturers bringing forward summer production stoppages in anticipation of a Brexit\u0026nbspthat was ultimately postponed.Ford workers expressed surprise at how soon the decision to shut the Bridgend plant had been made.Len Jones, 48, who has worked at the plant for seven-and-a-half years, said: It\u0027s devastating. Everyone\u0027s got mortgages to pay and families to support.I expected a little more time to get things sorted.When we found out, everyone was just silent. They gave us letters and we just all went home.It\u0027s hard to take in really, even though we expected it. Now it\u0027s official, it\u0027s a bad thing, really.One worker, who gave the name of Stephen, said: When they came out with the statement, you just don\u0027t take it in do you. But, such is life.The writing has been on the wall for a long time. We knew when the Sigma engine finished there was no replacement. We knew when the AJ engine finished there was no replacement. The predicted volumes for new Dragon engine were 250,000, then 125,000, then the last thing we had was for 70,000.Unions described the news as a “hammer blow” for the community in Bridgend and a “grotesque act of economic betrayal”.The GMB union released an analysis on Thursday showing that the UK has lost half a million manufacturing jobs over the past decade.Ford has announced thousands of job cuts globally\u0026nbspthis year, largely affecting white-collar workers, as the company\u0026nbspseeks to shed unprofitable parts of its business.Brexit could mean more robots in UK manufacturingBrexit prompts slowdown in manufacturing as firms shun UK Video reveals how car manufacturing has changed over 50 yearsBrexit causes record rise in stockpilingUntil recently, the company’s\u0026nbspUK factories had not been thought to be immediately at risk as part of those plans.However, it is understood Ford did not replace a major contract to build engines for Jaguar Land Rover\u0026nbspat the\u0026nbspBridgend plant. That work comes to an end next year.Ford also operates a diesel engine plant at Dagenham, east London, and another factory making transmissions in Halewood, near\u0026nbspLiverpool.The Bridgend plant has been under threat because of falling demand for the two engines it makes\u0026nbspand lower projections for the Dragon engine it is scheduled to start making this year. It has been manufacturing engines for 40 years.\u0026nbspFord’s European profits plummeted 82 per cent last year, in part because of a fall in the value of the pound since the Brexit vote in June 2016.Jeff Beck, a GMB Union regional organiser, said: “Regardless of today’s announcement GMB will continue to work with Ford, our sister unions and the Welsh government to find a solution to the issue and mitigate the effects of this devastating news.“What makes it worse is Donald Trump is in this country talking about a possible trade deal between the UK and the US – yet when the plant closes the new line is likely to be produced in Mexico by an American company.”Len McCluskey, the\u0026nbspgeneral secretary of Unite the Union, said: “Ford’s decision to shut its Bridgend engine plant in 2020 is a grotesque act of economic betrayal.Car industry workers want to leave the EU“These workers and this community have stayed faithful to Ford, as have UK customers – this is still Ford’s largest European market – through thick and thin, but have been treated disgracefully in return by this company.“Ford broke promise after promise to the UK. First, it was that it would build 500,000 engines at Bridgend. That fell to a quarter of a million, then fell again and again to now just 80,000. The company has deliberately run down its UK operations so that now not a single Ford vehicle – car or van – is made in the UK.”The prime minister’s official spokesman said: “I am aware of the reports and I understand that they will be very worrying for workers at Bridgend but the reports are unconfirmed by the company so it is not appropriate for me to speculate or comment further at this time.”Carwyn Jones, a\u0026nbspformer Welsh government leader who is currently an assembly member for Bridgend, told the Press Association: “This has all been very sudden. There was no warning about this at all. It seems to me that any decision, whatever that decision is, would have been taken very recently.“From my perspective, I want to know what’s going on as to with the workers and want to know a reason for the decision, and to work with the Welsh government to see what we can do to help the workers here.“It’s the biggest single employer in the area, I remember it being built in the late Seventies. There are relatively few suppliers locally but there are a number of businesses that provide services for the plant itself and they would be severely affected because for a lot of them this is the only contract they have.”Ford announced last month it was cutting 7,000 white-collar jobs worldwide, with up to 550 expected in the UK.The US manufacturer said the cuts represented 10 per cent of its global salaried workforce and 20 per cent of its management positions.A spokesperson for Unite said: “Our priority is our members’ jobs, the communities and livelihoods in the supply chain that Ford Bridgend supports.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Facebook is rumoured to be in talks with various organisations and is expected to launch the cryptocurrency as early as next year.Facebook declined to comment on any rumours surrounding the cryptocurrency, with a spokesperson telling\u0026nbspThe Independent\u0026nbspthat the company is simply exploring ways to leverage the power of blockchain technology.It is understood that GlobalCoin will be pegged to a basket of currencies, such as the US dollar and euro,\u0026nbspin order to stabilise its value and make it a viable form of currency.Telegram founder gives up eating food to \u0027come up with new ideas\u0027It is also likely to face competition from rival messaging apps, including Telegram.Telegram is expected to launch its so-called GRAM cryptocurrency later this year, though Telegram has significantly less users than Facebook and is banned in several countries, including Russia.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Juergen Ziegler, chief executive for Europe, said that while Brexit was not the only factor, it has brought forward the decision to relocateThe number of cars built in the UK in April plummeted by almost half compared with a year ago, with the drop exacerbated by manufacturers bringing forward summer production stoppages in anticipation of a Brexit\u0026nbspthat was ultimately postponed.Ford workers expressed surprise at how soon the decision to shut the Bridgend plant had been made.Len Jones, 48, who has worked at the plant for seven-and-a-half years, said: It\u0027s devastating. Everyone\u0027s got mortgages to pay and families to support.I expected a little more time to get things sorted.When we found out, everyone was just silent. They gave us letters and we just all went home.It\u0027s hard to take in really, even though we expected it. Now it\u0027s official, it\u0027s a bad thing, really.One worker, who gave the name of Stephen, said: When they came out with the statement, you just don\u0027t take it in do you. But, such is life.The writing has been on the wall for a long time. We knew when the Sigma engine finished there was no replacement. We knew when the AJ engine finished there was no replacement. The predicted volumes for new Dragon engine were 250,000, then 125,000, then the last thing we had was for 70,000.Unions described the news as a “hammer blow” for the community in Bridgend and a “grotesque act of economic betrayal”.The GMB union released an analysis on Thursday showing that the UK has lost half a million manufacturing jobs over the past decade.Ford has announced thousands of job cuts globally\u0026nbspthis year, largely affecting white-collar workers, as the company\u0026nbspseeks to shed unprofitable parts of its business.Brexit could mean more robots in UK manufacturingBrexit prompts slowdown in manufacturing as firms shun UK Video reveals how car manufacturing has changed over 50 yearsBrexit causes record rise in stockpilingUntil recently, the company’s\u0026nbspUK factories had not been thought to be immediately at risk as part of those plans.However, it is understood Ford did not replace a major contract to build engines for Jaguar Land Rover\u0026nbspat the\u0026nbspBridgend plant. That work comes to an end next year.Ford also operates a diesel engine plant at Dagenham, east London, and another factory making transmissions in Halewood, near\u0026nbspLiverpool.The Bridgend plant has been under threat because of falling demand for the two engines it makes\u0026nbspand lower projections for the Dragon engine it is scheduled to start making this year. It has been manufacturing engines for 40 years.\u0026nbspFord’s European profits plummeted 82 per cent last year, in part because of a fall in the value of the pound since the Brexit vote in June 2016.Jeff Beck, a GMB Union regional organiser, said: “Regardless of today’s announcement GMB will continue to work with Ford, our sister unions and the Welsh government to find a solution to the issue and mitigate the effects of this devastating news.“What makes it worse is Donald Trump is in this country talking about a possible trade deal between the UK and the US – yet when the plant closes the new line is likely to be produced in Mexico by an American company.”Len McCluskey, the\u0026nbspgeneral secretary of Unite the Union, said: “Ford’s decision to shut its Bridgend engine plant in 2020 is a grotesque act of economic betrayal.Car industry workers want to leave the EU“These workers and this community have stayed faithful to Ford, as have UK customers – this is still Ford’s largest European market – through thick and thin, but have been treated disgracefully in return by this company.“Ford broke promise after promise to the UK. First, it was that it would build 500,000 engines at Bridgend. That fell to a quarter of a million, then fell again and again to now just 80,000. The company has deliberately run down its UK operations so that now not a single Ford vehicle – car or van – is made in the UK.”The prime minister’s official spokesman said: “I am aware of the reports and I understand that they will be very worrying for workers at Bridgend but the reports are unconfirmed by the company so it is not appropriate for me to speculate or comment further at this time.”Carwyn Jones, a\u0026nbspformer Welsh government leader who is currently an assembly member for Bridgend, told the Press Association: “This has all been very sudden. There was no warning about this at all. It seems to me that any decision, whatever that decision is, would have been taken very recently.“From my perspective, I want to know what’s going on as to with the workers and want to know a reason for the decision, and to work with the Welsh government to see what we can do to help the workers here.“It’s the biggest single employer in the area, I remember it being built in the late Seventies. There are relatively few suppliers locally but there are a number of businesses that provide services for the plant itself and they would be severely affected because for a lot of them this is the only contract they have.”Ford announced last month it was cutting 7,000 white-collar jobs worldwide, with up to 550 expected in the UK.The US manufacturer said the cuts represented 10 per cent of its global salaried workforce and 20 per cent of its management positions.A spokesperson for Unite said: “Our priority is our members’ jobs, the communities and livelihoods in the supply chain that Ford Bridgend supports.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

From the\u0026nbsp50th anniversary of partial decriminalisation of homosexuality to the fifth anniversary of same-sex marriage, we have much to be thankful for. The impact of these achievements,\u0026nbspand the rate of change, from when I attended an all boys Cof E school at the height of Section 28,\u0026nbspis monumental. At the same time, analysis by the University of Manchester\u0026nbspin 2018, based on a National Survey of Sexual Attitudes and Lifestyles in 2010, concluded that British society may be reaching “peak acceptance” of LGBT lifestyle and people.\u0026nbspFrom a very early age I was expected to be a diligent, hard working, studious middle son but at school\u0026nbspI was labelled the gay boy, subjected to taunts and homophobic vitriol purely because of appearing effeminateHowever,\u0026nbspI am reminded of a recent conversation with a gay friend, who suggested that equality is a lofty ideal that is far from reality when taken at a societal level.\u0026nbspHis rhetoric was far more colourful than I can attest but he believed as\u0026nbspLGBT people we were still subjected to stereotyping because\u0026nbspwe live in a straight, heteronormative world that\u0026nbspignores and threatens our lifestyles.AFPGetty Images)In my work as Britain’s First Out Muslim Drag Queen and trans activist, I have striven for visibility and wider acceptance for the Gaysian community, from within my own community and the\u0026nbspwider society. Being of a British Pakistani heritage, I struggled to come to\u0026nbspterms with my identity, within myself and my family, and this was made doubly difficult by our obsession with labels.Lebanon blocks Grindr in latest attack on LGBT+ communityLGBT+ Muslims to lead Pride march with teacher at centre of protestsPrimary school to close early as anti-LGBT+ lesson protests escalateMalta named best destination for LGBT+ travellersThe\u0026nbspother boys saw me as an outcast, which had no grounding in truth. At this time,\u0026nbspI had no sense\u0026nbspof my own sexuality but in the course of being bullied\u0026nbspI grew to associate with the gay label. If everyone assumed the\u0026nbspyoung Asif\u0026nbspwas gay\u0026nbspthen it must be\u0026nbsptrue. Apart from being sexually attracted to boys I had no deep understanding of my sexuality or what I would, many years later, come to decipher as a differing gender identity.In these formative years I identified myself with the gay label because I\u0026nbspwas being oppressed by\u0026nbspit, which fits western stereotypes of effeminacy in boys as being a gay trait. In Pakistan and the south Asian subcontinent,\u0026nbsptrans identities have long been widely acknowledged, a world away from my British upbringing. It was only in my early thirties that I became fully aware of my trans identity and this only occurred when I stopped defining myself by societal standards.Cashman, comedian Rhona Cameron,\u0026nbspactivist Peter Tatchell and Graham Norton\u0026nbsp(Getty)I’ve had the privilege to come out twice. First, as a gay man, when my mother discovered my stash of LGBT scene magazines: that\u0026nbspissue of Boyz magazine\u0026nbspaltered the course of my life. For many years I\u0026nbspled a double life:\u0026nbspa public one, at school,\u0026nbsp where I was confronted with jibes about my sexuality, where\u0026nbspI could only confide in a handful of friends who had also been labelled as gay, to my\u0026nbspprivate family life, where I kept to myself. I could not tell\u0026nbspmy parents about the abuse I was\u0026nbspgetting at school for fear they would believe it and begin to also question my sexuality.Created with Sketch.Best pictures from the 2018 Taipei Gay Pride March in Taiwan Show all 35Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Participants take part in the 2018 Taipei Gay Pride March in Taipei, Taiwan, 27 October 2018.Thousands of people attended the march in Taipei, the capital of Taiwan.Participants walk in the parade.The march took place ahead of a landmark vote next month on LGBT+ rights in Taiwan.On May 24 2017, the Constitutional Court in Taiwan ruled that same-sex couples have the right to marry in the state.After making its ruling on same-sex marriage in May last year, the court stated that its decision must be implemented in two years.On November 24, a public vote will be held in Taiwan on same-sex marriage.A participant of the march poses next to a wedding studio.A young woman from Chongqing in mainland China holds a fan reading free writers before the start of the march.Participants with Pikachu-styled costumes pose as they gather at the square outside the presidential office for the start of the march.Thousands took part in the parade in support of same-sex marriage.Participants in the square outside the presidential office before the start of the parade.A couple take part in the march with their baby.Members of Tokyo Rainbow Pride walk in the parade.The parade was awash with rainbow-coloured paraphernalia.A participant of the march poses with a fan.A participant from Japan holds a banner before the start of the march.A person taking part in the march waves a rainbow flag.A man, decorated with balloons and a rainbow flag, takes part in the celebrations.An American man and his Japanese partner, both wearing headbands saying \u0027Japan\u0027 in Japanese, kiss each other during the march.Thousands of people attended the annual march.Taiwan gay rights activist Chi Chia-wei attends the march.

At the height of the bullying I did not receive any visible support from teachers, who feared being reprimanded for going against the law.My\u0026nbspschool, with a 95 per cent majority Afro-Caribbean student body, and my British Asian ethnicity,\u0026nbsp also played a big part in my experience. The analysis by the University of Manchester found that BAME\u0026nbsppeople were more likely to hold negative views towards the LGBT community, particularly in the 1990s at the height of misinformation and fear about the HIVAids epidemic and governmental ineptitude.My mother once confided in me that she feared for my future, living as gay in a straight world. I remember thinking that she was worrying without reason but after many years of lived experience as a gay man – I do acknowledge her sentimentOne of my parents’ main fears, which guided their decision to take me to the GP and the local imam, was that I had learnt to be gay because I was exposed to it, from school, from pop culture. Their interpretation of religion and south Asian cultural expectations made them question my foundations – the “gay”\u0026nbsplabel took many years to be normalised and understood within my family unit.At the root of their concern was my happiness and safety. My mother once confided in me that she feared for my future, living as gay man in a straight world. I remember thinking that she was worrying without reason but after many years of lived experience as a gay man – I do acknowledge her sentiment.Tatchell\u0026nbspin Brighton at Pride 2018 (Getty Images)I recently rediscovered\u0026nbspThe Velvet Rage\u0026nbspby Alan Downs, a book I had read in my twenties at the suggestion of my then civil partner who lauded it as ground-breaking. So much of it still resonates. Downs argued that growing up gay in a heterosexual world results in the internalisation of shame, a shame gay men may strive to obscure with material success, creativity, beauty or more severe forms of escapist gratification like substance abuse.The chemsex phenomenon, when people take drugs that enhance sex and make them feel uninhibited, has become a prominent subculture within the LGBT community, which has led to the UK’s criminal and health bodies formulating policy. From personal experience I struggled with my LGBT identity and my role within a greater society.Asifa Lahore: ‘I struggled with my intersectionality as a gay, British, Asian, Muslim’ (Christine Hayter)Being of south Asian heritage and effeminate prevented me from being taken seriously. Fresh out of\u0026nbspthe Brit school, these loaded labels were a burden and affected my emotional wellbeing. After years of suppressing my creativity and personal growth, in a career that satisfied my traditional parents,\u0026nbspI created my drag alter ego Asifa Lahore –\u0026nbspmy decision to deviate from the rigid gender norm and toxic masculinity\u0026nbspI had been subjected to,\u0026nbspconsciously and subconsciously.Through Asifa Lahore,\u0026nbspI was able to express myself creatively in a physical form that better fitted society’s understanding of what was expected of an effeminate gay man. Through Asifa Lahore the drag queen, I found an art form that allowed me to subvert societal norms. But in a perverted way I was giving in to my critics, who expected that of me\u0026nbspas an effeminate gay man that\u0026nbspputting on a dress and wig would make more sense.The second time I came out, this time as a transgender woman, I felt freedom like I have never experienced before. Even as I became fully aware of my loss of male privilege and the benefits that come attached to that I felt emblazoned to live as open and authentically as I couldPerforming at cabaret venues and events throughout Britain, I would be heartbroken by the lack of POC faces in the audience, not because they don’t exist but primarily because they don’t feel they belong in these primarily gay, white spaces. The LGBT scene has become more erse but it is still very whitewashed and, arguably, has\u0026nbspracist undertones. Many POC LGBT people complain\u0026nbspof being turned away from prominent gay clubs for not looking or sounding “gay”\u0026nbspenough.I struggled with my intersectionality as a gay, British, Asian, Muslim. I\u0026nbspcouldn’t find a way to allow all these identities to co-exist. One of my first forays into the gay clubbing scene in the early Noughties resulted in a memorable conversation with a fellow clubber, a young white gay man who felt propelled to ask how I,\u0026nbspas a gay, brown Muslim man, could be dancing to Kylie. It was this and many other confrontations like these that led me to delve into my identity.Chutney queens is\u0026nbspan affectionate umbrella term used to describe drag queens who adhere to a Bollywood inspired, culturally south Asian aesthetic. Surrounded by these gregarious clubbers I felt accounted for. I belonged. Such safe spaces exist out of necessity, the need to feel represented.\u0026nbspI have opened my own club night, ‘Disco Rani’, which is a monthly Bollywood and Banghra club night that functions as a safe space for a wide cross-section of Gaysians.Similarly, we have seen a growth in BAME\u0026nbspPrides and events that commemorate our differences, supported by Stonewall but frowned upon by the old guard that question its necessity and the\u0026nbspfragmentation of the LGBT community. The harsh reality is that more work needs to be done to increase visibility and representation of all the peoples that make up the LGBT community and until then these Prides are needed.The second time I came out, this time as a transgender woman, I felt freedom like I have never experienced before. Even as I became fully aware of my loss of male privilege and the benefits that come attached to that I felt emblazoned to live as open and authentically as I could.LGBT activists\u0026nbspdemonstrate against the Supreme Court’s reinstatement of\u0026nbspSection 377, which bans gay sex in a law dating from India’s colonial era (AFPGetty)As annual Pride celebrations begin in earnest I reflect on the importance of such events. Prides are an essential part of our celebration as LGBTQ+ people and now more than ever we must continue to show up and not forget our history. Rights that are long fought for can as quickly be taken away.Visibility must continue, especially in the current climate of the Parkfield school protests and the debate of LGBT education. Such a debate highlights the fact that –\u0026nbspfor all the legal rights and privileges the LGBT community has acquired – more needs to be done. Same sex relationships deserve acknowledgement on equal footing to heteronormative relationships. Visibility is one way to ensure our presence. As Marsha P Johnson did and as Peter Tatchell and Janet Mock continue to do, so we must stand up and make ourselves heard.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Newcomer Molly-Mae got to know several of the male Islanders, leading to some friction with Lucie – though things seem to have reached somewhat of a resolution.Several couples kissed during the rodeo-themed challenge, and sparks are finally flying after a relatively calm first week.Callum leaves the IslandCallum, who had originally been paired with Amber, has become the first Islander to leave the villa this series. He and Amber never demonstrated much chemistry and Callum didn\u0027t really bond with any of the other female Islanders, meaning he was left as the only single man following tonight\u0027s recoupling. In his leaving speech, Callum, who said he had come on the show to meet his future wife, expressed some disappointment, though he still had hope for the future.After being torn between Tommy and Joe for several episodes, Lucie has finally made a choice between the two Islanders. To recap: Lucie was originally paired with Joe, who appears very taken with her, but Tommy picked Lucie as his date after joining the villa, which stirred up trouble. Lucie\u0026nbspwent back and forth between the two men and exchanged kisses with both of them during tonight\u0027s challenge. During the recoupling, though, she picked Joe. Does this mean the love triangle has finally come to an end?Molly-Mae hits it off with TommyNewcomer Molly-Mae seems to really like Tommy, with whom she had quite the flirty chat in the villa\u0027s hot tub. While Molly-Mae did get to know the other Islanders, expressing interest for Michael and Anton. In the end, though,\u0026nbspshe picked Tommy during the recoupling, enabling him to remain in the Spanish villa.Amy and Curtis endureCurtis and Amy seem so smitten with each other you\u0027d be forgiven for forgetting they met five days ago. They\u0027re definitely the old couple of the villa (and have doled out rather wise advice to other Islanders on several occasions). It seemed as though there could be trouble on the horizon when Molly-Mae asked Curtis to have a chat with her in the hot tub, but Curtis promptly told her how much he likes Amy – before clearing things up with his partner. In the end, all was well, and Amy picked Curtis during the recoupling. The two remain fan favourites.So many kissesA\u0026nbspLove Island\u0026nbspchallenge is always a chance for those who are so inclined to exchange a kiss, and tonight\u0027s rodeo game was no exception. Yewande kissed Michael and rather memorably described the experience as being like kissing your brother, but in a good way. Anna and Sherif Tommy and Lucie Joe and Lucie, and Curtis and Amy all smooched as well.Catch up on everything you missed below:Read up on everything that has happened so farRead our review of last night\u0027s episodeHello and welcome to our live blog of\u0026nbspLove Island\u0026nbspday five!

It hopes that private industry can develop the space technologies of the future, and help with its plans to return to the Moon in 2024, taking the first ever woman and the first person in decades.The moon is shrinking and shaking, Nasa saysNasa hopes that the missions help test out and encourage future private missions into space, which could provide funding for further exploration in years to come.The space agency will keep using the ISS as a place for research and testing in low-Earth orbit, doing work that will help contribute towards its plans to head to the Moon, it said. But it will also work with the private sector to allow it to use the ISS to test technologies, train astronauts and encourage the development of the space economy, it said.Nasa will also help develop a whole host of private spacecraft, floating around above the Earth, that can serve as a home for people, Nasa said.The tourists\u0026nbsp– whom\u0026nbspNasa refers to as private astronauts – will go on missions of up to 30 days. While there they will perform duties that can include commercial and marketing activity, which will be limited by Nasa\u0027s rules.There can be two of those short-duration missions each year, Nasa said. They will go on privately funded, dedicated spaceflights that will use a US spacecraft, developed under Nasa\u0027s plan to encourage the private sector to build new spacecraft.The private astronauts will still have to pass Nasa\u0027s medical standards and the training procedures to ensure they are safe on board the ISS.Eventually, private companies could use floating habitations like the ISS to stop off at on their way to further destinations deeper in the solar system.Nasa\u0027s decision to open up the space station comes as a variety of companies start to offer the possibility of space tourism in the future. Elon Musk\u0027s SpaceX, for instance, will send a Japanese billionaire and eight artists around the Moon in a private mission slated for 2023.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The effects of melting ice sheets would have diminished the food supplies. People were dependent on herds of horses and reindeer\u0026nbspand were likely impoverished compared to the previously well-fed population.As a result, Azilian tools were often cruder than those of their ice age predecessors.Gliksman, Inrap)The 25cm x 18cm stone was found during archaeological work at an ”ancient hunting site” near Angoulême train station.The institute said the stone will be presented to the public in Angoulême on the National Days of Archaeology between 14 and 16 June, during the “Blue Suns” festival.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

So allow me to make it here, because it’s actually a very good idea.Those concerns about overcrowded, creaking commuter trains are real: but they cannot be solved without HS2, or something extremely similar. The problem is that explaining why is quite complicated, so politicians haven’t really tried.Some people seem to think HS2 is about “knocking 35 minutes off London to Birmingham”. It isn’t. Yes, it will dramatically reduce journey times: the whole project will cut London-Manchester from\u0026nbsptwo\u0026nbsphours to one it takes around an hour off the journey to Scotland Birmingham to Newcastle is cut from three\u0026nbsphours 15 minutes down to two hours. Birmingham to Nottingham, which currently takes over an hour, falls to an almost ridiculous 19 minutes.

The objective is capacity, and not just capacity for fast intercity services, either, but for those local regional and commuter services between small towns that have been so neglected. The complicated bit is explaining why that is.Britain’s railways were largely built in the Victorian era, for a different kind of travel. Today, the same lines carry a mix of express intercity trains – the kind which HS2 will take – and stopping local and commuter services, the kind people use to get to work, or pop to a neighbouring town.The colossal HS2 bill could cost the north its much-needed railwayThis mix is a very inefficient way to run a railway, for a reason that is quite obvious if you think about it: trains cannot overtake each other on the same set of tracks. They would bang into the back of one another if they tried. Not good. To get around this, local stopping trains need a large gap behind them in the timetable, so the express trains behind them do not catch up. That reduces the number of trains you can have per hour on a line, dramatically reducing its capacity for every type of service – local and express.The engineering thinking behind HS2 is to take those express services off the older mainlines, leaving them for stopping local and commuter services. When trains are all travelling at roughly the same speed on a line, you can fit a lot more in, because the gaps needed between them are smaller.HS2 will take express trains off the West Coast Main Line that links London with Birmingham and the cities of the northwest the Midland Main Line that links London with the East Midlands and Sheffield and to an extent the East Coast Main Line that goes up to Leeds and Newcastle. That frees up capacity across a huge swathe of the country for local services, and it’s the whole rationale behind the project. That the government hasn’t been explaining this ad nauseum is inexcusable.So if the plan is to improve commuter services, why not build a new commuter line instead of a new one for expresses? It wouldn’t make sense: these existing lines are already good for slow trains, and they go into the centres of towns and cities, which have since expanded around them. A new high-speed line for expresses can make use of engineering advances since the 19th century to speed up journeys, and doesn’t have to go into as many built up areas as a local line would, where the need for tunnelling and demolitions would make it more expensive and disruptive. And making a line high-speed doesn’t actually cost that much more, either, if you’re building one anyway. But the key point is that local services benefit, despite the new line being for express trains.HS2 will also bring other direct benefits to cities and towns that aren’t London. Northern Powerhouse Rail (stupid name) is the government’s plan to connect up the cities of the north of England with high-speed rail. It’s currently in development, but the plan, as put together by northern councils, relies on vast sections of HS2 track. Liverpool to Manchester Sheffield to Leeds and towards York and Newcastle – these bits of NPR will use parts of HS2.The government arguably made a huge mistake by starting planning on the NPR scheme so late, leaving people wondering why they were prioritising journeys to London – but with Labour and the Conservatives both committed to the project, it is likely to happen. HS2 and better connections between non-London cities aren’t an eitheror: the two projects are intrinsically linked. If HS2 is scrapped, who knows when a government will next be brave enough to try a major rail project again.In the meantime, the West Coast Main Line is filling up, and can’t wait. The reason ticket prices are a rip-off from\u0026nbspLondon to Manchester (£175 for a walk-up, one-way, anytime ticket is absurd no matter what cheap advance fares are available – sometimes you just have to travel) is because the trains are running completely full and Virgin can charge what they like and still have a passenger in every seat – and sometimes the floor. The number of passengers using the route doubled between 1997 and 2005, and it is well on its way to doubling again. The huge capacity increase that HS2 brings is a response to that.It’s understandable that people are sceptical of a project that has been badly explained, when it isn’t obvious why it deals with the biggest problems they see with the railways. That said, some criticisms are red herrings. Take the environmental impact: over the 140 miles of HS2 line, 29 hectares of ancient woodland will be felled. Sounds bad? But for comparison, a single 2.5-mile road scheme, widening the A21 in Kent and Sussex (not even a new road!), will take down nine hectares, around a third of HS2’s phase 1 total. Extinction Rebellion are barking up the wrong tree on this one far more road schemes will be needed if we can’t shift traffic to more efficient rail, and that means building more capacity. High-speed rail has also proven the greenest way to get people off short-haul flights, dominating routes like London-Paris or Madrid-Barcelona, where polluting planes would otherwise be king. Long term, it’s good for the environment. And new trees are being planted elsewhere to replace the ones cut down.Why does Britain keep making a mess of its biggest projects?Lords report recommends HS2 rethink as costs spiral ‘out of control’HS2 accused of poor planning and ‘unacceptable’ damage to wildlifeExtinction Rebellion activists camp out in trees to protest HS2‘Thousands’ of trees die on HS2 route for lack of waterAny large project will be disruptive, but compared to the other options, HS2 is actually pretty good. Consider one much-touted alternative: upgrading the West Coast Main Line with an extra pair of tracks for more capacity. There are several thousands houses built facing onto the line, and you’re going to need to knock them down to put a railway there. And it won’t be high-speed, it’ll be more expensive to do it, and it’ll be massively disruptive – not just for people losing their homes, but passengers who would face about a decade of closures and replacement buses. The more general problem with suggestions that existing lines should simply be “upgraded” (a rather vague proposal) is that there are simply diminishing returns to what you can do with 150-year old infrastructure. The West Coast Main Line already benefited from a major upgrade programme ending in 2005 it took a decade of disruption and cost over £10bn in today’s money, provided only a fraction of the benefits of HS2, and is already full. Plans to upgrade it further were abandoned because they weren’t seen as practical, and planning for a new line that became HS2 is a direct result of that process.Will HS2 suffer from cost overruns? Probably. Delays? You bet. Infrastructure projects are rarely delivered on time anywhere in the world, not least in western democracies with little things like rule of law and environmental regulation. But once they are finally delivered, nobody cares: you probably don’t even remember that the Channel Tunnel or Jubilee Line extension were fiascos in their time nobody would get rid of them now. HS2 will be the same. It won’t solve every problem with the UK’s rail network, but it is a necessary part of solving a hell of a lot of them. If it gets scrapped, in 10 years’ time people will be talking about building something very similar, and moaning that we didn’t get on with it when we had the chance. Probably while they sit on the floor of an overcrowded train.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It\u0027s why we support a Final Say on BrexitAnd they challenged the invocation of wartime patriotism by the Leave camp, pointing out that it was Sir Winston Churchill who called for the creation of a “European family” to prevent another descent into bloodshed.Churchill’s words helped inspire the creation of the Common Market, which evolved into the European Union with “one main purpose - to create lasting peace by entwining our economies and societies together on a continent once ravaged by war,” they said.“Nato does not keep the peace in Europe – it keeps peace for Europe. It is the EU that keeps peace in Europe, because when you trade, you do not fight.Created with Sketch.D-Day 75: Normandy landings in pictures Show all 30Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created

With concern mounting that the crowded field – which at one point reached 13 contenders – would mean a long and unwieldy election period, Committee officials last week announced a new format designed to cull no-hopers early in the process.Candidates now require the nominations of eight other MPs to stand, rather than the proposer and seconder demanded in previous contests.In a first ballot of Conservative MPs on 13 June, candidates with fewer than 17 votes will be eliminated.\u0026nbspIf all receive 17 or more votes, the least popular goes\u0026nbspout. If there is a tie for last place, officials will speak to the two candidates involved to see whether both should drop out or the ballot be re-run.A second ballot will be held on 18 June, with candidates needing 33 votes or more to survive. Again, if all pass the threshold, the one at the bottom of the list will be removed.By this point, the field should have been considerably narrowed, and further rounds of voting will take place on the following days in the hope of producing a final two by Thursday 20 JuneBetween each ballot, intensive horse-trading can be expected in Westminster as the surviving candidates seek to poach one another’s supporters and hoover up the backers of eliminated candidates.The final two contenders will go through to a postal ballot of an estimated 160,000 party members around the country in July, with the result currently expected in the week of 22 July.It emerged on Thursday that there is no guarantee the new leader’s name will be announced before parliament breaks up for its summer recess, potentially denying the opposition an opportunity to test whether he or she can command a majority in the House of Commons as prime minister.The latest news on Brexit direct to your inboxThe latest news on Brexit direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Quite clearly, it’s a very troubling and difficult time for her and she’ll need to settle down and see what she wants to do.”Ms May clearly values her constituency role – and continues to play it\u0026nbspactively. She has also been a member of the Conservative Party her entire adult life, first standing as an MP in 1992, with a further unsuccessful attempt before winning in Maidenhead in 1997.

The average selling price of a property across the UK in May was £237,837 after a 0.5 per cent month-to-month rise.Experts cautioned that Halifax’s index had been an “outlier” in recent months and that other house price measures have consistently pointed to a slowdown, particularly in London and the southeast of England.\u0026nbspNationwide reported that house prices fell 0.2 per cent between April and May and\u0026nbsprose\u0026nbspjust 0.6 per cent over the year.Created with Sketch.

She had that very self-satisfied expression on her face.Then to stop the interviewer, Piers Morgan, asking her dficult questions, she started gabbling idiocies at  words per second. Like a maling Chatty Cathy doll. It was hilarious. Jabber The Hutt.She made no sense whatsoever. She appeared deranged.Thornberry is the best Labour has to offer. She is easily the most persuasive and talented member of Magic Grandpa’s frontbench. Yes, sure, that isn’t saying much. But here she was utterly lost.And you could see, as she wittered on, the end in sight for a great political party. One I was proud to be a member of for  years. A party which was once great, but now makes no sense whatsoever. A party suffused with hypocrisy.Thornberry was trying to explain why Jeremy Corbyn and the party were so hostile to Donald Trump. And she had no answer. How could she, when Corbyn is happy to call terrorists his friends — but has no time for the democratically elected leader of the free world When Corbyn and his cronies offer support for Socialist catastrophes such as Venezuela. Or totalitarian dictatorships such as Cuba, where trade unionists and homosexuals are imprisoned.Under Corbyn Labour has become a party of educationally challenged, far-left, perpetual adolescents, hostile not only to all of Britain’s allies but to Britain itself. It no longer represents the working class it was set up to protect. If it represents anyone at all it is the affluent, virtue-signalling, metropolitan middle class. And even they are drting away from Labour, appalled by its rank anti-Semitism.This genuinely could be the end of Labour. Despite the worst Government in living memory, it still struggles to hold a lead in the polls. In the Euro elections it was beaten out of sight by the Lib Dems and lost ten seats. Unheard of for the official opposition party! It’s only a matter of time before the Greens overtake Labour.Labour dumped the working class because it thought it could rely on the host of tribes in the UK, some of whom consider themselves victims. Gays, transgender people, Muslims, feminists, black and ethnic minorities.But the trouble is, those supposed “victims” do not agree with each other, or wish to be portrayed as victims.Some radical feminists don’t like the transgender activists, some Muslims don’t have much time for the gays or the feminists. So the whole thing has fallen apart. And it has fallen apart because it is based on a fallacy.Some Labour MPs have already deserted the party to join the hilarious Change UK.They would have been better off joining the Lib Dems. Other decent Labour MPs — Kate Hoey, Frank Field, Caroline Flint — soldier on in the hope that Magic Grandpa will one day be gone. They’ve been hoping that for four years, but there’s no sign of it happening. The truth is, the party is lost to them.Many commentators have suggested that Brexit may see the end of the Tory Party.So it might. But more surely, it will see the end of the Labour Party. It is ideologically bankrupt. It has outlived its useful purpose.THE Brexit Party looks set to win today’s important by-election in Peterborough.People are rightly furious that the liberal establishment and the major parties have effectively thwarted the people’s will. They want to teach Labour and the Conservatives a lesson.I voted for Nigel Farage’s party in the Euro elections – but I wouldn’t dream of doing so in Peterborough.They have no policies, other than Brexit. And their candidate is making stuff up on the hoof. Champagne for everyone! This is utterly dishonest.The truth Nigel and Co are not telling voters is that the Brexit Party is deeply hostile to the working class.Farage has talked about privatising the NHS. He has no time for nationalising our energy companies, or decreasing the ide between rich and poor in our country.OK, I’m biased – as you can see from the above photo. Butyou are a Leave voter but care about social equality too, there’s only one candidate to vote for in Peterborough – Patrick O’Flynn of the SDP.CONGRATS to Peter Crouch and Abbey Clancy on the birth of their baby boy.Crouchie joked the kid would be called Divock Samrat, after the Liverpool striker Origi and his favourite curry house.Abbey’s not having it, though.So here’s a thought – what about Roderick  Nobody calls their kids Roderick any more.Actually, nobody ever did, apart from my mum and dad. And I was lucky, it was almost Sebastian.THE Conservative Party is dying on its feet. But there are still plenty of munchkins who fancy being its boss.There were a dozen candidates until Tuesday, when one bloke I’ve never heard of pulled out.Several more people nobody has heard of fancy a go. Boris Johnson is favourite, of course – but the Tories are weird people and rarely,ever, choose the front runner.If they’re sensible they’ll go for someone who is actually conservative – someone like Esther McVey. Or Priti Patelshe chucks her hat in the ring.C’mon Priti, everybody  seems to be having a go.LOUIS Farrakhan is a foul piece of work.A vile Muslim rabble rouser from the United States and deeply anti-semitic. He has described Judaism as a “gutter religion”.He has called Jewish people “bloodsuckers”. And he described Adolf Hitler as being a “great man.”So who would defend a piece of crap like this  Who would say of him: “Mr Farrakhan is not anti-Semitic and does not preach a message of racial hatred and antagonism” Step right up – Sadiq Khan, London’s mayor, and the man who has spent the last couple of years flinging insults at Donald Trump.You know where you are with the Labour Party, don’t you Always available to support Jew-haters or anyone who despises our culture and way of le.Always available to be contemptuous of our friends and allies.DID you see the face of that woman protesting about Donald Trump’s visit She is called Siobhan and screamed “Nazi!” at a bloke who was supporting the US President.It was a face contorted with hatred, full of rage and spite. Just because someone disagreed with her. Everyone who disagrees with her is a Nazi. Only she is right.Siobhan has since apologised, kind of. But it cuts no ice with me. Nor was I surprised she worked in the NHS. It’s always nurses and teachers – the public sector – who are out on these fatuous demos, week in, week out.They’re the only people who have time to go on them.THOROUGHLY enjoyed Sky and HBO’s series Chernobyl.It was a great reminder of the sheer grimness, ineptitude and brutality of the old Soviet Union.As we now know, the reactor at Chernobyl had a flawed design. But layers of bureaucracy and Communist Party bullying prevented the experts from doing anything about it.Mind you, it is worth remembering that this was by far and away the worst ever disaster at a nuclear plant, anywhere. And the number of dead Just . When it happened the anti-nuclear lobby predicted hundreds of thousands of later deaths from cancers. This does not seem to have happened at all. The second worst ever nuclear catastrophe  The one in Fukushima, Japan, in . Total number of deaths from radiation  At the very most – just one, and that is disputed.Nuclear power is by far and away the safest means of generating electricity.More people have died building or maintaining wind turbines than have died as the consequence of nuclear powerTHE slightly odd Brexit Party MEP Ann Widdecombe has said that “science might provide an answer” to being gay.I’m not entirely sure what Widders means, or what medication she was on when she said it.Anyway, she was booked to do a one-woman show in Ilfracombe, Devon. But the boss of the company staging the show has sacked her.David Hutchinson, a virtue- signalling idiot who can only tolerate opinions which concur with his own, said he was “disgusted” by Widdecombe’s comments.Well sure, maybe. And that means that people who might have a dferent point of view to yours should not be allowed to talk to the public  This story is about a bigot. And the bigot isn’t Widdecombe.The best way to counteract this sort of fascistic intolerance is to hit them where it hurts. Hutchinson runs a company called Selladoor. So, here’s a suggestion. Don’t attend any of its events.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Can Nigel Farage’s Brexit Party win this core Middle Britain seat Dficult, but it would be a heck of a result and could do to those insects in Westminster what a dose of Sarson’s does to the winged pests that erupt from house walls on hot days.EvenFarage does not pull off a cup upset in Peterborough, Westminster is starting to get jumpy. About time, too! Theresa May quits the Tory leadership tomorrow and the race to succeed her has begun with almost as many runners as the Grand National.Quite a few of them will end up in the glue factory.Prince Charles’s pro-EU pal Rory Stewart, the little-known International Development Secretary, has made a wonderful fool of himself by standing for the job. Stewart has filmed selfie videos presenting himself as man-of-the-masses, in places such as, er, genteel Kew Gardens.Deluded commentators in the Westminster village have praised his social-media “outreach”. It’s the political elite’s echo chamber at work again.On Tuesday evening Stewart stood on a box at Speaker’s Corner in London’s Hyde Park, to “speak to the people”. What a gumby. The only bystanders at Speaker’s Corner these days are tourists, ice-cream vendors and a few winos.If Stewart really wants to meet the people to see what they think of his plan to soften Brexit to the point of non-existence, he should haul himself off to somewhere like Asda in Walsall, in the West Midlands.Brummies would soon let him know exactly what they thought of his proposal to ignore the  referendum’s .million Leave voters.Meanwhile, the Health Secretary, Matt Hancock , polished his credentials to be Tory leader by releasing a video of himself playing office cricket with a few of his civil servants. I had to watch this stunt twice just to make sure it wasn’t a spoof from Armando Iannucci, one of the sharp comic brains behind Alan Partridge.Not that Hancock is the silliest of the bunch. Sam Gyimah, an obscure former junior minister, was last night persisting with his leadership campaign even though he did not have the declared support of a single MP .This was almost pathetic in the proper sense of the word — ie enough to make you feel sad for the bloke. But in the end I’m afraid my heart remained unmoved. Gyimah simply looked a prat.Labour’s comrades are at each other’s throats, the Lib Dems have their own leadership contestand the Change UK brigade, just a few weeks after their creation, are disintegrating like one of strongman Geoff Capes’s deckchairs. More than half of them quit, leaving a rump that will be led by spluttering Anna Soubry, as shouty as a Jack Russell snapping at a postie’s ankles.All this was happening while Hurricane Trump blew into town and gave half-pint London Mayor Sadiq Khan a few home truths. The President also showed Jeremy Corbyn to be two-faced, revealing that Corbyn — who happily joined a rally where Trump was slandered as a fascist — had begged him for a one-to-one meeting. The crawler.Looking at this turmoil, you might think: “That’s it, I’m emigrating to strong, stable Venezuela.” Don’t book your ticket to Caracas just yet.Call me a crazy optimist, but I think the mayhem in our politics is healthy — a sign that it’s finally sinking into Westminster’s blockheads that they need to start reflecting and stop blocking public opinion.Theresa May first. The PM’s departure was so often predicted that it is hard to believe she and husband Philip are finally emptying their smalls drawers at No.But after her tearful announcement two weeks ago in Downing Street, there is no way back for Madam Glumbucket. A nation mourns  Don’t let’s put it that strongly but nor should we gloat.Allow her a decent adieu. She occupied high office with dignity and seriousness and was not tacky, like some recent PMs. There was no Carole Caplin or Lord Levy in her coterie, thank goodness.If that was an example of politicians learning from their predecessors’ mistakes, might the same be happening with the EU crisis  Tory and Labour MPs have been terried by the rise of Farage’s Brexit Party.Peterborough was a swing seat won by Labour in  by now-disgraced Fiona Onasanya, jailed after trying to cheat a motoring offence.Whatever the result, the Peterborough campaign showed that neither of the two main parties can take Middle Britain for granted.That has made northern Labour MPs wary of seeking a second referendum. And it has caused a big change in the Tory leadership election campaign.Front-runner Boris Johnson and his main rivals Michael Gove, Jeremy Hunt, Dominic Raab and Sajid Javid are all being much more ballsy about a No Deal Brexit.The three Remain candidates — Hancock, Stewart and Gyimah — are trailing badly. It is hard to say who will win but , as likely, it is Boris, Gove or Raab, the next PM should be much more in tune with public opinion.Meanwhile, the determinedly anti-Brexit Tory MP Phillip Lee looks doomed after a row with his activists in Bracknell. The people are revolting!With an opinion poll having now suggested that the Brexit Party may have a national lead, MPs on both sides of the Commons are finally clocking the possibility that they could lose their seats.Ouch.

They are all fully clothed as they give the horses their bath.He said that it was a lot quieter than expected for the first day and that it was mainly gypsies and travellers rather than visitors from the area.He added: Everyone is in a really good mood. The travellers are more than happy to talk to you about their horses, they are so proud of them and want to show them off.The traffic doesnt seem that bad at the moment either, in previous years the area has been absolute gridlock. Some of the main roads are single-carriageway, which become inundated with horse-drawn carts and cars struggle to get past.Sticking to their roots and giving a nod to their heritage, some sit by open fires heating copper kettles.One red road sign warns motorists of injury from horses.Last years festival saw  arrests,  crimes and  incidents logged by police.The earliest record of the fair is in a charter from Henry II, dating from the th century, but it is believed to have an even longer tradition than that.The Gypsy and Traveller attendees include British Romanichal, Irish Travellers, Scottish Gypsy and Welsh Gypsies known as Kale.There are usually around , and several hundred horses at the event, with the four-legged creatures being ridden up and down the

losing the support of her MPs.In a tearful speech outside Downing Street she said: I have done my best.I will shortly leave the job that it has been the honour of my le to hold – the second female Prime Minister but certainly not the last.I do so with no ill-will, but with enormous and enduring gratitude to have had the opportunity to serve the country I love.She leaves a dficult task for

PM wants to announce several spending commitments in her final weeks as PM, but the Treasury fears the cost will be too high.Mrs May wants to plug more money into schools and colleges which could add

They are fascinated.”Soon we arrive at the looming Reactor No. At .am on April , , it exploded, spewing  times more radiation than the atomic bomb the US dropped on Hiroshima in World War Two.Plant workers and firefighters, who were sent to contain the meltdown, would later die agonisingly slow deaths as their skin turned black and peeled away.More than , people were evacuated from a contaminated area covering , square miles in what was then the Soviet Union.Farms in the region reported animals born with grotesque deformities. There were foals with eight legs, headless calves and piglets with eyes as large as potatoes.The blame for the world’s worst nuclear disaster and its cack-handed aftermath fell on Soviet incompetence and its cult of secrecy.One local told me: “It was like giving a gorilla a hand grenade.”The official short-term death toll was just . Estimates of those who perished afterwards y between , and ,.Now encased with a ft, ,-ton protective cover, No has a monument of cupped hands in its shadow as a memorial.For many among the tourist throng it is a place for a solemn moment of quiet reflection. However, others see it as the ideal spot for a selfie.One German holidaymaker even dons a gas mask for his picture — despite Geiger counters showing radiation levels at the spot are safe.Brit tourist Daniel Birtles, , arrives with a more sedate tour group. The dad of two, from Northwich, Cheshire, enjoys historic and adventure holidays, travelling to Auschwitz last year.An aircraft engineer, he said: “I’m here to learn why it happened. It really hits you when you see stuff that was abandoned when people fled.”When Daniel told friends he was going to Chernobyl they joked he would “come home glowing”.Retired couple John and Shauna Keil, from Canada, are also here on holiday. A former air traffic services worker, John, , said: “People gave up their lives to cap No. We’re here in a respectful way to learn about the history first hand.”In the nearby city of Pripyat, the eerie streets where , once lived and laughed now lie silent like something from a movie set.Tourists clamber through the dusty, disintegrating buildings with cameras and selfie sticks.A classroom is still strewn with exercise books, a piano stands ready for recital, two flippers lie in a drained school swimming pool.It is a ghastly taste of what the aftermath of a nuclear war would look like.A favourite spot for day trippers is an abandoned theme park, which was supposed to open a week after the disaster. Its giant Ferris wheel is silhouetted against grey clouds and bumper cars rust and crumble.Though radiation levels have been passed safe for short periods inside the Exclusion Zone, hot spots still exist.As long as you stick with your guide, a Chernobyl visit will see you subjected to radiation levels no higher than an intercontinental flight or dental X-rays.A small supermarket in Chernobyl stocks baseball hats and T-shirts branded with the ghost city’s name in the local Cyrillic language. Staff say they are lucky to sell one a day.Mum-of-one Ira Ischukh, , who works in two-week blocks before moving away from the zone’s radiation levels, says: “I see nothing from tourism.”Driving on through the lush forest, guide Yuriy leads us to a log cabin in what appears to be the deserted village of Kupovate.Then, waving from her doorway, we see babushka Hanna Zavorotnya, , who has survived le in the Exclusion Zone against all medical odds since .She and other members of her collective farm had been evacuated after the blast yet, three months later, she came home.When government officials objected, she told them: “Shoot us and dig the grave. Otherwise we’re staying.”Today there are  elderly so-called “self-settlers” left alive in the Exclusion Zone.Yuriy says: “You can’t tell how radiation will affect each human. Some live with it, others die.”Hanna grows her own crops, draws her water from a well by hand and brews potato vodka in a wooden shack she shares with her sister Sonya, .She shows me the hoof prints of moose and boar that have raided her well-tended vegetable patch of onions, garlic and strawberries.Wild animals have thrived in Chernobyl as man fled, encouraging a wave of eco tourism.Hanna tells me: “We eat fish from the river and berries and mushrooms from the forest. I’m fine.“This village is my motherland. I was born here and I will die here.”Ukraine opened Chernobyl to tourists in .

It’s a sombre environment, like visiting a battlefield.”Back at Hanna’s little cottage in the woods I politely decline her offer of homegrown gherkins.Raising a toast of her vodka, she insists: “The tourists are wonderful. They bring me ice cream and help me with repairs to my house.”As the day wanes, holidaymakers pass through radiation scanners as they leave the Exclusion Zone for their hotels in Kiev — leaving Hanna to her beautul but damned woodland wilderness.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I mean ears. I, Nigel Farage, hereby declare victory in the Peterborough by-election that was called after its last MP was jailed for being a bit of a rotter. This was a glorious victory for the Brexit Party, an earthquake that has rocked the political Establishment to its core. I only wish Iaposd been standing for election myself, but unfortunately topping up the Brussels pension pot takes up too many seconds in the week. But I congratulate our candidate, Whatsisname, for so decisively proving that all the polling, experts, voters, milkshake purchasers and D-Day veterans are wrong, and that this country has clearly demanded that No Deal Brexit Iaposve been advocating. The mere possibility of this currency speculatorsapos wet dream actually manesting so terries the elites of this country that it has already contributed to the loss of , jobs in the car industry, which just goes to show that a Hard Brexit will get us all working, upskilling, innovating, and ing to a more traditional way of le in which our children must catch and skin rabbits to survive. Thataposs how we won the war, just ask the RAF. This was the first real test of the Brexit Partyaposs message, after the referendum, the general election, the constant opinion surveys, the  years of Tory infighting and all the Parliamentary rowing about exactly the same thing. And itaposs been definitively positive, in that we scored a totally unpredicted victory, coming first in a long list of runners-up. Westminster is running scared from a fledgling enterprise that has been able to do that only a few weeks after being incorporated at Companies House, raising six-figure sums from gullible members of the public at proto-fascist rallies, and massive donations from people whose foreign assets may well increase in valuethereaposs a crash in the pound. The fact the Labour Party technically got more votes is, to be honest, a shocking loss for Jeremy Corbyn who really needs to consider his position, in my view.  As you will see from the comments below this article, the fact that a corrupt electoral system counted bits of paper to decide the winner just proves how gross the stitch-up was. It was there in the leisure centre for all to see, and I was so disgusted by it that I was forced to leave before I had to answer questions about why there werenapost more bits of paper for us. The answer is obvious, isnapost it  I donapost need to say it. Jeremy Corbyn is in the pay of mysterious millionaires funding his luxury lestyle of allotments and old jumpers. I wouldnapost be surprised to find a Russian link,only my friends at the FBI would investigate him. Iaposll ask them about it next time they speak to me. The only reason that Labour can pretend to have won this vote is that its agents have clearly paid off the BBC, ITN, the Communists at Channel , several dozen council volunteers, , or so voters and the Peterboroughwhich, I understand, is staffed by a cabal of Marxists working to destroy this great British democracy. The Illuminati then used mind magic and psychic jiggery-pokery to convince the ing officer that they needed to use maths to work out who had won, when in fact all they needed to do was ask me. Itaposs perfectly clear, from all the entirely-biased people I speak to in those brief periods when Iaposm not making love to a TV camera, that I am the rightful Prime Minister.  I have been told by a source, you wouldnapost know him, he goes to another school, that this election was stolen by pencil manufacturers using time-limited lead in their products. Government scientists changed the radioactive signature of the lead so it decayed moments after being put inside a ballot box. Those who today have called this a victory for Corbynaposs policy of constructive ambiguity, or Labour votersapos widespread hope for a second referendum with a Remain outcome, have clearly not listened to everything I have said for the past  years about how Brexit is going to destroy Labour and Iaposll clean up in all its constituencies.Itaposs only because some of the voters decided to vote for other parties that our victory was not more obvious. If there hadnapost been , people who voted for the wrong guy in a blue rosette, andthe Liberal Demcorat Remoaners had sent their % swing our way, andturnout hadnapost been so big for a by-election, we would indisputably be forming a government by now. In fact, I think Iaposll form one anyway. I understand this is how things are done in Venezuela, Zimbabwe, Armenia, Hungary, the Congo and other well-recognised bastions of the democratic world, and Britain really should be learning from its potential international trading partners and let them lead the way in the post-Brexit moonscape that only I and that other bloke in the pub can deliver.  Predictably, there are those who will do anything to block the Brexit Partyaposs inexorable and righteous path to power. And to all those who voted for someone , I say this: youaposre just Peterbitter. Weaposre six points ahead nationally, which is where voting really matters. Who cares about Cambitchshire  Votes like this are very minor, I should know because Iaposve lost votes like this  times myself and that didnapost stop me being a winner.Iaposll come up with other nicknames for you in due course, but itaposs clear to me that youaposre just stone cold loser PETERBONEHEADS. Thataposs why, today, I have attended Downing Street to deliver a letter to Theresa May, telling her in person of our fantastic win and the thumping defeat of her woeful and, frankly, transparent attempts at forcing Britain to remain in the European Union. The fact the press call was planned when we were expecting to win, and wasnapost cancelled when we didnapost, is because it didnapost happen. Anyone who tells you otherwise is just fake news. YOUR MUM IS FAKE NEWS. Our by-election glory proves that I deserve a role in the Brexit negotiations weaposve already had, the EU wonapost reopen and I couldnapost possibly add anything useful to. A democracy needs the losersapos consent to govern, which is why we should ignore the .m people who voted Remain in  and hand the reins of power to the CEO of the Brexit Party whose greatest achievement so far is to get people to vote for more European representation. What these negotiations for a deal that I donapost want really need is some jingoistic sabre-rattling from an unpainted Pennywise at the head of a non-army of gay cure lunatics, IRA sympathisers and people who have no idea what war is like because the EU stopped them having to fight one.  I trust the Prime Minister will agree with me, the REAL Prime Minister, that democracy is all about doing what a shrinking minority wanted to do once ages ago, and that it is in Britainaposs best interests to end the uncertainty of relying on the ,-year-old Parliamentary system when,we just used the First Past Nigelaposs Post-Prandial Approval voting system, we could do what my paymasters want instead. We have the biggest democratic mandate of modern imagination, and I stand ready to serve. Please do not mention the fact that I appear to be shrinking before your very eyes, or you vill be shot.

She added: I am really sorryI hurt anyone, I never had any intention to do that. I engaged with some posts in error and I never had any intention to hurt anyone I will be reaching out to the Jewish community as soon as possible to try and explain and to learn.    Prominent Labour backbencher Jess Philips today said Ms Forbes election demonstrated that that anti-Semitism is becoming normal in the party.  Ms Phillips MP for Birmingham Yardley said that while she was glad the Brexit Party had been defeated in Peterborough I cannot begleeful or proud as Iaposd want to be because of how it shows that anti-Semitism is becoming normal in the party.

But with every case, the parties values chip away and our ability to stand up against hate erodes. Today the Jewish Labour movement demanded Ms Forbes go far further in her apology.    A spokesperson added: “This has encouraged a culture to develop where not only is it acceptable for someone who has shared racist material and rejected the internationally accepted IHRA definition of anti-semitism to be a member, but they can advance politically and gain public office. “Ms Forbes will have to go far, far further than her statement at the weekend to demonstrate to our members and the Jewish community that she isn’t racist against Jews. In a damning conclusion, they demanded that Ms Forbes should have the whip suspended immediately. Last week the Equality and Human Rights Commission said they were conducting an investigation into Labour over complaints of anti-semitism in the party. Labour pulled off the shock win by just  votes after a campaign which insiders praised as being a victory for shoe leather over showboating. Hundreds of party activists flooded the seat on Thursday to deliver the narrow win over Mr Farageaposs insurgent party. Today Mr Corbyn said the party won because it offered the politics of hope, not the politics of fear. He added: Everybody, all the experts wrote Lisa off. All the experts wrote Labour off yesterday. Write Labour off at your peril. He said the result would not change Labouraposs policy on a second Brexit referendum - yet. However, Labouraposs share of the vote was slashed to %, with Mr Farageaposs new outfit on %.    Mr Corbyn also doubled down on his partyaposs Brexit fudge. He told campaigners and journalist during a victory lap of the city: As our conference resolution was agreed last September, we would then be prepared to put that to a public vote. We’re not at that stage yet when where Parliament has actually voted on that and I think it would be much betterthere was a general election The result was disastrous for the Tories, who were shunted into third on just %.

The awards for Mrs May’s loyal Home Office staff and top police chiefs were revealed just hours after she quit as Tory leader and as she prepares to skulk out of No. Head of immigration Glyn Williams becomes a Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath in the Queen’s Birthday Honours - despite his role in the Windrush scandal. Mr Williams served as the Home Office’s head of migration policy between August  to  when the hostile environment policy was developed.    Then Home Secretary Mrs May said in  her aim “was to create here in Britain a really hostile environment for illegal migration”. Mr Williams also sat alongside then Home Secretary Amber Rudd when she was grilled over removal targets by MPs. She resigned after telling the Commons Home Affairs Select Committee there were no targets for deportation of illegal immigrants - the top civil servant agreed there weren’t - as far as he knew. Later a government review found that Ms Rudd, who took over from the PM as Home Secretary, had been let down by her officials.    Mr Williams is one of  Home Office staff to receive gongs. Another controversial honour goes to police chief Sara Thornton who had to apologise for her role in one of the worst child sex slavery scandals in British history. Ms Thornton said she was “delighted and humbled” to be made a Dame. The current Independent Anti-Slavery Commissioner was chief constable of Thames Valley Police - which includes Mrs May’s Maidenhead constituency - in  to . The force failed to help up to  children who were groomed, plied with drugs and alcohol and sexually abused in Oxford.    Ms Thornton said: “It was a privilege to serve the public as a police officer for over  years, often challenging but always rewarding.” The Chair of the Wates Group developers, which has given the Tories £,, receives an OBE. James Wates was given the honour “for services to business and charity”, while Archibald Boyd Tunnock, who invented the Tunnock’s Teacake and was “deeply honoured” to receive a knighthood, has given the Tories £,. Catherine Page, who was a private secretary to Mrs May, is handed an OBE for public service. Thomas Spiller, who is President of the National Conservative Conservation, receives an OBE for public and political service. Long-time Tory activist, hedge fund manager and chairman of Cities of London and Westminster Conservative Association Patrick Evershed gets a CBE. Councillor David Williams, who served on Merton council in South London with Mrs May, receives an MBE. Former Tory Councillor Derek Wilson, who served on Maidenhead Council - in the Prime Minister’s constituency - gets the same accolade . Katy Bourne, who is Tory Police and Crime Commissioner for Sussex, receives an OBE.   Outgoing Tory MEP for the North West Jacqueline Foster receives a Damehood, while Labour MEP for Wales Derek Vaughan, who is also stepping down, is made a CBE - both for public and political service. Tim Warren, the ousted Tory leader of Jacob Rees-Mogg ’s local council, Bath and North East Somerset, is made a CBE for services to local government.Elsewhere the head of the Confederation of British Industry Carolyn Fairbairn, who had been a strong campaigner for the UK to Remain in the EU and has since warned of the dangers of no-deal for business, becomes a Dame. The Director-General of MI Andrew Parker becomes a Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath. Liberal Democrat MP Norman Lamb, who has campaigned for better mental health treatment, receives a knighthood, as do current Labour MP George Howarth and former Labour MP Brian Donohoe. Former Network Rail programme director Simon Blanchflower is made a CBE despite last year’s controversy surrounding the same honour being awarded to the outgoing head of the organisation, Mark Carne, in the midst of rail disruption. A Government spokesman said: “Volunteering and working for a political party is part of our civic democracy and contributes to public le. The system recognises long-standing contributions, just as we do for other types of public service. “Honours are routinely awarded to employees across the public sector, in post and on leaving. “Political awards are a very small number compared to the overall number of honours granted each year through the regular New Year and Queen’s Birthday honours lists. “This latest list recognises over , people for their service from all walks of le and all backgrounds.” Of those, several were for campaigning for the rights of minorities. Operation Black Vote’s Simon Woolley receives a knighthood for services to race equality. Campaigners Nimco Ali and Dr Leyla Hussein both receive OBEs for services to tackling female genital mutilation and gender inequality. Conservative Party treasurer Stuart Marks is awarded a CBE. As well as raising cash from wealthy iniduals and businesses, he has also given £, to the Tories himself since , some of which was donated by his start-up investment company. Mr Marks said: “I rattle the tin, as they say, and raise funds.”Hitting out at the awards for Home Office staff, former Lib Dem leader Tim Farron said: “ Theresa May is ending her term as Prime Minister with one final insult to all those who’ve been the victims of her hostile environment, especially members of the Windrush generation.“Mr Williams presided over a litany of mistakes and scandals at the Home Office that saw far too many innocent people detained, deported and denied their rights. “His is hardly a record worthy of a knighthood. “May should be ending the hostile environment, not honouring the man who helped her create it.” Labour MP Stephen Doughty, who sits on the Commons Home Affairs Committee which probed the Windrush fiasco, said: “It will be galling to victims of the Windrush scandal and other mess-ups in the Home Office over the past decade to see officials who oversaw these scandals rewarded so handsomely. “This just shows again that for too many, honours are assumed as a given rather than being genuine rewards for people who have done great service to our country and communities.” Among other Tory donors honoured are Joseph Musgrave who has given £, in cash and receives an OBE. Clive Leslie Wood is managing director of Tees Components, which has donated £, to the party and its candidates. He is made an OBE. Shadow Cabinet Secretary Jon Trickett said: “It’s fitting that the last act of a Prime Minister who only ever looked after herself and her wealthy backers and allies, is to dish out honours to Tory cronies and donors. “It’s a stitch-up, and the public know it. “Theresa May might be on the way out, but the Conservatives will always be a party paid for by the rich and powerful that look after the rich and powerful.” "},{"url":null,"title":"10 worst 10 best seaside","story":"News worst and  best UK seaside resorts - how does your favourite fare One town scored  out of  and received just one star out of five for value for money, its seafront, scenery and attractionsShareCommentsByRuki SayidConsumer Editor:,  JUN NewsBognor Regis was branded tacky by some visitors \"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailBognor Regis may be the sunniest spot in Britain – but is has been named the worst seaside resort.

Visitors described Bognor as “tacky” and awarded it two stars for food but gave four stars for accommodation, with the average cost of rooms £.

Whitley Bay in Tyne-and-Wear had the cheapest rooms at £ a night while Salcombe, South Devon was the dearest with an average price of £.

Swansea Crown Court today heard the -year-old had an obsession with collecting chemicals used for dangerous explosives - but had no connection with terror groups and had no plans to manufacture them. Prosecutor Catherine Richards said Wales extremism and counter-terrorism officers raided Gilesaposs home in Port Talbot, South Wales, in October , and when askedhe had any items of concern, he replied nothing to harm anyone, Wales Online reports.    In his cluttered home, police found containers of chemicals including hydrogen peroxide and Acetone, which could be used to create explosives, and four publications containing instructions and recipes to manufacture them. The publications included the Anarchist Cookbook, the US Army Special Forces guide to unconventional warfare devices, the US Army guide to booby traps and a guide titled Flash Powder - Wikipedia. Police also found a Taser disguised as a torch, incapacitating sprays and evidence of the production and possession of class A drug crystal methamphetamine. He later pleaded guilty to  counts of possessing an explosive substance, three counts of possessing prohibited weapons and the possession and manufacture of class A drugs.    Kevin Seal, defending, said Giles had no plans to actually create any explosives, while the drugs were for personal consumption and not to sell to others. Judge Paul Thomas called the case unusual and accepted Giles was more of a nerd than a threat and did not intend to create explosive devices. But he said possessing the illegal chemicals posed a risk.    Judge Thomas said: You are not connected with any terrorist organisations or groups or movements, or had these for anything other than self-obsession with these materials. You are obsessive rather than maliciously motivated. Giles, from Aberavon, Port Talbot , was sentenced to six years in jail.

The -year-old Scot was the mastermind behind the teacake after being tasked by his father to come up with something new. His Thomas Tunnock Limited firm, which is based in Uddingston, Lanarkshire, produces the snowballs, caramel wafers, caramel logs and Tunnock’s teacakes, famous in the UK and worldwide. After extensive market research, he came up with the idea of using a biscuit base and hand piped Italian meringue on to it before covering in milk chocolate.

Saudi Arabia is the largest overseas buyer but the teacakes produced by the baker sell from Thurso to Trinidad.    At the opening ceremony for the  Commonwealth Games in Glasgow, the teacakes took centre stage as dancers dressed in the distinctive wrapper design moved around the main performers near the start of the show. Sales of the biscuit went through the roof the day after the ceremony.

Compass Pools describe the structure as the only building in the world to incorporate a -degree infinity pool.    The pool will be made from cast acrylic and will feature transparent sides and floors, so visitors below will be able to see swimmers splashing around above them. There are no permanent stairs for the pool - instead a spiral staircase that rotates and rises through the water to provide access. The designers envisage that the pool will sparkle like jewel-topped torch at night, with the building fitted with a collection of lights. Compass Poolaposs swimming pool designer and technical director Alex Kemsley said: We faced some quite major technical challenges to this building, the biggest one being how to actually get into the pool. The solution is based on the door of a submarine, coupled with a rotating spiral staircase which rises from the pool floor when someone wants to get in or out - the absolute cutting edge of swimming pool and building design and a little bit James Bond to boot.    He added: “Architects often come to us to design roof top infinity pools, but rarely do we get a say in the building design because the pool is usually an afterthought. “But on this project, we actually started with the pool design and essentially said, ‘how do we put a building underneath this ’ “When we designed the pool, we wanted an uninterrupted view, both above and below the water. The pool will be fitted with a built-in anemometer to monitor wind speed, and will be linked to a computer-controlled building management system that will regulate the poolaposs temperature and ensure water doesnapost spill onto the streets below. The water will be heated using waste energy from the buildingaposs air conditioning system.

The -month-old toddler suffered serious injuries in the attack, which left her with fractures to her skull, bruises and a bite mark on her arm. Thomas Dunn, , carried out the sickening abuse at his flat in Arbroath, Scotland, on January  last year. He took her to hospital when he found she was unresponsive. Following a five-day trial at Dundee Sherf Court, a jury found Dunn guilty of endangering the childaposs le by repeatedly striking her on the head and body and striking her against an unknown object or objects.  He was also found guilty of culpable and reckless conduct over an earlier incident that saw him place the girl in a tumble dryer at his home, in the presence of the childaposs mother. Giving evidence during the trial, she said she heard a thud and turned around to see her in the machine with the door closed. Referring to the later assault, Sherf Alastair Brown told Dunn he must have hit that little girl extremely hard at least twice in order to inflict what were potentially le-threatening injuries.  He said it was only by her good fortune and perhaps yours that Dunn was not tried at the High Court of Justiciary on a charge of murder. The Sherf said he did not feel his sentencing powers were adequate to punish the monstrous assault and the tumble dryer charge, and the case would be referred to the High Court.

The chilly weather s after the brief burst of sunshine in the past few days despite the UK is entering the initial stages of the summer. The Met Office warns Saturday will see a band of rain affecting some central and northern parts that will edge eastwards and eventually turn more showery. Some heavy downpours are possible in eastern England. But southern parts of England and Wales and perhaps Northern Ireland will become brighter in the afternoon with just a few light showers. It will be windy across much of England and Wales and feel cool thanks to Storm Miguelaposs aftermath.

Some heavy downpours are possible in eastern England. Turning brighter from the south. Windy across much of England and Wales and feeling cool. Tonight Most of the rain or showers will gradually die out to leave clear skies. But remaining cloudier for Northern Ireland and Scotland with some showers lingering. Sunday Sunny spells and a few showers, especially northern and central Scotland. Less windy than Saturday and so feeling warmer for most. Monday to Wednesday Remaining unsettled with sunshine and heavy showers on Monday. Then turning windy, with the best of the drier weather in the north, and some heavy rain in the south.

Among the acts are Dundee bands Thves and The Ruvellas, tributes to Oasis and Ocean Colour Scene and local DJs such as Hannah Laing and Mike McDonald.Greg also hopes to stage auctions, raffles and other fun activities to raise money with which he can help locals in need.“I set up Besty’s in Tracey’s memory so we can help people in and around Dundee,” Greg said.“I put on a wee event at the Nine Maidens last year and people were askingI was doing it again next year – so now we’re going to do it every year.”The spirit of Besty’s has been alive and well for some time, with cash already donated to some local youngsters in need.But now Besty’s has been officially recognised as a charity in Scotland, Greg has the means to widen the group’s scope.“It’s been registered since January but Bestyfest will be the point at which it really takes off,” he said.“It’s pretty much like a big launch event for the charity – and then we’ll be asking people to consider donating a bit of money, £ or £, each month.“My mum did a lot of charity work – that, combined with all the fundraising that people did to help Tracey, made me want to start a charity in her name.“I want to give back – and there’s no better way to do that than by helping others.”Focusing on the formation and promotion of Besty’s has been a welcome distraction for Greg since losing Tracey in September.Teammates in Fintry Athletic agreed to fly the Besty’s flag on their strip in January – and have since notched up some good results in the North of Tay Cup.Greg has taken time away from his work as a gas engineer to readjust to le – at Tracey’s request – spending the last few months travelling and sorting out the admin needed to make Besty’s a reality.He added: “I went back to work for three or four weeks and my head was just bursting.“Tracey told me to take a year out and that’s what I’m planning on doing.“I’m a bit up and down at the moment. I miss her every day but I’m getting there. She was one of a kind.”“All my mates have been really supportive, I’ve got a great network around me.“Her legacy will live on through the charity, her and my mum’s, and I just want to see it go from strength to strength.”Tickets for Bestyfest are on sale now for £ per person, available from clothing shop Manesto on Commercial Street and the Stobswell Bar."},{"url":null,"title":"times-past-the-old-firm-menzies-and-easterhouse-gangs-feature-in-our-look-back","story":"Another selection of photographs from the Herald and Times archive, today spanning the  years between  and ."},{"url":null,"title":"memories-pictures-from-across-glasgow-throughout-the-years","story":"Images from the archives of the Herald and Evening Times."},{"url":null,"title":"times-past-old-photographs-of-glasgow-through-the-years","story":"Images from the archives of the Herald and Evening Times."},{"url":null,"title":"times-past-do-you-recognise-any-of-these-old-photographs-of-glasgow","story":"Images from the archives of the Herald and Evening Times."},{"url":null,"title":"times-past-do-you-recognise-any-of-these-old-photographs-of-glasgow","story":"Images from the archives of the Herald and Evening Times."},{"url":null,"title":"star-of-glasgows-glow-anton-danyluk-to-enter-love-island","story":"A GLASGOW reality star is set to enter the Love Island villa next week."},{"url":null,"title":"times-past-how-many-of-these-old-photos-of-glasgow-do-you-remember","story":"Images from the archives of the Herald and Evening Times."},{"url":null,"title":"celtic-football-club-announces-major-redevelopment-plans-in-glasgows-east-end","story":"CELTIC Football Club has announced major redevelopment plans of its training centre in the East End of Glasgow."},{"url":null,"title":"trnsmt-launches-queen-tuts-stage-in-response-to-claims-lineup-was-too-male-focused","story":"TRNSMT Festival has responded to criticism that its line-up was too male-focused by announcing measures to reduce the ldquogender play gap."},{"url":null,"title":"council-rejects-plan-for-asylum-seeker-home-in-glasgow","story":"CONTROVERSIAL plans for a former Castlemilk care home to be converted into temporary asylum seeker accommodation have been refused."},{"url":null,"title":"emergency-services-rush-to-glasgow-bridge-as-part-of-ongoing-incident","story":"Emergency services have rushed to the River Clyde following reports of a body in the water."},{"url":null,"title":"anne-franks-step-sister-eva-schloss-gives-insight-into-powerful-new-display-in-glasgow","story":"VISITORS to a powerful new exhibition will have the chance to see a le size replica of the bedroom in the secret annexe where Anne Frank hid in Nazi-occupied Amsterdam."},{"url":null,"title":"search-of-river-clyde-to-resume-after-reports-of-man-in-water","story":"A search of the River Clyde is to resume after reports of a man falling into the water."},{"url":null,"title":"roofer-called-jessey-james-accused-of-being-a-cowboy-trader-by-council","story":"THE council has accused a roofer called Jessey James of being a cowboy trader and \"conning\" an -year-woman from Glasgows West End,even though their case flopped when it got to court."},{"url":null,"title":"muriel-gray-temporarily-steps-down-as-glasgow-school-of-art-chief","story":"Glasgow School of Art chairwoman Muriel Gray has temporarily stepped down from her role almost a year after fire engulfed the Mackintosh building."},{"url":null,"title":"bug-burgers-on-the-menu-this-weekend-at-science-event","story":"INSECT burgers will be on the menuthis weekend as a university takes its pioneering research to the north of the city."},{"url":null,"title":"may-day-bank-holiday-to-move-to-a-friday-to-mark-75th-anniversary-of-ve-day","story":"The early May Day bank holiday will be moved back four days next year to coincide with the th anniversary of VE Day."},{"url":null,"title":"lanarkshire-cop-to-keep-order-at-the-fifa-womens-world-cup","story":"A Lanarkshire police officer is swapping one black unorm for another for the next few weeks as she prepares to keep order at the FIFA Womenrsquos World Cup."},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/06/2.43378865-240x180.jpg srcset=https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/06/2.43378865-496x372.jpg 620w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/06/2.43378865-752x564.jpg 940w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/06/2.43378865-240x180.jpg 300w ","title":"steves right man for me says mckenna","story":"Aberdeen defender Scott McKenna was gutted when Alex McLeish was axed as Scotland boss but reckons the SFA got the appointment of his successor spot on.McLeish was sacked as national boss in April after just  games in charge.

What a lovely morning.To all who sent cards for my th, including the community council, the Wednesday Club, the Inveraray Highland Games , my warmest thanks.

Thank you Inveraray and District Accordion and Fiddle Club and Margaret Mather our secretary for this request.So I won#t forget my th in a hurry, but such kindness and friendliness cannot be forgotten ever.My thanks to you all,Niall Iain MacLean, InveraraySir,I read with great interest the letter in the March  edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser from C Rees, Lochgilphead.In addition to all that was mentioned I wonderyour readers are acquainted with the McCrone Report which was written in the s As I’m sure your readers are aware this was when oil had just started flowing from the North Sea. Mr Gavin McCrone was, at that time, a civil servant instructed to write a report on the possible effects of North Sea Oil on the argument for Scotland’s devolution.This quote comes from a letter written, by Mr McCrone, in April : #The Paper was written over a year ago in the weeks immediately before the February  election. This will be particularly apparent on page  where, of course, the ministerial pronouncements referred to relate to the Conservative Government.#So he was instructed to write this report by a Conservative Government but was reporting to a Labour Government.This quote comes from the end of the letter: #When my paper was written it was classied “secret” and given only a most restricted circulation in the Scottish Office because of the extreme sensitivity of the subject.#The report discussed the possibility of Scottish Independence and came to the conclusion: #What is quite clear is that the balance of payments gain from North Sea oil would easily swamp the existing deficit whatever its size and transform Scotland into a country with a substantial and chronic surplus.#Now, this is a very tiny segment from a document that could have changed our history but that’s in the past and we must now look to the future.What is upsetting is thatthis wealth had been invested in an oil fund or more fairly distributed by the  British Government # either Conservative or Labour # there might not, now, be an upsurge in support for separation from Westminster.Wilma Watts, TarbertSir,With Theresa May’s Brexit deal yet again failing to get through the House of Commons and a delay to the date the UK is due to leave the EU, it is clear that we are simply lurching from crisis to crisis.One wonders what good an extension will actually do given the negotiating position of both the EU and the UK. The UK is deadlocked, in terms of its people, Parliament and Cabinet and the likelihood of any semblance of a deal that command the majority of the House of Commons is unlikely. This is especially true given the deep isions within the Tories, both Remainers and Leavers, as well as opposition from the DUP.Given this situation those like myself have long argued that a UK-wide referendum on the deal, a so-called ‘People’s Vote’, with the option to remain in the EU, is the only credible way to break this deadlock. For those who argue that this would damage our democratic process, I am not sure we can slump any lower than the situation we are currently in.As David Davis, the former Brexit Secretary and an ardent Leaver, pointed out before the EU referendum: #If a democracy cannot change its mind, it ceases to be a democracy.#There are few I know who voted for Brexit in the belief it would make them poorer, and it is up to the public to give its view on whether the deal, and more importantly its implications, are what it wants.For once I agree with Jacob Rees-Mogg who previously supported a vote on the renegotiated settlement. A statement he now curiously seems to have forgotten.The Scottish Parliament has led the way in backing a People’s Vote and now that we know the precise nature of the deal, it is up to the public to have its say.Alex Orr, Edinburgh"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column week 13","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsWe could be wrong, but the confusion over Minard war memorial seems to be nothing a sit-down over a cup of tea couldn#t fix.It#s a pity the community missed out on the centenary fund, but there are general UK funds available for war memorials.

An implementation plan was produced in December  to cover the years -. Who in Argyll and Bute is responsible for this plan  How many of the outcomes have been achieved As someone who has been involved with autism personally and professionally for many years, I find it extremely disappointing there seems to be an inability by those in authority to get organised enough to address the issues and provide services for autistic people and their families.There is no need for further drafts and consultations.Someone in the authority needs to take responsibility for the existing strategy and implementation plan and get on with it.Maureen Mackintosh, Ardrishaig.Sir,Scotland’s small building firms had a strong start to , in contrast to the UK construction small and medium sized enterprisesector, according to the Federation of Master BuildersScotland.The FMB State of Trade Survey for the first quarter of , the only quarterly assessment of the UK-wide SME construction sector, showed SME workloads declined for the first time in six years.In Scotland, however, there was a jump of  per cent compared with the previous quarter. Thirty per cent of weighted responses were positive, up from  per cent from the fourth quarter of .It is encouraging the Scottish construction industry is bucking the wider Brexit trend with workloads and enquires in rude health. The UK-wide picture is very dferent, with the construction SME sector overall contracting for the first time in six years.Scotland’s good fortune could be due to fewer EU workers being based north of the border compared with other parts of the country, like in London where one in three construction workers are from the EU.Relying less heavily on migrant workers has meant the Scottish construction industry hasn’t fallen foul of thousands of EU workers ing home during the long march to Brexit due to no longer feeling welcome in the UK or sure of their future here.Scotland’s builders, however, must not be complacent. Looking ahead, the First Minister has indicated thatthe UK does leave the EU later this year, she wants a second independence referendum before the next Scottish Parliament election in . This additional political uncertainty, on top of the continued uncertainty stemming from Brexit, could impact on the construction sector in Scotland.The fear is a looming second referendum could test consumer confidence this year and next. For construction SMEs, this is particularly concerning as their prospects are vulnerable to dips in consumer confidence as so much work comes from the private domestic sector.Gordon Nelson, Director of FMB Scotland.Sir,I was joined by my fellow Conservative councillors in Kilmory recently as we discussed atthe numerous challenges facing Argyll and Bute.Ferry sailings, roads, education and the SNP#s late single farm payments were all mentioned.With the SNP hammering local authority spending and cutting our budgets, challenges in delivering services will become more prevalent.Despite this climate of cuts from the separatists, Conservative councillors are delivering for Argyll.

The weather was a challenge in itself due to the bitter cold, but the young people rose to the challenge and coped admirably.The climax of the weekend was the presentation of six Gold Chief Scout Awards to group members who have been working hard for four years to gain the highest achievement possible for a Scout. All six Scouts who gained the award have now started their careers in the Explorer section of the group.In late March members of the Scout and Explorer section joined with the Heart of Argyll Wildle Organisation to undertake an Earth Hour Camp. During the camp the group discussed how the unit could reduce its impact on the environment and how these changes could be implemented. Plans are now afoot for a further event in May to create an installation that looks at the impact of plastic on the countryside.Most recently three of the leaders, David Smart, Anne Smart and John McCartan took the chance to abseil  feet off the Falkirk Wheel. This event had been organised by Scout Scotland and gave a chance to meet up with other participants from all over Scotland.Looking to the future the group has exciting plans for the summer.

That revenue would have contributed towards the management and improvement of assets and development of services within the Ardrishaig area for years ahead and for the benefit of current and future generations.Edward Laughton, director, Ardrishaig Community TrustSir,We often hear Argyll and Bute Council being slated.But this time they deserve all the praise they can get for cleaning and re-pointing Lochgilphead War Memorial. All it took was a request and the work was done in time for the Lochgilphead Armed Forces Day on June .Geordie Rhodick, chairman, LAFDSirFor the past two years, since he was elected to Argyll and Bute Council by the skin of his teeth, Councillor Alastair Redman has bombarded local newspapers with a constant stream of drivel attacking the Scottish Government.In his latest diatribe, he alleges that #the SNP has completely misjudged the mood of voters up and down the country#.I know it will be extremely painful for him, buthe can bring himself to review last week’s European Election results in Scotland, he’ll see the complete fallacy of this statement, andhe wants to look even closer to home, he’ll see that the SNP polled , votes in Argyll and Bute – , votes ahead of the Tories who came a distant fourth.Hardly a sign of his mythical assertion that Ruth Davidson is poised to be the next First Minister of Scotland.Robert Macintyre, Serpentine Road, RothesayDear PaulI write on behalf of constituents in Tarbert regarding the application for the Inveraray to Crossaig kV overhead line, which is with the [Scottish Government] Energy Consents Unit.A very large number of constituents have contacted me regarding this matter and almost  have signed a petition.They believe the proposal will have a major deleterious effect on the village and will be a huge and ugly blot on the landscape which, given the very attractive and scenic nature of the area, will be a big disincentive to tourism and will spoil the enjoyment of the area for residents as well.I have met with SSE to discuss this issue and have made it clear to them that the community wishes the company to come forward with alternative proposals, which must include undergrounding the cableno route can be found which does not spoil the visual amenity of the village.I know that the new line is needed for entirely understandable and positive reasons, and I have had only a few complaints from other parts of the area which will be affected.The opposition in Tarbert is virtually unanimous and there is also concern being expressed from those who know and value the area but do not live there.I hope that any consideration of consent will ensure that this issue is dealt with in accordance with the views of local people and I would be grateful to hear from you what the timescale is for that decision .Michael RussellSir,Newly-elected UK MEPs will take their seats in the European Parliament in July and it is crucial they recognise their signicant role in shaping the policies that impact on farming businesses. This new parliament will be pivotal in determining the nature of our future regulatory environment and we are keen and ready to meet with them.Our industry faces a number of challenges over the coming years, not just in relation to Brexit but on issues such as climate change, environmental policy, plant protection and animal health and welfare. There will also be opportunities for farming and we must ensure that we make the most of these opportunities to build a forward-looking, progressive and resilient sector that benefits farmers and consumers throughout the UK.We would like to invite all UK MEPs on to farms in their local areas to discuss a range of priority issues and to answer any questions that they might have.

Design fleets comprising the Sigma s, Sonatas, Etchells and Hunter s joined the racing at Tarbert.Amid a flurry of rib activity laying and moving marks, it was not long before the CYCA  passage race fleet approached the finish line.The teams later caught up in the bar for the day one prize giving as new event chairman Glenn Porter welcomed everyone to Tarbert. With a number of races omitted due to protests, it was a nice easy start for Glenn.The Hunter s and Sonatas saw a spread of results after some close racing. The CYCA class  fleet on the Largs passage race was won on corrected time by Celtic Spirit. Additional prizes were awarded to Encore for the passage race line honours and Shona of Ashton for toughing it out at the rear of the passage race.Saturday was a much more challenging day on the water with a light wind and dreich drizzle. The race committee nonetheless got two races in for a number of the fleets.Protests concluded, Saturday’s prize giving announced the remaining results from Friday. This showed #s winner and RC Makars Mash class yacht Storm looking strong with a first place.Chimaera showed early signs of being a threat to the Scottish Series crown, taking a first in Friday racing. With no immediate showing of a dominant yacht in the IRC Class  fleet from Friday’s races, it was IRC class four that showed a brewing battle between Lady Ex and F’n Gr. In the CYCA Class  fleet, First by Farr surfaced with the highest number of race wins from Friday.Not to be outdone, CYCA Class  saw the final results dominated by Cool Bandit  before Saturday#s results were announced. With the weather mixing up the league table for Saturday, there were a lot of yachts taking home prizes.Saturday evening saw theof Big Vern and The Shootahs to the Scottish Series for another year and a spectacular fireworks display in celebration of Valhalla of Ashton’s th year on the water.Sunday saw yet another big weather sht with forecasts up to  knots. Loch Fyne likes to mix it up a bit so the fleets ventured out into more sedate conditions than those forecast. But as the weather built, race officers shortened the traditional round Inchmarnock passage race.Sunday prizes featured an additional prize for the best performer in each fleet. Glenn Porter started proceedings with a special award for #assisting mark layers# to the competitor who got tangled up in one of the race marks. In IRC Class  it was El Gran Senor and Forty Licks shining through. The Makars Mash RC class saw Hijacker leading the prize haul. In IRC Class it was Mata taking the #extra# prize. IRC class four saw F’n Gr take a clean sweep of firsts in both races. With only one race in CYCA  and , it was Reflection and Salamander XXII taking home the wins. In the Etchells One,  Design Hero took a win in both races with Squawk leading the way in the Sigma  One Design Class. In the Hunter  fleet Miss Moneypenny was the only yacht placed in both races taking home the best performer of the day for the s. With two firsts in the Sonata one design, Fiddlesticks made the most of the Sunday conditions.

\"Currently, UNESCO estimates that one in ten African adolescent girls do not attend school while they have their period and that their full engagement in school activities is negatively impacted.\"Many girls stay at home because of insufficient menstrual hygiene materials, inadequate water and sanitation facilities in schools, or fear of a menstrual accident.\"Days for Girls

Galashiels ndash who was a Captain and i c of A Company, st Battalion Kingrsquos Own Scottish Borderers, in the second assault wave on the morning of June .By June , , the Battalion had moved into the marshalling area Camp A. By this time all ranks of the Battalion had been briefed on maps with bogus name and map references - but everyone was fully in the lsquopicturersquo as to the plan for the invasion of the continent . The time in A was spent testing weapons and lsquoteeingrsquo up all the last details for the lsquobig dayrsquo.In the early morning of June , the Battalion embussed in TCVs and moved to the final Assembly area at Victoria Barracks, Plymouth. At am we were informed that owing to bad weather the operation had been postponed  hours.On June  we again moved to Victoria Barracks and at  hours started embarking on LSIs , although there was a fairly heavy sea running. The Battalion was on board by .. We sat at anchor until . when we set sail for the big adventure for which most of us had been waiting four years. It was an amazing sight, all around as far as the eye could see, there were ships of all shapes and sizes bobbing up and down on the water with their ensigns flying bravely in the summer breeze. As we passed the flag ship, with our Divisional Commander, Major-General Rennie and Admiral Vian on board, all ranks turned out on deck and saluted while the pipers played our Regimental march ldquoBlue Bonnets orsquoer the Border.The sea journey was one of the worst we had experienced, there was a heavy swell running and most of the Battalion felt very ill. After midnight maps were issued and from these, we saw we were scheduled to lsquotouch downrsquo at Lion-Sur-Mer about three miles west of Ouistreham.About . on June  we could see faintly the coast of Normandy on the horizon, all around us were battleships, cruisers and destroyers firing at the enemy, while overhead there was a continual stream of bombers and fighters. As we drew nearer the shore, we could see LCAs, DUKWs, etc ferrying stores from larger ships to shore.At . we were ordered to lsquostand byrsquo to disembark. Each man carried his normal equipment and personal weapon plus to extra bandoliers of ammunition, two -hour ration packs and an airborne bicycle. We had expected a wet landing but when we touched down, dead on time at ., we stepped off the LCI on to the shore. The Navy had certainly put up a terric show and now it was up to us.It took only a few minutes for the Battalion to disembark and then we moved off to our Assembly area north of Hermanville-Sur-Mer , this move was carried out without incident except for a few heavy shells from the coastal guns at Le Havre.At . the Battalion were ordered to move to St Aubin drsquoArquenay and ordered to lsquodig inrsquo. At . we witnessed what must be one of the most spectacular sights of the war - the landing of the Reserve Brigade of the th Airborne Division. It was certainly heartening for us, as up to then we had the feeling that we were all alone on the continent. Several prisoners were brought in during the night.Early on June  we prepared to attack the village of Gazelle. We moved on bicycles through Periers-Sur-le-Dan preparatory to the attack. At midday patrols reported Gazelle clear of the enemy and led by lsquoCrsquo Companythe Battalion moved through Gazelle to the woods north of Le Mesnil.We stayed until the morning of the th when we were relieved by the S Lancs while the Royal Ulster Rlesattacked Cambes Wood. At . the Battalion was ordered to pass through the RUR who had reached their objectives but were pinned down by heavy machine Gun, and Mortar Fire. The Battalion attacked after passing through the RUR and were met by machine gun fire and heavy mortar fire, but all Coys successfully reached their objectives. The Battalion suffered several casualties mainly from mortar fire.From June  to  the Battalion remained in Cambes Wood, where we were continually shelled and mortared and suffered fairly heavy casualties.Enemy mortar and artillery was very active ndash Battalion HQ receiving most attention. lsquoArsquo Coy HQ unfortunately came in for a very heavy lsquostonkrsquo and lost five killed and seven wounded. The end of the month saw the Battalion back in Cambes Wood once more, when we took over the right half of the line from the nd Lincs.During the month of June the Battalion sustained the following casualties two officers and  other ranks killed, eight officers and  other ranks wounded, and four other ranks missing.The Battalion remained in Cambes Wood till July . We continued to probe the enemy defences at night by patrolling. Sgt Grant carried out a very successful  hour patrol in the area of Galmanche.

On the evening of July , Lt Robertson lsquoBrsquo Company carried out a very successful patrol and succeeded in bringing back identication of  SS Div ndash this information had been urgently required by higher command in view of the forthcoming attack.The Battalion were relieved by a Battalion of South Staffs and moved by march route to the area of Benouville in preparation for the attack on Caen. On the evening of July  the Battalion took over the nd Kings Shropshire Light Infantry in the area of Le Homme. A large formation of Allied bombers raided Caen in the early evening.On July  the Battalion again moved forward, this time to the area of Lebissey. There was some enemy mortar and artillery fire, but few casualties were suffered.On July  in conjunction with the RUR and Canadians, the Battalion attacked Caen. The Battalion was ordered to attack from the West with the RUR on our right. The Battalion moved to the Forming Up Pointon the outskirts of Caen. We were continually shelled from the Eastern side of the River Orne. It was a very unpleasant approach march to the FUP as the ground was completely open and overlooked from the high ground on the far side of the river. Led by lsquoCrsquo and lsquoDrsquo Coys the Battalion advanced into Caen and proceeded to winkle out the enemy. This proved a very slow job, the town had been heavily bombed and the roads crated or blocked by rubble, giving ideal cover from snipers and Spandau posts. By early evening all companies had reached their objectives, patrols established on the canal, and contact established with the RUR. The civilians gave everyone a terric welcome and produced wine, fruit and bouquets of flowers.On July  the Battalion continued to lsquomop uprsquo the town. There was slight enemy shelling during the day.On the morning of July , the Battalion were relieved by Canadians and moved to a rest area at Plumeto where the time was spent cleaning up, kit inspections and parades. Football games were organised and there was a generous allotment for film shows, swimming, etc. The Pipe Band played Retreat for the first time since landing, on the evening of the th. Officers and Other Rank reinforcements joined the Battalion and on the th we moved off at full strength to the area of Ranville, east of the Orne river, in preparation for operation lsquoGoodwoodrsquo, our objective in this operation was the important road centre of Troarn.On the morning of July , the Battalion moved off via Herouvillette, Touffreville to Sannerville. This was the worst approach march the Battalion had ever experienced. It was a hot summerrsquos day and having to follow the same route as an armoured Div and we were completely overlooked by the enemy. Enemy shells and mortaring was heavy and we experienced for the first time the enemyrsquos multi-barrelled mortarndash several casualties were suffered by the Battalion, including the CO, Lt. Col G.D. Renny. He was wounded in the face and arm but refused to be evacuated.On passing through the RUR at Sannerville lsquoDrsquo and lsquoBrsquo Coys pushed forward and encountered enemy machine guns. The enemy shelling continued throughout the whole advance. After lsquoBrsquo Coy had successfully put in an attack, the Battalion occupied an orchard about  yards west of Troarn where consolidation was carried out. During the night enemy shelling continued and enemy patrols encountered. On the th, the Battalion attack towards Troarn was continued, lsquoCrsquo Coy left ndash lsquoArsquo Coy right. Both Coys advanced, but were met with heavy machine gun fire, and although supported by tanks, were forced to withdraw with heavy casualties.The Battalion took up its former positions and spent a most unpleasant day of enemy mortar and shell fire.The C.O. was ordered to be evacuated by the Brigadier and Major T.G. Coverdale took over command of the Battalion. Casualties in the Battalion in this action were  officers and  other Ranks. To make things more unpleasant we had  hours solid rain. Enemy shelling and mortaring continued but our own guns had moved up and they did some very good counter battery shoots.On July , two enemy Stretcher Bearersapproached lsquoBrsquo Coy position and asked that they and ourselves should bury our dead who were lying in lsquoNo manrsquos landrsquo. A party of SBs under our Padre, Capt Wilson, went out and did this job. As in Cambes Wood some very good patrolling was done, and several prisoners were taken mostly from  Fusilier Battalion and  Panzer Grenadiers.On July , Lt. Col. J.F.M. MacDonald took over command of the Battalion. A strong enemy patrol attempted to penetrate lsquoBrsquo Coy position but were beaten off by small arms and two-inch mortar fire.

It was recommended that for approval.A report for the meeting, prepared by executive director of development and infrastructure Pippa Milne said: #Officers are of the view that the primary benefit to the council in having this site designated as a Centenary Fields site is more in the symbolic sense – that the site is officially recognised by both Fields in Trust and the Royal British Legion as space to be protected for future generations to enjoy.#[It would also be] to commemorate those servicemen and women, as well as civilians, who played their part in the First World War.#There may also be the opportunity to use Centenary Fields status to help lever in external funding for the site.#Every site receives a commemorative plaque to display on site, as well as receiving associated signage, the display of which is optional. There is no requirement for an actual name change.#This status does not prevent disposal at a future point in time, as long as disposal is of a clear advantage to, and in the best interests of, the community from a recreational perspective.#Ms Milne’s report also stated that the council would continue to manage and maintain the park, with Fields in Trust’s role purely an advisory one.There would be no minimum expectation for maintenance requirements, or pressure to make money as a result of any Centenary Fields status.Ms Milne added: #To achieve Centenary Fields status, the site must have a link to World War One and be suitable for sport, recreation and or play.#The only two sites which appear to officers to meet this criteria are Kinloch Park in Campbeltown and Hermitage Park in Helensburgh.#Given that the profile of Hermitage Park is being raised through the £ million restoration project, officers are of the view that, on balance, it would be more appropriate to put Kinloch Park forward.#This is on the basis that Kinloch Park is likely to derive greater benefit from this enhanced status and protection.#"},{"url":null,"title":"beautiful meal accompanies swi agm","story":"President Jean Ives welcomed the members to the tearoom where Frances Hill provided the sustenance.The formal business included a review of the previous year’s events in which Southend#s SWI excelled, winning several events including bowls and a quiz.After a very successful year, the winter competitions# winner was Alison Eynon, who received the trophy, with Jen Ronald second and Fiona Rowland third.The retiring committee of Jean Ives, Fiona Rowland and Trish Jones were thanked for their hard work over the previous three years.

He goes to bed with his T rex, plays with dinosaurs constantly and knows even the complicated names of lesser-known dinosaurs.However, we have tried very consciously to allow our kids to be who they are and resist the gender stereotyping that defines what a girl should be and what a boy should be.But here was my youngest daughter, at the age of five, clearly articulating the ision between girlsrsquo and boysrsquo toys.Her list was in line with the way toys are still marketed. Often there are two versions of the same thing, one for girls and one for boys.Even some story books are defined in this way, with images and colours which are used to reinforce the gender identity of the object evengender is not specically mentioned.Donrsquot get me wrong, I have no problem that my son loves dinosaurs.But I do have a problem with marketing directed at my children to force them into a narrow definition of what toys they should like based on a patriarchal version of gender.In truth, itrsquos not so much the toys themselves but the emotions and ways of being that are deliberately connected to them.Itrsquos the idea that boysrsquo stuff promotes bravery, toughness, being fierce and adventurous, while girlsrsquo stuff promotes cuteness, romance, beauty and love.It is changing and itrsquos much better than it used to be because there is so much more awareness and debate about this issue. Gender neutral marketing is more common now, mainly as a result of public pressure.But as the conversation with my daughter shows, we still have a way to go.But does it really matter  Is it just a politically correct obsession that is making a mountain from a molehill ldquoBoys will be boys, after all, and ldquogirls are all sugar and spice, and all things nice.It really matters, of course, and I think it matters just as much for my son as my daughters, perhaps even more so.That may be controversial, but I believe that as gender stereotyping is being challenged, it is often more dficult for boys to free themselves from the traditional definition of male identity than it is for a girl.I say this as a father of four girlsand one boy.Perhaps part of the reason for this is the fact that being male is still in many ways the privileged gender, and so there is an understandable focus on removing the restrictive definition of female roles which limit opportunities for women.But the struggle for gender equality has to be a two-way processit is to be ultimately successful.We must also unshackle our boys from the narrow definition of what it is to be male, a definition which still remains powerfully entrenched in our mindsets and the way society works.I personally suffered from this when at school. I was ldquosoft, sensitive, a daydreamer. I was often made to feel I was not a proper boy. There was no space for me to realise that the lsquoladdishrsquo way of being male was not the only way.Irsquom not advocating taking the dinosaurs away from my son and forcing him to play with a unicorn or Barbie doll. Even I loved dinosaurs when I was young. But it does mean allowing him, and yes encouraging him, to explore sides to his nature that society would still label as feminine: nurture, co-operation, make-up, dresses, dancing, looking after dolls and toys, and feeling vulnerable and being allowed to express it.The best way to encourage boys to express this part of who they are is through role modelling by other men, especially in the early years of childhood when a childrsquos brain is forming, and the childrsquos view of how the world works is being created.This includes how to treat others on a personal level.So nurture and care by male family members can be a crucial part of this. But one gender inequality we rarely hear about is the fact that men make up only two per cent of early years childcare workers. And this is an inequality not just for adults, but for our children.It conveys the message to young children that caring and nurture is not a manrsquos job or a male quality. So we grow up believing this is lsquonaturalrsquo.And this idea is so entrenched that there have even been examples of parents complaining that a man is working in a nursery!Looking after children is as much a manrsquos job as it is a womanrsquos. Or it should be, and seen to be. But itrsquos not just about work, or even childcare or parenthood. Itrsquos about ways of being and understanding that there are hundreds of ways to be a man or woman and we all have the right to make our own path.Thatrsquos why itrsquos important from the beginning to show that therersquos no such thing as boysrsquo toys or girlsrsquo toys: there are childrenrsquos toys.Or perhaps more accurately, to show the emotions and qualities traditionally associated with them are not gender specic.As always, children teach us. When we got home, Lewis put his T rex to bed. ldquoHersquos tired, he said, ldquoand hersquos a nice T rex.This was my lesson from my son: a T rex can be nice.He summed up the issue as only a child can."},{"url":null,"title":"looking-back-25-years-since-east-lothians-independence","story":"Twenty-five years ago this week, the Courier proclaimed the news with the headline: ldquoItrsquos independence for East Lothian.This week, East Lothian Council chief executive Angela Leitch said: ldquoThe Local GovernmentAct of  saw the abolishment of the two-tier Region and District Councils to be replaced with  unitary authorities across Scotland.\"I believe this has greatly benefited East Lothian communities, as responsibility for major services including education and social work were decentralised from Edinburgh and instead became the focus of political decisions at a more localised level.\"Over the years, our politicians have ensured ongoing investment in all of our towns and villages, providing facilities for local people, developing our infrastructure and continually working to improve the services we deliver. This has been recognised in a iety of inspection reports that have confirmed that East Lothian Council is a high performing council and has an ethos which recognises the importance of working closely with its residents and communities.\"Our elected members all live within the county, understand local issues and can ably represent the views of communities.\"Previously, some political decisions about our county were approved by people who had no real knowledge of East Lothian.\"Local government reorganisation has improved both local democracy and the ability of local people to hold the council accountable for the decisions it takes.Here, we take a look back at how we reported the news that the county had secured its place as a stand-alone local authority in the upcoming local government reorganisation:East Lothian has won the battle for independence.In a dramatic about face, Scottish Secretary Ian Lang has given in to the majority wishes of the population and decided it can stand on its own two feet.From , the district will once again become master of its own house as an all-purpose local authority.It means East Lothian councillors will be responsible for running a full range of services ndash from education and social work to rubbish collection and recreation.The Local Government Bill which will end the -year lespan of Scotlandrsquos network of region, district and island authorities is currently going through its final stages in Parliament.And earlier this week, Mr Lang ndash supported by local Labour MP John Home Robertson ndash tabled an amendment to give East Lothian the go-it-alone status it wanted.It was the high point in a hard-fought campaign by angry locals which began last year when the Government announced its original intention to lump East Lothian in with Berwickshire.But their success in fighting off that idea was not the end of the battle ndash they still had to persuade Mr Lang and his local government minister Allan Stewart that East Lothian was NOT too small to become an authority in its own right.They had also to force them to give up alternative plans to create an East Lothian-Midlothian-West Lothian authority ndash and more recently a proposal to merge East and Midlothian.As councillors and senior staff celebrated the announcement with champagne, [district] council chairman George Wanless smiled and said: ldquoWe are absolutely delighted with the outcome.He said it was dficult to say what eventually changed the minds of ministers.ldquoBut I have no doubt that the campaign the district council fought had a lot to do with it.He added: ldquoIf I was being charitable, I would say it was a case where the Scottish Office actually listened to the people for a change...It was, however, a ldquogreat decision for the people of East Lothian, who had supported the campaign from the start.ldquoI would like to thank all those who came out on the streets and took part in demonstrations in the early days of the campaign ndash and all those who wrote to Ian Lang in support of the idea that East Lothian should be an all purpose authority.Councillor Wanless totally rejected the previously-held Government view that East Lothian was too small to stand on its own.ldquoWe currently have a population of something like , and growing.ldquoBy the year  we could have at least , and my colleagues and I along with our officials are confident we can handle all the services that the new council will be responsible for.And he insisted: ldquoWe will do so in the same economic and efficient way the electorate have been accustomed to over the years.MP John Home Robertson said the White Paper to reform local government could have been the ldquodeath knell for East Lothian.ldquoBut people all over East Lothian fought back in a massive local campaign and we have won a magnicent victory.He paid tribute to Councillor Wanless and others who took part in the campaign, saying: ldquoWe have shown that public pressure can move even this Government.ldquoHowever, we are not out of the woods yet.ldquoLocal government is all about providing important services to local communities and we must continue to fight to ensure that East Lothian is properly provided with the funds it requires through revenue support grants.The councilrsquos Conservative group leader, the Rev Dr David Whiteford, said: ldquoI am very pleased that the Scottish Office ministers have listened to the electorate.ldquoThe view of the electors all along has been consistent ndash that East Lothian could and should be an all-purpose authority.ldquoI believe East Lothian has the capacity and potential to become an authority on its own and its staff are well capable of serving very well the needs of all the people.He added: ldquoI am very pleased that that message has now been accepted by the Scottish Ministers and that they have departed almost entirely from their original plan.ldquoLarge is not always beautul and I think we can do better on our own.He believed the transition to a stand-alone East Lothian council would be fairly simple.ldquoThe staff structures are already on the ground and all you really need to do is build on that.ldquoI do not anticipate a great deal of dficulty.ldquoIt is a challenge.ldquoIt is something that we should think through.ldquoWe have a new council coming into being and we should try to run it in a new style way.ldquoI hope councillors will concentrate on the needs of East Lothian people and will try and make that their main concern.Said SNP councillor George Thomson: ldquoEast

The Committee on Climate Changewhich inspired last weekrsquos landmark target, is in no doubt that mass reforestation ndash and wersquore talking billions of trees ndash will be one of the major methods of scrubbing CO from the atmosphere.Scottish Greens: How you can help fight climate changeScotland is well placed to deliver on this at least. Those barren hills and glens used to be under a dense covering of foliage. The forests were cleared for agriculture and charcoal in the south, and latterly for sheep and deer in the north. So mass forestation is only restoring the ecological default in Scotland.Nice to know, too, that Scotland, on paper at least, is leading the way on meeting climate change targets, having reduced emissions by a creditable % since . This is better than the UK as a whole, which is itself a world-leader in climate control. Scotlandrsquos abundant renewable energy is going to play a major role in transforming the UK economy.Transport is one of the main areas yet to be decarbonised, and every watt of that green energy is needed to make the switch from petrol and diesel in the next decade. Itrsquos long overdue. The internal combustion engine is th-century technology, horribly complex, unreliable and inefficient. Future generations will be astonished that we allowed our city streets to remain sewers of toxic chemicals.Mind you, the Scottish Government needs to put its foot on the environmental accelerator pedal. It is three years since I wrote a series of articles on electric cars after being allowed to drive some of them around Scotland. There were precious few charging points back then, and therersquos scarcely any more now. Yet, the electrication of transport should be a relatively simple exercise.Every petrol station should be a charging station, every supermarket car park, every school and hospital. Wherever cars congregate, in fact. The good news is that no-one who tries a modern electric car will want to drive anything , because they are faster, cheaper, safer and more reliable.Of course, manufacturing any car uses prodigious amounts of energy too, requires many costly materials and produces toxic waste. Electric cars arenrsquot a solution to climate change, but electrication of transport must be, especially micro-transportation. Every city in Europe seem to be turning to those electric scooters ndash except in the UK where they are illegal. Half of the bicycles sold in Germany now are electric. People are turning naturally to more energy-efficient transport so why not give them a push :Climate clock is ticking and now is time for politicians to fightThe CCC report was rather benign on flying. Yoursquoll be pleased to know that itrsquos not being phased out. This is probably because reducing aviation requires international agreement. However, cuts in air passenger duty seem dficult to justy. The Scottish Government wants APD cut by % to attract more business and tourists to Scotland. But Nicola Sturgeon is going to have to bite the environmental bullet here. The optics are wrong. It looks too much like a middle-class subsidy, even though many working-class people swear by Ryanair.Then therersquos the nuclear conundrum. Scotlandrsquos nuclear power stations account for % of electricity generation ndash a large proportion of our nominally clean energy. But they are old and unreliable and in need of replacement. However, nuclear power stations are regardedas a safety issue following Fukushima. They are also ruinously expensive and damage the environment by producing toxic waste which needs to be stored for thousands of years.The nuclear industry leapt upon last weekrsquos CCC report as a vindication of nuclear as part of the de-carbon equation. Big money is going into painting the atom green. But the prospect of the Scottish Government commissioning a new nuclear plant, given the explosive cost of Hinkley Point C, Englandrsquos first new nuclear power station in decades, seem remote. Renewable energy is much cheaper, joule for joule,it can be brought to grid fast enough. We are in a race against time to seeTorness and Hunterston can be made redundant before they fall apart.There are other issues too. Homes need to be insulated, gas boilers are going to have to go. Wersquore told to keep our home thermostats at  degrees, when most of us donrsquot have them. Itrsquos all expected to cost -% of GDP. But what was remarkable about last weekrsquos much-anticipated report was how doable it all appeared. By comparison with the apocalyptic forecasts of the climate Cassandras, like -year-old school striker Greta Thunberg, the CCC sounded like a walk in the environmental park. Nicola Sturgeon insists that cutting carbon will improve our health and wellbeing and the quality of le. Wersquoll all be happier, cleaner and probably working less in our new habitable planet.I hope shersquos right. There was an air of wishful thinking about last weekrsquos pronouncements. But therersquos nothing wrong with accentuating the positive. The problem with the more alarmist forecasts of Extinction Rebellion, who want net zero by , is that they induce not willingness to change, but a sense of futility and public apathy. If addressing climate change is going to involve banning travel, eating no meat, digging for vegan victory and plunging the economy into a biblical recession, as we close down whole sectors of industry, then people will not buy into it. The Yellow Vest movement was ignited by an environmental tax.Scottish Greens: How you can help fight climate changeIt may well be that the climate change targets are still too conservative. According to the UNrsquos International Panel on Climate Change, CO emissions need to be cut faster to prevent the planet warming by more than .C ndash the new tipping point. But the Scottish and UK governments have consistently outperformed their targets since they started making them seriously over a decade ago. They can do so again.Much of climate hygiene is self-evident. The public are morally signed up to it, and while abandoning their petrol and diesel cars may seem a grim prospect now, in practice it is likely to be a liberation. Most cars spend their lives sitting near a pavement losing value through depreciation. With proper public transport and urban alternatives, everyone wins.Vested interests are always a block on progress, but there is now a remarkable consensus, from the CBI to the GMB, BP to the NFU, the BMA to BMW. Addressing climate change need not take us back to a pre-industrial world of squalor, disease and hardship. The human race isnrsquot over yet."},{"url":null,"title":"what-it-feels-like-to-have-a-breast-reduction","story":"In  I put myself under a scalpel in Ross Hall hospital in Glasgow and had my breasts reduced in size.

It was so massively emotional, but I had no idea what the emotions meant. Was I sad  No. Was I happy  No. I simply felt like I had been through a sort of battle.

This body will get paid p to a manrsquos pound. It will be scrutinised as it ages, it is taxed for the blood that spills out of it it must crash through glass ceilings to work beside its male counterparts.These long lines that I cherish remind me that this body is mine: not a future husbands, or ex-boyfriendsrsquo or future-boyfriendsrsquo, or employersrsquo. It is not a gt from a God I donrsquot believe in. It is mine: it belongs to a thinking being, a woman who when walking home in the darkness of night feels hunted. I felt harassed by my own body.

Key to this is a highly competitive process that will deliver on our commitment to provide access to superfast broadband to every home and business in Scotland.ldquoWe have therefore provided the bidders with the extension they sought, giving them more time to remodel their solutions, in line with changes to the intervention area that arose from the decisions of UK Ministers on the use of Gainshare resources. Our actions will see the procurement timeline extended, with the appointment of a preferred bidder or bidders anticipated by the end of September and contracts signed by the end of the year.ldquoDespite broadband being a reserved matter, the Scottish Government has contributed .% of the poundm and continues to works towards its target of providing access to superfast broadband to % of premises in Scotland."},{"url":null,"title":"the-spice-girls-return-to-the-stage-in-the-post-metoo-era","story":"The Spice Girlrsquos brand of female empowerment ndash or ldquogirl power, as it would become known across the world ndash earned the group status as pop culture juggernauts. The five-piece appeared on the cover of hipster Rolling Stone magazine, fronted Pepsi ads and sold out gigs across the world in the space of a few whirlwind years.When the group announced a long-rumoured comeback at the end of last year, it took minutes for tour dates to sell out. Even being down a member ndash Victoria Beckham, aka Posh Spice, declined to join the reunion ndash did little to dampen worldwide sales or the enthusiasm of the thousands of fans heading to Murrayfield to see them perform tonight.:Sherlock Holmes lives on as Conan Doyle hits So is it pure nostalgia filling a dozen stadiums across Europe, or does girl power still have a place in  Mel B, also known by her alter-ego Scary Spice, described the s feminist catchphrase as ldquoabout spreading a positive vibe. Geri Halliwell ndash now Geri Horner ndash echoed her sentiments years later. ldquoGirl power was a mission, she said in . ldquoIt was like, lsquoWe feel like this, and we believe there is a whole generation of girls who feel like this, toorsquo.Their message was obvious in music, a string of fun, confidence-laden number one singles. ldquoIf you wanna be my lover, you gotta get with my friends, make it last forever, friendship never ends became a mantra for a generation of young girls growing up in the s.The group became known for anthems of self-assuredness: ldquoIrsquoll tell you what I want, what I really, really want and ldquoWho do you think you are  were a breath of fresh air to mainstream charts at the time.The Spice Girls also celebrated the notion that you could be any kind of woman you wanted to be.Everyone had a Spice they identied with most .For many, they also provided a first brush with feminism for girls and young women in the s. With Germaine Greer and Simone De Beauvoir not nearly as accessible, or cool, the Spice Girls inspired confidence and prioritised friends over boyfriends.Older adolescents were given sex-positive, body positive messages.Of course, not everyone embraced girl power. Critics were more cynical, seeing it as a male-made marketing tool.Garbagersquos Shirley Manson said she found the Spice Girls ldquoabhorrent. ldquoI always hated the term girl power, she said in . ldquoIt was pretending to be women taking control, but none of them took control, they werenrsquotwriting, they werenrsquot producing, they werenrsquot playinghellip I found it a sham.She perhaps has a point: the band was initially brought together by men, advertising for a ldquostreet wise female group.But, despite the grouprsquos slick PR machine, Horner maintains that there was authenticity behind the forming of the group.ldquoWhen I met the other girls, I was pursuing a career as a solo artist, but it suddenly occurred to me that there was something so powerful in the idea of lsquowersquo ndash when women, or people in general, really support each other, she told Vice.In , the tone of feminism has taken a more serious turn. The MeToo movement is at the forefront of public consciousness, while the Instagram age is synonymous with a decline in mental health. But its core remains the same.A profile of the group by Kathy Acker forin  urged the Spice Girls to grow with feminism.ldquoI am speculating, but, perhaps due to Margaret Thatcher ndash though it is hard to attribute anything decent to her ndash a populist change has taken place in England, she wrote.:Paperbacks: Inheritance The Summer House Mac and His ProblemldquoThe Spice Girls, and girls like them, and the girls who like them, resemble their American counterparts in two ways: they are sexually curious, certainly pro-sex, and they do not feel that they are stupid or that they should not be heard because theydid not attend the right universities.The profile added: ldquoIf any of this speculation is valid, then it is up to feminism to grow, to take on what the Spice Girls, and women like them, are saying, and to do what feminism has always done in England, to keep on transforming society as society is best transformed, with lightness and in joy.Feminism has carried on and the reviews of Spice Girlsrsquo reunion tour may be lsquobeen there, done that, bought the t-shirtrsquo. But, two decades later, for one night only, most of us wouldnrsquot mind wearing that old t-shirt again ndash evenit doesnrsquot fit anymore.Geri herself said there were ldquobraver voices before the Spice Girls and braver voices after.

Thatrsquos when, with the massive support of The Beatson, I started my fight back against the disease.\"Irsquove had my ups and downs since then, but throughout it all the unique, world-class team of iniduals at The Beatson have treated, cared for and supported me every step of the way.\"It is understood Ms Grays absence is linked to her husbands health.It is nearly a year since the second disastrous fire at the Mackintosh Building at the Glasgow School of Art on June .Ms Gray, also an author and television presenter, and a graduate of the school, has been much in the news since that fire, which left the historic building gutted.The causes of the fire have yet to be established formally by the Scottish Fire and Rescue Service.It is understood that investigators still wish to probe areas of the Mackintosh Building, including the basement area.Ms Gray has been a stalwart defender of the GSAs treatment of the building before and after the fire.Last September she said that the Mackintosh Building could be rebuilt, albeit over four to seven years, using Charles Rennie Mackintoshs original plans.Original plans from the Mackintosh Building, built in two stages between  and , are held in the GSAs stores and at the Hunterian at Glasgow University, and the school also has digital plan, called a BIM Model, from the restoration work following the  fire.Ms Gray said: \"This time it will be built with such knowledge and expertise that we have learned since .\"We are resolved that the Mackintosh comes back as a working art school, as a major player, a cultural leader for the city and the Scottish economy.\"The chair appeared at the Culture Committee of the Scottish Parliament hearings last year.Those hearings led to a critical MSP report into the GSAs treatment of the Mackintosh Building, which also suffered a fire in .The MSP report called for a full judicial inquiry in the two fires at the building, and raised the question of the building being run by a Trust, rather than the GSA.The GSA responded to the MSP report, questioning and querying some of its findings, and in turn, last week the Culture Committee responded.The Culture Committee, which is led by convenor Joan McAlpine MSP, says: \"The recommendations made in the Committeersquos report are based on the balance of evidence provided over the course of the inquiry taking cognisance of the views of a iety of parties with a range of experience and expertise.\"The Committee is therefore extremely disappointed that the GSArsquos response seeks to question the credibility of the evidence provided by some of the witnesses.\""},{"url":null,"title":"scottish-labour-to-decide-on-support-for-referendum-on-brexit-deal","story":"The partyrsquos executive committee is due to meet in Glasgow to determine its policy on Brexit following calls from Mr Leonard to commit to a confirmatory vote on any deal to leave the European Union.Ahead of the meeting, a source close to the leader

playing a leading role in the campaign.ldquoOnly Scottish Labour is building a radical  of investment for our people, communities and public services.Scottish Labour leader Richard Leonard reacts to

slump to fth place with just .% of the vote, lose both its MEPs and caused two frontbenchers to resign.Approximately % of Scottish voters backed Remain-supporting parties in the poll, won in Scotland by the SNP with .% of the vote.On the day after the results were announced, Neil Findlay MSP ndash an ally of Mr Leonard ndash announced that he was stepping down as the Labourrsquos Brexit spokesman due to party infighting.He was followed by justice spokesman Daniel Johnson, who blamed ldquothe current direction and leadership of the party.A defiant Mr Leonard said that he would not stand down following his partyrsquos worst-ever showing in European elections, and, following a Labour group meeting in the Scottish Parliament, said: ldquoThere is a determination in the group to find a constructive way forward.ldquoWe recognise that % is an incredibly bad result but we need to come together to build a way from that.ldquoI am taking the flak, and I am prepared to take the flak, for

has arisen because of declining standards in nursery school, a teacher told the annual general meeting of the Educational Institute of Scotland .In recent years, councils have replaced teachers with lower-paid child development officers ndash previously called nursery nurses ndash partly on cost grounds, but also because they work longer hours.Councils argue child development officers are now better qualied than ever following the introduction of new qualications and their use allows them to open nurseries for longer in order to meet the demands of working parents.However, research has consistently highlighted the importance of teachers in nursery education.Jillian Gillespie, a primary teacher, told the EIS agm in Perth: ldquoOver the years we have seen a steady decline in the abilities of children coming into P.ldquoPoor communication skills, poor speech, social and emotional dficulties, lack of independence. We can no longer assume that the children coming into P have a basic level of ability.ldquoSome children are coming in to school unable to speak in sentences, they donrsquot know how to sit and listen and a majority of them donrsquot even know how to hold a pencil.Ms Gillespie said the job of being a P teacher was getting harder every year because there was ldquono educational input in nurseries.And she warned the situation had arisen at a time when the Scottish Government was doubling the provision of free nursery places.ldquoLocal authorities are decreasing the educational value in the early years and we need to put teachers back into nursery, she added.ldquoOur curriculum is three to  and we should have a teacher there educating from three.ldquoI am not disrespecting what our early years officers do, they do a very good job, but teachers are qualied to a higher standard and can offer high quality educational activities and encourage pupilsrsquo development.A motion from the Dumfries and Galloway EIS local association called on the agm to campaign for qualied teachers to be part of the core staffing of nurseries."},{"url":null,"title":"d day borders veteran john mcowan recalls that fateful day","story":"A -year-old from Peebles is among the  veterans who are making their way to Normandy today.Sergeant John McOwan served in the Royal Electrical and Mechanical engineers, attached to the th Army.

According to these three parties, the new power supply system — known as #cold ironing# — will reduce the overnight carbon footprint from the vessel’s diesel generators and engines. It is believed that this will lower the ferry#s fuel consumption by at least  tonnes a year and resulting in a signicant reduction in carbon dioxide. It is also hoped that this will make a contribution towards further reducing nitrogen oxides, sulphur oxides and noise.According to the organisations behind these plans, it will be £, cheaper to service MV Hamnavoe each year, as a result of the project. £, of funding was secured for the scheme from the European Regional Development Fund in August last year, with additional funding coming from OIC#s Miscellaneous Piers and Harbours fund and HITRANS.The scheme is expected to fully pay for itself in three years’ time through efficiencies and cost savings.Organisations behind the project say that other benefits will include the installation of an electric bus charger at the ferry terminal to open up opportunities for an electric vehicle to be used on the Stromness to Kirkwall route. There are also plans for the installation of electric vehicle charging points, as well as  electric bicycles for use by members of the public.For the full story, pick up a copy of The Orcadian, this Thursday.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Having been extracted in the lab, the DNA has been sequenced and compared against known species, creating a near-definitive list of everything that lives in the loch for the first time.The results of the study were supposed to be published in January, but cataloguing the extensive range of micro-organisms and bacteria has taken longer than expected.The team has found around  dferent species of fish and up to , species of bacteria, some of which will have been deposited in Loch Ness by animals using connecting rivers.Prof Gemmell said he hoped to announce the full findings of the study at a press conference in Scotland next month.“Is there anything deeply mysterious  Hmm. It depends what you believe,” he said. “Is there anything startling  There are a few things that are a bit surprising.“What we’ll have achieved is what we set out to do, which is document the bioersity of Loch Ness in June  in some level of detail.“We’ve tested each one of the main monster hypotheses and three of them we can probably say aren’t right and one of them might be.”Although Prof Gemmell would not confirm which hypothesis might be right, the two main theories about the monster is it is a long-necked plesiosaur that somehow survived the period when dinosaurs became extinct, or it is a sturgeon or giant catfish.Prof Gemmell admitted that part of the reason for the delay in publishing the results was due to a series of failed attempts to film a television documentary.Negotiations with a series of production companies ended without a deal.©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"queen s birthday honours the scottish list in full","story":"Here is a list of all the Scots honoured by Her Majesty the Queen to mark her birthday.KNIGHTS BACHELORBrian Harold Donohoe.

What you have counted was the Leave without a deal of any type vote  and your figure of  includes voters who may care nothing about the EU but are considering a host of other reasons for casting their vote.LOL The London Liberals’ view of democracy:“Dear plebs, we’re honouring you by asking your advice on which of two options # Leave or Remain # you want us to adopt .” 🙂Alternative description of London Liberals:They made it % clear that they want to withdraw Article  and remain in the EU.They expressed this view in language that was so clear that not a single person could misunderstand them.Millions of London plebs agreed with them and voted Liberal, so they won the election.If you saw anything dferent John, I suspect your moving picture wireless needs re-tuning.Would you say the same about the SNP in Scotland, Malcolm Still thinking about it, Malc Liebe Rosa, you’ve fairly thrown down the gauntlet there!I agree, each translation has issues, but happily help is at hand within Shetland culture. Schiller was surely making a typically Enlightenment-era appeal for people everywhere to enjoy brotherhood or solidarity, irrespective of the irrational isions imposed on us, saying that joy in this reunites us. He knew it was chance that saw us on one side or another of any nationalist driven war, and wanted to emphasise the need for healing and togetherness.It’s a concept of course that also is captured by Robert Burns ten years after Schiller in: For a’ that and a’ that, or Trotz alledem und alledem, as it also became in . The final lines guaranteed translation into many other language too:Shall brithers be for a# thatSchiller would also have recognised the romantic sensibilities which informed Shetland’s Up-Helly Aa, or unserer feuer-trunken Faschingsdeinstag, ob du wilst. I think these lines from the closing verse of The Galley Song capture Schiller’s intention perfectly:O’er stre the curtain drawHappy to see Europe inspiring Shetland still!#Schiller was surely making a typically Enlightenment-era appeal for people everywhere to enjoy brotherhood or solidarity, irrespective of the irrational isions imposed on us#Unless of course they#re English eh Peter. You want to separate scotland from the rest of the UK yet come out with the PC BS above. just who are you trying to kid I wondered when the anti- English racist rhetoric would raise its ugly head on here. Rule Britannia was actually written by Thomas Arne a Roman Catholic who was proud to be British. He’d get short shrt on the so called Liberal Shetland Islands.The first  notes of Beethoven#s Fth. Lest we forget how Europe became free.And there is a big world out there we don#t need Europepo founded , napoleon long dead by then. liberals to replace lairds  look at tavish family historyThe original company originates from , with the formation of the Peninsular  Oriental Steam Navigation Company, Napolean not long dead . Napoleonic Wars were certainly consequential in the rationale behind the companies formation. Particularly the Peninsular war.It wasn’t of course ever a one way street. Garve, a contemporary of Schiller and Goethe, did a great to broadcast the gains of the Scottish Enlightenment by translating and accrediting the works of Smith, Hume, Ferguson, Hutcheson, Reid and others, to the extent that Goethe himself, though perhaps before his heyday, said there was nowhere in Europe that could hold a candle to what was happening in Scotland. It would be unreasonable to suggest Burns did not become familiar with the thoughts of Kant, Rousseau, Locke, and other European philosophers, directly or indirectly, in the salons of Edinburgh. It would similarly be a nonsense to suggest that Haldane had no exposure to all this. His inspiration cannot be orced from the earlier flourishing of inspirational ideas of brotherhood and equal worth that happily live on yet. Shetland, after the Napoleonic era, seems to have been quite a radical place to a degree, as the later broken-promise legal challenges possibly demonstrate. There was also a legal challenge related to a whale grounding in Sandwick which seemed fairly radical in intent. The underpinning ideas don’t appear to respect the random lines drawn on maps that seem to dominate some people’s thinking.Some lines are more equal than others eh Peter The modern Labour movement of course grew out of the earlier Liberals, with many older ideas and values broadly held in common. Opening the debate, crossbencher, Lord Lisvane saw a problem where Scotland and Northern Ireland, as two of four parts of the United Kingdom, backed Remain, yet could be dragged out of Europe against their will. He identied #a sort of imperial condescension from the centre—from Westminster and Whitehall# and sought #a devolution settlement properly owned by its participants# that would #include something perhaps missing from the present arrangements: the R word—respect.#Most Scots voted to continue their solidarity with Europe, whilst a signicantminority of English and Welsh voters would apparently risk sacricing their older union with Scotland in order to Leave. Schilleradvocated seeking broadminded and warmhearted company. Should the UK falter, will it be those who sought to continue to enjoy the benefits of the wider degree of solidarity who are really to blame I am so sorry, Peter Hamilton, Schiller died two hundred years ago. Have you someone a little more contemporary to bore us with  Tony Benn had some creative thoughts about Europe, as did Jack Jones. They were real socialists and Democrats, not pretentious windbags. Now carry on spouting, Liebe Rosa, will be most impressed. # made me realise how cushioned from the worst excesses of Tory Lib-Dem austerity we are in Scotland: free prescriptions, no bedroom tax and – of vital important to many state benefit recipients – universal credit payment choices, to name but three. This of course, was reflected in Shetland’s EU election result. My friend is planning on early retirement and swt relocation to pro-Europe Shetland.In that same spirit, and reflecting on Northern Ireland’s and Scotland’s situation, I found myself wondering how someone might feeltheir favourite pub, which offers a decent selection of bar meals, was to be burned down by their dour in-laws who run the bog standard cafe next door, all in order to secure wider access to the market.These words were in the context of his apologising to the Roma people for Catholic discrimination.They sit in contrast to Farage’s racist and isive comments regarding Romanians that some people willingly overlook.

Students have learnt about the aquacultures along the tidal zones of Skye and food practices that can support them.During the summer, three graduates of the course have been awarded a Climavore apprenticeship in restaurants across Skye and Raasay # Edinbane Lodge, Raasay House, and Scorrybreac Restaurant. Working in close collaboration with the chefs and kitchen teams, the apprentices will develop, prepare and serve Climavore dishes to support and develop alternative aquacultures that promote cleaner usage of the tidal zone.The programme will be launched with a celebratory meal on Saturday st June at the oyster table in Portree. Prepared in partnership with the pupils, diners will be treated to a lunch of scallop ceviche, oysters, seaweed soup and carrageen panna cotta, washed down with a Harris Gin and sea buckthorn cocktail.Events on Sunday nd June will include a walk to a rare native Skye oyster habitat, which will be followed by a screening of the recently-released film #Artishal# at the Aros Centre in Portree. Produced by Patagonia, #Artishal# is a film about people, rivers, and the fight for the future of wild fish and the environment that supports them. The film screening will be followed by a discussion led by environmentalist Corin Smith.Alon Schwabe of Cooking Sections explained why he believed this project was so vital. He said: #All across the Scottish isles, the United Kingdom and across the planet we are witnessing a tremendous loss of bioersity and extensive pollution of our air, land, and waterways. In the UK and all around the world, the environments we leave to future generations are in a fragile state.#Climavore questions how we eat as humans changes climate and develops programmes to provide tools to young residents of Skye to transform food practices, ecologies and environments to become better places for humans, plants and animals living along the tidal zone.#Atlas Arts producer Shona Cameron added: #Working with the students and teachers at Portree High School over the last year has been an exciting development for this project. The students have shown real enthusiasm to learn about the local ingredients and engage in conversations that question sustainability.#It has been brilliant to see restaurants across the islands continue to show enthusiasm towards the aims of Climavore and demonstrate a willingness to take on apprentices, working with them to bring Climavore dishes to their menus.

The late Peter McCambridge won his Distinguished Conduct Medal on the Longest Day - but he had, in fact, dropped into Normandy in the late evening of June , .Anyone who has seen the film of The Longest Day will remember the scenes featuring Richard Todd and the Glider troops of the Oxs and Bucks Light Infantry attacking Pegasus Bridge.Mr. McCambridge, then an NCO with the thParachute Btn. of the th Airborne Division, was fighting only yards from this famous action in the nearby village of Le Port.In later years, Peter McCambridge was a familiar figure in Ballymena. He lived at Wilson Crescent and was a keen walker. Few,any, would have known that the tall, bespectacled figure who went about his civilian le so quietly and modestly was one of the heroes of D-Day.This is what his citation recorded about the action:-  Unit : B Company, th Parachute Battalion. Service No. : . Awards : Distinguished Conduct Medal‘This NCO was one of the parachute troops who landed behind the German lines in Normandy on the night th th June . During the fighting for Beacutenouville bridge on the th June, McCambridges platoon was responsible for holding the village of Le Port. At one period his section became detached from the platoon and the fighting, which went on for  hours almost without pause, was particularly fierce. McCambridge noticed that one house dominated the scene of the fighting. By skilful use of a smoke grenade and displaying the greatest dash he got his section across a road swept by Machine Gun fire and into the house. He used anti-tank grenades to smash open the garden gate and the door of the house. Once inside the house he was completely cut off from the rest of his company, who actually had withdrawn slightly, but he was in a dominating position and became the target for the enemy who greatly outnumbered his section and were surrounding him. So well did he dispose his men however and so splendid was his leadership that he held this isolated house until the seaborne troops eventually entered the village from the other end, several hours later. At times the enemy were close enough to try and beat down the door by beating it with their rle butts - McCambridge dealt with such attacks by having grenades dropped on them from the upper windows. There is no doubt that the holding of this dominating house seriously weakened the enemy attacks and greatly assisted the battalion to carry out its job of holding the bridge. On the th June at Bois de Bavent during a company attack Sgt McCambridge, together with another NCO, saved the le of his platoon commander, who had been wounded and whose phosphorus bomb was burning in his pouch. Between them they extracted the burning bomb and dragged the officer to cover despite heavy and accurate mortar and Machine Gun fire.McCambridge has shown himself throughout the three weeks continuous fighting to be a truly magnicent NCO. He is calm, cheerful and always reliable.

The Amateurs celebrated reaching the historic milestone by holding a gala sports dinner at the Millbrook Lodge Hotel in Ballynahinch“Sixty years is a long time for a Junior or indeed an Intermediate club to keep going, especially in the modern day when there are so many other attractions,” said Mr Martin.He revealed that the Irish FA was working on a strategy to reverse the nationwide decline in the adult game, and hoped that the Amateurs would themselves benefit from this plan in the near future.Over  members, friends and former players of Dromore Amateurs enjoyed a fantastic evening at the Millbrook Lodge Hotel, Ballynahinch on April  as the club celebrated in fine style its th anniversary.Formed at the beginning of the   season, the Amateurs have maintained football in the Co Down town for six decades.Terry Pateman, chairman of the Northern Amateur Football League, presents a crystal vase to Amateurs chairman Russell WardAs well as the president of the Irish FA, special guests on the night included Terry Pateman, chairman of the Northern Amateur Football League, and Maurice Johnston, vice chairman of the Mid Ulster Football League.Dromore played in the Northern Amateur Football League from  to  and again from  to , before moving to the Mid Ulster Football League where they currently play in the Intermediate B Division.The compere and after-dinner speaker was BBC legend Jackie Fullerton, whose wit and charm throughout the evening brought much fun and laughter.The Ballymena man’s tales about sporting icons George Best, Joey Dunlop and Alex Higgins went down a storm with the audience.Mid Ulster Football League representatives Maurice Johnston, vice chairman, left, and Stephen Magill, honorary secretary, right, make a presentation to Russell Ward, chairman of Dromore AmateursMr Fullerton was the perfect gentleman with all he met, mingling with guests and accommodating every request for a photograph or a selfie with good grace.SpeechesThe Amateurs’ hard-working committee was delighted to secure the attendance of such a prestigious guest as the president of Irish FA.Universal Credit in Crisis: These people want you to hear their stories of le on the problem benefit before it is rolled-out even further Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\"However, the pleasure was reciprocated because, of course, Mr Martin is an Amateurs old boy himself.Top goalscorer and first team player of the year Matthew Reain, centre, withcoach Keith Halliday and manager Graeme DavisHe spent  years with the club as a player and club treasurer.“I receive many invitations over the course of a year but this is one which gives me so much pleasure in being able to attend,” Mr Martin told the audience. “It was Mountview Park in  when I joined the club.“I was a second team player. Robert Gracey, Sam Vint, Aubrey Davidson, Wyn Crothers, Brendan Maginess, Philip Roy, Bernie Mackin, John Toucher and, of course, so many others, were my teammates.“They were great times, great moments. We weren’t successful, however these guys were fine clubmen.“I was treasurer from  to . We developed the clubhouse and upgraded the pitch and surroundings. We put the club on a sound financial footing before I left in  – this was achieved from a less-than-zero position in .“Suffice to say, this is where I began as a football administrator and I have always been grateful to the club for that.”Commenting on the Amateurs’ exciting plans for a new pitch and clubrooms, Mr Martin said the future was looking bright for his old club. He brought the best wishes of the Irish FA and on their behalf presented a crystal bowl to Dromore chairman Russell Ward to mark the occasion.Indeed, Mr Ward was a busy man on the night.In addition to making two fine speeches himself, the Amateurs chairman was presented with a further two pieces of crystal from Mr Pateman and Mr Johnston. Both league officials made excellent speeches during which they brought the best wishes of their respective organisations and paid generous compliments to Dromore on reaching their th anniversary.AuctionA highlight of the evening was the auction of sporting memorabilia. Hospitality tickets for a Northern Ireland game, signed shirts from Ulster Rugby and Linfield FC, and signed footballs from Rangers FC and Manchester United, all sold for very respectable sums.However, a titanic bidding war took place over a signed Liverpool FC football and the atmosphere in the room was electric as the figure kept getting higher and higher.When the auctioneer, Mr Fullerton, eventually brought the hammer down and declared ‘sold’, it was Amateurs committee member and local businessman Darren McCauley who became the new owner of the prized football.He might have paid an eye-watering amount, but being a lelong Liverpool fan and a great Dromore clubman, Mr McCauley was delighted with his purchase – and with Liverpool having won the Champions League final at the weekend, it now looks like a clever investment.With the formalities over, it was time for the band to take to the stage, and five-piece Klass proved a big hit, packing the dancefloor until the finish.AwardsThe final act of the   season came on Saturday, May  with a charity match between current players and a team of Amateurs “legends”.An entertaining game was played in a friendly but competitive spirit at the Community Centre.The youthful legs of the current players proved too much for the wise old heads of the legends. However, a clever tactical decision to play the last  minutes with  players on the pitch helped the old boys finish the game with a respectable - defeat.It was wonderful to see so many former players come along, pull the boots on and attempt to relive past glories. Special mention goes to Malcolm Hanna, who celebrated his th birthday with a sterling display in midfield.A total of £ was raised for Diabetes UK, with the costs of the day kindly sponsored by Trevor Tate and Son Transport Ltd.Afterwards, the Amateurs held their end-of-season awards presentation in the clubrooms.Chairman Russell Ward expressed his sincere thanks to the coaching staff, players and committee for all their efforts throughout the season.First team player-manager Graeme Davis was praised for guiding the Amateurs to their highest place league finish in many years.Dromore ended the season in fth positionin the Intermediate B Division of the Mid Ulster Football League.Their record was as follows: P W D L Pts .Graeme can be proud of this achievement in his debut season in charge.

The seconds finished eighthin Reserve Division Four.Their record was as follows: P W D L PtsDficult as the season proved, it was still a great learning experience for the younger players. Although there were many ups and downs over the year, the team stuck together and there was a great spirit in the changing room, right up until the last game.The award winners for both teams was dominated by young players – an encouraging sign for the future.The first teams gongs were a family affair, with the Reain brothers, Josh and Matthew, iding up the trophies between them. These two fantastic athletes will be the backbone of the first team for many years to come.Young player of the year was Matthew Briggs, who moved up from youth football and played the entire season in the first team - a tremendous achievement.In the seconds, top goalscorer Jonathan Rodgers only joined midway through the season but he is a great attacking player and is such an exciting prospect. And -year-old Nathan Thompson capped a wonderful season by taking home both the manager’s and players’ player of the year trophies. Nathan is a quiet young man – but on the pitch he makes his presence felt, and is a model defender who rarely makes a mistake.Clubman of the year was the popular Christopher Tate – a committee member and first team coach, Christopher puts his heart and soul into the club.Dromore Amateurs will hold their AGM in the clubrooms on Monday, June  at pm.

If we get Boris Johnson in as Prime Minister, God knows what’s going to happen because that man wants to bring in an amnesty. He will probably call a halt to legacy inquests, so we need to get people out on the streets at the weekend.”She continued: “The inquest won’t answer all of our questions, but at least we’re having it addressed. We had General Mike Jackson in the box who, when my brother and Mr Corr were being thrown into the back of an army vehicle, he stood round the corner saying they had engaged in two-three hour gun battle and had shot dead two gunmen. That has now been exposed – they were unarmed.“We’re  years down the line with our campaign. An inquest is something that every person is entitled to. The right to le is something that people should have in any country.”Mr Laverty’s niece, Mary-Kate Quinn, added: “The Stormont House Agreement was something that people were happy with, but all of the mechanisms are shelved. Sunday is about making sure there is a process for everybody to be involved in and asking for it to be implemented.“The Stormont House Agreement provides people with mechanisms that acknowledge their loved ones. There are people sitting who don’t even know that they have had loved ones murdered – they have no voice.We’re very lucky –you could say that – that we have a process and we’re miles ahead of everybody  because of the inquest.”She continued: “The Ballymurphy campaign and the inquest has given people hope. As a family we would like to think that it gives people hope. When the Bloody Sunday families got the outcome of their investigation it was victory for them, but it was a victory for all of us. I think this march is about hope and about demanding the rights that we’re entitled to.”The Time for Truth March will assemble at pm, Sunday th June at three points, walking to join at Belfast City Hall.

These lines of inquiry do not include the journalists, Mr Birney or Mr McCaffrey, as suspects in the investigation.“At all times, my officers have acted in good faith, within the law and followed due process. The warrant application was originally submitted to and approved by a county court judge. We do, however, accept and respect the decision of the High Court last week.“We plan to produce a final report to the Chief Constable of the PSNI outlining all of our findings.”In response PSNI Chief Constable George Hamilton said: “In , PSNI became aware of an alleged theft and or unlawful leaking of sensitive documents relating to the Loughinisland investigation from the Office of the Police Ombudsman. To ensure independence and address any conflict of interest I asked Durham Constabulary to conduct the investigation.“I am grateful to Durham Constabulary and to Chief Constable Mike Barton for the work they have conducted on our behalf in this sensitive investigation. I have always accepted the autonomy of Chief Constable Barton’s inquiry and I fully concur with his decision not to progress the investigation into the two journalists Mr Birney and Mr McCaffrey.“Throughout the period of this investigation, the horror of what happened in Loughinisland has never been far from any of our thoughts. The perpetrators of that crime have never been brought to justice and that is a matter of huge regret for policing.“The police investigation into who murdered the six innocent men in the Heights Bar in  remains open but progress is dependent on new information. There are people out there who know what happened. I would appeal to them to come forward and make a statement that will help us finally bring justice to the families of the victims.“I am aware that the investigation over the last year has caused concern for families who have already suffered so much. That is something none of us would ever have wished to do.“However, as a police service, the suspected theft or unlawful leaking of any sensitive documents containing information that may endanger le is a serious matter which we are statutorily obliged to investigate.“Recognising the sensitivities, we asked an independent Police Service to conduct the investigation. The clarity provided by last week’s hearing has now brought a signicant part of that investigation to a conclusion.“I await the final report from Durham on this complex investigation.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"tim and jake unveiled as feile comedy leads","story":"NORTH is set to meet West as Belfast’s comedy big hitters come together for Féile an Phobail’s annual comedy night.

Nationalists, and rest of society, must play part in working towards greater Catholic representation in our police force Read MoreChief Constable: Change needed to stop falling numbers of Catholic PSNI officersMr Hamiltons comments provoked criticism from the SDLP who said that the - policy should never have been removed, while Sinn Fein said it wasnt up to political parties to recruit for the PSNI.The DUP weighed in, accusing nationalist politicians of paying lip service to policing and lacking real leadership, while the UUP said it has always been opposed to - recruitment and does not want to see it .Meanwhile, high-profile priest Fr Martin Magill said he supported the Chief Constables remarks and said that church leaders and politicians have a responsibility to encourage Catholics to join the PSNI where appropriate.Speaking to the Belfast , Mr Sheridan, who was once Northern Irelands top Catholic police officer, said he believed the PSNI should \"seek to avoid\" a new - policy, despite the organisations current recruitment challenges.\"I genuinely believe that we should look for the best people regardless of religious background,\" he said.\"I think we should seek to avoid -we can.\"Having said that, it also has to be reflective of society.\"Were at %. We should work hard at maintaining that, picking people because they have the skills for policing, not because of their religious background.\"But given the low percentage of Catholics in the PSNI, Mr Sheridan, who now heads up cross-border charity Co-operation Ireland, said more should be done to encourage recruits from that side of the community.\"If theres a sense that somehow were going to lose that representation then I absolutely do think that people should be championing the need for people [Catholics] to join the police service,\" he said.\"Im not sure - would be the answer today because Im not sure there would be any more encouragement for young people to jointhat was the case.\"The PSNI replaced the Royal Ulster Constabularyin November , and a - recruitment policy ran for its first  years until .This meant that % of all recruits had to be from a Catholic background, and % from a Protestant or other background. When the policy began, about % of police officers were Catholics. Mr Sheridan said that while it was the right strategy then, it isnt the way forward in his view.\"I was in favour of - at the time because we needed to rebalance the organisation but we shouldnt consistently need to do that,\" he said.\"We should be looking for the best people whatever their religion or gender or anything .\"The ex-head of the PSNIs Crime Operations Department also said it would be \"dangerous\" to lay the blame for this lack of Catholic recruits at the door of nationalist politicians, community leaders or any inidual.\"Its on all of us - its on our politicians, its on the community, its on the police,\" he said.\"Policing has to be reflective of society and the democracy it serves so therefore its everybodys responsibility.\"Fr Magill, whose emotive speech during the funeral of murdered journalist Lyra McKee prompted a standing ovation, said he was \"very supportive\" of what Mr Hamilton said.\"The bottom line is that Church leaders and politicians should encourage Catholics to consider a career in policing when an appropriate opportunity arises,\" he added.Mervyn Storey, the DUP MLA, said nationalist representatives must \"step up to the challenge issued by the Chief Constable to demonstrate civic leadership and properly advocate a career in policing\".He accused Sinn Fein of failing \"to step forward and demonstrate real leadership\" and slammed the SDLPs call for - recruitment to be reinstated as a \"knee-jerk response\".He added: \"It is not enough for nationalist and republican representatives to pay lip service to policing.\"Dolores Kelly said the SDLP encourages any young person from a nationalist community who is thinking about a career in policing to pursue it.\"Ending - policing has had a detrimental impact on the makeup of the PSNI. We warned the British Government against it,\" she added.\"Its time for a rethink.\"Sinn Feins Gerry Kelly accused Mr Hamilton of \"attempting to deflect from failings within policing\" by blaming political parties for the lack of young nationalist recruits.\"While I am on the record as having said my door is open to assist anyone interested in a policing career, it is not and never has been the job of any political party to recruit for the PSNI,\" he said.Ulster Unionist MLA Alan Chambers said his party has always been opposed to - recruitment and does not want to see it ."},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article38192996.ece/d68af/BINARY/HONOURS%20Ch%203.jpg","title":"full list of northern ireland recipients of queens birthday honours june","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsEU Elections Top  CompaniesNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

We have a very simple saying, Happy pupils, high expectation, high achievement and thats it in a nutshell.\"The school is well led by a supportive board of governors.\"Principal of Loreto Grammar, Omagh, Grainne OHanlon, said she was \"delighted\" at its joint top ranking, the first time it has topped the league table.\"It is the result of the professional relationship and trust which the teachers establish with the pupils,\" she said. \"Theres a strong, supportive pastoral Special Educational Needs and safe environment surrounding the pupils and thats fully endorsed by the parents.\"Its the overriding belief that our young girls are creative, talented and able, and with a lot of self belief and hard work they can achieve.\"Lumen Christi College principal Siobhan McCauley said her schools academic success is largely due to \"the excellent relationships that exist between students and staff\".She added: \"The strong support of parents coupled with the hard work and dedication of the staff enables our students, who are well-motivated and enthusiastic, to perform at the highest level and thus achieve outstanding exam results.\"Principal of Rainey Endowed Mark McCullough said the results were enabled by a \"three-way partnership between the school, parents and pupils\".\"Its a great accolade - we just work and do the best for them that we can,\" he said.\"Im absolutely delighted and would like to thank everybody for all their hard work.\"Principal of St Dominics in Belfast Carol McCann said that % of all GCSE grades achieved in her school were A* A.\"Our performance at GCSE is the highest it has ever been in the A* A grades,\" she said. \"We are very proud of the achievement, which is down to the hard work of the pupils, staff and parents, who have worked together.\"Our Lady and St Patricks College principal Deborah McLaughlin said her schools joint sixth position was \"testament to the positive attitude of our students, who are supported by our committed staff and our parent body\".\"Were very much a team,\" she said. \"It is a balance between academic and extracurricular activities for students.\"Principal of St Louis Grammar School in Ballymena Sean Rafferty paid tribute to the work of pupils, staff and teachers.\"I would like to congratulate the pupils, teachers and parents for their magnicent effort.

The party lost  seats on local authorities around the country last week, and at least one MEP.Ms McDonald has accepted responsibility for the result, telling reporters: “The buck stops with me.” The result has sparked fears within Sinn Fein that the party will lose some of its  Dail seats at the next general election.Mr Treacy was a late substitute onto the party’s election ticket for Dun Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council.He secured just  votes in the Glencullen-Sandyford ward."},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article38184574.ece/804a7/BINARY/trump_shannon_002.jpg","title":"the donald gets into the swing of things after landing in rough with border faux pas","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsEU Elections Top  CompaniesNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Were used to Americans coming over and flattering the Irish with faux praise about how their ancestors built their country. Trump is somewhat dferent, though.Sources say the US President told Taoiseach Leo Varadkar that he always thinks of the Republic as \"a huge country\" because of the impact its people have had. Varadkar happily told him the country has just five million people.It was one of the lighter moments in a meeting that briskly moved from serious topics to sport. Brexit, immigration and all featured, before conversation swayed to The Open. At one point the Irish side found itself explaining how, for some sports, the whole island plays as one team, while for others, there are Republic and Northern Ireland teams. The US President was fascinated. Insiders say the atmosphere was \"warm\", which probably matched the temperature in the makesht meeting room that was dressed up with a few net curtains and colourful flowers. On the American side, Trump had some big hitters, but they didnt throw any punches. There was his Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney, National Security Advisor John Bolton and Secretary of the Treasury Steve Mnuchin. Varadkars back-up team included his Chief of Staff, Brian Murphy, main Brexit brain John Callinan, US envoy John Deasy and Ambassador Dan Mulhall. Even before the meeting began, it was obvious Trump was in a good mood. He allowed journalists to fire questions at him for eight minutes without trading any insults. He also denied being in Ireland to play golf and promote his hotel but struggled to show that he had done any actual preparation for the meeting. The Taoiseach was brave enough to publicly correct him when he tried to compare the Irish border situation with his plans to build a wall between the US and Mexico. \"His basic knowledge isnt great,\" a source admitted. However, Mr Varadkar insisted afterwards that the purpose of the meeting was to educate the US delegation.Soon, Trump and his we, Melania, were on board a chopper bound for Doonbeg. Irish officials were more than a little relieved. Mr Varadkar went on to defend the cost of providing , unormed and  specialist gardai for the trip. \"The good bilateral relationship between Ireland and America is worth a lot more than €m,\" he said. Trump is unlikely to have taken in much of what was said, but he didnt call anybody, including Michael D Higgins, a stone cold loser. No real damage done, then, which is the best they could have hoped for. There was no mention of wind turbines or fake news. \"I learn from my mistakes,\" the Taoiseach laughed as he left the post-match analysis session.  data-dfpadtargeting and First Lady Melania Trumpdisembark Air Force One upon arrival at Shannon Airport in Shannon, County Clare, Ireland on June , .

obesity epidemic  ","story":"NEWRY, Mourne and Down Council is aiming to help fight the growing obesity crisis across Northern Ireland.Local politicians are gearing up to declare war on the issue and implement a new policy that will result in high sugar items such as sweets, fizzy drinks and high fat snacks being banned from vending machines in council buildings across the district, including its leisure centres.The high sugar items will be replaced with healthy choice snacks and drinks with local politicians hoping that other organisations across the district, which have vending machines in their buildings, will follow suit.A number of local schools have already banned chocolates and crisps from their vending machines with politicians keen to lead from the front in encouraging people to eat more healthily and exercise regularly.Last year, the local authority launched a new app to make it easier for residents across the district to take part in sport and leisure activities and receive up-to-date information about the local authorityrsquos leisure facilities.Now it wants to go a step further to help improve peoplersquos health.The move to ban high fat and sugary items from vending machines across council buildings, which will be formally discussed later this month, comes after it emerged this week that sweets, crisps and fizzy drinks could soon be sold under cigarette-style plain packaging under plans by a number of leading brands to help combat the obesity epidemic.A recent Department of Health survey revealed that that % of people in Northern Ireland were overweight, with % classed as obese with councillors acutely aware that obesity continues to be one of the most important public health challenges.They recognise that being overweight or obese increases the risk of le threatening disease, with its costs extending far beyond the public sector, affecting iniduals, families, communities, the economy and society as a whole.At Monday nightrsquos monthly meeting of the local authority, politicians agreed to debate the possible ban and view the move as an important step towards tacking the obesity issue.They aim to encourage people to opt for healthier food choices and to change their diet as part of the drive to create an environment that supports and promotes a physically active lestyle and healthy diet.Mournes councillor Willie Clarke, who is spearheading the drive to ban sugary snacks and drinks from council vending machines, said he hopes it will empower people to make healthier choices and reduce the risk of overweight and obesity related diseases.He said tackling childhood obesity was already a public health priority and was keen for Newry, Mourne and Down Council to do all it could at a time when research suggested that one in four children across the island of Ireland carried excess weight.Cllr Clarke said that without action to reverse current trends, the next generation will be beset with signicant ill-health related issues linked to obesity, most of which are potentially preventable.ldquoI am keen for the local council to introduce a new policy to effectively ban high fat and sugary foods and drinks from vending machines across its facilities and replace them with healthy options, he explained.ldquoI also hope that the local authorityrsquos many partner organisations will follow suit. We do not want to see obesity becoming a social norm and I believe we can help make a dference by exercising greater control over what items are in vending machines in all council buildings.Cllr Clarke said he viewed a ban on sugary snacks and drinks as ldquojust the start of a concerted campaign to help tackle obesity and get people move towards healthier lestyles.ldquoI think it is important that the council takes the lead on an issue which everyone can support. It is essential people signicantly reduce their intake of unhealthy food and drinks, he said.The local councillor also suggested that the local authority should offer politicians healthy options when they arrive for their tea ahead of the monthly council meetings.ldquoHealthy options featuring salads, fruit and vegetables should also be on the menu at council-organised s so people can choose to eat healthily. While I want the council to take the lead on this issue, I hope many other bodies it works alongside will follow suit.ldquoWorking together we can make a dference and help people change their lives. The councilrsquos lead on this issue could have a ripple effect across the district beyond.Cllr Clarke added: ldquoThis is not about being a kill joy but encouraging people to be more health conscious when it comes to what they eat and drink and is the first step in a process..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Countdown to DownTime summer festival  ","story":"THE countdown is on for this monthrsquos spectacular DownTime summer festival which has something for everyone.Organisers of the four-day community event mdash which kicks off on June  mdash are promising a sparkling festival of fun which includes two daysrsquo of not-to-be-missed horse racing at the widely acclaimed Downpatrick track.Horse racing first took place at in Downpatrick in  and for almost  years the local track has been constantly improving, boasting great racing, modern facilities, themed race days and a rather unique atmosphere.DownTime summerfest has been organised by a dedicated local team from all sectors of the community whose aim is to get people out and about not just over the four-day festival, but across the summer.Now in its second year, the festival is supported by Newry, Mourne and Down Council and features over  events covering arts, heritage, music, food and, of course, sport.There will be street art, live music, theatre performances, free train rides, a living history Viking encampment at the St Patrick Centre and an artisan market mdash which will be open between am and .pm mdash cradled in the grounds of the Down County Museum.Locals and visitors alike will experience a haven of freshly produced food, bespoke crafts and relaxing surroundings.

Antrimrsquos expected fightback started immediately with the accurate Katie McAleese keeping her side in contention with five consecutive points, including three from play.There was only a point in it as the first half drew to a close, but Down broke free from their shackles and Mallon sent her side into the break with a - to - lead with a well-taken score.Antrim reduced the leeway to a single point at the start of the second half with a score from Bronagh Orchin, but a composed Down side replied with a brace from Mallon as the Mourne girls took a - to - lead after  minutes.McAleese and Paula OrsquoHagan swapped points before Down hit the jackpot when Sara Louise Carr found the back of the Antrim net for Downrsquos second goal and a six point lead with  minutes remaining.Full credit to Antrim, they refused to throw in the towel and three unanswered points from Maeve Kelly and McAleeseleft a puck of the ball between the sides.It was a hammer and tongs finish with both sides feeling the pressure, but it was Downrsquos Niamh Mallon who settled the issue with a converted free and give her side a deserved victory.Down captain Fionnuala Carr was delighted after her sidersquos victory and it marked a successful season on both the club and county front for her after she also lted the All-Ireland Intermediate Club Camogie title with Clonduff in March.ldquoThere are a few of us that played for Down for many years and couldnrsquot win an Ulster senior.

With winter over, during which time many elderly residents were effectively trapped in their homes after dark, the news may not be much consolation for residents.The committee also heard that their plea for a telephone kiosk at Cuan Beach had been refused and that an alternative site has been found for the Toye Kiosk at the New Line.ANNSBOROUGH mdash The youngsters of Annsborough have at last been able to use their new playing fields where a mix-up in the erection of a fence had kept them out for several months. Grazing cattle which have been using the field have been banished to the sidelines behind a new fence.The problem started when Enterprise Ulster erected only one fence at the new playground and forgot about s second fence to keep out nearby cattle. The mistake led to angry words at Down Council where officials were blamed for not supervising the work and inspecting the completed job.However, Enterprise Ulster workmen responded quickly to a council call and within days had put things right.SHRIGLEY mdash A new factory in Shrigley, which will manufacture plastic products and employ  people, is expected to open within the next few months.The factory is sited in premises vacated by the tannery at Shrigley and the man behind the venture is Mr Garfield Brown, who already owns the Killyleagh Rug Company.It is not exactly clear when the new firm will open, but itrsquos managing director, Mr Lance Walker, says he is optimistic that production will start in August.He said the factory will carry out plastic processing and will provide materials for the packaging industry. ldquoObviously we want to start as soon as possible, but at the moment machinery is being delivered and we are waiting for more to arrive. This makes it impossible to announce when production will start, he added.CROSSGAR mdash Mr Edward Cargo, from Crossgar, retired this week after  years of service to transport and received an inscribed gold watch from his colleagues to mark the occasion.Mr Cargo, who was based at Downpatrick bus station, received his gold watch from the station manager, Mr Ian Cunningham, at a specialheld in the Slaney Inn, Raholp.Mr Cunningham, who made the presentation on behalf of Mr Cargorsquos colleagues at the Downpatrick, Newcastle and Ballynahinch Ulsterbus depots, thanked him for his long and distinguished service in transport, starting with the old Northern Ireland Road Transport Authority and finally Ulsterbus.Mr Jim Prior, on behalf of the engineering department, wished Mr Cargo a long and happy retirement and thanked him for all the help and friendship he gave to all the men in the garage over the years.SAINTFIELD mdash Preparations for the th annual Saintfield and District Agricultural Show have been finalised and the organisers are hoping for good weather to ensure big crowds.Entries for the agricultural, home industry and poultry sections are very high.

The traditional merchant city is situated on the lsquoRiver of Goldrsquo. It was here in the th century that Portugal took its name. Much of its fine architecture in the old medieval quarter and a mandatory wine tasting session of the world famous ruby-port wine warrant atrip in itself some day.Hugging the coastline, this first stage meanders along a low lying shoreline of boardwalks and sand dunes to Vila do Conde where we took lodging for the night in a guest house as the townrsquos albergue offered only mattresses in a hallway.Day two saw us slowly begin to adapt to the rigours and demands of the Camino. I secretly longed for the day to be over before it began and was relieved that not just a few of us were wondering the same thing. Yet,  miles later, with a one and a half stone weight packed inside our rucksacks and the unwelcome emergence of a cluster of painful blisters forming, we were singing with joy as we arrived at the popular surfing resort of Esposende in the Braga district later that afternoon.Day three began in much the same way, neither of us forgetting the miracle cure that can be derived from a good nightrsquos sleep. We crossed the Rio Nieve to the first of two  foot peaks leading to Viana do Castelo where the majestic Monte Santa Luzia stands atop of a steep hill overlooking yet another captivating beachside town.Half way between Esposende and Viana do Castelo is Igreja Santiago de Castelo do Neiva, where an altar inion relating to St James and dated  AD was found during the reconstruction of the church. This is the oldest consecration to the apostle to be found outside Spain and has put this relatively recent route firmly on the official routes map for pilgrims.Onwards we hiked to Caminha on day four, where more beach board walks, pebbled pathways and sand dunes morphed into woodland trails, offering welcoming shade from the midday sun. Another steady uphill climb helped us reach here before crossing the Spanish-Portuguese border the next day.Farmers still tend their crops by hand in this part of the world, which harks back to a bygone era, leaving it untouched by modern intensive farming methods and giving us a window on the past.The fth leg of our journey began by being ferried across the border in a row boat which had a small motor installed, leaving behind the harbour town of Caminha for the Spanish town of Garda a few short miles round the bay.Further up the coast we trekked, for -and a-half miles until we reached the quaint seaside hamlet of Oia and its famous Cistercian monastery, Real Monasterio de Oia, which dates back to .By this stage our trek was getting easier as we adapted to the distances we were hiking each day. By way of a measuring stick as to how far wersquod come, we got chatting to a couple from Kent who had made their way to a villa they had rented out for a short break.They had driven from Porto in a hired car up the motorway the day before and it took them  minutes. It had taken us five gruelling, but extraordinarily peaceful days to reach the same point and we laughed at how easy it could have been.Each day we handed over our pilgrim passport to be stamped by church sacristans, post office workers, tourist office clerks, cafe and hostel owners, each of them eager to put their mark on our pilgrim way as we followed another hand-painted yellow arrow or scallop shell, dutully painted and maintained by locals proud to be part of a , year-old Christian pilgrimage, which has exploded in popularity in recent years not only with Christians, but also with the unbeliever, the doubter, the atheist and the sceptic mdash all eager to take on its challenges in a bid to escape the rigours and stress of modern day le.Each day too locals seemed to appear out of the midsts, asby magic, beckoning us with a whistle or a car horn to prompt us to turn aroundwe had mistakenly taken a wrong route mdash for which we were very grateful because each step we took seemed to matter a great deal.On day six the town of Moughas gave way to the mountain village Baiona, from where we walked to Ramallosa, famed for its historic sites and narrow medieval streets.Day seven presented a continuous series of spectacular vistas, each imprinted upon our minds until the day we die, such was their beauty, until we reached the large city of Vigo.Between Ramallosa and Vigo we met with a retired local man out walking his dog along the seashore. Silently he studied the two of us slouched exhausted over a park bench at mid morning. We could almost hear the mechanisms at play within his mind.ldquoWhere are you from  he enquired in a fair attempt at English.ldquoNorthern Ireland, we both replied, knowing that he was going to say something witty.ldquoAh, Paddies, he said, aswaiting our next move in a chess game.Ah, you must be Pedro, we retorted, intending no harm.ldquoWhere are you walking to  he enquired.ldquoSantiago de Compostela in Galacia, we both said.It was a trigger. After telling us quite succinctly what, over the last several decades, he had slowly come to realise le was about and how it should be lived, he asked: ldquoWhy are you doing it Neither of us was prepared for his directness but I showed him my rosary beads nonetheless. ldquoItrsquos a sacrice, I said straight out. He paused before he shook his head and said: ldquoYoursquoll never make it.As he watched us stand up he was only too eager though to hold our rucksacks as we reached into them again after our short but thought provoking rest.After wishing us buen Camino, he asked us to remember him when we reached the tomb of St James.Day eight and the noise and bustle of Vigo soon gave way to  feet and a steady climb of mountainous terrain and shady woodland trekking until we reached the refreshingly rural town of Redondela.Quiet country lanes led to  miles of more pebbled rustic pathways and stony gravel lanes on day nine until we reached the city of Pontevedra. As good fortune would have it, Friday, May , was a public holiday across Galacia and every shop, except cafes and wine bars were closed. We did mange to explore the magnicent Roman town though in the evening, but our bank balance didnrsquot suffer too much.Pontevedra paved the way on day ten with more forest trails and waterfalls. Our first climb of the day was to Caldas de Reis, home of the famous volcanic foot spa where for centuries pilgrims have been dipping their sore and weary feet in water of  degrees.Our penultimate day saw us take on the dizzy heights of Mount Corgullion before reaching the famous city of Padron, where we sampled the world famous padron peppers with dinner in the evening.Padron is  miles south of Santiago and is the starting point of St Jamesrsquos ministry in Spain and to where his remains were brought following his martyrdom in Jerusalem. His remains were later taken to the cathedral in Santiago where they lie in a tomb.We gazed in awe at the great Jacobean treasure and the original stone mooring post of Padron, from which the town gets its name.On the twelfth day a final temptation presented itself in the form of a train station that was situated directly opposite our lodgings that evening. Fellow pilgrims laughed at the idea that a train would take us to Santiago in  pain-free minutes,we werenrsquot up to the final trek and the almost , feet climb.I wasnrsquot laughing. I seriously eyed up the possibility, going as far to check train times. It was a stroke of good luck when I learned there was no other half way stop between Padron and Santiago. After what we had endured over the last  days, not to walk the final few miles would have been an obvious regret.And so we reached Santiago on foot shortly after pm on May , overjoyed and in a state of euphoria. The city of Santiago was worth the hike. Itrsquos as beautul and charming as it is captivating.The camaraderie and craic shared among all us pilgrims who made it from Porto to Santiago that day was incomparable to anything I have encountered before. The memories will stay with me until the day I die..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.impartialreporter.com/news/17673913.long-calls-for-peoples-vote-after-election-triumph/resources/images/9411974.jpg","title":"line up of calves win over judges at calf fair","story":"Breed judges from throughout the UK and Ireland were unanimous in their praise for the Pedigree Calf Fair and Beef NI Expo, held at the Balmoral Showgrounds in Belfast on SaturdaySpeaking after the one-day show, which featured three show rings and  native and continental beef breeds, event organiser and Chairman, David Connolly said: ldquoItrsquos been another fantastic event, and we certainly exceeded our strap-line lsquoBigger and Betterrsquo.ldquoThe  show has surpassed last yearrsquos inaugural event, attracting hundreds of spectators and more than  trade exhibits.

You have people all over who, through no fault of their own, can’t drive because of this.

The current delays are ridiculous.“Whilst the PSNI have an immediate role to play by adopting what would be a very common sense approach by allowing temporary exemptions, the reality is that the wider problem remains a Department for Infrastructure issue.”Alliance MLA Kellie Armstrong said: “The department should have seen this coming. They should have access to figures showing the number of car sales, and at the end of the day they are the ones issuing the reminder letters so they should have known well in advance how many cars were due for an MOT.“It is very unfair that people who have done nothing wrong are being penalised.”The Department of Infrastructure said the DVA is now issuing reminder letters nine weeks in advance, and is advising customers to book an appointment as early as possible to avoid delays.try catch  TrendingMOT delays: PSNI in talks about relaxing rules for affected driversIncreasing concern for N.I. teen who has vanishedN.I.

The PSNI will not make such a decision in isolation.”Asked what advice police could give to motorists faced with long delays for an appointment, the PSNI said: “Keep checking the online booking portal for cancellations. Carry your appointment letter with you.”Charlene out to strike a gender balance in the music industry\"  \"  Reported On This Day : Murdering Irish peer is pardoned by King George II Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Mr Cousens said: “If not quickly resolved, lawful drivers could be unfairly penalised for an issue outside of their control.“It’s not just the private motorist at risk either, as delivery vans are being caught up in the backlog. As the majority of freight is moved by road, inaction could dent the Northern Irish economy.“In previous periods of delay, Stormont has allowed exemptions to affected vehicles while the backlog is cleared. We hope that this can be repeated again while a long-term solution is sought.”Almost , more tests than normal were made in the first three months of this year.The Department of Infrastructure has said additional staff are being recruited and “urgent consideration” is being given to the possibility of opening testing centres on Sundays for a limited period of time in order to address the current backlog.try catch  TrendingMOT delays: PSNI in talks about relaxing rules for affected driversIncreasing concern for N.I. teen who has vanishedSinger Malachi Cush lsquostablersquo in RVH following road collisionN.I.

Others will be converted to fit LED lights in line with the energy reduction strategy. This is better for the environment as LED lights produce less CO.ldquoIt is dficultnot impossible to find parts for the old Victorian lamp posts, so retention and refurbishment of the street lights is generally not an option.ldquoThe lantern design on the posts is also incompatible with a conversion to LED lighting and the switch forms part of the councilrsquos Street Lighting Energy Reduction Strategy.Ms Weightonrsquos pavilion exhibition, called lsquoAdre ndash Homersquo continues until May .The petition can be found at www.change.org p vale-of-glamorgan-council-save-the-victorian-heritage-of-penarth. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Unfortunately the swing bridge has been out of commission since June .I have met with residents and local Labour councillors, who have been working closely with residents to discuss their concerns and plans to make the bridge once more available to the public.The bridge is owned by the Vale of Glamorgan Council and leased to Penarth Quays MarinaLTD. It was built to ensure that both residents and boat owners had equal access to land and water.I understand that there are no mechanical reasons why the bridge should not be used.The Vale Council and PQM have agreed that safety upgrades need to be carried out for the bridge to reopen. In October  PQM submitted a planning application for modications to the swing bridge. I have been told that PQM were contacted by the Vale council to mody the current application to include lower intensity flashing lights and lsquosilent alarmsrsquo. Unfortunately PQM felt that the changes would not meet the safety standards they felt necessary and choose to withdraw the application. I understand that the Vale Council is currently awaiting the outcome of a noise report which will feature in future discussions between the Vale and PQM over the future of the swing bridge.The swing bridge has been an integral part of marina le for many years and is enjoyed by both residents and the thousands of tourists to the area. Connecting the two sides of the marina the bridge acts as a short cut for residents, particularly useful for those with walking dficulties. Having spoken to local businesses about the potential for the reopening the consensus seems to be generally positive. Reopening of the swing bridge, customers could use the car park on Llwyn Passat and use the bridge to access Portway businesses.I hope that the Vale council and PQM are able to work together to find a solution. I think we can all agree that the way forward is to ensure safe operation of the bridge while minimising disruption to adjacent properties.Before the Easter recess I met with residents to listen to their concerns over plans to remove Victorian lampposts from across Penarth. The cast iron lampposts, which have been an integral part of Penarthrsquos street scene for a century are being replaced by the Vale council with modern LED lighting. I am disappointed that several lampposts along Cwrt-Y-Vil road have been removed without notying residents.Residents have set up a petition, of which over a thousand people so far have signed asking for the old posts to be left in place with new ones installed beside them.

I will challenge other councillors to back it.Earlier on Wednesday, Cllr Gray made a statement to Vale of Glamorgan Councilrsquos Conservative group to say he was resigning.In his statement, he said he had ldquoabsolutely no issue with the manner in which Cllr Bailey was elected as the new leader of the Conservative Group,But he said he is ldquoat least partially at odds with Cllr Bailey on three issues ndash the proposed lsquoclosurersquo of Llancarfan Primary School, the Dinas Powys Bypass and the incinerator in Barry.On the Llancarfan School proposal, which would see the primary moved to a new building in Rhoose, he said: ldquoI seconded a motion to have the executive reopen the issue consultation and this was ignored by the then cabinet but now that this dficult decision has been made I fear that any attempt to articially prop up Llancarfan School will take funding away from the budgets of Penarth schools which is something I will not tolerate.Cllr Gray said heremained ldquounconvinced that the proposed bypass around Dinas Powys, linking Cardf to Barry, ldquois an issue with a large base of support in my ward, and the efforts to give it even more prominence and funding would I believe be to the detriment of the residents of my ward.Vale council has been waiting for more than a year for Welsh Government to decide whether the Barry incinerator needs to carry out an environmental impact assessment before it can operate.Cllr Gray said any efforts to ramp up the councilrsquos rhetoric on the incinerator ldquowould do a disservice to those residents who are passionate about the subject.ldquoRaising  hope for headlines is not the reason I stood for local government and I donrsquot want to mark my success by how many column inches we are able to achieve on a wedge issue, he said.       ,params: .pushHe added:ldquoThe structures around the group that Vince is proposing seemed to be geared up to act as an opposition party and not to focus on the work of delivering core services for the benefit of the most vulnerable members of our society.ldquoI donrsquot expect everyone to agree with my decision and I donrsquot take this decision lightly ndash I am sure that there will be a great number of people who have an opinion on whether I have done the right thing or not.ldquoI need to remain true to myself and my belief in acting as a positive advocate for the residents in my ward ndash the issues that get me out of bed every morning to work hard for the residents in my ward are not the way the press views me but how I can make a positive dference to peoplersquos lives. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log        ,params: .push-- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

And under my leadership, a Conservative administration will proudly put the people of the Vale of Glamorgan first.ldquoNaturally, we are open to working with other councillors who share those ideals.ldquoOthers - including those who resigned from the Conservative party - will have to explain to voters where they stand on these issues - and I would urge them to back us, rather than propping up a Labour administration that was rejected by the Vale at the last election.Cllr Bailey said he had a six-point plan for the Vale.He pledged to deliver the Dinas Powys bypass stop inflation-busting council tax rises scrap proposed parking charges review the local development planto curb inappropriate development protect rural schools and oppose the Barry Biomass plant.Cllr Bailey said that he was also keen to improve engagement with the public, after a series of hugely unpopular decisions taken by the existing cabinet.He said: ldquoDuring the elections in , we promised to build a stronger relationship with local residents by consulting them on key decisions.ldquoUnfortunately, too many people feel that their views are simply being ignored and that Vale consultations are just tick box exercises. Take the proposals around car parking charges, or the closure of Llancarfan School. I donrsquot think anyone outside of the Civic Offices believes that those decisions werenrsquot already done deals, and thatrsquos simply unacceptable.ldquoAnother good example is the councilrsquos failure to listen to the public over Penarthrsquos original Victorian lamp posts.ldquoIrsquove been criticised for wanting to listen to the people who elected me, and I make no apologies for that.

Although a relative newcomer to the site, having previously taught in Newport, it is clear he is immensely proud of the students and staff.ldquoVisitors to the school often comment on the warm, friendly and purposeful environment that exists at Stanwell and, despite its size, they see how the school cares about the inidual child and their progress, he said.ldquoThe schoolrsquos Mission Statement is summarised as lsquoLearning to Excelrsquo and this is the vision for every child, whatever their starting points, interests or talents. The school thrives because we have a fantastic team of teachers, teaching assistants, support staff, parents and governors who help make this vision a reality.ldquoThis is what makes the school so successful because everybody gives so much.Wandering through a theatre the school uses to put on assemblies and biannual productions, Mrs Kynaston pointed out a section of floor that moved away to create an orchestral pit. The production value afforded to every department ndash theatre, maths, sports, English ndash was astounding.ldquoWe try to give our pupils the very best, said Mrs Kynaston. ldquoWe want them to truly reach their potential. To excel.Mr Brown agreed. ldquoOur amazing staff believe in every young personrsquos potential to succeed and really do go the lsquoextra milersquo for pupils, he said. ldquoOur pupils flourish academically but also as well rounded, confident young people ready to contribute to society.The extra-curricular provision at the school is broad and this really helps to develop our students confidence and skills beyond the classroom setting.That extra-curricular provision is a key focus for the school.Lessons finish at .pm, earlier in the day than most other schools, but that affords pupils plenty of time to take on other pursuits.The school offers a huge number of activities, ranging from the expected - rugby, football, hockey, theatre and orchestra - to the esoteric, like German Film Club or Cipher Club.School trips in recent years have taken students to such exotic destinations as Costa Rica, Iceland, Borneo, Morocco, Spain, Germany, France, and Italy, allowing students to soak in culture both at home and abroad.Clearly, a huge pupil base allows for a huge number of options.The schoolrsquos ability to bring such a population to the table, and keep them focussed, has produced excellent results.In the last fty years alone, it has produced Olympians, rugby internationals, Members of Parliament and television presenters.It has ties to Nasa, and men who walked on the moon have visited the school for talks.Its most curious claim to fame comes in the form of a mascot painted on a wall.Emma Davies, a former pupil of the school, had a design chosen as the official Welsh Wenlock ndash the Olympic mascot for the London  games.But Stanwell flourishes academically, as well.In its  GCSE results,  per cent of Stanwell pupils achieved at least their expected grades, compared to  per cent of the rest of Wales. The same story went for maths, with  per cent again hitting their expected target or better, against  per cent of Wales.       ,params: .pushAt A level,  per cent of all grades were A* or A, with  per cent of the year group achieving A* to C overall.A level results put Stanwell students amongst the top performers in Wales, with many iniduals securing exceptional grades.  of themachieved the equivalent of three A grades or better.Three of its pupils went to Oxford University last year, while another earned a place at Cambridge University.Mr Brown said: ldquoWe place a large emphasis on listening to our learners and and our pupils make a dference as leaders in the school, whether itrsquos through well established groups such as our school council, eco-committee or charity committee, or in aspects of teaching and learning where we have subject prefects and learner voice groups.ldquoThey help us evaluate our work as a school and plan for the future.ldquoWhat always comes through is how proud they are of their school.Rightly so. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log        ,params: .push-- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

So, why are Northern Ireland’s makers and engineers bucking the trend  John Mulgrew takes a look at our top performers and what may be skewing the figures If there’s been an industry yet to be tainted by the ill-effects of the run-up to Brexit that I, or other journalists haven’t written about, I’d be very surprised.The latest economic metrics and predictors have been tarred by the three years of uncertainty and political instability. But, according to the latest purchasing managers’ indexfrom Ulster Bank, manufacturing here has seen an uplt – unlike the other sectors.Globally, however, the growth of the manufacturing sector has slowed closer to stagnation, sitting at . in Januaryaccording to the JP Morgan Global Manufacturing PMI.“At the moment, exports are falling in German manufacturing,” Richard Ramsey, Ulster Bank chief economist said. “Northern Ireland and the UK compare favourably to the German powerhouse, and countries such as France and Italy.”He says that nine out of the  nations which are recorded by PMIs show manufacturing is falling.For Northern Ireland and the UK as a whole, Brexit-related stock-piling is certainly a factor. Let’s say you’re a cross-border business and you could be burdened by World Trade Organizationtarfs on your exports to the Republic in the event of a hard exit. What do you do  You produce more, and warehouse in your export market.Graeme MacLaughlin, relationship director, Barclays in Northern Ireland, said the “underlying state of health of UK manufacturing continues to be obscured by stockpiling, albeit down from the last survey’s record high, as Brexit uncertainty still thwarts investment intentions”.Ulster Business has revealed in this magazine that one major manufacturer, which has its base here, had stockpiled more than £m in food stock for its market in the Republic amid border concerns – and is now left with huge levels of product in a warehouse, with the exit from the EU now not likely until Halloween.“Continuing increases in inventories of both inputs and finished goods have exacerbated the slowdown in growth of new orders and given the loss of momentum in exporting activity, with growing signs that overseas markets are looking to alternative suppliers, the sector needs some degree of clarity on the future relationship with the EU sooner rather than later,” Graeme MacLaughlin said.Looking at what organic factors and positive stories which are fuelling the increase in manufacturing, Richard Ramsey says the success stories and expansion of firms such as CDE Global and Terex could be among those contributing.“They seem to be in expansion mode. But they are firms which are more exposed to the US, which is growing strongly. I would imagine those focused on eurozone are maybe experiencing that fall in demand.”Stephen Kelly, chief executive of Manufacturing NI, told Ulster Business that “in the past year, our firms have been busy”.“The economic conditions have been right. A purple patch indeed. Admittedly Brexit stockpiling has driven demand for many and as that begins to wash through the system in the coming monthsand with slowing of international and domestic demand, then now is the time to ensure we have the right conditions to ensure that this success is sustained.“By value, our engineering sector remains our most important. The extraordinary growth of the export focused sector in Mid Ulster, South Derry and West Tyrone contributes huge levels or employment and wages but as labour and skills have become more dficult to secure, firms have begun to spread out. CDE’s investment in Monkstown and Terex’s announcement for the North West demonstrate their commitment to creating more jobs here instead of overseas.“There has been much speculation about the demise of our manufacturing over recent years but the sector continues to confound its detractors. Employment levels, despite high profile closures, are back to  levels with exports at record levels and orders at home remaining strong. Our sector is larger and more important than manufacturing in the rest of the UK. Through direct and supported jobs, one in four local families rely on a manufacturing wage with our rural economy and community depending on manufacturers to bring both wealth and work.“Our award-winning food firms feed families at home and abroad with a greater number securing supply contracts with the UKs and Ireland’s largest buyers. Indeed news that Dale Farm had secured a supply contract with Greggs is further evidence that there is more growth possible for this critical sub-sector of manufacturing.“Often overlooked is our strength in building products. From Specialist Joinery and Carella fitting out the best of corporate offices to Smyth Steel and Macrete making the bulk of the new Tottenham Hotspur stadium, regarded as the best in Europe, in factories here before shipping on barges to London.“We’re also leading the move in construction from site build to factory built homes, schools, hospitals and offices at the McAvoy Group and Fasthouse. We have even seen a beautul table made by Terry Design from Portadown in  Downing Street.“Whether it is a critical spring on the Mars rover, or a defibrillator in the Oval office or indeed the fact that one in  people on the planet this year benefiting from a Randox test, products made in Northern Ireland are making a dference and making a huge economic contribution.“It is therefore critical that we cherish and celebrate our great firms who are making great products with great people in every postcode area. We must create the conditions that allow them to be free to make a success of their business and their community.As for the current and future “disruptor”, Richard Ramsey says while Brexit is the largest, the impact of Trump on the global economy, could have an impact on business here. “The thing is, it’s to what extentthere is when there is a trade war. Trump is increasing tarfs on China, then he focuses on the EU – how does the EU retaliate ”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/kpm_1.jpg","title":"ni bosses searching new markets to boost exports","story":"Posted on Tuesday June  by John Mulgrew Around % of Northern Ireland bosses are exploring emerging markets in order grow their exports, according to the latest survey from KPMG.

John Hansen, partner in charge of KPMG Northern Ireland, said: “Successful CEOs know they need their companies to be as innovative as possible and it’s clear that the right environment is being created in Northern Ireland to do just that. “Our leaders aren’t afraid to give their teams the scope to try new ideas which may have a risk of failure and that opens up a world of potential. This level of freedom will no doubt make sure that Northern Ireland companies are at the cutting edge of innovation in the years to come.” Angela McGowan, CBI director in Northern Ireland, said: “KPMG’s  Global CEO Outlook gives local business leaders some great insights into what is on the radar for chief executives across the globe and raises some important and interesting ideas around what leaders should doing to maintain competitive advantage despite the uncertainty.”  View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/glandore_web.jpg","title":"glandore the family flexible workspace on the rise","story":"Posted on Wednesday June  by Ulster Business High-end flexible office company Glandore has expanded rapidly into an all-island family business with further growth on the horizon. Ulster Business speaks to director Clare Kelly about a burgeoning firm which is leading the way in more than just business, but connectivity, co-working and wellness for its members Eighteen years ago and in its early stages of infancy, Glandore began its le in one building at Fitzwilliam Square in Dublin – capable of hosting just  members.Fast forward to the present day and it’s an all-island business with an -strong workforce across nine locations in Belfast, Dublin and Cork – playing host to as many as , people. And it’s very much a family-owned and run business, led by founder Michael Kelly with daughters Clare, Fiona and Rebecca each as directors within the company.Glandore’s high-end flexible working spaces have been up-and-running in Belfast for  years – with capacity for  members across its two locations here. However, the family’s connection to the city dates back to , when Michael first bought - Arthur Street, now Arthur Place.It’s been at the forefront of attracting some of the leading international foreign direct investmentto Belfast, working closely alongside Invest NI to bring in cyber-security and technology firms from the US and beyond – first setting up here in . Glandore offers its members a wide iety of flexible office space, co-working and hot-desking – designed so companies can grow organically. But it’s also focused on bringing its members together, connecting indigenous and international firms, while also considering wellness in the workplace, and improving its green credentials. Clare Kelly is a director of the family business – a qualied occupational therapist and Trinity College graduate, who joined Glandore in .She’s now tasked with focusing on the key marketing and business development elements of the burgeoning company – attracting and retaining members, and ensuring there remains a strong pipeline of clients.“We offer our members a erse range of services,” Clare tells Ulster Business. That includes short-term hot-desking for small businesses with just a handful of employees, to providing flexible high-end office space for companies with dozens, or hundreds of workers.”And while the flexibility allows firms to scale from small numbers to a larger workforce – taking short-term space for as little as just three months – Clare says many of the companies stay for several years, orto Glandore further down the line in their own business journey.“We also host a range of events, and can bring everyone together through the network of our members. That has allowed us to cater from very early start-ups, right through to the largest multi-national company, or scaling FDI business,” Clare says.“The dference with Glandore is the flexibility. A company may wish to bring in one or two people, and then concentrate on recruitment – but they can then scale with their growth, from say  to  people. “That flexibility and scale is key. In terms of Glandore, we are offering high quality space, but also offering a range of business services to our members.”Across its two Belfast city centre flexible workspace buildings, Glandore’s expanding network means it can now host around  members – with locations at Arthur House and the nearby Arthur Place.It has six locations in Dublin, including the Silicon Docks and Central Business District, and has boasted a long list of foreign direct investment firms, including Facebook, Twitter, Dropbox and Smartbox, and has also opened its newest office space building in Cork city.Glandore has forged strong relationships with Invest NI – helping provide high-end working environments for rapidly expanding FDI businesses – along with Belfast City Council, the Belfast Chamber and Northern Ireland Chamber of Commerce and Industry.Some of its high profile international current, or former members, include cyber-security experts Rapid , digital marketing firm Bazaarvoice and global payments giant Cayan – a company which has now expanded into its Belfast headquarters at City Quays.The quality and bespoke nature of the offices are part of what helps Glandore stand out from the crowd. Clare says firms are able to specy exactly what they want, with a top-end design and fit-out team on hand to develop a specic working environment for each business.“When Glandore was set up by Michael in , he always focused on a high quality working environment,” Clare says. “We take premium office space in premium locations, and there is no expense spared in fit-out.“We provide a bespoke set up – whether they need a co-working space or a virtual office, for example. We can tailor that for each business. It’s not a cookie-cutter approach.”And while she says design and the aesthetics are important, behind the decor is the IT and security infrastructure to ensure that guests have the very best available to them.“We have always invested heavily in our network, and have our own on-site IT. We have an IT director, manager and team – so there is support even before day one. All of these things are important to firms of all sizes.”For Glandore, it’s not simply about putting guests on seats – there’s much more to the offering. “We have such a erse mixture of companies in the network and community, and we are able to mix the indigenous firms with the international companies, and actively, facilitate connections between our members.”That includes an alumni programme, which sees members past and present ing to celebrate their successful partnerships.“We bring back customers from the last  years, and representatives from Invest NI and Belfast City Council. It’s about making the connections between the current scaling members and those which have come before,” Clare says.“That support is invaluable. It can be very isolating in the those days when you are setting up, so it’s great to have someone you can bounce ideas off.”Glandore goes further still, with the introduction of both the Glandore Wellness Programme and Glandore Green Initiative – the latter focused on creating a greener and more sustainable office space.“We have been working with these companies for several years, and we get a bird’s-eye view,” Clare says. “One thing we have been very mindful of is the need for us to support from a wellness perspective.“We offer a complimentary wellness programme, which started in , long before it became a buzzword. It offers a way for our members to connect with each other, and help in retaining talent.”And while almost every business has experienced some Brexit-related impact, Clare says Glandore has reached its highest occupancy rate in its history – rising to % in Belfast.“It has been a very uncertain time and that has impacted businesses across Northern Ireland. There have been some delays in regards to FDI, but our hats go off to Invest NI which still attracting businesses into Northern Ireland.”And while there’s also scope for further growth in Belfast, there’s potential for that demand to move outside Belfast, with a potential to grow into the North West.“The hope is to continue our expansion as an all-island business, having operated on both sides of the border for  years, with capacity to grow the businesses in Belfast.“With the likes of Derry, that would be something on the agenda for Invest NI as part of its remit to win investment for outside Belfast. We will take the lead from the councils and from Invest NI, and we will look to see where we can add. If there isn’t space for a business to land, people will go where.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
