Opposite a country club, it was the biggest and \u0027flashiest\u0027 home that Meghan lived in during her youth. However, the inside was fraught with problems and was where Thomas Jr allegedly smoked weed all day, while dad Thomas Sr worked night and day           The Duchess of Sussex, here on her birthday August 4,  lived in multiple modest homes before finding fame with her role in Suits and marrying Prince HarryMeghan lived on the property until she was two years old and it was the biggest and \u0027flashiest\u0027 home she lived in during her youth.It was located opposite a country club - but the inside was fraught with problems, according to acclaimed biographer Andrew Morton, who wrote the book Meghan: A Hollywood Princess.Thomas Jr smoked weed all day and even her mother would share a joint with a neighbor, while TV lighting director Thomas worked night and day, and wild teen Samantha would be out clubbing.Doria and Thomas had married at the Self-Realization Fellowship Temple on Sunset Blvd, in a \u0027hippie wedding\u0027 in December 1979.They orced four years later and Meghan went to live with her mother in a top-floor apartment on S. Cloverdale Ave, Mid-Wilshire.It was once the garage and loft space for the main front property.This was recently renovated and is currently for rent at $3,950 a month, ten times what her mother would have been paying over 30 years previously.Although Meghan lived in modest homes, she attended a prestigious private nursery and kindergarten called Little Red Schoolhouse which starts at $18,800 a year for kindergarten and $22,600 year for sixth-grade.  After her parents orced in 1983, Meghan and her mother Doria moved into a top-floor apartment (pictured) in the Mid-Wilshire neighborhood of LA. The apartment previously served as the garage and loft space of the main front property. The Duchess of Sussex split her time here and at her father\u0027s home until she graduated high school in 1999    Meghan and Doria lived behind this two-bedroom, one bathroom house (pictured) on South Cloverdale Avenue. Their home was a short walk from Sunset Gower Studios where her father worked and where she spent time after schoolThe school was a short walk from Sunset Gower Studios where her Emmy-winning father worked on the set of Married With Children and where she would spend her days after school.Her mother Doria, 62, had a less glamorous location for her line of business, which was still only a stone\u0027s throw away from the school - now called the Hollywood Schoolhouse.She owned a gift shop called Distant Treasures and a clothing store called A Change of a Dress - both at the same location on N. La Brea St in Hancock Park for 14 years - until she went bankrupt in 2009. As can be seen in our photos, the run-down shopping precinct is now home to a liquor store, kosher market, and an aquarium, which is where Doria\u0027s shop was situated.When Meghan moved on to the $15,900-a-year Immaculate Heart High School, which she attended from 1991 to 1999, she lived with her dad on Vista Del Mar Avenue, a shabby street behind the Hollywood strip, only a few hundred yards from one of Scientology\u0027s most important buildings, founder L. Ron Hubbard Life Exhibition.This is where Thomas recently said in an interview that he\u0027d warned his daughter off the controversial religion after catching her lingering outside the building.Her father\u0027s apartment was on the ground floor and had two tiny bedrooms with bars across the windows.She lived there until she was 17. Now the place has been renovated, as photos show the kitchen, living room and two bedrooms that she shared with her dad throughout her teenage years.          Meghan\u0027s mother Doria, 62, previously owned a gift shop called Distant Treasures and a clothing store called A Change of a Dress - both at the same location on N. La Brea Ave in Hancock Park - just a few blocks away from Meghan\u0027s elementary school for 14 years - until she went bankrupt in 2009. The run-down shopping precinct is now home to a liquor store, kosher market, and an aquarium (pictured) which is where Doria\u0027s shop was situated          Meghan began splitting her time between her mom\u0027s house and her dad\u0027s Hollywood apartment (pictured) when she was 11 until she left for college in 1999. Thomas Sr was living in a two-bedroom ground floor flat on Vista Del Mar Avenue, a shabby street behind the Hollywood strip, only a few hundred yards from one of Scientology\u0027s most important buildings, founder L. Ron Hubbard Life Exhibition          Thomas Sr\u0027s apartment, pictured above with bars across the window, was a short distance to Meghan\u0027s high school. According to a biography on the duchess, \u0027it made sense for her to live with her father during the week,\u0027 however, as she got older, there was friction between the two since she felt she was the one who was mothering her father          Not so shabby: The home has since been renovated, as photos show the kitchen, living room and two bedrooms that she shared with her dad throughout her teenage years. Pictured above is the large living space of the Hollywood home   The two-bedroom, two-bath home located in the heart of Hollywood is now listed for rent. Pictured left is a renovated kitchen, while the right shows an upgraded living space with hardwood floors According to Morton\u0027s book, \u0027it made sense for her to live with her father during the week.\u0027\u0027It was a decision that would have far-reaching implications for the way she was seen by her new teachers and classmates…The older she became, the more she felt she was the one who was mothering her father. It was a source of friction, especially when she started dating,\u0027 the book states. Meghan also had various part-time jobs and volunteer work including bussing tables and serving food at the Hippie Kitchen in Downtown Los Angeles, a Catholic set up to help the homeless living in the notorious Skid Row.She was an assistant at the Paper Store in Beverly Hills, where she also taught calligraphy, and served frozen yogurt at Humphrey Yogart, in Sherman Oaks.When she left high school to attend Northwestern University in Illinois she met film producer Trevor Engelson in a bar on one of her visits back home in LA.Royal reporter claims journalists are being kept at a...Meghan Markle \u0027is at her wits\u0027 end over her father\u0027s public...Share this article \u0027When Meghan first met him on that night out in West Hollywood, she liked what she saw and was attracted to his passion, drive, and ambition. He was a guy with an aphorism for every occasion. \u0027Hope is the greatest currency we have in this business,\u0027 he told the wide-eyed wannabe.\u0027 True or not, it\u0027s a great pick-up line,\u0027 Morton wrote. The pair lived behind Whisky A Go-Go, a notorious club on Sunset Strip in West Hollywood, where Engelson still lives today and Meghan resided there until getting her big break in Suits and relocating to Toronto for filming in 2011, orcing the 41-year-old two years later.    Meghan lived in different humble abodes growing up, but received a private education from kindergarten until high school. She attended Immaculate Heart High School (pictured) on Franklin Ave in Los Angeles from the age of 11 up to 18. Tuition is now $15,900 a year          She attended a prestigious private nursery and kindergarten school called Little Red Schoolhouse, pictured, which cost $18,800 a year for kindergarten. It is now called Hollywood Schoolhouse          This is where Meghan and her first husband Trevor Engleson lived - behind Whisky A Go-Go, a notorious club on Sunset Strip in West Hollywood on Hilldale Ave during their marriage until they split in 2013. Engelson reportedly still lives there todayYet it was her childhood that defined Meghan, the aspiring actress and now adored royal. \u0027While her childhood experiences were the crucible that set her on the path to activism,\u0027 says Morton.\u0027Her mother believes that she was hardwired from birth to try to make the world a better and more equal place. In short, she had a moral compass.\u0027Despite wanting to be a Hollywood star, it was her faith that was equally important and the central pillar for Meghan and Doria. So much so, that we can disclose she was once a youth minister for the Agape International Spiritual Center, which her mum is still a member today, along with TV host Oprah Winfrey.Sharon Fox, now an executive producer at California Motion Picture Company, was also a member and told her Facebook followers about bumping into the duchess and her husband Prince Harry in Dublin earlier this month.\u0027It was such a nice surprise to bump into them when I went to Dublin to view the Book of Kells. Meghan was very sweet and I had a short chat with her during her stop on the walk about regarding our church, the Agape International Spiritual Center, and our mutual minister, Reverend Michael Bernard Beckwith... Meghan was a youth minister at my church, Agape, in LA years ago when I used to volunteer with the babies and toddlers on Church Sunday at Agape… I can not recall if I ever met her back then but it is clear she radiates that Agape spirit where ever she goes.\u0027 Her new digs: Meghan\u0027s childhood homes are a far cry from her new home in Kensington Palace (pictured)           Meghan and Harry moved into Nottingham Cottage, opposite Princess Diana\u0027s former home "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/08/07/02/4EE37D9000000578-6033569-image-m-14_1533605788771.jpg","title":"David Victoria Beckham family caught Bali earthquake","story":"The Beckham family, from left Romeo, David, Victoria, Brooklyn, Cruz and Harper arrive in Bali, a few days before travelling to Lombok where the quake struck          The Beckham\u0027s two oldest children, Brooklyn and Romeo, aged 19 and 15, are pictured arriving in Bali with the rest of their family earlier in the week\u0027They certainly felt the earthquake.

He spotted the large obtrusions while exploring the area in a submersible looking for shipwrecks. \u0027I was trying to identify shipwreck material based on one of the anomaly readings on Gordon\u0027s charts when I noticed something that stuck out, that shocked me,\u0027 said Miklos in an exclusive interview with DailyMail.com          Horizontal cylinder structures jut out from this large dome feature at the center of the site. Geophysicists on the team report that the coral covering these structures appears to be more than 5000 years old.           A close up of one of the horizontal structures which has scientists baffled. Because of the extreme currents at the location it\u0027s almost impossible for coral to grow at all, let alone into a anything this large          Here, what he describes as the right jutting section of the USO.  According to scientists on Darrell\u0027s team, no coral anywhere in the world could grow in this formation naturally, there would have to be an underlying structure to support that type of growth          Miklos, 55, described what he found while filming episode seven of Cooper\u0027s Treasure and tells how he and his team want to bring the \u0027alien spaceship\u0027 to the surface \u0027It was a formation unlike anything I\u0027ve ever seen related to shipwreck material, it was too big for that. \u0027It was also something that was completely different from anything that I\u0027ve seen that was made by nature\u0027          These horizontal structures are massive, each measures as much as 300 feet straight out, the length of a US football field. The explorer also found other bizarre and unexplained formations around the main object, all of which are covered in thick coral which he believes are hundreds if not thousands of years old          These mystery shapes score the top of the massive central mound. Each of these lines is the width of a family home          Here you can see the gigantic mound rising above the ring of structures that stick out from the center. The entire site\u0027s diameter is some 600 feet - the length of two football fieldsBut instead the veteran treasure hunter found a bizarre structure like nothing he\u0027s ever seen.The huge unidentified submerged object (USO) has 15, 300ft long obtrusions jutting from its side.In an exclusive interview with DailyMail.com Miklos, 55, described what he found while filming episode seven of Cooper\u0027s Treasure and tells how he and his team want to bring the \u0027alien spaceship\u0027 to the surface.He recalls: \u0027We were doing a scene where I was sitting in a two man submersible.\u0027We were out in the Bahamas and we were on an English shipwreck trail, somehow related to Sir Francis Drake.\u0027I was trying to identify shipwreck material based on one of the anomaly readings on Gordon\u0027s charts when I noticed something that stuck out, that shocked me.  In an exclusive interview with DailyMail.com Miklos, 55, described what he found while filming episode seven of Cooper\u0027s Treasure and tells how he and his team want to bring the \u0027alien spaceship\u0027 to the surface\u0027It was a formation unlike anything I\u0027ve ever seen related to shipwreck material, it was too big for that.\u0027It was also something that was completely different from anything that I\u0027ve seen that was made by nature.\u0027It\u0027s almost like there are five arms coming out of a steep wall cliff and each one of these is the size of a gun on a battleship. They\u0027re enormous and then there\u0027s five over here and five over there, 15 in total.\u0027There\u0027s identical formations in three different areas and they don\u0027t look nature made, they don\u0027t look man made, certainly nothing I\u0027ve ever seen based on my experience and I have years of experience at doing this, we\u0027ve identified multiple different types of shipwreck material, this doesn\u0027t match or look anything like that.\u0027The deepest part of the site is 300 feet below the surface, ers had to use special breathing apparatus and a state of the art submarine to access it.The explorer also found other bizarre and unexplained formations around the main object, all of which are covered in thick coral which he believes are hundreds if not thousands of years old.Blown away by the discovery, when back on board his ship, Miklos decided to dig further into Cooper\u0027s files to find further clues.Significantly, the astronaut had written \u0027unidentified object\u0027 on the chart of the area rather than mentioning any historical shipwreck.\u0027I investigated some of Gordon\u0027s charts, I realized that there was something else on there that Gordon was referring to,\u0027 he said.\u0027Then it made sense to me why it wasn\u0027t identified as a shipwreck... he had to mean it might be something from another world.\u0027Gordon believed in aliens. He believed that we had visitors from other planets and he also believed that a lot of these things landed in this particular part of the world.\u0027          The treasure hunter has made the astonishing \u0027unexplained\u0027 discovery deep beneath the Bermuda Triangle.  Miklos believes  it could provide the first evidence of an extra-terrestrial visit to earth hundreds of years ago.          The deepest part of the site is 300 feet below the surface, ers had to use special breathing apparatus and a state of the art submarine to access itGordon Cooper successfully piloted the Mercury-Atlas 9 Faith 7 Spacecraft around the Earth 22 times in 1963 paving the way for men to reach the Moon.He was a pioneer who became the first American to sleep in space and the first to fly twice.He was also the first American televised from space.But as well as researching the limits of human endurance he was also charged with a secret spy mission while in orbit.Using special \u0027long range detection equipment\u0027 Cooper was asked by the US government to look for \u0027nuclear threats\u0027 - which likely meant Russian submarines or nuclear missile sites.But Miklos says Cooper - an avid treasure hunter - also noted the positions of Caribbean shipwrecks while he conducted this spy mission, and created a map on his return to Earth.The shipwreck hunter claims long time friend Cooper gave him the maps - which included detailed charts and exact coordinates - after he was diagnosed with Parkinson\u0027s and then died in 2004 aged 77.In the first season of the show Miklos and his team used Cooper\u0027s map to make a remarkable discovery in the Caribbean - a centuries-old anchor believed to be from one of Christopher Columbus’ ships.Cooper\u0027s maps led Miklos to dozens of other significant ship wrecks across the Caribbean worth millions of dollars.But with this latest discovery the Californian is conscious of being labeled \u0027crazy\u0027 by coming out with wild claims that Cooper\u0027s map might now have led him to an alien spaceship submerged under the ocean.That\u0027s why he says he wants to remain \u0027neutral\u0027 until he can investigate the mysterious site further.Miklos and TV production company AMPLE Entertainment are now hoping the Discovery Channel will commission a third season of Cooper\u0027s Treasure so they can do just that.          United States astronaut Gordon Cooper (1927-2004) pictured wearing his Mercury space suit used in early phases of the Project Gemini training program in the United States circa 1961. (Photo by Rolls PressPopperfotoGetty Images)Miklos said: \u0027I want to investigate it. I want to see what it is, because it may be nature made, just a freak of nature, but given its placement in this particular part of the Caribbean and given what Gordon has told me about visitors from another planet and the things that I\u0027ve seen, I think it\u0027s definitely worthwhile investigating.\u0027AMPLE Entertainment founders Ari Mark and Phil Lott, who are behind Cooper\u0027s Treasure, are equally as excited.Mark told DailyMail.com: \u0027In the first two seasons we didn\u0027t enter too far into Cooper\u0027s UFO interests and what he had told Darrell about what he had seen.\u0027I don\u0027t feel like we\u0027ve even scratched the surface of what\u0027s in Cooper\u0027s files, but that\u0027s what we hope to do in a third season.\u0027The bottom line is that Cooper spotted anomalies and it is his maps that led Darrell to this discovery.\u0027Cooper was a reliable source for treasure, then based on his findings Darrell found something that does not appear to be a shipwreck or anything that anybody has ever seen.\u0027We want to find out exactly what it is and establish whether it ties in with Cooper\u0027s belief that we\u0027re not alone.\u0027During his post-NASA career, former US Air Force Cooper became well known as an outspoken believer in UFOs and claimed the government was covering up its knowledge of extra-terrestrial activity.\u0027I believe that these extra-terrestrial vehicles and their crews are visiting this planet from other planets, which obviously are a little more technically advanced than we are here on Earth,\u0027 he told a United Nations panel in 1985.\u0027I feel that we need to have a top-level, coordinated program to scientifically collect and analyze data from all over the Earth concerning any type of encounter, and to determine how best to interface with these visitors in a friendly fashion.\u0027He added: \u0027For many years I have lived with a secret, in a secrecy imposed on all specialists and astronauts. I can now reveal that every day, in the USA, our radar instruments capture objects of form and composition unknown to us.\u0027Miklos said Cooper often told him stories of UFO sightings and believed a lot of the world\u0027s technological advances had been passed on to governments by messengers from alien planets.Cooper even designed his own miniature \u0027UFO\u0027 based on an alien design he claimed to have seen.          Using special \u0027long range detection equipment\u0027 Cooper was asked by the US government to look for \u0027nuclear threats\u0027 - which likely meant Russian submarines or nuclear missile sites. But Miklos says Cooper - an avid treasure hunter - also noted the positions of Caribbean shipwrecks while he conducted this spy mission, and created a map on his return to Earth. The shipwreck hunter claims long time friend Cooper gave him the maps - which included detailed charts and exact coordinates  Miklos said Cooper often told him stories of UFO sightings and believed a lot of the world\u0027s technological advances had been passed on to governments by messengers from alien planets          Producers Ari Mark (top left) and Phil Lott (top right) with treasure hunter Miklos, host of Discovery Channel\u0027s \u0027Cooper\u0027s TreasureBut as for Cooper being a UFO \u0027nut job\u0027, Miklos couldn\u0027t disagree more.He described him as a \u0027close friend\u0027 and \u0027father figure\u0027 who was of \u0027sane mind\u0027.\u0027I can tell you one thing for sure, there was a lot of conspiracy theorists and UFO nut jobs that he wanted nothing to do with,\u0027 said Miklos.\u0027Just because he had actual encounters with something that he couldn\u0027t explain and other encounters to which he did have an explanation for, but he wasn\u0027t going to go and befriend all of these crazy different types of groups.\u0027In the early days he wasn\u0027t going to overstep the bounds of what he could reveal out of fear of getting killed (by the government) and what good would that do. So he kept a lid on it, he kept a lot of it quiet until later in his life.\u0027So the man I knew wasn\u0027t a whack job, he wasn\u0027t hallucinating and he wasn\u0027t making things up to gain attention, that wasn\u0027t him.\u0027He truly believed in what he saw and he tried to tell it in such a way to make people believe it and he knew because of his background in NASA as a rocket scientist that he was more credible than most.\u0027Nevertheless, Cooper was often discredited for expressing his beliefs on extra-terrestrial activity, but Miklos added: \u0027As serious as I\u0027m talking here right now with a clear mind to you, that\u0027s who he was.\u0027He was an honest, straight forward inidual who only wanted to investigate and explore the possibilities of the unknown, even if it meant risking his professional career.\u0027The next episode of Cooper\u0027s Treasure airs this Friday on the Discovery Channel at 9pm (PST) "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/08/07/15/4EE2DBFA00000578-0-image-a-2_1533652169006.jpg","title":"My life Moonie Former member Unification Church recounts life cult new book","story":"    The Unification Church - whose members were dubbed Moonies by US media in 1974 - began in Korea 20 years earlier leader Rev. Sun Myung Moon claimed that Jesus had come to him in a vision, and Moon and his wife were the True Parents of humanity tasked with bringing the Kingdom of Heaven to Earth. The emphasis on family was behind his encouragement of mass marriages, such as the 1982 event in Madison Square Garden pictured above. In attendance was Church member Lisa Kohn, whose mother was marrying a man she barely knew the day is described in Lisa\u0027s new book, To the Moon and Back: A Childhood Under The Influence          Lisa, left, first learned of the cult after her mother, Mimi, center, attended a lecture by Moon in 1974, three years after he\u0027d moved to the US. She joined the Church and was followed by Lisa and her older brother, Robbie, right, though Mimi left the children in the care of relatives to move to Church centers and become more fully involved with the Moonies      Moon and his wife, Hak Ja Han, were completely revered by members Lisa recounts a story in her book of having a meal in the same room as Moon and \u0027you couldn’t eat. You were so beyond lucky to be in that room and have him look at you, and you didn’t know how to act. He’s the son of God, and you’re just you’          While Moon was at the very center of the Church, members sent out on recruitment missions took care not to initially mention his name or the word Moonies as they tried to draw people in the public was highly suspicious of the Church and its teachings, and it was not uncommon for families to hire people to kidnap loved ones who\u0027d joined and \u0027deprogram\u0027 them          Lisa, left, was an enthusiastic member of the Church and followed around its popular band, Sunburst, helping them set up and break down shows and idolizing the older members she was so entrenched in the Church that she was wracked with guilt and confusion when she finally realized she had to leave          Lisa and her brother - pictured with their mother Mimi in a passport photo - were sent to live with their volatile father, Danny, after Mimi left them for the Church they happily visited Moonie centers on weekends from their grimy home in New York City\u0027s East Village and considered the Church something of \u0027a haven,\u0027 Lisa says      Korean woman suffocates after spending the night in an...Rusting statue of Soviet dictator Josef Stalin is found at...Who was Sharon Tate?

Moon\u0027s death in 2012 at the age of 92, his body was placed in a large hillside museum at the Church\u0027s estate in Gapyeong east of Seoul, pictured above          The Church splintered into different groups following Moon’s death his widow has come to be called the co-Messiah by many followers and founded the Women’s Federation for World Peace International. His oldest living son, Hyun Jin Preston Moon, leads the Family Peace Association and is pictured above at a ceremony earlier this year. Moon\u0027s youngest, Hyung Jin Moon, started Sanctuary Church, which continues to this day          Following Moon\u0027s death, his widow Hak Ja Han followed in his footsteps and continued arranging mass marriages, such as the one pictured above in South Korea, where 15,000 couples arranged or renewed marriage vows in the ChurchLisa’s mother eventually left the cult, too, following the birth of Lisa’s first child she and Mimi – who lives in New Jersey – now have a ‘guarded’ relationship, she tells DailyMail.com. Lisa’s not totally sure why her mother left or what she still believes, and the pair rarely go into great depth about, given the related issues surrounding the cult and their historically complex family dynamic.‘One time she said, “I couldn’t even be a Moonie well,”’ Lisa says. ‘She has said she still believed – I don’t know if it’s “believe” or “believed” … in the teachings, in the truth.‘The hypocrisy of the leadership and what people did with it, she could not follow any more … arbitrary rules and power and who’s more equal than other people, and the things that happen when people jockey for power.’Lisa adds: ‘When pushed, my mom’ll say about leaving … She’ll say: “It’s what I knew I had to do at the time.” So I don’t think that she regrets her time in it I do thinks he regrets not being with us.”’She says that her father, for all his flaws, had always been frustrated by his children’s involvement in the cult, though he tried to let them lead their own lives – and Lisa adds that ‘he does think the worst thing he ever did was leave us with my mom.’Danny had a stroke more than a decade ago and remains in a care facility, with damage that Lisa says means he will never read the book – ‘which is wonderful, because he would not be okay reading it,’ she says.Her mother, however, has been a huge supporter of the project, Mimi says. ‘She’s my biggest fan, even though she’s terrified of what it’ll do to her,’ Lisa tells DailyMail.com.And Lisa’s own reasons for writing the book, she says, were to give other people hope. She says she wants her story to be uplifting and inspire others, not just because she left the Church but because she also survived such a turbulent home life.‘There isn’t really any reason I should be as happy and functional as I am,’ she says. ‘What happened to me, I shouldn’t be okay, and I am – and so I really hope that people realize that there’s hope, that there’s always hope, that our lives can be good, that you can rise out of any situation, that there’s a way to live with intention and joy and it’s possible.’She adds: ‘The results of that childhood on me and on my psyche and my emotional state, the things I did and how I felt and stuff and what I did to myself, is too common. It’s universal. So I hope that someone who feels like, “I am so damaged … that there’s no way I’ll ever be okay or anyone will ever love me or I’ll ever be happy,” will be like: “Wow, she’s okay, maybe I can be okay, too.”’She’s also happy to add a few words of caution for anyone who might be susceptible to the recruitment tactics of cults or similarly damaging groups – warning against ‘anyone or anything who claims to have the truth. I don’t there there’s a truth.’‘Anyone or anything who passionately, fervently tells you, “this is the truth and this is the way” … there are religious cults now, there are political cults now. I think some of our political situation is kind of cultish now. There’s self-help cults now, they’re all here …‘So as soon as someone says, “This is the way, and spend lots of time and potentially lots of money with us” … Anybody who tells you, ‘We know better than you or what’s right for you” (and one could argue many religions do that) but the ones that do it in a very strong, intoxicating way: Again, I say there’s nothing more intoxicating than knowing you have “the truth.” That is why people fly planes into buildings.’All these years later, however, Lisa says that she’s almost always met with shock when people find out about her close association with the Moonies during her youth.‘It invariably blows people’s minds, because I quote-unquote look so normal,’ she laughs. ‘And I don’t actually look that normal and I’m not actually that normal … but I am way more functional and have a wonderful marriage, two happy kids. I have a white picket fence now in front of our house!’ To the Moon and Back: A Childhood Under the Influence - Kindle edition by Lisa Kohn.

If Liz Truss is saying the opposite then she is out of kilter with me.\u0027Weeks before the successful appeal, Miss Truss used the case to underline her commitment to liberalising planning laws at a housing conference in London.She told delegates: \u0027We have to support new development. Even if it is on the field that our house personally overlooks.\u0027          Liz Trusswarned that the Tories needed to allow homes to go up on undeveloped land – or face frustrated voters unable to get on the property ladder handing power to Jeremy CorbynThe other development, which was blocked in June, was for 19 two or three-bedroom homes in a former paddock.One resident said developers had been \u0027licking their lips at the prospect of cramming it with as many houses as possible\u0027.Last year Miss Truss notified King\u0027s Lynn and West Norfolk Council of her intention to build a ground floor extension at her home, which is now worth £250,000.Neighbours said the couple had not begun work on the extension.The former environment secretary\u0027s controversial comments came a day after the Campaign to Protect Rural England published a report that revealed almost 460,000 homes have been approved for green belt land since 2013.Miss Truss\u0027s Conservative colleagues have warned against any softening of green belt protection.Former minister Crispin Blunt predicted electoral \u0027catastrophe\u0027 if the green lungs are not protected.Shadow housing minister Sarah Jones said: \u0027Everyone knows someone affected by the housing crisis but, after eight years of failure, it\u0027s clear the Conservatives haven\u0027t got a clue what to do about it.\u0027A spokesman for Miss Truss said: \u0027Liz respects the vast range of views of all of her constituents.\u0027"},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/08/08/08/0564FDED000007D0-5937713-image-a-1_1533714185193.jpg","title":"Tenants left property junk room FINALLY evicted year","story":"    Stacks of clothes and boxes litter the house in Bootle, Merseyside.

Rubbish coats the floor of the house which was inhabited by a family with four children. Problems started after their housing benefit was reduced in July 2017          In the kitchen there are even half eaten bowls of cereal, the milk has been left out on the counter and there are dishes piled up in the sinkProblems started when the amount of housing benefit they were receiving dropped from £621 to just £140 in July 2017.Homesure says it was forced to serve notice on the property as soon as it became apparent that the tenant refused to make any payments towards the rent themselves.Homesure said that after notice was served, it was refused access to the property over the course of six arranged inspections - and the locks on the house were changed.The family eventually moved out on August 2 after a bailiff appointment was arranged          There are piles of laundry all over the kitchen, dishes piled up in the sink and breakfast cereal and other foods left on the counterA spokesman for Homesure said: \u0027We applied for possession 10 months prior to this, but due to complications with the court we did not reach a bailiff date until then.\u0027Homesure received an apology from the courts in Liverpool who agreed that an administrative error had led to further delays in processing the claim.Homesure\u0027s managing director, Nicholas Stott said this was a sad situation that is becoming \u0027all too common\u0027 in the private rented sector.He said: \u0027A raft of legislative changes, including changes to the way housing benefit is paid and calculated, as well as taxation, makes owning residential property a liability rather than an asset in the most vulnerable sections of our society.Thousands of fish engulf er in mesmerizing attempt to...Share this article\u0027It is important to remember that, if private landlords didn\u0027t own properties in certain areas, then there simply wouldn\u0027t be any housing stock available.\u0027If a private landlord is willing to provide safe, secure, and licensed housing in areas where there is demand from those entitled to housing benefit, and there is no alternative place for them to live, then those landlords should be helped, not hindered, by the housing structures in place.\u0027          The black two seater sofa has been left and has the jet black TV stand.

To truly improve the private rented sector needs co-operation, not distance, between the local authorities and landlords.\u0027\u0027At the same time that County Court resources have been cut, the fees for evicting tenants in breach of contract and failing to give up possession of their property have increased. This means that landlords have to pay out even more in costs to evict tenants who aren\u0027t paying their rent, so this money is having to come from alternate sources.\u0027\u0027It is a common misconception that all landlords can simply increase rents to cover additional costs. Those landlords with tenants in receipt of housing benefit cannot do this, as the benefit entitlement does not change according to a landlord\u0027s increased costs.\u0027          In the main bedroom the bed and mattress have been left and the floor is filled with boxes and clothesHomesure looks after a number of landlords who are attempting to \u0027keep up\u0027 with changes in the law as they quickly come into force.He said: \u0027If Homesure hadn\u0027t have been willing to help this landlord for free, he would\u0027ve quickly have become yet another landlord trapped within the contradictory legislative policies, should he have tried to do it on his own.\u0027We need local and national authorities to work with us to create a fair, secure, \u0026amp healthy housing scheme in Sefton and the wider Liverpool area.\u0027Responding, a spokesman for Sefton Council said: \u0027After assisting in finding a tenancy for this property, we issued a bond to Homesure acting as guarantor for the new tenant from December 2015-June 2016.\u0027After that date the bond was not renewed by Homesure, which ultimately ended our involvement in this property.\u0027Payment of rent is a matter between landlord and tenant, even where the tenant may be entitled to welfare benefits to help pay it.\u0027If the personal circumstances of a private tenant change, it is still their responsibility to pay their rent.\u0027Help and advice is available from us for anyone who has difficulty in paying rent or any housing issues.\u0027"},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/08/07/17/4EE4726E00000578-0-image-m-26_1533661165499.jpg","title":"Pictured Briton 26 stranded Dubai caught speeding 33 times","story":"Farah Hashi (pictured), from Newport in South Wales, is stranded in the United Arab Emirates city because he cannot afford to pay and does not have access to his passport, his family have told MailOnline          All of the speeding offences took place between 2.30am and 6am on July 31 when the road was mostly deserted.

Saeed Ali Rent a Car says Hashi (shown in his passport photo) left his passport as a guarantee for using the £260,000 supercar Under Dubai law it is the owner of the vehicle who is penalised for speeding rather than the driver.Faris Iqbal, owner of the car rental agency, told MailOnline he has begun civil proceedings against Hashi that will prevent him from leaving Dubai.He said: \u0027I have spent the day in court and have started civil proceedings to recover the money that is owed by the speeding.\u0027It is our car, but we are not responsible for the fines that have accumulated. We have tried talking with Mr Hashi but he has not responded. The matter is now with the courts. I do not understand why he would do this.\u0027Mr Iqbal said by starting court proceedings it is unlikely Hashi will be allowed to leave Dubai until the fine is paid.Hashi could also face a prison sentence if the court finds in favour of the rental car agency and he is unable to pay the money owed.Hashi was due to leave Dubai today but without his passport will be marooned in the city.\u0027I still have his passport so he will not be leaving,\u0027 he added.

However, speaking to MailOnline, Farah\u0027s brother Adman claimed the firm came to the Briton\u0027s hotel to demand he hand over the passport and called the fine \u0027ridiculous\u0027Iqbal said he had never had a client run up such a large amount in speeding fines from hiring one of his luxury sports cars.Hashi is said to have triggered every speed camera on the Sheikh Hashid road reaching a top speed of about 143mph. Twelve of the fines were imposed for exceeding 124mph and were seconds apart.Going over Dubai\u0027s 80kmh (50mph) limit results in a 3,000 dirham (£600) fine.Iqbal said the Lamborghini\u0027s on board computer alerted him to the excessive speed and he sent a text message to Hashi warning him about the cameras.He said they were ignored and Hashi continued to speed along the road triggering roadside cameras that took a photo of the number plate.\u0027I\u0027d warned him that there are cameras everywhere in Dubai and that he\u0027d be liable for the fines\u0027, he said.          The tourist sped his rented Lamborghini Huracán on Sheikh Zayed Road (pictured)Iqbal went to his local police station when he realised how many cameras had been triggered.He knew as owner of the car he would be liable to pay the fines and attempted to have police block Hashi from leaving the country.Iqbal said he was unable to get an order banning the British tourist from leaving and feared he might go to the British Embassy to get a new passport.By beginning legal action Hashi will not be allowed to leave even if the passport is returned and the sports car retrieved from outside the hotel.Hashi was unavailable for comment."},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/08/05/01/4ED66D1B00000578-0-image-m-47_1533427260847.jpg","title":"Exiled Venezuelan opposition leader calls assassination bid President Maduro staged farce","story":"    Hitting back: Venezuelan opposition leader Julio Borges has called the alleged assassination attempt of Nicolas Maduro a \u0027staged farce\u0027 after the President blamed himNo evidence was given to support the allegations, which have worsened already fraught ties between Caracas and Bogota. In addition, details of Saturday\u0027s incident remain unclear, with conflicting information coming from various sources about whether or not it truly was an attack on the president\u0027s life.Share this articleBorges hit back on Tuesday night, calling the attack a staged \u0027farce.\u0027\u0027Neither the country nor the world believe you when it comes to this farce of an attack, we all know that it was staged to persecute and repress those of us who oppose your dictatorship,\u0027 he wrote on Twitter.The president said several raids were underway as part of investigations.Borges is one of the most prominent figures of the Venezuelan opposition and like Requesens is a member of the Primero Justicia (Justice First) party of former presidential candidate Henrique Capriles.

The England cricketer is accused of knocking out Ryan Hale (left), 27 and Ryan Ali (right), 28Nicholas Corsellis, prosecuting, asked: \u0027Do you see Ryan Hale put that implement down before he gets to the group?\u0027 The officer replied: \u0027No.\u0027Cameras belonging to Bristol City Council captured some of the aftermath of the alleged incident with police officers and an ambulance arriving at the scene.Hale places his T-shirt under the head of Ali, who is lying on the ground, while off-duty special constable Mark Spure arrived.Meanwhile, Stokes has been arrested and is sitting in the rear of a police car.Mr Hales is with one of the attending police officers before making a telephone call and heading towards a taxi rank to get a taxi.  Earlier, the jury watched CCTV taken from outside the Lola Lo club in Bristol on September 25 last year, which shows Ali and Hale, with bottles of beer in their hands, walking up the road with gay revellers Kai Barry and William O\u0027Connor.          Stokes and teammate Alex Hales were together (pictured on the night) after celebrating with the England cricket team, who had just beaten the West Indies in a one-day internationalStokes and Hales are seen catching up with them and overtaking them and then, the prosecution claim, Stokes can be seen turning to look back at Mr Barry and Ali.Detective Constable Adams said: \u0027Ryan Ali and Kai Barry appear to be having a disagreement. Mr Barry grabs Mr Ali around the groin area.\u0027The CCTV shows Mr Barry walk away from Ali but then return. DC Adams said: \u0027Mr Barry appears to link arms with Mr Ali and is shrugged off and pushed away.\u0027Further CCTV from the Be At One bar was played to the court, which showed Stokes and Mr Hales in shot and then Ali, Hale, Mr O\u0027Connor and Mr Barry coming into view.The camera later records the police and an ambulance arriving at the scene. The jury then watched CCTV taken from the nearby NatWest Bank.Detective Constable Adams told the jury: \u0027Alex Hales crosses the road towards the direction of Natwest in the direction of STA Travel.\u0027Ben Stokes is crossing the road from the same direction and meets Mr Hales. They are both looking back up Queen\u0027s Road in the direction of Be At One and Lola Lo. Ben Stokes is smoking.\u0027        Stokes starred in the cricket last week (pictured) as England beat India at Edgbaston\u0027He got a bit verbally abusive towards myself. He mentioned my gold teeth and he said I looked like a **** and I replied, \u0027Thank you very much\u0027. \u0027I said they could call me what they liked, it still wouldn\u0027t change the fact they weren\u0027t getting in. They could swear, shout – I wouldn\u0027t rise to it.\u0027He mentioned my tattoos and how s*** they were. He just looked at me and told me my tattoos were s*** and to look at my job, which he obviously wasn\u0027t happy about for keeping him out.\u0027When asked what sort of tone Stokes was using, Mr Cunningham replied: \u0027Quite a spiteful tone, quite an angry tone.\u0027 Stokes, 27, faces a single count of affray. He is standing trial alongside Hale, 27, and Ali, 28 – two men he allegedly knocked out in a brawl near the club.Prosecutors allege trouble flared after England and Durham star Stokes and Mr Hales caught up with Ali, Hale, Mr O\u0027Connor and Mr Barry on a nearby street. The cricketer is accused of knocking out Hale and Ali. Ali allegedly threatened Mr Hales with a bottle, with Hale said to have picked up a metal pole from a street sign.Stokes claims he was acting in self-defence and took action after Ali and Hale were homophobic towards Mr Barry and Mr O\u0027Connor. But Nicholas Corsellis, prosecuting, said Stokes was instead acting with \u0027revenge, retaliation or punishment in mind\u0027.The jury also heard allegations that Mr Hales kicked the prostrate Ali in the head. Mr Hales was not arrested but interviewed under caution in connection with the fight. He was never charged.The Nottinghamshire batsman, 29, had been credited by the prosecution with trying to calm the fight. But when the jury were shown footage of the incident by Detective Constable Daniel Adams, Hale\u0027s barrister Stephen Mooney asked him: \u0027What I am going to suggest you see here is Alex Hales stamping down upon Ryan Ali at least twice. Does that accord with what you see?\u0027DC Adams replied: \u0027Yes, a stamp or a kick.\u0027 Mr Mooney said: \u0027We have someone lying on the floor, Ryan Ali, and just above him, moving towards him is Mr Alex Hales. Would it be fair to describe that as Alex Hales kicking the man in the head?\u0027DC Adams replied: \u0027That\u0027s what it looks like, yes.\u0027 Mr Mooney said: \u0027Well, it isn\u0027t what it looks like – it\u0027s what it is.\u0027 DC Adams replied: \u0027Yes.\u0027Mr Mooney said: \u0027Ryan Hale has just been in a situation with Mr Stokes and Mr Ali. \u0027At the same time, Mr Hales has come in and used deliberate force with a shod foot, stamping down upon Ryan Ali to his body, then kicking him deliberately and in a considered fashion to his head? DC Adams replied: \u0027He has definitely used his feet on three occasions.\u0027Stokes, of Castle Eden, County Durham, and Ali and Hale, both of Bristol, all deny affray.

It has reported a jump in refusals over the last few years.This year, about a dozen iniduals had gone through an extremely difficult process to obtain a visa, Barley said. They were from Middle East and African countries, with one author from Belarus, and had had their applications refused at least once.Several applications remained outstanding, despite some authors being due to appear at the festival in less than a week.Barley’s comments echo that of Peter Gabriel, the Womad festival founder, who last week criticised UK foreign policy when at least three musical acts found they could not perform due to visa complications. “Do we really want a white-breaded Brexited flatland?” Gabriel said. “A country that is losing the will to welcome the world?”According to Barley, the dozen authors were asked to provide three years’ worth of bank statements to demonstrate financial independence, despite being paid to participate in the Edinburgh book festival, and having publishers and the festival guaranteeing to cover their costs while in the UK. Barley said any deposits that could not be easily explained were used as grounds to deny the authors’ visas one had to reapply three times due to her bank statements.“It is Kafkaesque. One was told he had too much money and it looked suspicious for a short trip. Another was told she didn’t have enough, so she transferred £500 into the account – and then was told that £500 looked suspicious. It shouldn’t be the case that thousands of pounds should be spent to fulfil a legitimate visa request. I believe this is happening to many arts organisations around the country, and we need to find a way around it.”Barley called the situation humiliating, adding: “One author had to give his birth certificate, marriage certificate, his daughter’s birth certificate and then go for biometric testing. He wanted to back out at that point because he couldn’t bear it, but we asked him to continue. Our relationship with authors is being damaged because the system is completely unfit for purpose. They’ve jumped through hoops – to have their applications refused.”A permit-free festival visitor visa is available to artists appearing at 45 approved cultural events, including Womad and the Edinburgh Fringe, which means they do not require a certificate of sponsorship and only have to show bank balances for three months. However, the book festival is not on the list. Barley said that while the festival could apply to be added to the permit-free list, he hoped other festivals across the UK would come together to campaign for a new system.“I think this is an honest mistake the UK government has made as a result of their immigration policy, which is making problems for artists, musicians and performers. We need to create a kind of cultural passport that allows people to attend festivals, gigs and shows. If we don’t, we’re putting culture in the UK at risk,” he said. “I am calling on the British government, the Scottish government and cultural institutions like Womad: work with us, let’s try and find a solution.”Deidre Brock, MP for Edinburgh North and Leith, who has been working on inidual cases with international acts for multiple Edinburgh festivals including the book event, has raised the issue in parliament. She said her office had seen growing delays and rejections for artists and organisers, particularly from the Middle East.“My fear is that many will simply choose not to try any more, and we’ll all be poorer for it. Edinburgh’s festivals will be damaged by London’s ‘hostile environment’ attitude to visas,” she said. “Home Office bureaucrats say performers won’t go home to their friends, families and jobs after the festival, despite no evidence that this has ever been an issue. You have to ask why they think highly acclaimed artists would throw away their careers and leave their family and friends to live as illegal immigrants. Edinburgh urgently needs the UK government to rethink its visa policies and help make sure its festivals remain a fantastic global showcase of the arts and of Scotland’s international appeal.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c6e83eceba8ed90756f1f481ec22d463c4f7c880/0_130_5100_3060/master/5100.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b090c3bc2706cb2a340fa293f9e9f109","title":"homebase set to announce closure of up to 80 stores","story":"Loss-making DIY chain, sold to restructuring experts for £1, has already shut 17 storesHomebase is preparing to announce the closure of up to 80 stores next week, with the probable loss of about 1,000 jobs.The loss-making DIY chain, which was bought by the restructuring experts Hilco in a deal agreed in May, is expected to file a company voluntary arrangement (CVA), a form of insolvency that enables a retailer to exit or alter deals with landlords. The process is expected to be handled by Alvarez \u0026amp Marsal, a specialist adviser on corporate insolvencies that advised Toys R Us on a CVA before the it collapsed this year.The company has already shut 17 unprofitable stores and confirmed plans to close at least 23 more. Industry insiders said the 23 would be part of a CVA involving between 60 and 80 stores in total.Homebase was bought by Hilco, the owner of HMV, for £1 in a deal agreed in May after its previous Australian owner, Wesfarmers, pulled the plug on its UK venture. The botched Australian acquisition of Homebase is considered one of the most disastrous retail takeovers, alongside Tesco’s doomed expansion into the US with its Fresh \u0026amp Easy grocery chain.Wesfarmers, which bought the business for £340m two years ago, offloaded the entire Homebase chain of 250 stores, with a workforce of just over 11,000 people, ditching a plan to convert them to its Bunnings brand.On top of Wesfarmers’ catalogue of errors, Homebase is battling to survive in a tough DIY sector hit by a slowdown in the housing market and a squeeze on consumer spending. Traditional chains are also under pressure from online specialists such as Victoria Plum and of discount stores such as Home Bargains, B\u0026ampM Stores and Aldi, which sells tools, wallpaper and gardening accessories in its bargain aisles.Since the rescue by Hilco, Homebase has cut 300 jobs at its Milton Keynes head office and horticultural buying office in Swindon. Several of the 24 stores that had been converted to Bunnings outlets, including those in Folkestone and Frome, have been switched back to the Homebase brand.At least four other major retail chains – House of Fraser, New Look, Carpetright and Mothercare – turned to CVAs to jettison unwanted outlets this year. Restaurant groups such as Carluccio’s, the Prezzo group, Byron and Jamie’s Italian have done the same.Landlords have expressed anger at the growing use of CVAs, with the British Property Federation calling for an urgent government review, saying the process is being misused. Melanie Leech, the chief executive of the BPF, said: “CVAs should not be entered into lightly as they impact jobs, local communities and property owners and the pensioners’ savings that they invest. We advise any insolvency practitioner, representing a business seeking to enter into a CVA, to engage in confidence with the British Property Federation’s insolvency committee as early as possible in the process. Homebase’s team has not yet done this, but this best practice would allow for constructive engagement, to aim to ensure greater transparency and fairness.” A group of landlords also launched a legal challenge against House of Fraser’s CVA but settled out of court at the weekend. The department store is in last-ditch talks about refinancing with a number of parties after C.banner, the Chinese owner of Hamleys, withdrew plans to invest £70m in the business. The group is expected to fall into administration as it struggles to fund payments to suppliers and rent bills due in coming weeks.Frasers in Edinburgh will be the first of 31 House of Fraser stores to close after the landlord agreed to take back the keys next month.The ailing department store chain is in last-ditch rescue talks after C.banner, the Chinese owner of Hamleys, withdrew plans to invest £70m as part of a restructure involving the closure of 31 of House of Fraser’s 59 stores.The group is facing administration as it struggles to fund pay suppliers and rent due in coming weeks.The 71,500sq ft store on Princes Street, which House of Fraser took over in 1953, is expected to be redeveloped as a hotel or offices.Landlord Parabola, which recently bought the site for more than £13.5m, is also behind the Edinburgh Park development that includes offices, homes and a park.The Princes Street site has been occupied by a department store since 1894 when Robert Maule \u0026amp Sons converted a building which began life as the Osborne Hotel. H Binns \u0026amp Son demolished the original building in 1931, creating the store that exists today."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5decaf8f31e87c9e26547d12315407c9659841dd/0_295_4331_2598/master/4331.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=222e20aa5c90eeced1610cc3462365e6","title":"ryanair cancels 250 german flights due to pilots strike","story":"Passengers affected by Friday cancellations offered refund or another route, airline saysRyanair is cancelling hundreds of flights to and from Germany on Friday because of a strike by pilots.The airline said it had notified passengers affected by the cancellation of 250 flights, offering them a refund or another route.Ryanair pilots in Sweden, Belgium and Ireland had already voted to stage a 24-hour strike on Friday, leading to the cancellation of 22 flights to or from Sweden, 104 to or from Belgium, and 20 to or from Ireland.

That trait has led to both reforms (allowing women to drive) and a crackdown on those advocating them (arresting women who campaigned for the right). When Ottawa responded by calling for the immediate release of peaceful activists, including Samar Badawi, who has family in Canada, Riyadh lashed out at what it called reprehensible interference in its internal affairs. It expelled the Canadian ambassador, cancelled flights to Canada, froze new trade and investment, and is reportedly selling Canadian assets. Some measures – withdrawing students, and transferring home patients currently undergoing treatment – seem more damaging to those Saudi citizens than their hosts.This absurd overreaction reflects the bullishness of the man who led the charge to war in Yemen and the blockade which has failed to bring Qatar to its knees as planned. But he has surely been emboldened by Donald\u0026nbspTrump’s embrace, and the US president’s own\u0026nbspattacks on Canada. It was little surprise when the state department said it would stay out of this row more disappointing is the reticence of others.

It is in European countries’ own interests to stand together and tell the crown prince that such actions are not cost-free for Saudi Arabia. Like his anti-corruption coup, they are unlikely to reassure potential partners and his mission to modernise the kingdom will require foreign support."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c2c4d097d1653f102e6c49da0ddb74c82e6e7d94/0_371_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=327194003aae6b39b733ec3965da7188","title":"the guardian view on shahidul alam bangladesh should let him go","story":"The work of renowned photographer and social activist Shahidul Alam has appeared in publications worldwide, including the .

As Mr Alam observed, demonstrations initially about road safety were fuelled by anger over issues including corruption and gagging of the media by the ruling Awami League. The resulting crackdown has seen police use teargas and rubber bullets on the streets – and the notorious section 57 of the information and communication technology act against Mr Alam.

Don’t consider the routes prescriptive – they are merely an introduction to the possibilities for cycling in different parts of the UK. Use them as a basis for your own exploration of nine parts of the country, each offering a unique day’s cycling.Full English: the Chiltern Hills, BuckinghamshireDistance: 37 milesDifficulty: 610Start and finish: Princes RisboroughNearest station: Princes Risborough“England’s green and pleasant land” perfectly describes the Chilterns. Broad-leaf woods overhang deep seductive lanes that wriggle around and over these chalky hills. Red kites rule the sky, and cricket is played on village greens. The Chilterns are commuter country now, but still charming, and still very English.Head for Chinnor on the north-west edge of the hills, then ride towards them to pick up a cycle-way going south-west to Watlingon, where you leave the trail. Climb Watlington Hill, then go through Christmas Common and Turville Heath take a pitstop at the Barn cafe at Turville Heath Farm, which is excellent. Continue to Marlow, then head north-west along the B482, leaving at Stokenchurch, and go north through the lanes to Princes Risborough.The most unexpected: Dengie Peninsula, EssexDistance: 24 milesDifficulty: 410 (810 if it’s windy)Start and finish: Burnham-on-CrouchNearest station: Burnham-on-CrouchSqueezed between two rivers, just 24 crow-flying miles from the centre of London, there’s a time capsule called the Dengie Peninsula. For a basic loop, follow the B1021 north towards Bradwell, go left after Tillingham through Maylandsea and Latchington, then follow the B1010 back to Burnham-on-Crouch. You ride through rosy brick and painted clapboard villages, past a patchwork quilt of fields. There are little loops you could add, such as visiting Dengie Marshes where you might glimpse a rare hen harrier. It’s so quiet, so peaceful, it’s like riding through the 1950s. Distance: 45 milesDifficulty: 810Start and Finish: BodminNearest station: Bodmin Parkway A ride of stunning sea views with a taste of wild moorland. Follow the Camel Trail from Bodmin to Wadebridge, leaving at the old bridge for Port Isaac, a beautiful Cornish fishing village and location for TV’s Doc Martin.  Continue north on the clifftop road, then join the B-road to Delabole, where you turn left and descend to Trebarwith Strand and its gorgeous beach. Continue north through Tintagel, for an unmissable mid-ride snack at Pengenna Pasties. Then it’s on to Boscastle, where you head inland through Camelford to St Tudy. Go left just outside St Tudy, to experience Bodmin Moor and its villages, before picking up the Camel Trail back to Bodmin. Best urban ride: the Taff Trail, CardiffDistance: 32 milesDifficulty: 510Start and finish: Cardiff BayNearest station: Cardiff Central “We’ve had it done up,” the Welsh comedian Rhod Gilbert says when describing Cardiff. And it has been done up, especially the waterfront of Cardiff Bay, where this ride starts. It’s a glorious place to pootle around on a bike. There are plenty of cafes to choose from – but save them for later, when you get back.  The Taff Trail mixes cycle-ways with quiet roads and is well signposted. This ride is 32 miles there and back to Pontypridd, but you can go on to Abercynon in the Rhondda or even do the whole 55-mile-long Taff Trail and reach the Brecon Beacons. The cycle-way sections are ideal for family rides.Best rite of passage ride: the Strines, SheffieldDistance: 22 milesDifficulty: 810Start and finish: LangsettNearest station: Penistone The Strines is 11 miles of unclassified road on the eastern edge of the Peak District, running from Langsett on the A616 to Moscar Fields on the A57. It’s brutal the road plunges into and out of three steep-sided valleys, with plenty of undulations and exposed moorland in between. Head south from Langsett, keeping right at all junctions, to the A57. Turn around and ride back. The Strines both ways is a local rite of passage, and the hills form part of many local training rides. There are six big climbs if you go both ways, ranging between a third and a half a mile long. Oh, and there’s the Bank View cafe in Langsett. It’s very special. Best cafe ride: Selby, West YorkshireDistance: 24 milesDifficulty: 510Start and finish: SelbyNearest station: Selby A pleasant ride through quiet lanes with a cafe stop about halfway. Start at Selby Abbey (fact: the Rt Rev Dr John Thompson is actually known as the Biking Bishop of Selby), find the B1223 and go north then west to Sherburn in Elmet. Elmet was an ancient British kingdom covering much of what is now West Yorkshire. From Sherburn go south to Hillam then Birkin for the cafe, the Birkin Fisheries Tea Room, which stands in its own grounds – there’s a lake, the food is delicious and the service always smiling. Once re-fuelled, head east to West Haddlesey, then north to Gateforth and on, north-east, to Selby.  Distance: 35 milesDifficulty: 910Start and finish: UlphaNearest station: Broughton in Furness Two of the steepest road climbs in the UK – plus others, long and short – give this ride a total altitude gain of 1,800 metres. The first seven and a half miles from Ulpha to Cockley Beck has only one climb, then you are at the foot of Wrynose heading east with the pass before you. Engage your lowest gear and haul yourself over – there’s no way of finessing it.  Descend to Little Langdale, climb over to Great Langdale. Go right in Elterwater, right at the next junction for Wrynose, then clamber over Hardknott Pass. Continue to Eskdale Green and turn left for the long slog over Birker Fell and back to Ulpha. This ride hurts – but the satisfaction of doing it lasts a lot longer than the pain it causes.The quietest: the Cheviot Hills, NorthumberlandDistance: 47 milesDifficulty: 710Start and finish: RothburyNearest station: Alnmouth (for a regular service) Rothbury is a country town like country towns used to be – gentle and homely, where people enquire about a person’s health and actually want to know the answer. The ride is out and back, mostly uphill out and downhill coming back, tracing the River Coquet almost to its source.  Follow the B6341 west from Rothbury. Take the first right after Hepple then keep left all the way to the end of the road, where if you stop for a moment you will probably hear no other evidence of human life but the sound of your own breath. Refuelling at the Barrowburn Tea Room near the turnaround point is highly recommended.The wildest: Ardgour and Moidart, west HighlandsDistance: 81 milesDifficulty: 810Start and finish: Fort WilliamNearest station: Fort William I saved the best till last. Any ride with a ferry crossing starts ticking wild boxes for me, but this gets a lot wilder. It’s mostly on main roads, but they will be the quietest main roads you’ll ever ride. The busiest, the A82, is first, going south-west from Fort William to the Corran Ferry Terminal. Marvel at the mountains as you cross Loch Linnhe. Then it’s on the A861 west through glens, alongside salty sea lochs, over the tip toes of mountains, around the Sound of Arisaig, where the Isles of Rum, Eigg and Muck are grey-green jewels in a sea setting. Finally you’ll head back to Fort William, and in fine weather the whole of Ben Nevis can be seen. Ready to hit the road? Why not make it count?

From the lingo to the Lycra, these essential tips will have you pedalling prettyHow to avoid saddle sores All you need is a good pair of cycling shorts: don’t worry about underwear. “Also, use a good lubricant like chamois cream,” says Phil Burt, former head physiotherapist at British Cycling and founder of Phil Burt Innovation. “Avoid sores completely by asking an expert to check your saddle is positioned correctly.”The best way to ride into the wind If you’re in a group, make the most of drafting and taking turns going at the front. “If you’re alone, keep your head and body low on the bike and maintain a steady effort level,” says former pro cyclist Yanto Barker, who runs clothing brand Le Col. Where to ride on the roadNever. Hug. The. Kerb. “Try to default to riding about a third of the way into your lane, a metre from the gutter,” says British Cycling’s Nick Chamberlin. “Ensure you always look behind you before changing road position.”How to draft like a proDrafting takes practice, according to Barker. “Establish where the wind is coming from and ensure the person in front of you is protecting you,” he says. “Ride as close as possible and don’t overuse your brakes to reduce unnecessary exertions catching up.” How to avoid bonkingBonking: see “running on empty” or “hitting a wall”. Preparation is key to preventing running out of energy on a long ride, so load up on carbs the day before. “Take water and an electrolyte drink on the ride,” says Prof Don Maclaren, head nutritionist at The Nutrition X Consultancy, “plus snacks such as dried fruit or malt loaf and an energy gel for a quick fix.” The best stretchesYou’re in the same position for a long time, so stretching or foam rolling is essential. “I would target hip flexors, IT bands, glutes and lats,” says Burt. “Stretch out your chest too, and do it all within an hour of cycling.” What will make you faster To up your fitness, five one-hour rides a week is better than one long ride. Barker recommends this routine, along with your normal rides: “Aim for six 15-second sprints. Start in an easy gear at 10mph, then sprint really hard and don’t change gear. Repeat six times, with five minutes of steady cycling in between.” How to hydrateAvoiding sugary drinks is wise at the best of times – but especially on long rides as they can cause dehydration. How you hydrate also depends on the temperature and humidity and, of course, the distance you are riding. “If it’s a 15-mile ride, water should be enough, but an electrolyte drink would be useful,” says Maclaren. It also goes without saying that making sure you have more than one bidon (water bottle) pays idends on longer rides, particularly in the countryside – you never know when or where you’ll next get the chance to fill up. What to say in a bike shopDon’t ever blag it. “If you don’t know what something is – there are many unknown unknowns in bike shops – proclaim ignorance,” says cycling commentator and comedian Ned Boulting. “Never casually mention nuggets of inadequate knowledge, as you’ll be considered an expert, and inundated with unknown unknowns. This will prove costly.”Now you’re feeling confident on two wheels, why not make it count?

You ride to work. So you already know that getting on your bike can do wonders for your body and mind. And then there’s the naturally uplifting effect of avoiding congested train carriages or bumper-to-bumper traffic. Add to that smug wellbeing bike buzz with these top tips for making the most of your commute.Find your de-stress tipping pointYour legs might creak as you first push down on the pedals, but every rotation releases muscle tension and makes energising oxygen flow a little faster. The more aware you are of the moment your mood tips from stressed to relaxed, the more intense it feels.Cycle mindfullyWhat is mindful cycling, exactly? Think of it as a moment-by-moment awareness of what your body is doing on the bike. Observe how your abs engage as you squeeze in your navel, which in turn straightens your spine. Feel every muscle in your foot press down on the pedal. Pay attention to the fact you’re getting stronger and healthier with every movement – it’s a double positive reinforcement. The more mindfully you cycle, the more likely you are to become hooked on the sensation of riding your bike, not just the results.Breathe easyThe wellbeing benefits of fresh air are manifold: lower blood pressure, reduced levels of the stress hormone cortisol, and a serotonin boost from increased oxygen. But does dodging traffic on your commute really count as getting fresh air when air pollution is so high? Research published in Preventative Medicine suggests that it very much depends on the route you take (particularly if you’re in London), but it is also thought that the cardiovascular benefits of cycling are likely to outweigh the negative effects of pollution. To up your daily dose of rejuvenating fresh air, pick a route through a park or fields. Build strength and muscleCycling does far more than just burn fat. The resistance aspect builds muscle, and the more muscle you have, the more calories you’ll burn – even when you’re kicking back at your desk eating breakfast.To tone muscle in your glutes, hamstrings, quads and calves, switch to a high resistance gear – that’s the big chain ring.Get fitter fasterIf you want to run faster or train for a triathlon, throw four minutes of high-intensity interval training (aka HIIT) into your commute to seriously fast-track your fitness. How? Try 20 seconds of all-out effort, followed by 10 seconds of relaxed freewheeling. Your aim is to repeat this eight times in four minutes. Working out this way is a more effective way to boost your metabolism than longer, lower-intensity sweat sessions. And if you pedal fast and furious up behind a cyclist wearing all the gear, it’s extremely satisfying to casually breeze past them while you’re in rest mode.Sharpen your brainpowerWe’ve become so dependent on our smartphones that our brains can feel slow or dull at times. So ditch Google Maps and go sans satnav, because exploring a new route to work can sharpen your cognitive capabilities, according to research from Harvard Medical School. A little detour requires the brain to do some work, because it’s encountering something it’s never experienced before.Clear out your headCycling hits your mental refresh button, clearing out the data overload from your day that slows your brain down. The time on your bike is an essential buffer that gives you headspace between work and home to process worries and work through problems. That opportunity to get out of your head and into your body helps you let go of information you don’t need, allowing it stream behind you like the churning wake of a boat.Practise gratitudeWhen you cycle, everyone wins. Take a moment to note how everyone you care about benefits from you being fitter, calmer, and stronger. Perhaps it means you swoop your kids into your arms for more cuddles, or you take fewer sick days, or you’ve got an increased libido. Maybe it means you smile at a stranger when they really need it, or you get home in a good mood because you haven’t been squidged sardine-like into a crowded carriage on an excruciatingly slow train.Sleep well tonightWhen you’re stuck late in the office, use your ride home as the start of your wind-down routine. The secret? Go slow. The evening is the best time to do calming exercise that doesn’t raise your cortisol in the same way HIIT training does. Cortisol is the enemy of sleep, you see. The NHS agrees with this – it recommends you exercise regularly but avoid vigorous exertion close to bedtime. Good sleep, in turn, makes you a better cyclist, so tomorrow you’ll wake up ready to jump on your bike and do it all again.Kate Faithfull-Williams is the author of The Feelgood Plan.You’re already clocking up the miles, so why not make them count?

I have a bike, of course (I live in Oxford – everyone here has a bike), but it’s a bottom of the range, bog-standard mountain bike and I only ever use it to wobble to the shop and back. Also, the gears have been stuck on the lowest setting since last summer, which makes even that 10-minute ride look slightly ridiculous.So when someone suggested I take part in Cycle 300 this year, attempting to clock up 300 miles in a month in aid of Cancer Research UK, my first reaction was to laugh. But once I stopped laughing, I thought: “Why not?” Just so long as I don’t have to wear any Lycra. I’ve made a fair few embarrassing middle-aged-dad decisions in recent years, but I draw the line at Lycra.What the hell. I’ll give it a go.First things first: get the bike sorted. Luckily my street has an excellent cycle shop on the corner, so I booked in and finally got the gears fixed. Next: formulate a proper strategy.My plan – as someone with basically couch-potato levels of fitness – is twofold. First: I’m not going to do 10 miles a day right out of the gate. Let’s get real. Instead, I’m going for 50 miles in week one, 75 in week two, and 88 for the two following that. Will this be realistic? Who knows? It looks OK right now.Second: to start with I’m going to stick to cycling along towpaths. I live close to both the Thames and the Oxford canal, and not only do they offer pretty views, but (and this is the really cunning part), towpaths are by their very nature, flat. Water does not flow uphill – therefore, I will not need to cycle uphill.Is this cheating? Of course not! I’m going to try to ride 300 miles in one month, for crying out loud. At least let me try to tilt the odds a little in my favour.Right, here we go. There’s a World Cup on and Britain is in the middle of a heatwave … ideal conditions for a man in his mid-40s to attempt a gruelling physical challenge, right? With that in mind I take it easy for my first ride – a picturesque six-mile round trip along the Thames from my house in west Oxford, past Christ Church meadow to a pub called the Isis Farmhouse, on Iffley lock to the east of the city.And guess what? I don’t know if it’s because my bike was fresh from a service or whether I’m not quite as unfit as I feared, but when I got back I felt fine. Better than fine: I felt great. So great that I sailed right past my house and continued another couple of miles in the other direction to a pubrestaurant called the Fishes … and my six miles became eight.The next day I repeat the trick, and over the week not only push farther east along the Thames but also follow the river in the opposite direction, as well as striking up north along the Oxford canal past the village of Wolvercote and into the wilds of Oxfordshire.By Friday I’m aching, but it’s a good ache – and when I tot up my total on Sunday I’m a couple miles over what I aimed for, which feels even better. Of course, next week will be 25 miles tougher, and the weeks after that worse still, but for the moment I’m winning.After last week’s positive start, Monday began with a hiccup. Or, rather, a sneeze. Or, to be entirely precise, a raging bout of full-on man flu. As you might expect, 48 hours in bed is hardly ideal when you’re supposed to be clocking up 10 miles a day on the bike. Still, like any cheap motivational tweet will tell you, without struggle there’s no real achievement. Or something. So, after two bed-bound days, I stoically get back in the saddle and resume the fight.I fancy a change of routine. The towpath routes into the countryside I’ve been taking have been very beautiful (and very flat), but it occurs to me that even after 14 years living in Oxford there’s still much of the city I’ve never seen. So, for the rest of the week, I hit the streets, losing myself in the terraced neighbourhoods of studentland around Cowley and Jericho, as well as the altogether grander vistas of the northern suburbs (the big, long hill up to Headington is left well alone for now).Dealing with traffic is a different discipline, of course, but at least the stop-start nature of road cycling gives me a chance for a breather every now and then. By the end of the week, I’m short of my 75-mile target – but despite those enforced rest days, I still clock up more miles than last week. And it feels good to be on my bike again. After two days indoors the fresh air, sunshine and sheer physical activity was the perfect medicine – both physically and mentally.Of course, to pull this off, I’m going to have to top 90 miles for each of the two remaining weeks. Can I do it? I’ll give it a bloody good go.Excuse the frank language, but I need to share something with you: my bottom hurts. I mean – it really hurts. It aches, it throbs, it’s … tender. I am literally saddle sore. I’m not a qualified doctor, so I may be wrong, but I think going from doing virtually no exercise at all to cycling 200 miles in three weeks has proved to be a bit of a shock to the system.On the plus side, however, I’ve cycled 200 miles in three weeks. And some discomfort aside, it’s been glorious. The sun is still shining, my bike’s still running like a dream, and the Oxfordshire countryside has never looked so beautiful.I’ve clocked up regular 15-plus-mile trips out to the villages of Radley, Appleton and Yarnton, where the towpaths and country lanes have made for wonderfully uplifting two-hour rides. My mind feels clearer, and nothing beats the sense of accomplishment of having actually achieved something I never thought I could a month ago.Of course, I’m still behind schedule. There’s another 100 miles to go if I’m going to make the 300 – and only a week to do it in. And did I mention that my bottom hurts?This week – the final week of my challenge, the week in which I was going to rack up an actual century of miles on my bike – contained a revelation. It sounds obvious, and frankly it is obvious, but my revelation was this: there are 31 days in July.Thirty-one days – not 28 days.Which meant I had 10 days left in which to hit my 300 mile target, 10 days left to cycle 100 miles. Not seven. 10 days. Six rides of 15 miles and an easy 10-miler to the finish line – with three rest days dotted in between them. Reader, I could have wheelied for joy.Re-energised, I saddled up and hit the road. Now armed with an A-Z’s worth of local knowledge, I decided on a couple of favourite routes that combined a bit of towpath-cycling and road-biking: meandering north through the leafy streets of Jericho and Summertown to Cutteslowe Park and then cutting west and heading back home along the canal striking south along the Thames past the locks at Iffley and Sandford before returning through the pretty village of Radley and up the Abingdon Road into Oxford.And if this heatwave made for hard going in places, coasting through Oxfordshire in the sunshine was also utterly, gloriously, uplifting. And somehow, I did it.By the final day of my challenge I’m considerably fitter than I was a month ago, and, best of all, unbelievably proud of myself. I’ve covered 300 miles in a single month under my own steam – something I never really thought I’d manage. Will I now be investing in Lycra shorts? No, don’t be silly. But I am going to keep cycling.If you’re tempted by life on two wheels, why not make it count? Sign up to Cancer Research UK’s Cycle 300 challenge and cycle 300 miles over the course of September to raise money for life-saving research. Whether you cycle the distance all in one go, over a weekend or throughout the month, every penny you raise will help beat cancer.

Born in Ondarroa, a fishing village of 10,000 people in the heart of Spain’s Basque country, the young man who is set to become the world’s most expensive goalkeeper was not quite so sure of his talent as a unassuming teenager, despite being called up to Athletic Bilbao’s first team squad by Marcelo Bielsa.Concerned no one on the coaching staff had attempted to correct his mistakes after one training session, Kepa convinced himself his days at the club he had joined just before his 10th birthday were numbered. He need not have worried.Having been named on the substitutes’ bench for the league matches against Getafe and Málaga in 2012, Kepa made his debut for Bilbao Athletic – the club’s reserve side – before being loaned out to second-tier sides SD Ponferradina and then Real Valladolid in 2015. Little more than a year later, he made his La Liga debut in a 1-0 win against Deportivo La Coruña, following in the footsteps of Ondarroa’s most famous son, José María Bengoetxea.The former striker had been responsible for scouting Kepa and three of his friends from their home village in 2002, watching on with pride as the young goalkeeper progressed through the various age groups with club and country over the next 15 years.“He was small in relation to other\u0026nbspchildren,” remembered Luis Llopis, who is now goalkeeping coach at Real Sociedad and first trained Kepa at Athletic’s Lezama base. “But I saw him jump around a\u0026nbspbit in the goal and said: ‘Woah, this\u0026nbspis a goalkeeper.’ If everything goes normal, he will be a goalkeeper of his time.”It was Llopis who recommended Real Madrid should meet his €20m buyout clause in January as the European champions continued their protracted search for a new No\u0026nbsp1, only for Zinedine Zidane to veto the deal despite Kepa already having passed a medical.“Kepa is very talented,” Zidane said, “but I did not want a goalkeeper in the middle of the season. I don’t regret not signing him.”The feeling was clearly mutual, even if Kepa admitted the saga had been a huge distraction for a player who had yet to make 50 appearances for Athletic: “I do not hold a grudge against Zidane, I do not have to resent anyone. I do not regret everything I’ve lived in these months. Few players have the option of living something like this. It has been a soap opera but with a happy ending for me. I am satisfied and happy.”A new contract worth €4m a season with an €80m release clause was swiftly signed and, for a few months at least, life returned to normal. Kepa has previously spoken of his passion for birds, having spent his childhood searching for goldfinches with his father, training them to sing and taking part in competitions. “Since we were little we have had birds,” he has said. “At the beginning I did not miss a contest and then I could not go to so many because of the fact that the games are on weekends. But I did not want to leave them behind. Every time I go home, it’s full of birds. It’s very healthy.”He was named in Spain’s squad for the World Cup having made his debut for Julen Lopetegui against Costa Rica in November. Six months before he starred for the under-21 side as they reached the European Championship final in Poland. Despite losing 1-0 to Germany, his performance in the semi-final victory over Gianluigi Donnarumma and Italy underlined his status as one of the best young goalkeepers in the world, although he and Llopis have both acknowledged there is still plenty of room for improvement at such a\u0026nbsptender age.“Kepa is always well placed behind the defence,” he says. “He manages well in circulating the ball thanks to his technique with his feet. He reads the game very well and interprets the passing options of the opposing strikers when they attack him to go out to intercept. He does not make many mistakes.”“Kepa’s biggest asset is his head,” adds Nika Cuenca, former editor of the Bilbao edition of Spanish newspaper AS. “He is still very young but he is very strong mentally. He takes the same approach whether he is playing\u0026nbspat the El Madrigal or Bernabéu. He has made a real impression with all\u0026nbspthe teams he has\u0026nbspplayed for and I’m sure he will just take this all in his stride.”Yet even he must have been taken by surprise at the speed with which Chelsea have acted. The refusal of Thibaut Courtois to attend a meeting with the Chelsea manager Maurizio Sarri this week ultimately forced their hand, with the Italian deciding against a move for Stoke’s England goalkeeper Jack Butland despite several inquiries over the summer.“It is a shock because people thought that he would be at Athletic for several years,” admits Cuenca. “We know Chelsea are an important club but everything happened in 24 hours and, at this moment, everyone is surprised. The transfer policy of only signing Basque players means it is rare for Athletic to sell because it is very difficult to sign replacements. Kepa was the most important player in the squad and was an inspiration for all the young players at Lezama, although Álex Remiro could be a good replacement for him.”Now it is up to Kepa to show he is ready to fly the nest."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/602ed3d3044ffc71f9764c68e0aa9a9a6d3a6059/0_70_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3cf7eea842bc67fb553cb00b31ee7dbf","title":"mauricio pochettino criticise shorter transfer window tottenham","story":"Tottenham manager feels Premier League clubs are at a disadvantage because of their self-imposed deadline but the drawbacks are few and apply only to the biggest clubsThe habitually genial Mauricio Pochettino has shown another side to his character of late. From suggesting the Tottenham project would continue “with me or another”, to urging his boss, Daniel Levy, to put his hands in his pockets, the Argentinian has taken to being more forthright in public. The object of his most recent remarks was also the one that has left him most irate: this summer’s shortened transfer window.“If you compare with Europe, you are at a complete disadvantage and it does not help the clubs in the Premier League,” Pochettino said during Tottenham’s tour of the United States last week. “We are all in the same situation in England. I don’t know if the rest of the teams are happy with that decision. Personally, I think it’s not right. It’s not going to help the Premier League clubs because we’re going to compete in Europe and in the Champions League but have 20 days less. It’s not going to help.”While there is no doubting Pochettino is not happy, is he right to be? Part of his frustration is surely specific to his own job. He knew the transfer window would close early, this Thursday 9 August at 5pm to be precise, before he signed a new five-year contract as the Spurs manager in May. But he had also hoped his club would be able to do their business early, before the World Cup. This was probably a triumph of hope over experience given the fact Spurs are short of funds owing to a new stadium which they have yet to pay for, and the poker that Levy traditionally likes to play in any transfer negotiation.Tottenham are likely to have to sell players before they can buy this summer and no outgoings mean no incomings neither. Given past behaviour it would be unwise to rule out some frantic action on deadline day, Jack Grealish having a medical in a traffic jam on the M40 kind of thing, and the truncated deadline would have had nothing to do with it. The incentives at work are largely the same as ever. Yes, any money received from the continent after 9 August could not be used for any deals this summer but that is just as much of an encouragement for buying clubs to strike a deal beforehand, on terms possibly more advantageous to them.Similar arguments apply when considering if Pochettino’s point might pertain more broadly. Are Premier League clubs leaving themselves at a disadvantage by shutting the window three weeks before everyone else? Well, on the most basic terms they are, as their continental rivals have more time to trade but 17 out of last season’s 20 Premier League clubs voted for the change and must have felt the disadvantage is outweighed by gains elsewhere.The most obvious of these benefits is the fact of having decided their squad at the point the season kicks off. There will be fewer inexplicable injuries to unsettled players, no more waiting until after September’s international break before bedding a signing into the team. This was the argument made by clubs just a year ago and if Pochettino has forgotten it again he may be blinded by this summer’s other special circumstance. Spurs, alongside other members of the big six (though not Leicester, as José Mourinho observed waspishly of Manchester United’s opening opponents), have only just welcomed back many of their top players from holiday. This is because these players had a successful World Cup. While this may feel like another interrupted opening, it is really only a consequence of success.It is the big clubs whose foreign rivals could strengthen late and the big clubs whose players may not be ready for opening day. It is also only the big clubs whose players may be picked off by continental clubs in the weeks that remain of their window. The football food chain is such the risk of poaching faced by smaller Premier League (never mind EFL) clubs comes only from the domestic market. It’s a stretch to say that even the bigger clubs face much threat from abroad.Last season, according to the website Transfermarkt, Premier League clubs bought 150 players and sold 174. They did so at a combined loss of just under £755m. Only Serie A gets anywhere close to the Premier League in terms of spending but they make it back in sales almost entirely. When it comes to being able to strike big money deals the English top flight is way out on its own.Big deals on the continent are often funded by Premier League largesse and when they are not, as might yet be the case with Thibaut Courtois, they are the exception. But even Real Madrid’s pursuit of Chelsea’s goalkeeper is not unusual. If Chelsea were rushed into signing Kepa Arrizabalaga for a world-record fee it is largely because Maurizio Sarri has only just got his feet under the desk himself.Having a whinge is a noble Premier League tradition and Pochettino will not be alone in doing so this year, in fact he will probably have another himself soon enough. Even if the top clubs in the world’s richest league were now at a disadvantage owing to their self-imposed deadline, it would not be easy to feel too sorry for them. But the truth is that, really, they are not."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/23844d1927426100ea393aef5cef048d68968d77/0_376_5074_3045/master/5074.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=451cd5ebc999282365b08f0ee9462341","title":"transfer window kepa to make 71m chelsea move pogba bernard grealish and more live","story":"Less than 24 hours remain until Thursday’s transfer deadline – but Chelsea have edged closer to signing Kepa and Mateo Kovacic “This time next year, we’ll be millionaires”. Well, Athletic Bilbao will pocket a cool £71.6m for Kepa Arrizabalaga, while Chelsea might earn around £35m for Thibaut Courtois, who looks set to join Real Madrid, with Mateo Kovacic’s season-long loan sweetening that deal. One day until the summer window does not just close but slams shut, and there’s plenty of potential movers and shakers to keep an eye on before then.

Birmingham City have snapped up Lee Camp on a two-year deal. He joins on a free transfer from Cardiff, solving Garry Monk’s self-made goalkeeping crisis. Monk has exiled David Stockdale and Tomasz Kuszczak, meaning Connal Trueman made his debut against Norwich on Saturday. Camp follows loan signings Omar Bogle and Connor Mahoney into St Andrew’s, after the EFL lifted the club’s transfer embargo. From Manchester airport to Merseyside: Bernard is at Everton’s Finch Farm training ground, where he will undergo a medical. Across town at Anfield, Danny Ings and Sheyi Ojo are the most likely departures from Liverpool before Thursday’s deadline.Done deal klaxon! Bournemouth defender Brad Smith has joined MLS club Seattle Sounders on a season-long loan. They currently sit eighth in the Western Conference, with 29 points from their 22 games. Smith, who joined the Cherries from Liverpool in 2016, has made 11 first-team appearances. The Australia defender’s loan to the MLS includes a recall clause in January, should Eddie Howe wish to activate it.No move for Robert Snodgrass in this window. Scotland international is staying at West Ham despite loan interest from Aston VillaNorth of the border, Scottish champions Celtic are to swoop for former defender Emilio Izaguirre. The 32-year-old has been playing in Al-Fayha in Saudi Arabia but has ripped up his contract to be able to seal a return to Celtic Park, where he previously spent seven seasons, winning six titles. Brendan Rodgers is also keen on a loan move for the Australia international Daniel Arzani, once the teenager formally completes his move to Manchester City. They have, though, seemingly lost out in the race for the Hibernian midfielder John McGinn, who is set to sign for Aston Villa.At Middlesbrough, out goes Adama Traoré and in comes Jordan Hugill on a season-long loan from West Ham United. Hugill, the former Boro season-ticket holder who was pulling pints in the town’s Dickens Inn a handful of years ago, bolsters Tony Pulis’s front line. “I used to sit in the North Stand,” he says. “I’ve had many nights at the Riverside and I’m looking forward to many more.” The 26-year-old, a graduate of Glenn Hoddle’s former academy in Spain signed a four-and-a-half-year deal with West Ham in January following a £10m move from Preston but made just three appearances for the club.Calling Bournemouth and Wolves supporters! What’s your verdict on your club’s summer business? Blindingly good, or is your team still short in key areas. Let us know:Valencia are attempting to sign Michy Batshuayi on loan for the year, with the club still considering whether to accept the request or not. It could be completed any time before the end of the month. Kurt Zouma is interesting Everton in a similar deal.Could another Le Havre prospect be heading for the Premier League? A couple of reports suggest Brighton are in pursuit of the defender Harold Moukoudi after being priced out of a move for the Reading defender Liam Moore, who handed in a transfer request this month. The France Under-20 international could follow a well-trodden path, with Benjamin Mendy, Riyad Mahrez, Paul Pogba, Dimitri Payet – not forgetting Liverpool’s Anthony Le Tallec and Florent Sinama-Pongolle, signed by Gerard Houllier in 2001 – in having graduated through the Ligue 2 club’s youth system. Newcastle players have solved those indifferences regarding unpaid bonuses with owner Mike Ashley, the captain Jamaal Lascelles has confirmed. The Newcastle squad had refused to fulfil any media duties with broadcasters but any blackout is over. Lascelles said: “We’ve managed to sort the off-field stuff now that’s out of the way, we don’t have any reason why we can’t go out and put on a good performance. No one’s moaning, no one’s upset and now it’s just about gelling together even more, working hard, getting a good energy around the club and the training ground – and doing what we do best which is working hard and playing as team.”Bernard has waltzed his way through passport control at Manchester airport, and his on his way to Merseyside to put the finishing touches to his free transfer. The Brazil winger will undergo a medical inside the next 24 hours, with Everton set to wrap up a lucrative deal for the former Shakhtar man. Meanwhile, in Florence, Kevin Mirallas has been officially unveiled as a Fiorentina player after joining on loan:Rangers have allowed Greg Docherty to depart Ibrox on a season-long loan deal. The 21-year-old midfielder joins Shrewsbury Town, who have been ravaged for their prized assets, including manager Paul Hurst, Toto Nsiala, Jon Nolan and Abu Ogogo. Up at Kilmarnock, they’ve signed Watford goalkeeper Daniel Bachmann on loan until May.Told that Tottenham were willing to match Aston Villa’s £25m valuation of Jack Grealish but then told he was no longer for sale by new owners. A moving of the goalposts ...Premier League teams have just over 24 hours to bring in new players. Who should the club you support be targeting? Do Bournemouth need another defender? Do Tottenham Hotspur need a sea of new faces, and what about Cardiff City?A big-name arrival in Chongqing, where Jordi Cruyff has taken charge of the city’s Chinese Super League side. After six years in Israel with Maccabi Tel Aviv, the 44-year-old former Manchester United man succeeds Paulo Bento, who lost his job last month. Cruyff said: “I’ve been following the development of Chinese football from afar for some time now. There’s a lot of talk about the star signings, but there’s also a desire to build strong foundations to ensure that the game continues to grow in a sustainable way and that’s something I’ve seen at Chongqing Lifan.”Southampton’s recruitment last season was a little off-colour – their £19.2m club-record signing failed to muster a single goal. Newcastle’s was equally a little disappointing, though this summer has been worse. How will they both fare?With Kepa Arrizabalaga heading to Chelsea for £71.6m, a world-record fee for a goalkeeper, it is time to take a trip down memory lane. In 2007, when Sunderland signed Craig Gordon from Hearts, he became Britain’s most expensive keeper at £9m, and the third-most expensive in the world, behind Gianluigi Buffon and Antonio Peruzzi. Gordon’s at Celtic these days, though was of interest to Chelsea a couple of years back.It looks like being a very satisfying window for Wolves they are confident of pulling off a deal to sign Leander Dendoncker, the Anderlecht midfielder, according to reports in Belgium. The 23-year-old, linked with Crystal Palace, among others, is on his way to the Midlands to complete a deal. He attended Sint-Guido-Instituut on the outskirts of Brussels, the same school as Romelu Lukaku. If they get Dendoncker over the line, surely that would mean the end their interest in Sam Clucas, of Swansea City:Aston Villa are closing in on the £2m signing of John McGinn from Hibernian, according to manager Neil Lennon. Celtic have had a couple of bids rebuffed and it seems that, despite a summer of financial worries, the Championship club have blown the Scottish champions out of the water. Brighton were also interested in the midfielder. Lennon said: “He went down to Birmingham, I think he is having a medical there. A fee has been agreed. I think Celtic have matched the offer but I think Villa are in the driving position.” If Wolves move for Sam Clucas, that could grease the wheels for Ryan Woods to get his move from Brentford to Swansea City. As for Chris Mepham and Ollie Watkins, manager Dean Smith is confident of keeping both, with the former of interest to Leicester City and Bournemouth. “I don’t think anyone’s come near the valuation we have on them,” he said. “So I fully expect them to stay. Funnier things have happened and some Premier League clubs come with crazy money that you can’t turn down but we will certainly have a plan in place if anything does happen, though I’d be very surprised.”Who needs transfers when congratulations are in order? Harry Kane has just posted a snap of his newborn baby daughter and second child, Vivienne Jane Kane – it’s got a ring to it. That could be the most exciting incoming at Tottenham this summer and all that, though Jack Grealish is reportedly unhappy at being priced out of a move to Spurs.More Leicester speculation: the 2016 champions are considering the possibility of re-signing Danny Drinkwater from Chelsea only a year after his £35m move to Stamford Bridge, according to The Independent, while Watford are pressing to close a year-long loan deal for the Juventus midfielder Stefano Sturaro.And with that, I’ll hand you back to a suitably well-nourished Ben, who can feed you with news and gossip to your heart’s desire for the rest of the afternoon.Some Chelsea chat from you the public: “Kovacic to Chelsea as a loan makes sense,” cheers Mervyn Millar. “He still has a good chance of being there longer than one of the managers. Perhaps all Chelsea’s signings should be season-long loans. What’s the best XI they could assemble from out-of-favour benchwarmers hungry for minutes? Everyone wins, and hey presto, Chelsea get an entertaining footballing identity.” Given the number of Chelsea’s own players out on loan they could of course field a handy enough team of their own out-of-favour benchwarmers. While Ben Duxbury wonders: “Given Kepa Arrizabalaga (thanks copy and paste) has already paid his buy out clause with Bilbao, what happens if he fails his medical at Chelsea or doesn’t agree personal terms? Is he technically a free agent given he presumably hasn’t signed a contract with Chelsea?” While Villa hold the line on Grealish, here’s Martin Laurence on why he’d be a good fit for Spurs:Elsewhere, relentless newshound Sky Sources tells us Jordan Hugill has arrived on Teesside for a medical at Middlesbrough, who have gaps to fill after recent departures. The shadow-boxing around Leicester and defenders continues: Claude Puel’s side are reported to be close to a deal for Caglar Soyuncu and Filip Benkovic. No news on Harry Maguire going anywhere though. Yet.Thanks Ben. And among those chunks of gossip are reports that Jack Grealish is staying put at Aston Villa for now, the club insist, soothing Steve Bruce’s troubled soul and doubtless frustrating Spurs, who were thought to have had a £25m deal lined up. Sky says Aston Villa’s executive chairman Nassef Sawiris has told Tottenham and any other potential suitors “he is not interested in their money”.With rumours swirling around left, right and centre, get a grip on all the concrete transfers. Tom Davies will guide you through the next chunk of gossip and goings-on ...Kepa Arrizabalaga is due in London this afternoon to undergo a medical with Chelsea ahead of a world record transfer from Atletic Bilbao after the Spain goalkeeper’s £71.6m buy-out clause was triggered earlier this morning. Kepa will be joined at Stamford Bridge by the Real Madrid midfielder Mateo Kovacic, who is expected to complete a one-year loan move later today as he seeks greater game-time. That could conclude Chelsea’s incoming transfer business in this window, though other players could yet depart. Thibaut Courtois is expected to travel from Belgium to Spain to complete his own £35m move to Madrid, signing a six-year contract, having been absent without leave from Cobham all week. The Belgian international has entered the final 12 months of his deal. Meanwhile, there is interest from Milan in Tiemoue Bakayoko, while the likes of Danny Drinkwater and Tammy Abraham have attracted enquiries from fellow Premier League clubs seeking to bolster their ranks with loanees ahead of Thursday’s 5pm cut-off.Any more for any more? “Sorry if this is already old, but are Chelsea really about to sign a keeper called Kepa?” asks Michael Hunt. “Are Golskora and Reliabulssentabakk still available as well?” Meanwhile, on the continent, Kévin Malcuit has swapped Lille for Naples, and George Puscas has joined Palermo on loan from Internazionale. Keep up:More on that news that Kepa Arrizabalaga is primed to join Chelsea, becoming the world’s most expensive goalkeeper: Middlesbrough are working on deals for Yannick Bolasie and Jordan Hugill, according to our old friends at Sky. Crystal Palace and Burnley have both expressed an interest in Bolasie, deemed surplus to requirements by Marco Silva at Everton, who would prefer to sell the winger. Hugill, who joined West Ham from Preston for almost £10m in January, would likely leave on loan. Staying in the Football League, Ipswich are closing on a £1.6m deal for the Accrington striker, Kayden Jackson.Hearing of delays in West Ham’s moves for Arsenal’s Lucas Pérez and Fiorentina’s Carlos Sánchez. Both deals are close, but at the moment they seem likelier to happen tomorrow rather than today. Not much West Ham can do about it.Mateo Kovacic, the Croatia midfielder, will sign on a season-long loan in a deal that will smooth Thibaut Courtois’ departure for the Bernabeu. Chelsea had written to the goalkeeper demanding he report back to the club’s training base at Cobham today after missing this week’s sessions, but Courtois is understood to remain in Belgium awaiting confirmation he can travel to Spain to complete his transfer. A six-year deal has apparently been struck with Real and should be finalised tomorrow, with Chelsea to receive £35m for the player.It has been a tumbleweed summer for Tottenham Hotspur – with Mauricio Pochettino yet to bolster his squad. “I wonder if I’m the only one a little miffed at the lack of signings,” says Paul Saunders, via email. “We may have the best new stadium, but we aren’t close to competing on the same level as Manchester City and Liverpool as things stand. Top four possibly, but winners unlikely.” No, Alan O’Connor is also concerned. “Even if Grealish does arrive, I’m not sure he adds that much quality,” he says. “Is he really going to push Son, Lamela, Moura, Alli or Eriksen for a starting place. Would someone like Fekir be out of reach for Spurs at this point due to financial constraints? Should they be looking to improve in other areas? Backup for Kane, cover at CB, cover for Dembélé if he is staying ... For a team that needs to push on and improve if they are going to win a trophy, they are not exactly pushing the boat out to improve the squad.”A few nuggets from Ligue 1, courtesy of Get French Football News (GFFN):• Newcastle United have agreed personal terms with Valenciennes’ 19-year-old central defender Sikou Niakaté, but his entourage is not confident that the club will meet his €3m before tomorrow’s deadline• Olivier Giroud has told French outlets that he has spoken to Nabil Fékir about coming to Chelsea: “We would obviously welcome him, he is a super player”• And local sources in Montpellier believe that 22-year-old attacker Isaac Mbenza has already travelled to England ahead of a possible €15m move to Huddersfield TownKepa to Chelsea: Athletic Bilbao have confirmed the earlier news that his lawyers, at 9.22am this morning, have activated the £71.6m release clause, paving the way for the Spain goalkeeper to make the move to Chelsea. “Athletic thanks the player for his contribution during the time he has remained in our club,” a statement read. In short, Kepa’s en route to London as he edges closer to becoming a Chelsea player ...No comment. Real Madrid head coach Julen Lopetegui refused to be drawn on speculation linking the Chelsea goalkeeper, Thibaut Courtois, with a move to the club:As for the Croatia midfielder, Mateo Kovacic, set for a switch in the opposite direction, Lopetegui added: “It’s true that Mateo has expressed his desire to leave. I’ve expressed my desire for him to stay. If he leaves, we’ll see how we organise things. The solution that we’d look for at the right time would be a player at Kovacic’s level, someone who is a top-level footballer. To compete all the objectives, we need a balanced squad.”In the Football League, Ipswich Town have completed the double signing of Jon Nolan and Toto Nsiala, with the pair reunited with Paul Hurst. Shrewsbury Town fumed at Ipswich allegedly making their first move via text – insisting the duo were going nowhere – but they had little choice but to cave in. Meanwhile, these days Marc-Antoine Fortuné is running out in Chesterfield colours, playing under Martin Allen. Who knew? Jack Grealish’s future at Aston Villa remains uncertain, with Tottenham Hotspur circling. Last night, there were murmurs of the club rebuffing a £25m bid. And, it’s not far from doom and gloom for Steve Bruce’s side, with Joe Bryan set to sign from Bristol City for £6m after undergoing a medical. He will join the Ashton Gate exodus, following the exits of Bobby Reid and Aden Flint, to Cardiff and Middlesbrough, respectively. Done deal klaxon! Derby have whisked Martyn Waghorn through the door from Ipswich, with the striker arriving on a three-year deal for a fee of £5m. He ought to fill the void left by Vydra, who could be joined at Burnley by Jay Rodriguez, my colleague Ed Aarons reports. They are hopeful of re-signing the striker, who left for Southampton in 2012.Big news out of Burnley ... Ben Mee has signed a new three-year deal at Turf Moor, following on in signing on the dotted line after the arrivals of Ben Gibson, Joe Hart and Matej Vydra. The 28-year-old defender has made 248 appearances in six years Burnley.Brentford know how to nail a transfer window they have sold players for a total profit of more than £50m since promotion in 2014, yet remain as competitive as ever:Danny Ings and Sheyi Ojo are the most likely departures from Liverpool before the domestic transfer deadline as Jurgen Klopp looks to trim his squad ahead of the new season. Ings has attracted interest from several Premier League clubs this summer having reluctantly accepted he should leave Anfield for regular first team football after an injury-plagued few years. Newcastle United and Crystal Palace are possible destinations for the striker, who was also wanted by former club Burnley before they switched their attentions to signing Matej Vydra from Derby County. Liverpool want £20m for the 26-year-old. Liverpool have received several loan enquiries for Ojo, their talented 21-year-old winger, with Aston Villa keen to take him to the Championship. The Anfield club would prefer a permanent deal, however, and West Bromwich Albion are interested. As for other would-be departures such as Simon Mignolet, Divock Origi and Lazar Markovic, they all have suitors in Europe and, as such, have until the end of the month to finalise transfers.Jérôme Boateng has been on the blower, to let down Mr Mourinho gently and inform the Portuguese that he will not be swapping the Oberpollinger for the Trafford Centre:Done deal klaxon! Adama Traoré joins Wolves on a whopping five-year deal after the club activated his £18m release clause at Middlesbrough. The 22-year-old speeding winger, once of Aston Villa, graduated through the Barcelona academy and becomes Nuno’s fifth summer signing following promotion to the Premier League. Meanwhile, there are a few murmurs that Wolves that five may become six, with Sam Clucas reportedly of interest. The Swansea City midfielder failed to agree terms on a move to Burnley but is said to be a target, with Brentford midfielder Ryan Woods still keen on a move to south Wales.It may have got lost amid the noise around the big-boys, but Bournemouth shattered their transfer record last night, signing the Colombia midfielder Jefferson Lerma for a club-record £25m fee. Eddie Howe’s No 1 summer target, a player the club had tracked long before his World Cup appearances in Russia, has signed contract until 2023 on the south coast. That £25m eclipses the £20m they shelled out for Nathan Aké, last summer. In 2013, their transfer record stood at just £2.5m, when they signed striker Tokelo Rantie from Swedish club Malmo. Want another crunching dose of context? Lerma arrives 10 years to the day that Bournemouth were handed a 17-point deduction in the fourth tier of English football ...Lyon sound far from certain they will retain their captain, Nabil Fekir, this month. The attacking midfielder, who had come close to a £53m switch to Merseyside in June, returned to training on Monday after an extended post-World Cup break and was not included in his club’s travelling squad for Tuesday’s friendly at Chelsea. “For the moment, it’s too early to say whether he will stay,” said the Lyon manager, Bruno Génésio. “He wanted to leave at the end of last season, but he came back on Monday and was happy to come back. “Who knows? There may be opportunities that come up before the end of the window but, for now, he is a Lyon player.” Any other takers?A big dollop of Chelsea news to get us started ... with Kepa Arrizabalaga en route to London to finalise a £71.6m move – a world-record fee for a goalkeeper – to Stamford Bridge. Mateo Kovacic is also expected in the capital ahead of sealing a season-long loan move from Real Madrid, Dominic Fifield reports:Kepa Arrizabalaga and Mateo Kovacic are travelling to London today to complete their respective moves to Chelsea, deals that are likely to conclude the Premier League club’s incoming business ahead of Thursday’s cut-off. The goalkeeper will cost £71.6m from Athletic Bilbao, having made that payment at 9.22am Spanish time to trigger his buy-out clause in Madrid (apparently the player has to meet the fee in Spain, with the buying club presumably providing him with the required funds) before flying to England.The end is near, this very nearly the final descent. Who will be sitting pretty come 5pm on Thursday? Who will be tearing their hair out, resigned to their fate? Will Athletic Bilbao’s Kepa Arrizabalaga become Chelsea’s Kepa Arrizabalaga? Will Everton get that Bernard deal over the line? What happens to Jack Grealish? We’ll keep an eye on all the movers and shakers. But before we get stuck in, feast on some red-hot rumours:"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/106e69cb4799c47b43958b73f919bac85cb2a9e7/0_182_4977_2987/master/4977.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f95725366c36fa16effd4cfe58d33735","title":"drawn to success how to bring out your inner artist","story":"Anyone can learn to draw, and from the web-based Sketchbook Club to art-shop mini-classes and even videos from children’s illustrator Nick Sharratt, there is plenty of help to get you startedMy great-aunt was an artist, and was fond of telling us that anyone can learn to draw. Not everyone is super-talented, she would hastily qualify – not everyone can be an artist. But given the right teaching, everyone can, at the very least, turn out a decent representation of a tree, or a flower, or a human being. It is like learning a language, she would say. You just have to put in a bit of work.The success of recent books such as Johanna Basford’s Secret Garden colouring book and Emma Farrarons’ The Mindfulness Colouring Book certainly suggests there are millions of us nurturing a creative side, often one frustrated by our everyday lives. But these bestsellers are marketed more as therapy than creativity – simple exercises like dot-to-dot or colouring-in that help calm the mind and relieve stress. They are, for many, a lovely way to pass the time, but unlikely to end up framed on your bedroom door. So what if you want to create something a little more, well, creative?I studied art at school to A-level, and loved it. But in the decades since, without guidance and structure, I have lost both my ability and my confidence. My drawing skills are rusty, and I buy sketchbooks that remain unfilled. I see potential inspiration everywhere, yet lack the ability to translate it into anything. In need of some help, I started searching online, and eventually found Jennie Maizels’ Sketchbook Club.Maizels is an illustrator and artist whose designs are drenched in colour. You suspect her darkest nightmares play out in black and white, and involve paint shortages. But although she has talent in multicoloured spades, she also understands the fear of the intimidatingly blank sketchbook page. With this in mind, she has created a series of short projects that provide all your inspiration, in a non-scary, easy-to-follow format – yet where there is also plenty of room to inject your own style.“Drawing is the only creative pastime that we have left behind in childhood,” she explains from her colourful studio near Winchester. “We knit, we sew, we bake and we play music – we even colour in – but somewhere along the line, we have been led to believe that drawing is a God-given talent and completely unachievable. My core belief is that if we treat art like all the other pastimes and follow recipes or instructions, we can ALL draw.”Maizels had long noticed that people seemed to believe that she, as an illustrator, could conjure creative work out of nothing. “But I always have a brief – I am told what to paint and very often I will copy from photographs or even trace – there’s a reason we all have light boxes!” This source material is what she has compiled for each of her modules: you download sheets with dozens of images, which you can then use, trace, doodle over or manipulate however you like to make up your finished page. This means that hundreds of people given the same sources will nevertheless all create unique images.“The copying and tracing element can be controversial,” she says, “but if you tell people to ‘just draw from your imagination, don’t be afraid, there are no mistakes’, pen is put to paper nervously and the drawings, more often than not, look like children’s and the belief that ‘I cannot draw’ is perpetuated and then the pen is put down indefinitely.“I’ve found that even the most nervous and reluctant attendee, after following my prescriptive instructions, has found enormous pride in their finished piece and immediately wants to do more. For me, that is exactly why I do it. To see that pride on people’s faces, it is immeasurably rewarding.”Sketchbook Club now has participants from all over the world, including Canada, America, Australia and, recently, a group in Abu Dubai. As well as the different themes, each module covers a different style, from typography to pen-and-ink doodles via collage. New modules are released fortnightly, with Maizels taking feedback from Instagram on which ones participants would next like to see. She is also keen to keep prices affordable so that as many people can take part as possible – each module is £4, can be shared with a group and there is no subscription. She also does occasional workshops at her studio.I have long suspected that a vast number of those bestselling colouring-in books languish uncoloured at the bottom of bookshelves. Who, after all, really has the time? Yet Maizels’ participants seem genuinely devoted, and set aside time each fortnight for their projects. The fact that many can be used as cards certainly helps, but the main benefit is in feeling a real sense of a creative project achieved. “I get messages from all over the world saying how grateful people are for reigniting their long-lost creativity, says Maizels. “People who are bed-bound, recuperating, people who would love to attend classes but can’t get there, are creating these masterpieces which gives them so much pleasure. People who have NEVER drawn, people who are determined they just cannot are discovering that not only that they can, but they are in fact rather good at it.”365 Days of ArtLorna Scobie’s superb book is one of the few that I have really stuck to – day in, day out. Each exercise is small, simple and varied enough to sustain your interest. Tasks range from doodling in shapes and colouring-in to drawing a skyline you can see from a window. Doing it all in small boxes within a portable book makes it feel very achievable. And Scobie’s own artwork is charming and inspiring. The name might evoke traditional artistic materials, but this YouTube channel has some great tutorials for beginners. Some of the most useful are the classes in how to get the most out of materials – for example, the fairly new (to anyone who hasn’t taken up a paintbrush in years) ranges of watercolour marker pens now on the market. Much loved children’s illustrator Nick Sharratt (Shark in the Park is a classic for young kids) has some great “how to draw” videos on his website. Ideal for kids themselves, or for drawing for kids. If the idea of going to a traditional art store is daunting, head to Muji. Its range of affordable sketchbooks, coloured pens and stationery with neutral colours might be less intimidating than the gorgeous, but scarily pristine, pages of a brand new Moleskine sketchbook. Cass Art is a fantastic place to shop for materials – it manages to offer the kind of premium products, such as oil paints that I imagine proper artists must need, yet also never feel intimidating to an amateur. The prices are really good, too. Its blog has some great “How-tos” and although the website selection is superb, do go in store if you have one nearby – it frequently runs mini-classes showing off new materials.

For breakfast? Have you completely lost your marbles?”I’m joking, obviously. That’s not what you’re thinking. You’re thinking: “Pizza? For breakfast? If that’s a new food trend, I’ve been ahead of the curve for years.”Because pizza as your first meal of the day – served cold and slightly congealed, and with at least one slice less than you thought you’d saved – is arguably the king of all breakfasts. Indeed, half the thrill of ordering in on a Saturday night is that it saves you the enormous hassle of having to pour milk over something the next morning.The Lebanese have long known the benefits of a pizza at breakfast – although they prefer their morning guilt-binge freshly baked. Their manousheh is a traditional white flatbread – topped with herbs, meats, cheeses and sometimes sugary treats – that is typically served at breakfast time. The name derives from the hand-pressed dips in the dough that help to hold the toppings and, while it’s not pizza, it provides similar, carb-charged comfort.The Lebanese Bakery in London opened earlier this year and features a menu consisting almost entirely of manousheh it bakes them in a traditional basalt rock oven, using only Lebanese ingredients. I get to sample the za’atar (an intense blast of thyme and sumac that would certainly wake you up) the lahmeh bi ajin (minced beef and lamb, with an infusion of pomegranate molasses) and one with the classic topping of baked eggs, which has a ridge to catch any runaway yolk and is the most similar to an English breakfast item.All tasty, but it’s the akkawi – a simple topping of hard cow’s-milk cheese that is grated and washed so it softens – that steals my heart, a Middle Eastern version of cheese on toast that feels oddly light for such an obvious indulgence. The sampling is finished off with a sweet manousheh consisting of strawberry, crushed pistachios and delicious halva. I can confidently say that sampling five manousheh in one sitting makes for an “interesting” afternoon’s output at work.This is street food in Lebanon, but the Lebanese Bakery is not selling at a ludicrous price: most items on its menu sell for £6, which seems reasonable for a modest lunch or hearty breakfast. The restaurant’s owners also have a branch in Beirut, where their food is perfect at 4am when the post-party hunger cravings kick in. Personally, I’d eat one at any time. And that’s the whole point. Rather than pizza you eat for breakfast, the manousheh is more a breakfast that you eat at pizza time. And when is it ever not pizza time?"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f676e95b51fbdb3edba3f5797aec9528564041a8/0_0_3500_2469/master/3500.jpg?w=700\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=5d2e846f7eba255de16f30b3cbe5a6d1 1400w","title":"hiring of senior staff brexit uncertainty halts says top recruiter page group","story":"Page Group says firms are delaying decisions and candidates are staying put Companies are putting off hiring senior staff and potential job candidates are staying put because of uncertainty over Brexit, one of Britain’s leading recruitment companies has said.Michael Page recruits accountants, IT heads, finance directors and other senior people in industries ranging from financial services to manufacturing and healthcare.The stagnant market for senior recruitment appears to reflect wider business uncertainty as the March deadline for leaving the EU looms with no deal in sight.

It includes a free-trade area for goods governed by a common rulebook.The deal had prompted David Davis and Boris Johnson to quit the government, saying it was not in line with their vision of a post-EU Britain.The letter from May, received by Tory party members on Tuesday, follows a concerted effort by Conservatives to woo party chairs. There have been in-person briefings with May’s chief of staff, Gavin Barwell, and the party chair, Brandon Lewis.Tory chiefs have been alarmed at the extent of the backlash from the grassroots and May herself took part in a conference call to take questions directly from local chairs.In the three-page letter, estimated by ConservativeHome to have cost the party about £70,000, May repeatedly acknowledges the grassroots’ disquiet, referring to the “strong feelings members of our party have on this important national issue”, and saying there had been “a number of questions” about how a common rulebook would affect sovereignty.The letter takes aim at critics who have described the Chequers’ offer as capitulation. “It is in no sense a concession to their demands,” she wrote. “I have been very clear that we are rejecting the two models they have put forward.”Polling by the ConservativeHome website found members bitterly opposed to the Chequers proposal, three in five calling it a bad deal.A further survey by the site discovered that the popularity of cabinet ministers who backed the deal – including former leadership frontrunners Michael Gove and Sajid Javid – had plummeted. Johnson, however, soared to the top of members’ preferences for next Tory leader for the first time since 2016.On Wednesday a handful of party members posted pictures on social media of themselves discarding May’s letter or tearing it into pieces.The script preps Tory members to answer questions such as “is this Brexit in name only?” and “won’t the EU just reject this?” which includes the reply “both sides have to compromise”.Among those endorsing the deal on paper are the Eurosceptic cabinet ministers Fox and Leadsom, as well as Gove, who is environment secretary, and the Brexit secretary, Dominic Raab.Leadsom, who was reported to have told colleagues she hated the Chequers deal but was prepared to back the prime minister, is quoted as saying: “This proposal puts the power back in the hands of parliament ... this allows our laws to be decided directly by those we elect.”Fox’s endorsement says the deal will “give the UK the freedom to sign our own independent trade deals”. Raab calls it a “credible vision ... a principled and practical Brexit”.May’s letter also takes pains to emphasise future trade. “I know that some people are concerned that this common rulebook will stop us doing trade deals,” she wrote. “I can assure you this is not the case – and I would not be proposing it if it would.”Among those endorsing the deal was Rob Semple, chair of the National Conservative Convention, the members’ body. In his quote Semple appears to acknowledge some differences in the party over the plan, saying it took “on board differing views within the Conservative party and country as a whole ... it is therefore incumbent on the party that we support the prime minister”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/38e182c358fc4ba81a08f27943cb97e80159f4cd/4_212_3636_2182/master/3636.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d03e2f5fe2ce69c09923f54f4feb922d","title":"civil service unions take legal action against government over pay cap","story":"Unions representing 200,000 workers seek judicial review over failure to consult  Civil service unions are seeking a judicial review over the government’s failure to consult on pay.The FDA, Prospect and the Public and Commercial Services (PCS) unions said they were making the unprecedented move after government promises to negotiate failed to materialise. Solicitors for the government are expected to claim that no such undertakings were made and that the government is not obliged to consult with unions.It is the first time that public sector unions have sought a judicial review over the government’s failure to consult. The move reflects a deep frustration among civil servants that other public employees have received pay increases after consultations. The FDA general secretary, Dave Penman, said the government’s consultation process on pay had been shambolic.“This, more than anything, demonstrates the perilous state of industrial relations in the civil service,” he said.Mike Clancy, the permanent secretary of Prospect, said the refusal to consult in any meaningful way demonstrated a disdain for hundreds of thousands of civil servants.“By treating civil servants differently and worse than those employed in other parts of the public sector, the government has shown how little they value their vital contribution,” he said.Mark Serwotka, general secretary of the PCS, said: “Not content with reneging on its commitments to engage in consultation on an issue as fundamental as our members’ pay, the government is now adding insult to injury by claiming it never intended to consult in the first place. This shambolic state of affairs cannot go unchallenged and we will now pursue this matter to the high court.”The legal case will revolve around a series of meetings between union officials and ministers in May and June this year.NHS workers, police, local government workers, teachers and prison officers have been covered by pay review bodies or have held meaningful negotiations with the unions, insiders said.The civil service unions also wrote to Liz Truss, the chief secretary to the treasury, to seek an urgent meeting but did not receive a response.Last year, the PCS successfully launched a judicial review over the government’s Civil Service Compensation Scheme, which led to changes to the guidance.The former cabinet office minister Ben Gummer was found to have acted unlawfully by excluding some unions from negotiations over redundancy terms.Asked to respond to the latest move and the claim that the government had broken a promise to consult unions over pay, a government spokesperson said: “Civil servants do an outstanding job supporting the delivery of public services right across the country. This year’s pay guidance provides greater flexibility for civil service pay, striking a balance between rewarding our hard-working staff while ensuring good value for the taxpayer.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/36907ba34062e7c066d45130c6ff4556142e8005/107_0_3611_2167/master/3611.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9b44af2bbe3a4811c5a8da7508297680","title":"adam peaty european championships","story":"Like a pernickety judge on Strictly Come Dancing, a flawless routine is required to earn a perfect review from Adam Peaty. Yet in Glasgow on Wednesday the Englishman appraised in generous terms his third gold medal of the European Championships, in the 50m breaststroke. “Execution was probably 9.5,” he said. “But the race itself was 10 out of 10.”Without the lustre of lowering his own world record, as he had done over 100m last weekend, there was almost a dash of disappointment when victory was the lone landmark. His time of 26.09sec, with Italy’s Fabio Scozzoli claiming silver and Peter John Stevens of Slovenia bronze, was a championship best. It secured his 11th European gold and he supplanted Fran Halsall as the most successful Briton in the Championships’ history he has the opportunity to make it a round dozen in the concluding 4x100 medley on Thursday.Peaty expects to carve out more history at the 2019 world championships in the South Korean city of Gwangju. “I missed a few strokes which cost me zero-point-zero something but I don’t think it would have got me the world record. But next year is looking very strong: very good power-wise, very good technique-wise.”Sweden’s Sarah Sjoestroem earned her third gold in Glasgow by claiming the 100m freestyle title for the fourth consecutive time. There was another display of the immense potential of Freya Anderson when the 17-year-old from the Wirral took fourth place in a European junior record of 53.16sec.Siobhan-Marie O’Connor missed out on bronze in the 200m inidual medley by two-hundredths of a second as Hungary’s Katinka Hosszu won the event for the fifth time. Ben Proud will be favourite in the 50m freestyle on Thursday after setting a British and championship record of 21.11sec in his semi-final. Imogen Clark lowered the British best to 30.04 finishing second in her 50m breaststroke semi-final.Jazz Carlin makes her championship bow in the 10-km open water event in Loch Lomond on Thursday. The 27-year-old Welshwoman confessed to a lack of motivation after claiming silver in the 400m and 800m freestyle at Rio 2016. “The change has brought reinvigoration,” she said, but it is has been a radical shift.“When I first got into it, I was kind of looking at everyone that was touching me and I was a bit like: ‘How dare you.’ Obviously you can do that, it’s part of the sport, it’s part of the race.

The England coach leans forward with unexpected animation in the pavilion at Lord’s, where the second Test begins on Thursday. “It was some Test. Of course you ride every ball and in the close games it’s very nervy. On the surface my demeanour is chilled out but I get as nervous as anyone else. As a coach it’s a case of trying to look calm.”In the deserted majesty of Lord’s, as an imperious Virat Kohli leads his squad out to practise, Bayliss emerges as a more open man than his persona indicates. In the three years since he became England’s head coach the Australian has remained a reserved presence. It sometimes seems as if no one is quite sure what Bayliss does, apart from spreading calm and encouraging his players to express themselves. The opaque nature of his work has been matched by inconsistencies on the field.England have been transformed in white-ball cricket. They were a shambles when he took over in 2015, after they had been knocked out of the World Cup by Bangladesh, but England are now the No\u0026nbsp1 side in one-day cricket. But they have lost 20 Tests under Bayliss, won 17 and drawn six.The first Test against India nearly slipped away and at Lord’s they will be without their top all-rounder, Ben Stokes, who is on trial in Bristol after\u0026nbspbeing involved in an incident last September that led to him being\u0026nbspcharged with affray – which he\u0026nbspdenies.Did Bayliss talk to Stokes about the trial after he took four wickets to\u0026nbspseal England’s victory last Saturday? “No – that’s outside our domain or influence. It might not be great for this Test but it’s an opportunity for someone else to put their name up in lights.”On more familiar terrain Bayliss is keen to tear up the assumption he favours white-ball cricket. “I’m very much a traditionalist. I like Test cricket more than white-ball cricket. So much white-ball stuff is played these days and we’re lucky England have 15 to 20 guys that could easily step in and shine. At Test level we haven’t got 11 players that have nailed down their positions, let alone 15 to 20. You go through stages where guys are more suited to one‑day cricket.“I’d like to see the county batters up their average. We’ve had a lot of good players averaging 35 to 40 at county level. If you want someone to average 40 to 50 in Test cricket, he’s got to average 50 to 60 at the level below. We haven’t got that right now but some good young players are coming through.”Notorious for watching little county cricket Bayliss admits he has not seen Pope bat in a first‑class game. “I’ve just seen him in a couple of short-form games but our selectors and scouts are convinced he’ll be a good player.”Under Ed Smith, the new head of selectors, England have made some striking and even controversial decisions – from choosing a trio of very young players in Dom Bess, Sam Curran and Pope to recalling Jos Buttler and Adil Rashid despite their lack of red-ball cricket. “It’s been very good,” Bayliss says. “Ed’s come in with some left-field suggestions but he communicates extremely well and so far, so good.”Has Smith made any suggestions that have seemed too left-field for Bayliss? The 55-year-old shakes his head. “I don’t think Ed would mind me saying we’ve had lots of chat about when is the right time to bring in someone very young. Do you wait\u0026nbspuntil the team is winning or do you make the change even if we lose and are under pressure? Our views have not always been the same but,\u0026nbspafter chatting and listening, we’ve often gravitated to the other’s way of thinking.”Bayliss will not say anything special to Pope before his debut. “The best coaches are the other 10 players. If you’re that 11th player you can get help from the coaches but you learn more about the game from experiencing it and watching your teammates.”I read to Bayliss a withering comment George Dobell wrote about him on Cricinfo last year. “What does Bayliss do? If he’s just creating a relaxed environment, he could be replaced by a couple of scented candles, a yucca plant and a CD of ambient whale noises.”Bayliss smiles. “It makes me think two things. One is that it shows he doesn’t know what’s going on behind the scenes but number\u0026nbsptwo it was funny. I had a laugh about it.”Does it bother him there is a perception he is merely ticking along as a coach? “At times, yes. But people don’t know the full picture and I actually promote that because it lets people know it doesn’t have to be structure and pressure, pressure, pressure all the time. Everyone starts playing cricket because they love it. Yes, there’re extra pressures now but let’s keep playing the game because we love it.”Have there been times when Bayliss has spoken forcefully to a team which, in March, were 23 for eight against New Zealand before being defeated by an innings and 49 runs? “That was shock. You can’t believe it’s happening – whether you’re on the receiving or the good end of the stick. It was a low point and we’ve had a few stern words with them elsewhere. But I don’t believe in ranting and raving. If you get the message across in a calm way it’s more likely to sink in”How has Bayliss’s light touch succeeded with his white-ball teams? “We changed the attitude and encouraged players to be more aggressive. And we started choosing batters suited to playing hard at the top. But, more than a big shift, it’s making proper use of the available\u0026nbsptools.”Bayliss and Paul Farbrace, his ebullient assistant, have complemented each other with England and Sri Lanka, whom they led to the 2011 World Cup final. “Everybody has weaknesses,” Bayliss says, “and you need to surround yourself with people who have strengths in areas you don’t.”Where does Bayliss feel he is weakest as a coach? “I’m not sure it’s\u0026nbspa weakness but I fly by the seat of\u0026nbspmy pants a little where Farby is very organised and writes everything down. Detail and structure is very important to him. I sometimes say players need to loosen up a little more. There’s not one perfect way to coach.”Bayliss tells some good stories about his four years with Sri Lanka from 2007 to 2011 – at a time when it\u0026nbspseemed impossible to drop Muttiah Muralitharan, the brilliant spin bowler who was approaching the end. “It was difficult. At one stage he was left out but he ended up back in the team. Your selection had to go to the federal sports minister for approval. A number of times you’d get a note saying such-and-such must be in the team. You’ve got to accept it and keep doing what you do well within that framework.”This phlegmatic approach is obvious when I ask Bayliss if he was haunted by the terrorist attack on the Sri Lanka team in Lahore in 2009. “No, and I don’t know why,” he says of an incident in which six of his squad were injured and eight people were killed. “I remember thinking, ‘Keep your head down and arse up.’ Everybody was in the middle of the bus lying on the floor. Farby was behind me. A piece was sticking out of his arm and blood poured on to the floor. You expect screaming and yelling but everyone was very calm. There were guys saying, ‘Oh I’m hit’ and it was no louder than that. The driver got us out even through bullets were flying into the bus.”A few months after he returned to Sydney, in 2011, Bayliss worked in a more mundane job as an estate agent. “I had applied for the New South Wales job again but they overlooked me. I was lost, thinking, ‘What do I do?’ A mate said: ‘Come work with me and sell some houses.’ It was interesting to do something completely different. I did that for five months and then the Big Bash started and I was back in cricket. I sold about five places but I wasn’t a salesman. I certainly worked out that cricket was my domain.”English cricket will remain his specific domain until the end of next summer – when Bayliss hopes to lead England to their first World Cup victory in 50-over cricket and regain the Ashes. “Winning a home World Cup is very important. But it’s no more important than winning the Ashes. I hold them on equal terms. We’ve played good white-ball cricket over the last two years. Our challenge is to sustain that while we improve as a Test team. The aim is to win both next year, go out on a high and hopefully not go back to being an estate agent again.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/33bd2ee7f778c1941fb58481a3d28f6336eff9a0/0_362_5393_3236/master/5393.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=71a472fbb3c02e8d75ad00430174b550","title":"counties need to revolt the hundred ecb","story":"Here is the squad representing English cricket at the Lord’s Test on Thursday. It may not be the one you expected. Delia Bushell, Martin Darlow, Alan Dickinson, Colin Graves, Tom Harrison, Barry O’Brien, Kamlesh Patel, Lucy Pearson, Scott Smith, Jane Stichbury, Brenda Trenowden, Jim Wood.If you think that’s not so much a Who’s Who of English cricket but a Who? Who? you would not be alone. Don’t worry: they are not taking the field. But they are, quite astonishingly, the 12 most important people in the national summer game – and now the only 12 with any power worth mentioning: the directors of the England and Wales Cricket Board.Some say only one of them matters. And there is no doubt about the captain of this team. There have been dominant chairmen of the ECB before now. But the board itself have never accrued anything like the power wielded under this incumbent, the Yorkshire businessman Colin Graves.Remember the verse by the Scottish poet Andrew Lang? “I am the batsman and the bat  I am the bowler and\u0026nbspthe ball  The umpire, the pavilion cat  The roller, pitch, and stumps, and all.” The reference is to God, who may or may not also surround himself with non‑executive directors.Graves came to prominence in cricket in 2002: he\u0026nbspgallantly bailed out Yorkshire when they were heading for bankruptcy, and became chairman of the ECB in 2015. He made his money as the founder of Costcutter, a supply chain and unifying brand for nearly\u0026nbsp2,000 independent retailers, a setup that bore some resemblance to the cooperative relationship between the ECB and its component counties. Not any\u0026nbspmore.Two months ago, the ECB’s old board was reconstituted. This was partly to fulfil Sport England’s requirements, which are indeed hotter on ersity (Boxes Must Be Ticked) than democracy. Penalty for non-compliance: no government handouts. However, the ECB, under Graves’s command, went far beyond this and somehow persuaded its constituents (the counties, major and minor, plus MCC) to cut themselves out of any meaningful role in decision-making.Specifically, the board’s new articles of association preclude the counties from any say in “the new Twenty20 competition” (now scheduled as 16.4 overs a side not 20), due to start two years hence, involving eight still non-existent teams sprawling across 38 days of prime summertime.The new event is riddled with obvious flaws: it isn’t just mad old me saying this. However, some of us can express this view freely others are nervy. Yet there are only two possibilities. Either the marketing money being hurled at it will buy short-term success, leading to the permanent enfeeblement of all other domestic cricket. Or it will be a very, very expensive fiasco.So who are these 12 people who might halt the runaway train? There are three ex\u0026nbspofficio board members: Graves, Harrison the chief executive officer and Smith the CFO. There are four “independent directors”: Patel (a peer, professor and all-purpose committee man), Bushell (former Sky executive), Trenowden (banker) and Stichbury (retired chief constable).There are five “cricket non-executives”: Pearson played women’s Tests back in amateur days Darlow (another ex-cop) and Wood are from Minor Counties cricket O’Brien (reputedly a staunch Graves ally) is a former Glamorgan chairman and Dickinson (another banker) was treasurer of Surrey. They look well set up to handle riots caused by a financial crisis. But run cricket?But these obscure figures are not to blame – not yet. The counties were bribed (as clubs, not iniduals), browbeaten and bamboozled into giving away their power. This was in effect a coup d’état – the transformation of an old democracy into a top-down dictatorship – but a coup in which the counties connived.Meanwhile, down the food chain, people who actually understand cricket are trying to work out how to schedule regular fixtures when almost half the first-team professionals in the business – the top half – will be yanked out of their\u0026nbspcounties for nearly six weeks. The whisper is that this committee is\u0026nbspnot so much struggling as writhing.\u0026nbspThe schedule is already atrocious: a bonkers number of competitions but hardly any sport Essex and Hampshire are in the midst of 52 days with 30 hours of playing time. The players might as well take holiday jobs.The counties could stop the extra nonsense. The articles of association bar them from interfering with a Twenty20 tournament, not a 16.4-16.4. Their own Twenty 20 is expected to attract well over a million spectators to 23 different centres this summer. If the 16.4, confined to eight cities, filled every seat at every match, it would still produce only half as many spectators. This aspect of cricket is not broke and does not need fixing. But the counties have been promised more than £1m a year to shut up.It is up to the rest of us. More than 40 years ago, Camra stopped the breweries condemning British drinkers to fizzy keg bitter. Now we need a Campaign for Real\u0026nbspCricket.

Some of the numbers reveal the capacity for densely rhymed hip-hop that has become his admired trademark. Yet for all the production’s energy, there is something odd about members of the youth-oriented British Theatre Academy immersing themselves in the deeply American culture of cheerleading. Jeff Whitty’s book makes it clear that cheerleading is much more than pompoms and ra-ra chants: it is a highly competitive sport with its own built-in status-seeking. The plot focuses on the ambitious Campbell, who is captain of her high school team, and who, when deviously relocated to another establishment, vows revenge on the rival who has supplanted her. The show argues there is more to life than winning and reveals the dubiously hermetic nature of its subject. We are told: “Being a cheerleader is like being a marine: you sign your life away.” What the musical doesn’t mention are the catastrophic injuries and the accusations of sexual molestation inseparable from cheerleading. You simply have to sit back and enjoy the songs, which Miranda co-wrote with Tom Kitt (music) and Amanda Green (lyrics), and the exuberance of Ewan Jones’s production and choreography, which require the cast to leap, dance, cartwheel and form human pyramids. Robyn McIntyre as Campbell, Chisara Agor as her newfound friend, and Kristine Kruse as a one-time mascot who enjoys a sexual awakening, lead the group with elan, but I can’t help feeling relief that in Hamilton, Miranda finally found a subject that matched his formidable talents."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/10254cd0f15a16a0be4e7b59f7f606e712fd14ba/0_89_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6c124f4245d382bd16048a63229581b7","title":"tesla directors elon musk private twitter shares","story":"Statement from board members suggests Musk’s tweets – which prompted surge in price – were less spontaneous than imaginedTesla directors have said they knew about Elon Musk’s surprise proposal to privatise the money-losing car maker before he tweeted about it and have met several times in the past week to discuss the proposal.The statement, issued by six of Tesla’s nine-member board, suggests Musk’s controversial tweets, which led to the company’s stock being suspended from trading for a time on Tuesday, were less spontaneous than originally believed and not designed simply to punish Tesla stock short-sellers.The board members said they were “taking the appropriate next steps” to evaluate the proposal. But they did not reveal who or what institution Musk may have been referring to when he posted “funding secured”.The company, which is losing money and burning through cash reserves, has not revealed how it plans to raise more than $70bn it needs to offer shareholders the $420 per share that Musk indicated.No board member has come forward to back the plan. In its statement, the board said the company’s chief executive had “addressed the funding for this to occur”.No bank or institution has come forward either. In a note to clients, Bernstein analyst Toni Sacconaghi asked: “What does Musk mean by ‘funding secured’? How could Tesla possibly fund such a large transaction?”But as the dust settles on Musk’s latest Twitter escapade, questions remain over whether the Tesla chief executive broke SEC guidelines by tweeting the news.Musk has 22.3 million followers on Twitter, and Tesla’s share price was already rising after the Financial Times reported that Saudi Arabia’s sovereign wealth fund had taken a $2bn stake in the company.“I do not believe this is the appropriate way to suggest going private,” Charles Elson, director of the John L Weinberg Center for Corporate Governance at the University of Delaware, told CNBC.Trading in Tesla was halted for an hour and a half on Tuesday afternoon, by which time the stock had soared to $370.Compliance experts are still arguing about whether Musk could face official censure.If the content of Musk’s tweet was not true, lawyers argue, it could expose Tesla’s mercurial chief executive officer and the company to regulatory action and private lawsuits.Former SEC chair Harvey Pitt told CNBC that while the US stock market regulator permits executives of publicly listed companies to use social media to make statements about their businesses, Musk’s tweet was still “highly unprecedented”.Asked if it could be considered securities fraud if it could be shown he was trying to manipulate the market, Pitt said: “It raises significant questions about what his intent was.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8033292183fbb0852f87335f5367a6fffedeb258/0_78_2070_1243/master/2070.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=40995981192bceaa11d9e5add642f6bc","title":"elon musk grumbles at short sellers but is private ownership right for tesla","story":"A buy-out could be done, but may not be the paradise the entrepreneur imaginesTesla’s Elon Musk isn’t the first chief executive to be infuriated by short-sellers, or to grumble about swings in the share price, or to complain that the outside world is stupidly obsessed by quarterly earnings figures. Prod most bosses of quoted companies and you’ll hear similar grumbles. The stock market can be ridiculously short-termist.Nor does the hostility land only at Musk’s door. One of the biggest and most loyal investors is Scottish Mortgage Investment Trust, a FTSE 100 company these days, and its co-manager, James Anderson, addressed the question of why Tesla is so hated in a blogpost last year. “At one stage last year I was receiving at least 10 emails a week denouncing us for owning Tesla in savage words,” he wrote. “We were told, for instance, that we would be featured in ‘the mutual fund hall of shame’ as a consequence.”Such threats of reputational damnation are absurd. Musk can be irascible and irritating – and his “pedo” tweet to the British er involved in Thailand cave rescue was disgraceful. But Tesla itself, if it succeeds, could be a genuinely interesting company for a lower-carbon economy. Its battery technology already seems more socially useful than anything that has emerged from, say, Facebook. Risk-taking investors who are prepared to fund such innovation should be applauded. The “negative propaganda”, as Musk calls it, seems wildly overdone, even if he provokes half the noise himself when he calls Wall Street analysts’ questions “bone-headed”.But there are two key questions about the take-private plan. Can it be achieved? Is it wise?Then there could be a whip-round among big backers to replace some of the shareholders who wish to sell at the proposed $420-a-share buy-out price. Saudi Arabia’s sovereign fund is a recent arrival on the register. Other sovereign wealth funds might be attracted. Then there’s Google, Apple, and Japan’s Softbank. All are flush with cash and unafraid to throw a few billions at capital-intensive projects for the long-term. A buy-out still sounds a stretch, but perhaps it could be done.The harder question to answer is whether private ownership would be really the paradise Musk seems to imagine. If the goal is to avoid distractions, then arranging and executing a $70bn deal seems an odd road to take. Even if new shareholders can be rounded up, the process will be fiddly and time consuming. Fixing the hiccups on the production lines might be a better use of Musk’s time over the next year.And what if, to fill the financing gaps, Tesla has to borrow heavily to get the buy-out across the line? The bark of short-sellers can be irritating, but banks and bondholders have bite in the form of legally enforceable rights of repayment. Musk should perhaps reflect that the rough and tumble of public markets hasn’t been pure hell. Capital has still flowed and his core group of shareholders has been prepared to ignore the scepticism. Life could be worse.He should also consider how Amazon, and even little ol’ Ocado in the UK, rode out the short-selling brigade. Answer: management got on with the job, ignored the “dreamer” insults, and offered fewer performance targets that were hostages to fortune. It is still possible to succeed in the public markets."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e5adeb1ee080784d3fb1c34c51394833a1656a83/0_112_4500_2700/master/4500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5cac8adee35bfc6b8567bdd44f3fbf54","title":"insatiable netflix comedy fat shaming","story":"The story of a girl who loses weight and takes revenge on her bullies has already inspired an online petition for ‘fat-shaming’ One of the recurring images on Netflix’s new show, Insatiable, is that of the show’s heroine, Patty, played by Debby Ryan, gorging on food. “While my classmates were out losing their virginity,” she says in the first episode, “I was at home stuffing another hole.” The show’s palpable disgust for Patty’s desire for food is visceral. Throughout the series, anytime Patty feels out-of-control, angry, desperate or sad, she immediately begins to binge, whether it’s handfuls of crawfish or gobs of birthday cake. Each time Patty goes on a binge, the camera homes in on her mouth as she shoves food in it, in a way that seems both joyless and fetishistic. Patty’s mouth is the iconic image for the title scene, too. At the start of each episode we see her beautifully made-up mouth with the word “Insatiable” in front of it. In one opening, Patty holds a match between her lips. In others, we see her mouth biting or inhaling the words in front of it. Each time, the trailer closes on her smile, as she shows off perfectly white teeth.Though the trailer for the series, which prompted a furious outcry among concerned viewers, seemed to suggest that this was a story of an overweight girl getting skinny and seeking revenge on those who bullied her, Insatiable is more accurately a story of a young woman who has a binge-eating disorder. In fact, one of the more offensive aspects of the series (and there are many aspects that are offensive) is that fatness itself is synonymous with disordered eating. Throughout the series, Patty’s weight is perceived as a kind of moral failing, as evidence that her desires are just completely out of control. Certainly, one of the “jokes” of the series is that thin Patty is flailing just as much as “Fatty Patty” did. Though she suddenly has tons of positive reinforcement about her looks, she doesn’t feel good about herself or her body. The years of being bullied still haunt her, and her response to any and all stress or setbacks is to act out in ways that are vicious, cruel or just plain crazy.Insatiable is clearly striving to be an edgy satire of our image-obsessed culture and our constant need for more, but the candy-colored veneer of the series never offers viewers an actual escape from the toxic tropes it attempts to skewer. In fact, the show often seems intent on embodying the very stereotypes that it claims to be dismantling. Patty is shown being teased mercilessly when she is fat, and then ogled constantly after she drops the weight. Her character has daddy issues, is a cutthroat and cruel pageant contestant, and has very few interests, ideas or thoughts outside of her looks (except for the fact that she really loves Drew Barrymore). The way that the camera focuses on Patty’s body in various scenes is often odd and distracting, and seems to emphasize that the viewer shouldn’t really be able to see Patty beyond her looks either.Other characters in the series are also presented as tropes that don’t get complicated in ways that are particularly interesting, and yet aren’t campy enough to get played off as simply absurd. We meet “trailer trash” characters with thick southern accents and tacky wardrobes, and the wealthy white collar strivers who are just as seedy and ridiculous under their fake veneer of elegance. We see the world of beauty pageants as being fake, charmless and ugly. Religious institutions are shown to be judgmental, foolish and patently unhelpful in the quest for spiritual enlightenment. There are jokes about race, sexual orientation and sexual molestation, all of which seem intent on being shocking, without being particularly funny. There are also a lot of dirty jokes based on a fast food place called Taco Weiner.Insatiable’s best qualities are its quick-paced plot and the fact that it doesn’t take itself too seriously. Its worst aspect though, and one that I view to be an irredeemable one, is the fact that it pretends that any of its messages are intended to help teenagers navigate a cruel world or feel better about themselves. In reality, Insatiable isn’t skewering the ridiculous expectations placed on teen girls it’s merely reiterating them. It doesn’t provide a sensitive and humorous reflection on the experience of binge eating disorder it’s placing Debby Ryan in a fat suit for cheap laughs.Insatiable’s arrival comes at an odd time, a season after Marti Noxon’s Dietland, a fantastic takedown of fat-shaming and the cruelty of beauty culture, and a few months after a company decided to start marketing weight loss reduction lollipops to teen girls and young women using bright pink colors and images of beautiful young women with heavily made-up lips delightedly sucking on lollipops instead of eating food. In response, you had some celebrities like Kim Kardashian West jump on the opportunist bandwagon (after receiving a lot of backlash from an Instagram post supporting the product, West deleted her post) and others like Jameela Jamil posting outrage about the ways that young women are taught to feel bad about themselves. It seems as though Insatiable is trying to straddle these two aspects of our current culture, attempting to attract earnest viewers who struggle with body image issues as well as viewers who would be more than happy to laugh at the life of a “former fat girl”.After the trailer for Insatiable aired, hundreds of thousands of people signed a petition for Netflix to cancel the series, arguing it would be dangerous for teen girls and anyone who struggles with eating. At first blush, this type of response is heartening, but I’ve been a cultural critic long enough to know that an explosion of cultural discourse, no matter how well-written and smart, isn’t necessarily enough to actually facilitate cultural change.

Having seen the reaction of audiences across the pond and around the world to this most recent season, we expect American viewers will be captivated by this engaging format.”Vuong said there was an intellectual aspect to her decision to acquire the programme for the US TV network. “Love Island is more than a pop sensation,” she said. “This series has generated compelling ‘sociological think pieces’ in major publications here and abroad.”Past series of the UK edition had already been showing on the American catch-up TV service Hulu, where it attracted a cult audience and baffled interest from highbrow US media outlets. The Washington Post concluded that American viewers were attracted “by the Britishness of it all”.“It’s a TV dating show that manages to be trashy, yet a tad classy,” the paper said.All global versions of Love Island are produced by local offshoots of ITV’s in-house production company, meaning the broadcaster stands to make a substantial amount of money as it is rolled out around the world. Foreign editions of the programme are already massive ratings successes in Germany and Australia, and further versions are due to launch in Sweden, Norway, Denmark and Finland."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cdf4f0a8d9d3d54d73b487cc643f911c462aa68b/0_147_4849_2910/master/4849.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bdb0eea7b5241c9fd6aac926e90c1ff2","title":"paul manafort trial rick gates testimony","story":"Defense lawyers bid to damage Gates’s credibility by asking if he failed to disclose four affairs – prompting an instant objectionDefence lawyers for Paul Manafort made a last-ditch attempt on Wednesday to torpedo the key witness at his trial by asking whether he failed to disclose four extramarital affairs.Attorney Kevin Downing suggested the revelation would destroy Rick Gates’s plea agreement with the special counsel’s office but was blocked by an instant government objection.The drama came at the end of Gates’s testimony in the trial of his former boss and mentor Manafort, an ex-Donald Trump campaign chairman accused of bank fraud and tax evasion.Manafort and Gates were the first two iniduals indicted in Mueller’s investigation into potential collusion between Russia and the Trump campaign. The case has little to do with either man’s work for the Trump campaign, which has only tangentially figured in the trial. In a final back and forth between lawyers over Gates’s credibility, the focus turned to his decision to plead guilty and cooperate with special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation, which Manafort’s defence have portrayed as an attempt to save his own skin.Gates told the court in Alexandria, Virginia, that he had met with government lawyer Greg Andres and FBI agents 20 times and been told only to tell the truth, without any guarantee that he will be spared prison. Andres put it to him: “As you sit here today, do you have any doubt that if you lie, the special counsel’s office will rip up your plea agreement?”Gates said he did not.Downing then noted how on Tuesday he had referred to the witness’s “secret life”, in particular an extra-marital affair he conducted in London, that involved lavish spending on flights and hotels. “You said you had a made mistake,” the lawyer said.Downing followed up: “Do you remember telling the office of the special counsel you actually engaged in four extramarital affairs?”Andres quickly rose to his feet to interrupt: “Objection! Relevance.”Downing responded that the question goes to whether Downing told the truth to the special counsel or whether the plea agreement should be ripped up – potentially devastating to the government’s case and to the public perception of special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation into Russian election interference.Judge TS Ellis III called both legal teams to the bench for a private conference. A device was activated to generate white noise so their conversation could not be heard. People in the packed public gallery could only try to lipread as they saw a grim-faced Andres make a series of hand gestures.Gates, meanwhile, wearing dark blue suit, white shirt and red tie, cut a lonely figure at the witness stand, blinking hard. His seat was turned at such an angle that there was no risk of eye contact with Manafort.After about five minutes, the judge and lawyers returned to their positions, and Downing appeared to have lost the battle. He asked a broader question about Gates spending beyond his means to fund a secret life.“Mr Downing, I’ve made many mistakes over many years,” said Gates, before being cut off by the judge, who snapped: “This isn’t the time for that.”Gates, also a former Trump campaign aide, has claimed during three days of evidence that he both stole for and stole from Manafort, who denies 18 counts of bank and tax fraud and failing to disclose foreign bank accounts. He testified that he and Manafort knew they were committing crimes for years, concealing money in foreign bank accounts and falsifying bank loan documents.On Wednesday, Gates initially testified Manafort told him to be truthful during a 2014 interview with the FBI about offshore shell companies and bank accounts that contained millions of dollars in proceeds from their Ukrainian political work. However, Gates also said the agents did not ask about tax returns and “the majority of the Cypriot accounts were closed” at the stage.Andres questioned: “Did you tell the FBI there was hidden income in those accounts?”The interview was part of an FBI investigation that sought to recover assets looted from the Ukrainian government under former president Viktor Yanukovych. Gates and Manafort were not targets of the FBI at the time of the interview.More recently, after the launch of the Mueller investigation but before his plea bargain, Gates lied to the FBI about a meeting between Manafort and an unnamed US Congressman regarding a “specific issue”. The meeting has previously been cited in court documents.“You knowingly made a false statement to the FBI?” Andres asked on Wednesday. “Yes,” Gates answered."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1b3e83b2f8082b618ff04d3af617351c306b92ca/0_120_3600_2160/master/3600.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=753ae3698b76c9e5deee10fe06159321","title":"puerto rico hurricane maria electricity ten months","story":"Almost a year after Hurricane Maria ravaged the island’s ailing power infrastructure, the Ruiz family is one of 1,000 still off the grid They have eaten by candlelight for the past 10 months, powerless and isolated.Their small home, with its wooden walls and tin roof, nestled high up in the hills of Utuado province, somehow survived Hurricane Maria without a scratch. Most others in the surrounding area of this mountainous region were swept apart by the wind. But the hurricane’s raw strength last September didn’t leave everything on their property unscathed. It uprooted a mango tree a few metres down their steep pathway, which crashed onto a pylon that had brought electricity up the slope for 23 years and cut this family of four off from the grid for almost a year.They were among the remaining 1,000 households in Puerto Rico – almost all living in poorer, remote communities – without electricity in July after Maria practically knocked out the island’s entire ailing power infrastructure.The months without electricity have taken their toll. Diana, a mother of four, no longer takes her digestive medicine because she has nowhere to keep it cool. They eat tinned food – beef, fish and vegetables – which preserves in the humidity, but costs far more. They lug bags of ice up the steep mountainside four times a week to keep it in picnic coolers.“They treat people who live in places like this like we matter less, and as if we don’t have the capacity or class to learn,” she said, explaining that power crews here had told the family their home was too remote to prioritize for reconnection. “I’m saying this from my soul.”Jose Ruiz Gonzalez, Diana’s husband of 26 years, is the family’s sole earner, bringing in a salary of $7.25 an hour cutting fabrics at a local textile factory. The money was not enough to buy a generator. But after six months without power, the factory offered a donation and purchased one for the family.Still, the petrol prices meant they could barely afford to keep it running. On some evenings they turned it on to watch a DVD together as a family. On Saturdays they turned it on for four hours to get the washing machine running.Life had become about adaptation. Their porchway is lined with solar powered bulbs that charge in the sun. They all wake at sunrise to make best use of the daylight. Their fridge – redundant without continuous power – functioned as a bookshelf for 20-year-old Leidianne Ruiz-Vera’s college materials. It is stacked full of encyclopedias and books on astrology, art history and geometry that Diana, determined her children succeed in education, has collected over the years.“I couldn’t finish college education because of the fees,” said Diana. “But I wanted all my kids to learn and go to school. Even if their home is made of wood and tin, they should be proud of where they came from.”On the day the  visited the Ruiz family in mid-July, the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority (Prepa), the island’s embattled, sole electric provider, was in the midst of another scandal. As the Puerto Rican government begins the process of privatising the bankrupt company in around $9bn debt, it was announced its newly appointed CEO, Rafael Díaz Granados, had been granted a $750,000 annual salary.After initially attempting to defend the amount, Granados left the job after just one day in office. He was the fifth Prepa CEO to depart in the space of a year, amid corruption allegations and accusations of serious mismanagement. The authority did not put up an official for interview despite multiple requests.“It’s an indignity,” said Jose Ruiz Gonzalez. “The country is broke. And all the government is doing is cutting here, cutting there, laying people off, and then using the savings to executives and lawyers and exorbitant private contracts.”After the  raised the Ruiz family’s case with local Prepa officials, their power was eventually reconnected at the end of July. It has since been cut off twice again but was restored last week. Prepa officials say around 250 households remain without power on the island. The agency hopes to restore power to the remaining groups by this week. A few miles across the valley from the Ruiz family’s home, a crew of Prepa linesman were battling the overgrowth to restore power to another household high in the mountains.This group of six men have worked six day weeks, on 14-hour shifts, since Hurricane Maria hit. They are all exhausted. “We leave for work under the cover of darkness, and return home after the sun sets,” said Heriberto Velez, the group’s supervisor.They had restored power to this farmhouse a month ago. It had taken three days, wading through long grass peppered with fire ants and trees littered with wasp nests, to connect a new line. But a falling tree had knocked out their work earlier in the week, and so they were forced to return, driving their ageing service trucks and a 1978 Jeep along the precarious mountain roads for over an hour. Their day’s repair work underlined how fragile the island’s power system remains. In May, a former Prepa director warned it would take an additional $9bn to modernize the grid, which relies on infrastructure around three times older than the industry average.The linesman here were also furious at the government’s decision to hand over part of the restoration work to a number of private companies, claiming their counterparts were paid higher wages (Prepa linesman are paid $20 an hour) for doing the same work.“We’ve had no holidays,” Velez said. “We’re exhausted now – 10 months of doing this work.”The entire crew, just like the Ruiz family, had sat at home petrified as another tropical weather front approached the island earlier in the week. Reports had initially indicated that Beryl could hit Puerto Rico as a category two hurricane, but it was eventually downgraded to a tropical storm, leading to flash flooding and temporary power outages across the island.“The system is so sensitive. If another hurricane hit it would just be terrible,” said Velez as his crew chainsawed the surrounding foliage and hoisted the line back into position. “I don’t even want to think about it, to be honest.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bc02d1bce5732a58dcea9d334f16f9045147c871/9_0_2483_1491/master/2483.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b968657b6e47025b85c122a74d8f3d63","title":"saudi arabia canada latest egypt russia","story":"Foreign minister Adel al-Jubeir refused to back down from spat on Wednesday as Egypt and Russia express support for Saudi ArabiaSaudi Arabia has refused to back down from its escalating diplomatic dispute with Canada, saying that Ottawa knows what it needs to do to “fix its big mistake”.Speaking to reporters on Wednesday, Adel al-Jubeir, Saudi Arabia’s foreign minister, said the kingdom was still “considering additional measures” against Canada. He did not elaborate.“There is nothing to mediate. A mistake has been made and a mistake should be corrected,” he told a news conference in Riyadh.Several countries have expressed support for Saudi Arabia, including Egypt and Russia, which both told Ottawa it was unacceptable to lecture the kingdom on human rights.“We have always said that the politicisation of human rights matters is unacceptable,” Maria Zakharova, a spokesperson for Russia’s foreign ministry, told reporters on Wednesday. “What one probably needs in this situation is constructive advice and assistance rather than criticism from a ‘moral superior’,” she added.Meanwhile, the United States – one of Canada’s closest allies – has so far refused to wade into the row.“It’s up for the government of Saudi Arabia and the Canadians to work this out,” said Heather Nauert, a spokesperson for the state department, on Tuesday. “Both sides need to diplomatically resolve this together. We can’t do it for them.”The United Kingdom was similarly muted in its response, with a foreign office spokeswoman saying: “Canada and Saudi Arabia are both close partners of the UK, and we urge restraint during the current situation,” a foreign office spokeswoman said.The spat began last week when Canada’s foreign ministry expressed its concern over the arrest of Saudi civil society and women’s rights activists.Saudi Arabia shot back on Sunday, expelling the Canadian ambassador and freezing new trade with Canada.In the days following the kingdom has continued to announce measures against Canada, including urgent plans to remove tens of thousands of Saudi students and an unspecified number of medical patients from Canada.Saudi Arabia’s state airline said it would suspend flights to and from Canada, starting next week.Saudi Arabia’s main state wheat buying agency, the Saudi Grains Organization, has also told grains exporters it will no longer accept Canadian-origin grains in its international purchase tenders, according to European traders. Analysts and regional officials say that Riyadh’s actions have little to do with Canada instead, the kingdom’s actions are a broader signal to western governments that any criticism of its domestic policies is unacceptable.“Canada is an easy target because our bilateral economic ties are limited,” said Bessma Momani, a political science professor at Canada’s University of Waterloo Momani, on Twitter. Annual Saudi-Canadian trade hovers around $4bn.  Responding to a question about the reason for the activists’ arrests, Saudi Arabia’s foreign minister said that charges against them would be made public once their cases reach the courts, repeating earlier allegations that they had been in touch with foreign entities.On Monday, Canada’s foreign minister, Chrystia Freeland, said her government – which has come under fire previously for signing off on the sale of more than 900 armoured vehicles to Riyadh – would continue to call for the release of the detained activists. “I will say Canada is very comfortable with our position,” she told reporters. “We are always going to speak up for human rights, we’re always going to speak up for women’s rights, and that is not going to change.”This article contains material by Reuters"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5befc623e90698615f7a81454712a6186f35570e/0_186_2800_1680/master/2800.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=191ede206cf0b677dcf0fd94d3a7bdc4","title":"north korea leader kim jong un inspects things in pictures","story":"Images of the dictator on tour offer insights on the life of one of the world’s most secretive rulers – and serve to bolster the cult of personality surrounding him"},{"url":null,"title":"a day of celebration and singing as women s hockey team are welcomed home","story":"  August 6, 2018Tears as Minister for Sport announces \u0026euro1.5 million in extra funding for teams preparing for the Olympic Games in Tokyo in 2020   August 6, 2018Team greeted with a joyous and emotional homecoming as sights now set on Olympics   August 7, 2018Minister says an additional \u0026euro1.5m is to be allocated to high performance teams   August 6, 2018Losing World Cup final to superior Netherlands team has not shaken their self-belief "},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3584276.1533214652!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"united ireland the south of ireland doesn t want us and can t afford us","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tFormer first minister Peter Robinson at the MacGill Summer School in Glenties. Photograph: North West NewspixOmagh man Kevin Skelton shakes his head when asked what he thinks about former DUP leader Peter Robinson’s advice to unionists that they need to think about preparing for a Border poll which could lead to Irish unity.He later pleaded guilty in an Irish court to unlawful assembly, and paid a large fine, thus avoiding a jail term but earning the nickname, Peter the Punt. “I know what I’d do with a Border poll, where I’d push it,” says Skelton.“I couldn’t give a hoot, couldn’t care less. The south of Ireland doesn’t want us, doesn’t need us and can’t afford us. If the vote was held on both sides of the Border they’d likely reject us. Peter Robinson and Mary Lou McDonald would be better putting their time into getting the assembly back together. There’s none of them wants to deal with the past.”Skelton’s wife Mena was one of the 31 people (including unborn twins) murdered in Omagh when the Real IRA’s massive 1998 carbomb exploded without warning on Main Street. Prepared in the Republic, it had been driven north, passing through Clontibret, and across the border into Tyrone.Relatives and friends are bracing themselves for the 20th anniversary on the 15th of this month. The views of the survivors are as erse as the backgrounds from which their loved ones came and Skelton does not claim to speak for anyone other than himself, though his anger at what he sees as the neglect of the victims is widely shared. He thinks a Border poll is irrelevant, and that Brexit is the critical issue.“My fear is that Brexit could start the Troubles up again. I’d be out of here if there was a hard border,” he said. However, he also believes that the real Border in Northern Ireland is the river Bann. The newly released NI statistics on deprivation support his view that the most prosperous areas are in the northeast, with the western Border areas among the most disadvantaged.“Omagh was already struggling on the shavings from the table, and it never recovered from the bomb,” said Skelton. “It is well on its way to being a ghost town.”Further north and further west, the city of Derry has lately been in the news because of a flare up of street violence among young people under the influence of dissident republicans. The violence included sectarian attacks on the Fountain estate, a tiny unionist enclave alongside the old city walls on the by now almost entirely nationalist west bank of the river Foyle.On Wednesday night a remarkably civil and wideranging debate took place on the other side of the river, the largely unionist Waterside, in a Protestant church hall. Sinn Féin president Mary Lou McDonald and DUP MP and chief whip Jeffrey Donaldson were among the speakers discussing the future of the Northern state.The event was one of 40 in the New Gate Fringe Festival, organised by the North West Cultural Partnership, which includes the Londonderry Bands Forum the membership of which is drawn from young men from some of the most deprived loyalist estates in the region. Public debates including working class nationalists and republicans have long been a feature of Northern political life. An audience predominantly made up, as this one was, of working class unionists is far more rare.“What’s your take, Sir Jeffrey?” said June Elder. Donaldson said the DUP was very clear on the question. “Peter does not speak for the DUP. He is retired. I do,” he said. “I don’t share his view.”Considering such a poll would polarise people and cause further ision, he had not had a single email from a constituent about it. “We are preparing for Brexit.”Elder came back after his response with a supplementary question. “So was Peter just off on a rant?” she asked. “No,” said Donaldson with a tight smile. “He was expressing his opinion.”“Well,” retorted Elder, sceptically, to laughter. “My TV shows the same as yours.”Joe Thompson said he was a unionist but he was angry with the DUP. “For decades they’ve insisted this part of the country is British and now with Brexit they say it can’t be treated any differently from England, Scotland and Wales,” he said. “But people are treated differently when it comes to reproductive rights, marriage rights and the Irish language act.”Donaldson said devolution meant that different parts of the UK would have different laws. He said the place to legislate for the issues Thompson raised was at Stormont and reiterated his party leader Arlene Foster’s accusation that Sinn Féin was “holding to ransom” the parties which wished to resume powersharing. “We no longer have a veto,” he said, pointing out that to use a “petition of concern” to block new legislation 30 votes were needed. “We only have 28,” he said.McDonald retorted that Foster had just that morning backed the use of a blocking mechanism to prevent a local council from flying the rainbow flag this weekend, Saturday August 4th, as part of LGBTQ Pride events around the North.Afterwards, Thompson, who works in Derry and lives in Mid Ulster, told The  he was not satisfied with Donaldson’s response. “The DUP is coming across as just so arrogant,” he said. “They’d get their 30 votes to block progressive change – they know it and so do we. I support the union but I vote Alliance now. Peter Robinson was right to say what he did about a Border poll. It is going to happen and the chaos that followed the Brexit vote showed that we need preparations.”The audience at the debate strikingly included many young people. On his way out after an intense 2½ hours, Chris Smith said a Border poll would be pointless. “It is not a question people need answered,” he said. “I am a unionist and I want the politicians either to get Stormont up and running or go back to Direct Rule. As it is we are losing out every way. My girlfriend works in the NHS here and she has just had to forego a payrise that colleagues elsewhere are getting. My mate is a firefighter but because of cuts his job is about to be lost.”Julia Kee, a community worker on a programme made possible by the EU’s Peace 4 funding, shared this view. “We have more important things to be thinking about than a Border poll,” she said. “I am a unionist and we have been hearing nothing but this anti-choice, anti-LGBT rights talk from the DUP.“The political impasse is creating political unrest around Northern Ireland including here in this city,” she said. “Then you get politicians calling young people scumbags and that does not help.”Hospital consultant Fergal McNicholl is from Greysteel, the Co Derry village which became internationally known after loyalists burst into a pub there in 1993 and sprayed it with gunfire, killing eight people. He came to the debate at the invitation of his friend, Dave Duggan, a writer from the city.“I felt quite privileged to be here tonight,” said McNicholl. “It was very impressive that they got a mixed audience and the fact that there was no tension was a massive step forward.” He was not inclined to favour preparing for a Border poll. “The territorial issue puts our identity back into conflict – I quite like it the way it was,” he said. “There was a period where I felt I could be comfortably Irish in this town and live beside someone who was comfortably British. Brexit has already raised territorial issues. It makes things harder. It unsettles us.”Georgina Campbell is a young dancer. She told the panel that she was worried and wanted to know if, in a new Ireland, the likes of her would have a place. She said that the Highland dancing that is her medium is rooted in British military history and that the highest honour available is to dance for the queen. Afterwards, she explained that a Border poll meant nothing to her.“We should just have a government,” she said. “My three best friends are nationalist girls who are self-employed artists. Highland dancers and Irish dancers work together on a regular basis, but a lot of our cultural activities are in our own communities. Northern Ireland is unique and special. We need to embrace it and we need to market it. It is just this big mad eclectic place. I love it so much – I’ll never move away.”"},{"url":null,"title":"nasas daring mission touch sun explained","story":"Nasa is preparing to embark on a daring mission to touch the sun on Saturday,  aiming to go closer than any other spacecraft has ventured.The Parker Solar Probe will endure wicked heat while zooming through the solar corona to study this outermost part of the stellar atmosphere that gives rise to the solar wind.The launch is currently targeted for August 11 at 3:33 a.m. EDT (8.33am BST), with an extended launch window through to August 23.To send a probe where you haven\u0027t been before is ambitious. To send it into such brutal conditions is highly ambitious, Nicola Fox, a project scientist from the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory, said.The project, with a $1.5 billion price tag, is the first major mission under Nasa\u0027s Living With a Star programme.Nasa is hoping to use the data collected from the probe to help astronomers predict solar storms and explain some of the deepest mysteries surrounding our source of light and heat.The probe, named after American solar astrophysicist Eugene Newman Parker, is set to use seven Venus flybys over nearly seven years to steadily reduce its orbit around the Sun, using instruments designed to image the solar wind and study electric and magnetic fields, coronal plasma and energetic particles.Nasa aims to collect data about the inner workings of the highly magnetized corona.Although 4 million miles sounds like a long way by our tiny standards here on Earth, being that close to the sun is likely to be a risk for the spacecraft.For example, by orbiting the sun at a distance of between 28 and 43 million miles, Mercury\u0027s surface and atmosphere have been completely changed by the constant stream of radiation and particles from the sun.It has been outfitted with a heat shield designed to keep its instruments at a tolerable 29 degrees Celsius even as the spacecraft faces temperatures reaching nearly 1,370 degrees Celsius at its closest pass.The closest a spacecraft has been before is when Helios 2 came within 27 million miles of the sun in 1976. By way of comparison, the average distance from the Sun for Earth is 93 million miles.Technicians and engineers perform light bar testing on NASA\u0026#39s Parker Solar Probe at the Astrotech processing facility in TitusvilleThe information collected from the probe is likely to help future generations of humans, who may one day live outside the Earth\u0027s atmosphere.Our world has since grown ever more dependent on a network of technology – both in orbit and on our planet\u0027s surface – that\u0027s vulnerable to a threat we barely understand.These people will need the knowledge to protect themselves from severe winds of charged particles and radiation.The resulting data will improve forecasts of major space-weather events that impact life on Earth, as well as satellites and astronauts in space.Alex Young, a solar scientist at NASA\u0027s Goddard Space Flight Centre in Maryland, said it was of fundamental importance for us to be able to predict this space weather, much like we predict weather here on Earth.In the most extreme cases of these space weather events, it can actually affect our power grids here on Earth, he added.Please review our commenting policyComment: The burka looks ridiculous, and those who defend it do Muslim women like me no favoursGirl, nine, dies after being struck by rock fall in Staithes, North Yorkshire Comment: The harrying of British veterans over Bloody Sunday is macabre and unfair Burkas are like wearing a crucifix and should be defended, says Ruth Davidson, as Boris row escalatesHomeless people wearing barcodes to accept cashless paymentsRecord numbers of women run for America\u0026#39s highest officesCalais migrant aid groups claim Britons are being \u0026#39singled out\u0026#39 with police intimidationEdinburgh and Glasgow universities allocate all remaining Scottish clearing places to poor applicantsEaster Island seeks return of \u0026#39stolen\u0026#39 Moai statue from the British MuseumGermany agrees deal with Spain to return migrants who registered there firstMissing child found dead at squalid New Mexico hideoutComment: With waiting times at an all-time high, we must make it easier to recruit GPs from abroadPrincess Beatrice turns 30: A look at how her fashion has evolvedChris Collins: Republican Congressman charged with insider trading vows to clear his nameAir-to-air missile \u0026#39accidentally fired\u0026#39 by Spanish Typhoon jet over EstoniaComment: Don\u0026#39t trust the \u0026#39natural birth\u0026#39 myth.

But the drought conditions in the state of New South Wales this year have been the driest and most widespread since 1965.The state government said Wednesday that 100 percent of New South Wales\u0027 land area of more than 800,000 square kilometers (309,000 square miles) was now in drought.Primary Industries Minister Niall Blair said farmers were enduring one of the driest Southern Hemisphere winters on record.This is tough. There isn\u0027t a person in the state that isn\u0027t hoping to see some rain for our farmers and regional communities, Blair said in a statement.Cattle on a dry paddock in the drought-hit area of Quirindi in New South WalesFarm reservoirs have dried up and crops are failing.State and federal governments are providing financial help, but not enough for many farmers.With dry conditions forecast to continue for the next three months, farmers had to decide whether to continue the expensive and laborious task of hand-feeding cattle and sheep or sell their livestock.The state government on Wednesday also lifted the number of kangaroos that farmers are allowed to shoot and reduced bureaucratic red tape facing land holders applying for permission to shoot.Farmer Clive Barton walking through the paddocks in the drought-hit area of Duri in New South WalesThe requirement to tag dead kangaroos to keep a tally of the number shot across the state had been dispensed with.Many farmers are taking livestock off their paddocks, only to then see kangaroos move in and take whatever is left, Blair said.If we don\u0027t manage this situation, we will start to see tens of thousands of kangaroos starving and suffering, ultimately leading to a major animal welfare crisis, he added.A train makes its way through dry paddocks in the drought-hit area of Quirindi in New South WalesBut Ray Borda, president of the Kangaroo Industries Association of Australia, which represents commercial shooters who hunt kangaroos for meat and leather, raised animal welfare concerns about the regulation changes.Anybody on the land that will make a phone call to the Department of Environment can get permission to shoot almost whatever they want to shoot and it\u0027s unaudited and unchecked and that\u0027s our concern - animal welfare, Borda told Australian Broadcasting Corp.The government would have been better off subsidizing professional shooters to reduce kangaroo numbers more humanely, he said.We see this as probably the worst possible outcome for the kangaroo, but I\u0027ve got to emphasize we do understand the plight that farmers are in, Borda said. Please review our commenting policyComment: The burka looks ridiculous, and those who defend it do Muslim women like me no favoursGirl, nine, dies after being struck by rock fall in Staithes, North Yorkshire Comment: The harrying of British veterans over Bloody Sunday is macabre and unfair Burkas are like wearing a crucifix and should be defended, says Ruth Davidson, as Boris row escalatesHomeless people wearing barcodes to accept cashless paymentsRecord numbers of women run for America\u0026#39s highest officesCalais migrant aid groups claim Britons are being \u0026#39singled out\u0026#39 with police intimidationEdinburgh and Glasgow universities allocate all remaining Scottish clearing places to poor applicantsEaster Island seeks return of \u0026#39stolen\u0026#39 Moai statue from the British MuseumGermany agrees deal with Spain to return migrants who registered there firstMissing child found dead at squalid New Mexico hideoutComment: With waiting times at an all-time high, we must make it easier to recruit GPs from abroadPrincess Beatrice turns 30: A look at how her fashion has evolvedChris Collins: Republican Congressman charged with insider trading vows to clear his nameAir-to-air missile \u0026#39accidentally fired\u0026#39 by Spanish Typhoon jet over EstoniaComment: Don\u0026#39t trust the \u0026#39natural birth\u0026#39 myth.

I don’t like the veil, and like Boris I would never seek to ban it. But the growth of young women wearing it in the UK is concerning, and it’s something we all need to talk about.My friend and I have had long debates about her choice to wear the veil. As much as she believes it is part of her faith, I feel that it is and was actually a reaction to an identity crisis at a difficult time in her life. After the death of her father she looked to her faith for comfort, and in a post-911 world that faith – which is also mine – had become a political one.To continue reading this articleStart your free trial of PremiumAccess all Premium articles then only £2 per weekAccess one Premium article per weekRegister for freeStart an annual subscription and receive a Fitbit Versa, worth £199View all subscription options\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp|LoginPlease review our commenting policyGirl, nine, dies after being struck by rock fall in Staithes, North Yorkshire Comment: The harrying of British veterans over Bloody Sunday is macabre and unfair Burkas are like wearing a crucifix and should be defended, says Ruth Davidson, as Boris row escalatesHomeless people wearing barcodes to accept cashless paymentsRecord numbers of women run for America\u0026#39s highest officesCalais migrant aid groups claim Britons are being \u0026#39singled out\u0026#39 with police intimidationEdinburgh and Glasgow universities allocate all remaining Scottish clearing places to poor applicantsEaster Island seeks return of \u0026#39stolen\u0026#39 Moai statue from the British MuseumGermany agrees deal with Spain to return migrants who registered there firstMissing child found dead at squalid New Mexico hideoutComment: With waiting times at an all-time high, we must make it easier to recruit GPs from abroadPrincess Beatrice turns 30: A look at how her fashion has evolvedChris Collins: Republican Congressman charged with insider trading vows to clear his nameAir-to-air missile \u0026#39accidentally fired\u0026#39 by Spanish Typhoon jet over EstoniaComment: Don\u0026#39t trust the \u0026#39natural birth\u0026#39 myth.

In 2009, the EU successfully pressured 14 companies including Apple and Samsung to work towards all using the same charging ports from 2011.But those phones all still use different wires. While many companies have moved towards the USB-C standard, Apple\u0027s iPhones\u0026nbspstill use the Lightning port that has been present in all of the recent models.Now Reuters reports EU regulators are frustrated with the lack of progress and might look into different ways of forcing companies to adopt the same standards.“Given the unsatisfactory progress with this voluntary approach, the Commission will shortly launch an impact assessment study to evaluate costs and benefits of different other options,” competition chief Margrethe Vestager said in a response to questions from EU politicians.It would be very unlikely indeed that Apple would ever allow anyone else to use its Lightning connector, which is proprietary and available only on Apple devices.As such, any effort to standardise the chargers would almost certainly mean that Apple would have to move towards another open connector, such as USB-C.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/06/12/15/the-meg-0.jpg?width=1000\u0026amp;height=614\u0026amp;fit=bounds\u0026amp;format=pjpg\u0026amp;auto=webp\u0026amp;quality=70\u0026amp;crop=16:9,offset-y0.5  on= tap:gallery-lightbox-6313726  role= photo  tabindex= 0  layout= fill  alt= The Meg  srcset= https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/06/12/15/the-meg-0.jpg","title":"kathleen turner friends interview hollywood michael douglas jennifer aniston","story":"Created with Sketch.Actress spoke at length about her storied career, experiences with sexism, and what she thought of the \u0027Friends\u0027 castClick to followThe Independent CultureKathleen Turner calls Friends cast \u0027unwelcoming and cliquey\u0027 in frank interview about her Hollywood careerKathleen Turner has criticised the way she was treated during her time on the hit sitcom\u0026nbspFriends.\u0026nbspThere are several talking points from the interview, including her refusal to be typecast, which saw her take aim at one unnamed actress for playing the same role for 20 years.\u0026nbspFirst look at Margot Robbie as Sharon Tate in new Tarantino filmJohnny Depp film pulled from cinemas weeks before releaseMatthew Perry \u0027rushed to hospital\u0027 after suffering ruptured bowelShe even looks pretty much the same, she said.

(Image: )He added: Legally, UK councils are not required to provide public toilets, however, these have been a common part of the High Street for more than a century.In most cases, the reduction is a result of government budget cuts that mean many local authorities can no longer afford to maintain public toilets.Some local areas are without a single free-to-use public toilet.This presents a challenge for many but especially for those iniduals who rely upon more frequent access to a bathroom such as parents with young children and those with medical conditions.The spokesman added: Businesses that sign up to Use Our Loos can expect to benefit from their new open-door policy.

The public are also invited to urge their local businesses to join the scheme.Council budgets are to blame for the lack of public toilets (Image: )Raymond Martin, Director of the British Toilet Association, said: We know that councils are under immense pressure with their budgets and despite having no legal obligation to maintain these public facilities, they have continued to try to halt the rapid rate of decline.They are constantly looking at alternative ideas, such as inidual Community Toilet Schemes, to provide reasonable provision for their communities.Use our Loos is a community-oriented solution not about opening more public toilets but making more toilets public that already exist. Rebecca Light, of Unilever UK, said: We believe everyone deserves access to a clean, safe lavatory.In the UK the problem is locating a public toilet when we\u0027re out and about, in other countries the problem is far more serious.An estimated 2.3 billion people worldwide lack access to clean, safe sanitation while around 892 million don\u0027t have sanitation facilities at all.This comes with significant health risks, including diseases like diarrhoea, which kills one child every two minutes.

Available only to the elite few who could afford them at first, they were designed purely to enable people to take a call while away from home.Fast forward a couple of decades and we are all glued to our devices, a nation of addicts.We are now so wedded to our smartphones that we check them every 12 minutes.The average Brit spends more than a day a week online, twice as long as ten years ago.This surge in time online is largely down to the rise of smartphones, which are now used by 78 per cent of the population compared with just 17 per cent in 2008.My personal bugbear is people who walk along the street in a slow zig-zag because they are glued to their phone.And there’s nothing worse than someone who interrupts a conversation to take a call or read a text.It surely can’t be a coincidence that, in the same week as this report was released, we hear about five-year-olds starting school unable to speak in sentences — partly, no doubt, down to parents plugging them into a screen rather than talking or reading to them.I’ve got a Blackberry, mainly because I like the keyboard. But I am probably as hooked on it as the next person.It’s an invaluable tool for anyone wanting to work flexibly. But I also do a fair amount of pointless surfing on it.I’m not into all forms of social media, but I am a bit of a news junkie and I’ll confess I also watch the odd funny YouTube film with my kids.Unfortunately, progress in technology has brought the idea that we “should” all be available 24/7.In fact, people are quite indignant if you don’t reply to an email within the hour — even if it’s sent at 4am.Being a conscientious type, the result for me if I’m not careful, is that if I wake up in the night I’ll check my emails and maybe even reply to a few before going back to sleep. Now that can’t be good for the old circadian rhythms.The other problem with everyone being always available and always “on” is that our FOMO — fear of missing out — has increased exponentially.We’re all terrified that if we’re offline for too long we won’t get to . . . what exactly? See photos of someone’s hashtag perfect holibobs with the famalam — and then feel like our life is rubbish by comparison?I use Twitter a bit but I avoid Facebook and Instagram, partly because I don’t want the possibility that the opinions and “likes” of people I don’t know may influence me more than my own values and views.And another problem with the prevalence of tech is that we don’t have any down time.All those previously blank moments — on the bus, waiting for our microwave meal to cook, lying in bed at night — have all become an opportunity to surf, tweet, and message. We are going to burn out if we aren’t careful.I always know when I’m really relaxed because I accidentally go out without my phone.Granted, it generally only happens when I’m on holiday.But now I know how close we are to becoming actual addicts, I feel like we should all build in some time away from our devices.After all, the more time we spend looking at a screen, the less time we spend looking at the world and engaging with other people.So maybe we should all take a moment to leave our phone at home, go for a walk, and switch from “on” to “off”.Isn’t that a liberating thought?I’M sure a fair few people felt a bit guilty reading about the Vogue interview with Princesses Beatrice and Eugenie this week.The sisters talk about how hard it is living in the public eye but also the criticism and mockery they face, often attacked for taking too many holidays.Who knows, perhaps some of that criticism is justified.But a lot of the comments they get are about their appearance and clothes – and that is where it crosses a line.No-one chooses the family into which they are born, and they are trying to make the best of the hand they’ve been given.They are trying to build careers and have a personal life while being in the public eye and that can’t be easy.I hope people realise that and give them a break.HAVING spent the past couple of decades getting annoyed at anyone who utters the words “Poor Jennifer Aniston”, this week, for the first time ever, I said them myself.You know why?Because the 49-year-old has been forced to publicly address, again, the tedious topic of why she hasn’t had a baby.She also alluded to something no woman should have to share with anyone they don’t want to, let alone the world – the fact she might be medically unable to procreate.Poor Jen. She can’t just get on with her very successful – and no doubt happy – life without being plagued by speculation.In the same interview she took the chance to spell it out: Just because she split from Justin Theroux doesn’t mean her life is over.She might even be happy to have finally got shot of him.“The misconceptions are ‘Jen can’t keep a man’,” she said. “And ‘Jen refuses to have a baby because she’s selfish and committed to her career.’ Or that I’m sad and heartbroken . . . first, with all due respect, I’m not heartbroken. And second, those are reckless assumptions.“No one knows what’s going on behind closed doors. No one considers how sensitive that might be for my partner and me. They don’t know what I’ve been through medically or emotionally.“There is a pressure on women to be mothers, and if they are not, then they’re deemed damaged goods. Maybe my purpose on this planet isn’t to procreate. Maybe I have other things I’m supposed to do.”So yes. Poor, poor Jen being under the world’s watchful and pitying eye all the time.Just to remind people. Jennifer Aniston is one of the world’s most successful stars.She has a big group of friends and a beautiful home, which she bought herself. She has dogs she adores, she’s funny, busy, and fulfilled.But all of that is worth nothing, of course. She doesn’t have kids.To anyone reading this who thinks women must have children to be fulfilled, please take note: Plenty of women don’t want to get married or have kids.Many other women want kids but can’t have them.And guess what? It’s none of our business.Here’s another way of looking at Jennifer’s life. She is lucky.She gets to please herself and hasn’t had to make any of the sacrifices that many of us make to become mothers.Also, George Clooney didn’t meet Amal until he was 51. Hugh Grant got married this year at 57 (after many failed relationships). Leonardo DiCaprio, 43, and Jude Law, 45, are still single and dating. Has anyone ever said: “Poor George/Hugh/Leonardo/Jude”?Of course they haven’t. So let’s stop saying it about Jennifer, too.I SO related to Carol Vorderman’s delight at being asked for proof of age when she bought some wine at M\u0026ampS recently.When you’re young, being asked to prove your age, as the presenter, above, was is very annoying. But as time goes by it’s one of life’s little victories.Having said that, this hasn’t happened to me in Aldi. Maybe I ought to go to M\u0026ampS!I’M truly appalled by the news that the Home Office “turns a blind eye” to the plight of British teenagers who are being forced to marry abroad, then raped and impregnated – after which the ministerial department actually hands a visa to their husbands.These young British women in question are forced abroad, or told they are going on holiday, but in reality are forced into a marriage and to get pregnant so that they can apply for a UK visa for their “husband”.Officials received dozens of reports last year that women wanted to block visas for men they had been made to marry in countries including Pakistan, India, Bangladesh and the United Arab Emirates.But in almost half of their cases the visas were approved nonetheless! And experts believe that there are thousands more victims who are too afraid to come forward.The women forced into this situation must be absolutely terrified, not least because their own family is complicit in this abuse.The authorities when granting the visa do not actually speak to the “wife”. There is no whistle-blowing process or opportunity for the women to make a confidential statement. Any statement made is public.Authorities fear that if they block the visa they will be called racists, but this is a safeguarding issue and that fear of causing offence really has to stop.We need to get on top of the problem by working with schools to raise awareness, so girls know how to report it.And we need to work with social workers so they can recognise the family members are the perpetrators of this crime.GOSH, how shocking is the video footage of a woman called Arabella Juniper Torres calling the police to report a woman, who happened to be black, for sheltering in her doorway in Brooklyn, New York, while waiting for her Uber?We are living in the age of the death of the Good Samaritan.I helped someone carry a pushchair downstairs at the Tube last week – as all the burly men walked past, I might add.She was so grateful it made me realise small acts of kindness have all but disappeared.

And how did they get so sick that they believe their behaviour is socially acceptable?These women-hating bullies — Liam Holmes, 20, who battered a woman to the ground outside Faces nightclub, and the five smirking thugs who tormented a vulnerable woman but can’t be named because they are under 18 — are not the products of brutal, inner-city gangland.These blights on the face of British manhood are the product of ordinary homes, God help us.They are what our young men look like now.They are not feral kids who never had a chance.They are not the products of deprived lives.The leering bullies posing proudly around their terrified victim in that sun-drenched park are growing up in Bury St Edmunds, a peaceful Suffolk market town with pretty cottages and a lovely cathedral, while Liam Holmes attacked his victim outside a club that was once a fashionable oasis for footballers and pop stars, the Essex answer to New York’s Studio 54.These thugs all have dear old mums who love them to bits.Indeed, the mother of one of the park scum sacks — a woman who must have an IQ lower than her dress size — complained that her son was the one suffering now because the backlash has ruined his 16th birthday.The poor little lamb! What’s the world coming to if you and your mates can’t torture a vulnerable middle-aged woman in the park any more?Personally, I hope the backlash ruins his life.And while we ponder these pitiful excuses for young men, let us spare a thought for their female victims.The 18-year-old woman who was punched to the ground by Liam Holmes has been predictably abused in the sewer of social media, informed “she deserved it” for daring to speak back to a man, and gloatingly told that, “she had a lesson in true equality.Meanwhile the vulnerable 49-year-old woman who was brutalised in the park has spoken with incredible restraint about her experience, which must have been as humiliating as it was frightening.“Considering the respective ages of all parties and that it was five or six young men versus me alone, I remain surprised that they behaved in such a way towards me,” she said.“I would like to hear their reasons, if possible.”Which is so mild-mannered that I find it breaks my bloody heart.It is tempting to blame the surge in violence against women on social media, and brainless morons like the little d**ks in that park taking pictures to show off to their mates. But it can’t all be blamed on social media.I bet Liam Holmes wishes there were no cameras around when he was smashing a woman in the jaw.“He wouldn’t do that for no reason,” protests his mother Cathy, 53. “There was a lot that went on before that people don’t know about.”Sorry, there can never be an excuse, reason or justification for a man or boy to abuse a woman or girl. Not ever.The old taboo about men being violent towards women should still stand.Lads, it doesn’t matter if they say something cutting to you at chucking out time.Lads, it doesn’t matter if they have the insolent cheek to sit on the park bench where you like to hang out with your bad-ass homies in the Bury St Edmunds massive.How hard is it to understand?Men should not be violent towards women.My father, the hardest man I ever met, taught me a real man does not raise his voice to a woman, let alone his hand.But that generation of tough, gentle men has gone and in their place we have pitiful excuses for the male of the species who feel empowered by belittling, beating and abusing women.And what sickens the stomach about the boys in the park is that they all look so very pleased with themselves, as if tormenting a vulnerable woman who, in the words of her stepmother “wouldn’t say boo to a goose” is the high point of their miserable lives.It is a good job their mothers all love them because I can’t imagine any other self-respecting woman ever will.“He’s never had a girlfriend,” someone remarked of woman-bashing lout, Liam Holmes.Yes, it shows. The big close-up Nicole posted on Instagram is absolutely terrifying. What a scary face! The spider, I mean. Not Nicole.HOW sweet life was for Jeremy Corbyn when he was a loopy left-wing backbencher, free to flutter his eyelashes at the IRA, to stand on platforms that compared Israel to Nazi Germany and to bowl up on Iranian TV praising the release of Hamas terrorists who had murdered Jewish children.But now fate has Corbyn as a possible Prime Minister his support of extremism is not such a good look.And no matter how pathetic this Tory Government becomes, no matter how timid, weak and gutless Theresa May looks in the face of Brussels’ bullying, the British people will never choose for Prime Minister a man who considers the child killers in Hamas to be his “brothers”.“In the past, in the pursuit of peace and justice for the Palestinian people, I have on occasion appeared on platforms with people whose views I completely reject,” apologises panicky Corbyn, a man who can feel the keys to 10 Downing Street slipping through his fingers.The past is coming back to haunt Jeremy Corbyn.And it will destroy him.It might also have something to do with the celeb fear of looking like a sweaty idiot with two left feet, while wearing nipple-crushing Lycra on prime-time television.Luckily, Nadiya Bychkova, above, will be there for her second series, the only pro dancer who looks more like a celebrity than any of the celebrities.THOSE who want the UK to remain in the European Union have never made any attempt to persuade the 17.4million who voted to leave to change our minds.They just insult us.Peter Mandelson says Brexiteers “hate other countries and hate foreigners” while Stewart Lee, a pot-bellied Bernard Manning for snowflakes, says: “It wasn’t just racists that voted to leave Europe – c**** did as well. Stupid f****** c****.”Just insults.Which is why Remain lost the referendum. And why they would lose 100 referendums.BAKE Off winner Nadiya Hussain tells Loose Women: “I work in an industry that is heavily dominated by male, middle-class, middle-aged men and there’s no space for a 5ft brown girl, who wears a headscarf.”But you became a national treasure, Nadiya.So self-pity is misplaced.MADONNA turns 60 years old on August 16 and has marked the birthday by laying provocatively on the ground sporting suspenders, lacy bra and a been-to-bed expression in her half-closed eyes.The Material Girl still looks great, of course.Mind you, she does look as though she might need a hand getting back on her feet. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Only whites qualify.For decades, the likes of Harriet Harman have led the crusade for equality, attacking men as oppressors and demanding — rightly — that women must be protected from abuse.Harman famously refuses even to endorse marriage as the best foundation for raising a family, let alone as a good thing in itself, a public commitment.Yet she and the overwhelming majority of virtue- signalling Labour MPs are silent, for instance, on the treatment of some Muslim women by some Muslim men.I can’t recall a Labour street protest against forced ­marriage or honour killings even though they are commonplace here and reprehensible in any society. Even the Home Office feels cowed when dealing with victims.Indeed, Labour turned on its own brave MP Sarah Champion for daring to raise the issue of rampant sex-trafficking by “mainly Pakistani men”.On the Left, racism trumps rape. Now, like the “F-word”, it has become the reach-for term of abuse applied to any debate — including the issue of Britain leaving the European Union.Opposition to the EU’s ­corrupt and undemocratic “Grand Projet” long precedes the uncontrolled mass immigration unleashed by Labour.Illegal immigration is simply another symptom of EU “we know best” arrogance — personified by German Chancellor Angela Merkel.Yet preposterous Tory MP Anna “Suck-It-Up” Soubry routinely slurs 17.4million referendum voters as “racist”.It is the mantra of all those who see Brexit voters — more than half the country — as thick and nasty.Odious Peter Mandelson joined in last week, avoiding the “R-word” but ludicrously accusing anyone who wants to leave the EU of “hating foreigners”, which is the same thing.“Nationalism is a hatred of foreigners,” says the slippery Euro peer. “They should not be confused with patriots.”“I voted Remain in the referendum though I entirely respect the contrary view of many others.”Mandy’s relationship with the truth has always been flaky, but this is pure cant.Even those who once worked alongside Lord Mandelson when Labour still stood for something are appalled.Ex-Home Secretary and fellow Remainer David Blunkett snapped yesterday: “The allegation that some of those voting for Leave were ‘racist’ is not a new one.“It has been bandied about and seems to me not only an insult to the many people that I used to represent who voted Leave, but also to utterly miss the point of why the majority of British people voted the way they did.“If we fail to understand, then we do ourselves, but crucially also our democracy, a great disservice.”Lord Blunkett also slammed Mandy’s call for a second referendum.He is right. It is now clear the mood has hardened against bullying Brussels.The EU’s own snide insinuations that voters here are racist “Little Englanders” has not helped.Bank of England boss Mark Carney, architect of Project Fear, sank the Pound last week by claiming chances of a clean-break Brexit were “uncomfortably high”.Trade Secretary Liam Fox warns the odds are now 60-40 against a deal.Remainers should understand that every gratuitous insult to the intelligence of decent British voters is another nail in Theresa May’s chances of a friendly ­negotiated settlement.McDonnell, cleverer than Corbyn, wants to stop Labour being dragged into what deputy leader Tom Watson calls a “vortex of eternal shame”. But McDonnell, too, is stained by anti-Jewish sentiment.In any case, Britain needs Jeremy Corbyn – to remain in place as the sullen figurehead of a blinkered Marxist rabble and remind voters what they are risking at the next election.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Those being treated for an attempted overdose rose more than ten-fold — from 249 in 1997 to 2,736.As far as I am concerned, social media is almost entirely responsible.In a world where everyone relies on their phones for everything, there has never been a more worrying time for mental health.To be a teenage girl in this day and age is to be never alone — and always lonely.They are spending day after day wading through airbrushed photos of images society has deemed perfect.Whether it is a member of the Kardashian family posing with a diet pill, a boob job advert in the middle of Love Island or a photo of a friend with whitened teeth and smooth skin, our screens are filled with how we can be better — with how we SHOULD be better.Jon Goldin is vice chairman of the child and adolescent faculty at the Royal College of Psychiatrists.He  said recently: “There are a range of factors putting pressure on young children — academic pressure, exam pressure, social media . . . with fear of missing out and comparing yourself unfavourably to images you see online.“If you look at social media, my hunch is that girls are probably more sensitive to some of those factors than boys.”Although suicide is still the biggest killer of men under 45, awareness of this is at an all-time high. Hospital admissions for self-harm in boys, while still too high (2,236 last year), are stable.There was a campaign (which I took part in) two weeks ago that went viral on Instagram as people were asked to signal that they were OK as a means of opening a conversation on mental health.It is a conversation that desperately needs to be had.Despite massive steps to raise awareness, not least the Royal Family getting behind the Heads Together campaign for last year’s London Marathon, the internet — and young girls’ place in it — still needs a lot of talking about.I was lucky. Instagram was only invented when I was 16 and it did not matter a jot that I did not start using it until I was 18. Although we had social media, it was in its infancy, and I am incredibly grateful for that. My phone played a very small part in my life as a teenager.24% of girls are depressed by age 1480,000 UK kids suffer from severe depression90% of teen girls unhappy with their bodies70% of young people have been cyber-bulliedAs I went through the trials of being a young, insecure girl at school, negative thoughts were not able to follow me home. I would say goodbye to the bitching at 3.30pm and eat bangers and mash with my siblings without a thought for the girls in my class — no pinging from my phone to create waves of anxiety.These days that is simply not an option.Every issue that every teenager has ever faced is magnified to an extraordinary level with the advancement of technology.But removing phones from our daughters is simply not an option. Telling a teenager they can not have the internet is to tell them they can not have friends.Ten years ago a teenage friendship could withstand a summer holiday of no contact, but now a weekend with no signal, a Tuesday night with no Instagram story, makes kids hyperventilate.To be offline is to be forgotten. It is not showing up to the only party. The party that is going on all day and, more worryingly, all night too.Self-harm is, more often than not, a cry for help.As the internet forces its way into every corner of our lives, I cannot help but feel that it is a cry for human attention for affectionate, real-life attention.Warning signs  include if a child starts talking about themself in terms of failure or if there is a  change in their eating or sleeping patterns.Try asking  open-ended questions and do not give up if they are reluctant to  respond.Do not ban social media but set a good example and do activities away from it together.If you are affected by any of the issues raised in this article, please call the Samaritans (free) on 116 123.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The PM has — finally — started to talk to them with a concrete plan.The silence after her meeting with Emmanuel Macron is concerning, but the noises from German business leaders and politicians from the Continent in recent weeks are more promising.As the clock ticks, it’s time for them to tell Brussels that the theatrics and the anti-Britain briefings have to end. The Chequers fudge is not perfect. But Brussels would be mad to knock it back.And if they do? Planning is already stepping up for a clean-break Brexit.The PM still believes no deal is better than a bad deal and insists she’s ready to walk away.And that, as President Trump knows, is The Art Of The Deal…AND so another new front opens up in the war against the motorist.It’s outrageous that companies in some parts of the country could be charged if their employees drive to work.Those firms, who have already paid business rates for having a car park, will just pass on the extra cost to workers. Another stealth tax, another pocket emptied.We wouldn’t mind so much if we believed the money would be ploughed back into the roads, getting rid of potholes and fixing rocky road surfaces. Or if the trains turned up when they’re supposed to.But we won’t hold our breath.POLICE unions never fail to complain about overwork and stress on the job.We can understand why. It’s not an easy job. Coppers have our respect.But the news that one in 12 have second jobs suggests that not all of the wailing about long hours and working conditions are entirely legitimate.The next time a victim is told there’s nobody available to investigate, they might wonder what their local bobbies are up to.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

A separate plan details a two week outright ban followed by six weeks of restrictions.It’s the first significant sign of No Deal planning by the Home Office – despite repeated calls for the Government to do more to shore up Britain’s borders.Critics claim a No Deal will spark huge queues at ports due to explosion in physical checks on goods and people entering the UK.Lucy Moreton of the Immigration Services Union said staff were “paying the price” for their woeful lack of preparation by the Government and Border Force over the past two years.The Home Office is recruiting some 300 extra Border Force staff for Brexit – but union leaders claims TEN TIMES as many are required.Ms Moreton stormed: “Beleaguered staff who already have had to give up summer family holidays may now be asked to give up Easter holidays as well just to paper over the gaps caused by years of under investment.“We have repeatedly warned Border Force of the need for far greater preparation in case of the catastrophic impact of a No Deal.“Now our members are paying the price.”A No Deal effectively means all existing agreements and alliances with the EU end overnight on March 29.Leaked documents last week suggested the Home Office may allow EU citizens to enter the UK without checks in the event of a No Deal because Border Force doesn’t have the capacity to cope.It currently takes 45 seconds to check an EU citizens’ passport compared to an average four minutes for someone from the rest of the world.But non-EU tourists have faced huge delays of up to 3.5 hours at Heathrow this summer as staffing shortages cause huge tailbacks at border control.A Home Office spokesman last night said: “We have made significant progress in negotiations and are confident of securing a deal with the EU.“However it is the duty of any responsible government to prepare for every eventuality, including the unlikely scenario that we reach March 2019 without agreeing a deal.” Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

This period is a blip in our history.“We will overcome this.”The incendiary comments - that threaten another huge backlash from ‘Corbynistas’ - came as a second Labour MP suspended in the anti-Semitism row threatened legal action.Lawyers acting for Ian Austin – a former Labour minister – said the investigation into the MP was a “farce and a disgrace” and an attempt to silence “legitimate criticism”.The row was sparked last month when Labour’s ruling body approved a new anti-Semitism code condemned by the Jewish community for watering down the internationally recognised IHRA definition.Mr Austin condemned the move in a tirade at party chair Ian Lavery – triggering disciplinary action. At the same time Margaret Hodge branded Jeremy Corbyn an “anti-Semite”.Labour ended an investigation into Dame Margaret on Monday claiming she had “expressed regret” - a claim she immediately denied.Mr Corbyn faced fresh humiliation as footage from an interview with Iranian TV in 2011 showed the Labour leader appearing to question Israel’s right to exist.He accused the Israeli Government and Israeli Embassy of pressurising the BBC into defending it.And UK experts who helped draw up the IHRA code condemned Labour by saying any “modified” version of its ‘gold standard’ code would allow attacks on Jews to go “unaddressed”.In a withering attack, the UK delegation of the global watchdog said any “modified” version of its gold standard would leave attacks on the Jewish community “unaddressed”.While not naming Labour, the seven UK academics said they were issuing the statement in light of the recent “discourse” on anti-Semitism.Labour’s ruling NEC body triggered the bitter row last month by approving plans for its own anti-Semitism code – which critics claim has dropped four of the 11 examples listed by the IHRA.In their statement, the UK experts said: “Any ‘modified’ version of the IHRA definition that does not include all of its 11 examples is no longer the IHRA definition.Adding or removing language undermines the months of international diplomacy and academic rigour that enabled this definition to exist.We would once again revert to a world where antisemitism goes unaddressed simply because different entities cannot agree on what it is.”Labour MP Wes Streeting – co-chair of the All-Party Parliamentary Group for British Jews – said it was time for the Labour leadership to “swallow its pride” and accept the IHRA definition in full. He said: “I think this demonstrates conclusively that any individuals or organisations including the Labour Party cannot cherry pick the bits that they like from the IHRA definition and disregard others. “I think after a summer of utter misery for the Labour party over its failure to tackle anti-Semitism it’s time for the leadership to swallow its pride and acknowledge they have got this badly wrong.” Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I wasn’t surprised I choked on my toast because anything bad that happens to me — big or small — I’ve already lived through in my imagination.But I choked at the sheer obviousness of the scientists’ conclusions. Of course feeling stressed helps people deal with bad news. What next? Scientists discover sleep is related to tiredness?I can deal with bad news better because I’ve already been in that moment. I’m well prepared because I’ve actually lived it in my head.Anyway, the choking passed and, to my surprise, I didn’t die. That’s another beauty of always believing the worst will happen. What a wonderful surprise it is when the worst doesn’t happen.The toast didn’t kill me. I cheated the choke. Oh, the joy.I don’t know how long I’ve been this way. It’s definitely been going on since I was a kid.I remember flying off on holiday to what was then Yugoslavia with my mum and dad. I recall my mum trying to talk to me about all the exciting things we’d be doing when we got to my nan’s house on the Adriatic.I kept shaking my head and not saying anything and she got annoyed and rolled her eyes, thinking I just wasn’t looking forward to our holiday.But she misunderstood me. I didn’t want to think about the nice things we’d be doing because I was so convinced the plane was going to crash that it made me sad to consider what I surely wouldn’t experience.Imagine, then, my joy when the plane didn’t actually crash and I ended up not dying. What a bonus!And I went in the sea and didn’t drown — another nice surprise.I almost look forward to the moment when I do croak. If I have any warning I’ll tut and say to myself, “Oh well, I knew this would happen sooner or later.”This kind of attitude is admittedly a disaster when it comes to wooing women. Assuming total failure ahead of any move made on the opposite sex is disastrous. It’s just not attractive.I’ve a friend who simply cannot imagine why any woman in the world wouldn’t desire him.Consequently, many women do desire him. I, on the other hand, simply cannot imagine why any woman would desire me. Consequently, they invariably don’t. But because I knew they wouldn’t, I’m not remotely downhearted.I’ve kept the company of positive people over the years. They have their uses. But expecting me to believe them when they say, “Don’t worry, it’ll all be fine”, is fanciful.And believing that from professional advisers can be absolutely calamitous.“Oh yes, Adrian, it’s all going to be fine.” And then, whatever it is, turns out not to be fine and they just shrug and say, “Oh dear, didn’t see that coming, pay me some more fees and I’ll make sure it’ll be all right in the end.”In my work as a journalist I’ve talked to many psychologists who speak of the power of positive thinking. Yeah, whatever. Maybe. But what I do know for sure is that I just can’t do it.When you’re standing on a golf course with a club in your hand addressing the ball, you’re supposed to envisage your perfect shot. For me, impossible.What I actually envisage, with complete clarity, is a truly dreadful shot.I can actually hear the ball smacking on to trees, or plopping into water. I’m living in the calamity.So at least when it happens, which is often, I can shrug and say, “Hmm, thought so.”All this may stem from supporting a team like West Bromwich Albion. I once told a priest, in all seriousness, that I suffered from deep despondence.When he asked me why I thought this was, I told him (as a joke) who I supported. He nodded gravely and said, “Yes, I see, I see.”I have a friend I travel with on the supporters’ coaches to away matches. The poor chap always thinks we’re going to win. Even at 2-0 down at half-time he’ll be sure we’ll emerge victorious.I challenged him once about these absurd delusions and he said: “Look, we all have the same journey home after a game. If we’ve won we’re both happy, if we lose we’re both sad. The difference is that I’ve had a much more enjoyable journey there than you.”That convinced me for a while. So the next game I tried being positive.And we lost. And it hurt more. So I went back to how I was.There’s only one route to happiness I can think of and it’s to be found in the lyrics of a song by the late Mose Allison: “I don’t worry ’bout a thing, ’cos I know nothing’s going to be alright.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But in those days — the late Seventies — it was rare and unrecognised.We lost touch a long time ago, but I thought of Sarah this week when I read that the number of teenage girls self-harming has doubled in the past 20 years.According to new NHS data, the number of hospital admissions for girls who have self-harmed has jumped from 7,327 in 1997 to 13,463 last year. For boys, the figures have stayed almost the same — from 2,236 then to 2,332 now.Worse, “self-poisoning” — as in taking an overdose — is rising for both genders and last month the Government released a green paper that said around 850,000 children and young people now have a diagnosable mental health condition.Experts say academic pressure is a contributory factor, so too social media.Kids have always had exams to cope with but in the old days jealous and bitter remarks were confined to the dark corners of secret conversations or, at worst, scrawled on a toilet wall.Now these brave warriors have a keyboard and pseudonym behind which they can troll you for everyone to see.By my age, you know the vitriol probably comes from a bitter, 53-year-old virgin who lives in his mother’s spare bedroom. But when you’re still finding your way in the world, that poisonous undermining can worm its way inside your head and chip away at the confidence that acts as an armour in life.One self-harmer told me the pain of cutting his skin provided a welcome distraction from the “washing machine” rotations of negative thoughts constantly disturbing his peace of mind.The majority of them can be helped if it is spotted early enough and the expert assistance they need is then easy to access. And therein lies the problem.In 2016, Theresa May said the mental health of children was to be one of her priorities as PM, but since then Brexit has taken over and little has changed.The Government’s strategy is to train more teachers to spot the signs, appoint 7,000 more specialists to child mental health units and cut the waiting time for non-critical cases to be seen.But even if it happens, it won’t be enough.Parents must also remain vigilant for any marked change in their child’s personality or behaviour and the big social media companies have the technology to stop the majority of trolls — so they should be forced to use it.If all of the above doesn’t happen, the NHS has another mental health time bomb coming which will cost the taxpayer a fortune and have an even greater cost to the mental well-being of the next generation.WHEN TV baker Paul Hollywood started dating a 23-year-old barmaid from his local pub, they were quick to point out that their relationship only started after his marriage to wife Alex ended.But Alex is reportedly not buying this explanation and is planning to name Summer Monteys-Fullam in her £10million divorce battle.Whatever the truth, it remains the case that many couples conveniently consider only full sexual intercourse as adultery.But of course, cosy chats, lingering touches and come-hither looks are all it takes for any man with a wandering eye to recognise that, should he wish to jump ship, there’s a shiny new model waiting in the wings to rev up his sex life.Hallelujah for the wonderfully pragmatic Emma Thompson who, when asked about her marriage to the dreamily handsome Greg Wise, replied that they have had plenty of rough times.The secret to a happy relationship, she says, is the realisation that there will be unhappy times and that, if you manage to amble through to the other side: “It’s always better.”She adds: “I think people in long, happy marriages tell a lot of fibs, like, ‘Yes, it’s been marvellous’, whereas I say, ‘Sometimes it has been awful’.”If a relationship is deeply unhappy for a sustained period then, of course, get the hell out.But in these Tinder times of endlessly sweeping left in search of the “perfect” mate (who doesn’t exist) it’s invaluable when someone high profile points out that, more often than not, sticking with the one you’ve got works out in the end.Altogether now, “Love is a decision, not just a feeling.”Daisy-May Demetres smile lights up a room.Just eight years old, she was born without her lower legs and now uses two prosthetic blades that allow her to live as full a life as possible.She attends mainstream school, loves PE and has just been given a modelling contract with high street brand River Island.Yet, because of her disability, her parents Alex and Claire admit to feeling a “profound sadness” the day she was born and asked themselves what they had done wrong. And when, as a toddler, Daisy-May had to endure a painful, eight-hour operation on her stumps, Alex admits he turned to alcohol and gambling in a bid to numb his feelings of hopelessness.But by the time she was four, Daisy-May had mastered her blades and was doing cartwheels and headstands.Alex, 35, from Birmingham, says: “I looked at her and thought, ‘If you can achieve so much, against all the odds, and still be cheerful, then I have no reason at all to be depressed’. I stopped gambling and drinking that day.”While no one would wish disability on their child, the Demetres’ story is a salutary lesson that, sometimes, what seems like insurmountable adversity through an adult’s eyes can, through a child’s simple acceptance and joie de vivre, enrich your life and give it deeper meaning.Following a cyber attack in Alaska, government officials have abandoned their computers and taken to using old-fashioned typewriters.Let joy be unconfined.I still have my original typewriter from my days as a junior reporter on the Solihull News and it was a loyal servant that never crashed, froze or ran out of battery. I may even request for it to be buried with me.It seems that my love for these machines is rivalled only by Tom Hanks (yes, that one) who has written a book of short stories about them and created an app called the Hanx Writer, which emulates the glorious click-clack sound as you type.Go on, try it.

Just making a name for himself.But more so why is religion always thrown in the pot.But others agreed with Sid when he argued that he should have been told about the dress code before being given the job.One wrote: To be fair BA should have addressed his hair/man bun before his first day of employment! Not 2 weeks in it just undermines their policy.Sid claimed it was only in his first week of work that a superior employee told him his hair needed to change, describing it as girls hair.When asked whether he had considered cutting his hair to keep his job, Sid argued: I dont feel like thats the point.The young man said he was now exploring other avenues for the future - saying he was going to look into a career with BA still.He said: Right now we live in multicultural Britain. We live in the age of equality and we should be open-minded.I have worked with lots of luxury retailers and never had an issue with my hair.A British Airways spokesman said: We dont comment in detail on individual employment matters."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/NINTCHDBPICT0000047618991.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"rochdale paedo ring members deported","story":"Abdul Aziz, Adil Khan and Qari Abdul Rauf were among nine men jailed over appalling crimes against teenage girls in the Greater Manchester town in 2012.Girls in their early teens were raped and pimped out to paying customers in Rochdale and Oldham.The horrific crimes were portrayed in three-part BBC drama Three Girls earlier this year.Then Home Secretary Theresa May ordered in 2015 that the beasts, born in Pakistan, have their citizenship revoked.The decision was a prelude to Government plans to deport them.But the men — convicted of trafficking girls for sexual exploitation — argued the ruling breached their human right to a family life.The trio, all of whom have British children, challenged the decision in the courts.But their campaign to stay British failed today when senior judges ruled that stripping them of citizenship is conducive to the public good.Lord Justice Sales told the Court of Appeal hearing that their exploitation of vulnerable girls in Rochdale amounted to serious organised crime.The judge, who had first jailed them at Liverpool Crown Court in May 2012, said victims were raped callously, viciously and violently.In some cases, they were driven round Rochdale and Oldham to be made to have sex with paying customers.All the men treated the girls as though they were worthless and beyond all respect.He added: They were motivated by lust and greed.Aziz, who was one of the ringleaders of the grooming gang and referred to by some of the others as The Master, was jailed for nine years.Married father-of-five Abdul Rauf was jailed for six years and Khan for eight years.But Lord Justice Sales warned that a deportation order would allow the men another right to appeal on human rights grounds — a process that is likely to take many months.The vile Rochdale group exploited girls as young as 13 and were initially handed sentences ranging from four to 19 years.The men — eight of Pakistani origin and one from Afghanistan — gave their victims drink and drugs  before “passing them” round for sex.The abuse took place at two takeaway restaurants — now under new management — in the Heywood area.One 15-year-old victim told their initial trial that she was ordered to sleep with a takeaway worker as a treat."},{"url":null,"title":"monks ghost spotted tintern abbey","story":"Urban explorer Rosie Boulton, 19, made the spooky sighting at the historic site where Black Death wiped out monks in 1348.Travelling to several haunted locations a week, Rosie is constantly on the road snapping pictures of ruins.While visiting Tintern Abbey at night, Rosie and her friends didn’t find anything unusual, but remember feeling creeped out at the Monmouthshire site.However, when she returned home and looked at her images she spotted the ghostly vision her camera had captured.What looks like a hooded figure can be seen in the photographs standing in front of the ruins.Having always believed in ghosts and the paranormal, she couldn’t believe her luck and can’t wait to visit the location again.Rosie, from Stanford Bridge, Worcs, said: “I get an adrenaline rush, especially when it’s dark because it sets that eerie vibe.“I felt okay at the beginning but it was a huge place which made it feel a little more spooky.“You’re not supposed to go there at night. We felt like someone was coming towards us so we all ran out as we were scared.“I didn’t know about the ghost of the monk until I got home and looked back at the pictures.“I was on my own going through the photos and it just freaked me out. I called my friend and told her about the photos straight away.Tintern Abbey stands by the River Wye and was founded by the Cistercian monks in 1131 AD and was the only the second Cistercian foundation in Britain – the first in Wales.The current ruins are a mixture of building works from 1131 to 1536, with little remaining of the first structures. It still boasts vast windows and soaring archways.There have been many ghostly sightings of monks and other spiritual entities in the abbey.The Black Death in 1348 saw many of the monks perish, and some claim to see their spirits within the halls of the abbey, lined up and holding torches.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Disgraceful.Although there was an uproar among the residents, a lot of people stuck up for the drivers because the roadworks can be an inconvenience.Lisa Waller wrote on Facebook: No defence for the drivers, but maybe show a little urgency in the works so people dont feel the need to off-road it across the fields.Liam Donovan added: If its a main used road with no close by diversion sign dont close the whole road down, work on one side then when you have finished work on the other you can keep the traffic going - its been done many times.What do you expect. Today I drove past an open barrier saying road closed, to find the work being done on one side.Other people was diverting for no reason you have got to chance it sometimes because 80 per cent of times it says road closed it nothing turns out to be happening.No offence to the workers though, this is just what I come across on a daily driving job.And one person particularly stuck up for the drivers, as Renier Jansen wrote: Love it!

Temperatures will fall off a cliff.“A huge atmospheric block prevented the jet stream from delivering wet weather from the Atlantic – but that block has finally been dislodged, and further weather systems will arrive.”A Met Office forecaster said: “It is turning cooler as the jet stream is diving south, steering progressively cooler air from Greenland and Iceland towards western Europe.“From Sunday to August 21, temperatures will generally be around normal.Spells of rain or showers are likely to push southeastwards.“From August 22 to September 5, the North of the UK is likely to see the driest weather.Temperatures are likely to be above normal, and many areas may become warm or very warm.”The Met Office said much hotter-than-normal UK conditions over the three months until the end of October are a huge 11 times more likely than much cooler conditions.The Weather Outlook forecaster Brian Gaze said: “The Met Office forecast is astonishing.“September has 27C possible in Scotland, and even warm temperatures into October.”The Met Office three-month forecast said: “For August-October, the probability the UK average temperature will fall into the warmest of our five categories is around 55 per cent.The coldest of our five categories is less than 5 per cent.”This year is twice as likely as usual to have the hottest August to October period since before 1981, the Met Office forecast shows, due to more warm high pressure forecast."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/NINTCHDBPICT000425478167.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"storm tornado sunset amazing entries weather photographer competition","story":"Arranged by the Royal Meteorological Society (RMetS) and AccuWeather, the deadline for entries was on June 5.“Weather impacts everything we do,” said Brian Lavery, Managing Director, Europe for AccuWeather.“We have seen countless examples of how and when the Superior Accuracy of our forecasts kept people safe and out of harm’s way.“I’m looking forward to seeing these captured moments that illustrate how we live alongside nature.”In what is the third edition of the photography competition, entries have come flooding in from across the world, with amateurs and professionals capturing the very best of Mother Nature.Images sent in for consideration included weather phenomena like stunning cloud formations, crisp lightening strikes and awe-inspiring sunsets.A mirror image of sunrise at Worthing Pier by Steven PastonThe overall winner of the competition will receive a £500 cash prize, an Olympus TG-5 Tough camera and one years membership to the Royal Meteorological Society."},{"url":"https://e3.365dm.com/18/08/2048x1152/skynews-julian-assange-wikileaks_4383952.jpg?20180808155056 ","title":"assange invited to testify before us congress over russian election interference","story":"The letter also states that the interview would take place in a closed session and would not be available to the public, something which the leaking organisation is unlikely to agree to.The organisation\u0027s Twitter account stated: \"WikiLeaks\u0027 legal team say they are \u0027considering the offer but testimony must conform to a high ethical standard\u0027.\"Assange is currently without internet access after clashing with the Ecuadorian government for his activities on social media during the US and Spanish elections.:: Why do they want to speak to Assange?The alleged interest comes amid an ongoing investigation by Special Counsel Robert Mueller into alleged collusion between Donald Trump\u0027s presidential campaign and Russia to help him secure a victory.Despite comments appearing to support WikiLeaks made on the campaign trail, Donald Trump declined to continue to support Assange upon becoming president.The letter follows an indictment in the US accusing 12 Russian military intelligence officers of hacking into the Democratic National Committee (DNC) and Clinton campaign and stealing emails which were published by WikiLeaks."},{"url":"https://e3.365dm.com/18/04/2048x1152/skynews-house-of-fraser-high-street-shop_4286902.jpg?20180419135510 ","title":"ohios squeaker election shows there is all to play for in us politics","story":"They point to the high turn-out in urban versus more rural areas, traditionally good news for the left.They read with delight the ominous warning from the GOP supporting Congressional Leadership Fund super PAC.\"This remains a very tough political environment,\" it read. \"Moving forward, we cannot expect to win tough races when our candidate is being outraised.\"Democrats knows they only need a net gain of 23 seats to take back the house.

The Football Association says it would plough a windfall into grassroots sport for 20 years. But there are other, better ways to do this. As the Premier League kicks off this weekend, it continues to receive at least \u0026pound3billion from domestic and overseas TV rights. It’s not hard to see how England’s richest clubs have so much money to share around between themselves. So the FA should be demanding the government introduce a levy of 10% on the TV income Premier League clubs receive.  This would help nurture the next generation of Harry Kanes, Jordan Pickfords, and Kieron Trippiers. Grassroots football in England is, unfortunately, not as healthy as the Premier League\u0027s prize pot. Only one in three grass pitches are of adequate quality to play football in England, and last season one in six matches were cancelled due to poor facilities. Meanwhile taxpayers paid out more than \u0026pound160million to build Wembley. So any decision to sell off this nationally important venue should not be taken before other alternatives have been exhausted. The Premier League currently puts just \u0026pound100million into grassroots football- a pitiful contribution given how wealthy its clubs are.

The honourable Member of Parliament for Boris Johnson is considering his next move. The Opposition is making headlines by chewing its own entrails over whether or not it likes Jews. The country is stockpiling food and medicines, while grass fires rage, cows go hungry and farmers talk of disaster. To make matters worse, he is being made to look incompetent by Jeremy Hunt, of all people, and Jacob Rees-Mogg is being spoken of as the next Prime Minister because he sounds clever. Grumble grumble and bugger me, Marina, but old Boris is benched! No-one is talking about Brilliant BJ. Damned impolite when I resigned on a matter of principle, having not displayed one iota of principle for the entirety of the 54 years I have given humanity the benefit of my existence. Well, I had a call on the telephoney-what-not the other day from Steve Bannon, you know, the man who looks like a suppurating tumour and got Donald Trump elected. He said I can take control of the news by saying mad and bonkers stuff, more mad and bonkers than normal anyway, not British bonkers but Trumpian bonkers. The fake news will faithfully report it all and the racists will love me, and all the racists-but-pretending-they-aren\u0027t will say they\u0027re supporting my economic policies.  So I asked the editor of the Waily Torygraph if they\u0027d like me to write something that would get lots of attention, and they said they could do with something like that, and here it is, Marina old girl! If this doesn\u0027t get me on top of the news agenda for a solid week then nothing will!   Let me read it to you. I spent five whole minutes on it, it\u0027s really good. Listen.  Ahem. If you tell me that we do not have enough state control over what women wear, then I will man the barricades with you, comrades! Let us rip from Muslim women their headscarves, bare the bodies masked by burqas, remark upon the beauty or otherwise of faces covered by niqabs!  It is the sovereign duty of every Englishman, fwar fwar fwar, to see whatever bit of a woman they fancy. Especially if they\u0027ve got dusky skin. Why, I regularly tell my wife to walk around in a balaclava purely so I can exercise my human right, guaranteed at the signing of Magna Carta, to jump out from behind a tree and rip it off again. And that\u0027s why we need to make the Queen walk around naked. Our monarch must set an example that British integration means women being told what to wear, and accepting that most days she looks like a knitted German egg cosy.  I am not in any way being racist. Did I say racist? I didn\u0027t mean to. It\u0027s what people will call me, of course, racist, but don\u0027t let us repeat the word racist in case it causes extra headlines about racism. So many items of female clothing are oppressive, and a truly liberal nation such as ours should not allow women of any race to totter along in high heels, thoughtlessly mimicking the billions of victims of Chinese foot-binding, nor the menace of winter tights that go all bobbly after a single wash and make them look like shabby French mime artists, coming over here and stealing the jobs of Ango-Saxon street artistes.  But let us not stop there, my brethren. Let us also call out the controlling nature of corduroy, the Nazi obsession with nylon, the perverted prevalance of polyester and wrongness of rayon. Nature made totty to titivate us, not to be hidden away! If this makes me a militant feminist then I am happy to confess I am one of the sisterhood.  And don\u0027t get me started on people who cover up their God-given bodies for religious reasons. The priesthood attracts paedophiles precisely because their vestments give them the perfect excuse to hide their true natures. And nuns! They\u0027re basically just angry penguins, aren\u0027t they? Penguins who flatten the wages of British Protestants.   And hair! Women shouldn\u0027t be allowed it, for it covers their skulls! Pluck out their eyelashes, epilate their eyebrows, render them clean of fuzz!  Say so long to saris. Wave bye-bye to baggy sweat pants, winter jumpers, 1920s vintage clothing, duffel coats and pyjamas. No woman needs them, and I say so in a spirit of weird and bullying adoration of the female form because otherwise we\u0027ll be overrun by half-drowned picaninnies.  In a spirit of gender equality I will also point out that not all men in crash helmets are acid-wielding murderers on a rampage, and of course we should not ban them as that would be an example of nanny state control. But if I make you worry about them, you\u0027ll be ripping helmets off little kids on trikes by the end of the week, won\u0027t you? Vote for Boris.  The hard truth everyone in this politically-correct world is too frightened to say is that it\u0027s simply ridiculous for people to choose to go around looking like letter boxes. Dogs urinating on them! Post being shoved into their cakeholes! Being turned to gold with the curse of King Midas if there\u0027s an Olympian nearby! The working classes being oppressed yet again by the elite, of whom I am most definitely one and therefore was born to be PM.    If a woman spoke to me I should feel fully entitled to ask her to divest herself of all clothes first so I could talk to her tits properly. After all, this is how humans have evolved to work. There\u0027s no mention of leather jackets in scripture, you know. Off with that woman\u0027s head.  It applies also to children with cancer, the malingering little brats, in those hospital gowns they just hide sweets in. Little old ladies in tweed, scarecrows in straw hats, roadworkers lurking behind shapeless hi-vis jackets while treacherously talking this country down. This doesn\u0027t mean we should ban clothes or the right of any man or woman to wear what they please when going about their own business. It just means no-one\u0027s been talking about Boris since I resigned, apart from the 1,704 mentions I\u0027ve had since then in British newspapers, and that\u0027s not good enough.  So if I say Muslim women look like bank robbers, act all offended when you say I\u0027ve offended them, and grab lots of headlines while people fail to notice that my \u0027hard truth\u0027 is the same as saying anyone in a mini-skirt is a prostitute , then I\u0027ll get away with encouraging millions of people to attack women in the street just to prove they\u0027re victims of someone else.  Whaddya think, Marina? Churchillian in its sweep, I think future historians will agree, and so illogical as to take up most of the country\u0027s mental bandwidth as they try to understand it and fail to spot that I have become an integral, entertaining and, most worryingly of all, taken-seriously part of their lives.

Andy Pardy, a 28-year-old digital transformation consultant from Exeter, was so upset by the outcome of the referendum he needed a way to vent his frustration. And obviously, what sprang to mind was an epic journey across the continent, using GPS to trace the words on the map. The trip will see him spend around \u0026pound5,000 driving 30,000 miles through 32 countries. The idea came to him, he told the Mirror, when he was out for a run and saw his fitness tracker tracing his route.  Speaking from Norway, where he is about halfway through drawing the \u0027p\u0027 in \u0027stop\u0027, he told the Mirror: I’m trying to embrace one of the privileges we currently have and embark on a farewell tour around Europe. “It covers 32 countries, obviously some of them are non-EU member states. “At the moment I’m in Norway, because I’ve got to see Europe as a canvas. I couldn’t just go to EU member states because I need to have room to draw the message.” He’ll also be visiting Belarus, which is not a member state, because he “needed some space to draw the stem of the ‘p’”  Andy reckons he’s about a quarter of the way in to his odyssey - which will visit every member state except Malta and Cyprus. He says the next leg of his journey will take in Finland and Iceland, before dropping into Estonia. Fittingly, he then plans to draw the word ‘Brexit’ in reverse. Andy isn’t under any illusions that his quest will change the course of history. He said: “I know this won’t stop Brexit, but I just wanted to have my say and make a point.” "},{"url":null,"title":"burglar caught after left dna","story":"NewsBurglar caught after he left his DNA on a block of cheeseLabourer Jamie Simmonds left behind a trail of cheese crumbs as he made off with the Red LeicesterShare\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspCommentsByAdam Aspinall18:16, 8 AUG 2018Updated18:18, 8 AUG 2018NewsJamie Simmonds (Image: WALES NEWS SERVICE)Get daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid Email A greedy burglar was snared when his DNA was discovered on a stolen block of cheese.

Andy Wallace posted a clip showing the cycling group being cut up by a van at a junction followed by an overtaking car seconds later, which almost causes a head-on collision. Andy, who was cycling with friends in the Malvern Hills, Worcestershire, posted the clip to social media where it caused a very heated debate between cyclists and drivers. The group were cycling two abreast when the incidents happened and many viewers claimed that was the reason disaster almost struck on Monday afternoon. The video also shows a minivan cutting in front of the group at a junction.  Moments later, a car overtakes the group at high speed despite a vehicle coming in the opposite direction. The overtaking car is forced to swerve back in to avoid a head-on, coming close to hitting the cyclists. But most viewers of the clip, which was posted to a private group, decided Andy and his friends were primarily to blame - and heaped abuse on them. One commenter said: The whole video is full of Lycra clad w*****s thinking they own the road, people like you make me sick. Another said: Cyclist again at fault, b****r off and get a life.  One wrote: Rats of the roads. I give them a good soaking from my window washers whenever I pass these Lycra clad t**s. Yet another wrote: Scourge of the roads...Cyclists - riding in pairs you should get what you deserve. One more considered response stated: No excuse for either of their actions and I\u0027m not condoning it, but you could have prevented the second close call by riding single file and allowing cars to pass. The contributor added: Had there been a single file I bet he would have passed without a problem. Not because the bikes made it easier just because he would have had a different attitude towards the situation. The abuse even strayed on to cyclists and tax with one viewer writing: They don\u0027t even pay anything towards the roads\u0027 upkeep and they think they own the road. Among those to defend the cyclists, one wrote about riding in pairs: It\u0027s not illegal at all. It is deemed safer to ride two abreast, because you can overtake quicker than a long line.  And another defended cyclists from the allegation of tax-dodging. I thought everyone paid taxes, they wrote, unless you\u0027re still under the impression you pay \u0027road tax\u0027. These people are probably saving the country more money than others. Defending cycling as a whole, they added: 1. It\u0027s healthy, potentially saving the NHS a lot of money. 2. The wear and tear they do on the roads is considerably less than cars. 3. They aren\u0027t spewing out any pollution therefore doing a huge service to the planet. Andy, in his oirignal post, wrote: Two examples of bad driving today. Second one nearly caused a head on crash. Overtaking on top of a small hill. Despite a long straight road just past us.

Jemma\u0027s 12-year-old son Alfie Whitby had his beloved BMX stolen from a park close to their home in Cleethorpes, Lincolnshire on Sunday. Mum-of-two Jemma scoured Facebook and saw the thief had listed the item for sale on a local selling site so contacted the seller to see if she could have a look at it.

Researchers who carried out a detailed study into middle aged dating found a large percentage of older Brits are ignoring the risks of catching sexually transmitted infections and having sex without a condom. And that has lead to two in every 100 discovering they have contracted an STI since turning 40, according to the report. One third said they ignore contraception because they no longer worry about pregnancy. But this comes despite three in 100 having an unplanned pregnancy over 40, and fertility rates for women over 40 now exceeding that of women under 20. Other reasons for unprotected sex are that a quarter are using other methods of contraception, despite these not protecting against STIs. The study also found 36 per cent of men and 24 per cent of women have had a sexual encounter blighted by erectile dysfunction. And one in four believe impotence makes dating more difficult for older people. Jane Devenish, pharmacist at Well Pharmacy, which commissioned the research among 2,000 over 40s, said: “Practicing safe sex is just as important for people over 40 as it is for younger people. \u0027\u0027And with evidence that STIs are on the increase in the UK, we would advise people actively dating at any age to use condoms to protect themselves against STIs and unplanned pregnancies.  The research also revealed some major barriers to finding love over 40, with lack of body confidence, family baggage, health conditions, and erectile dysfunction coming out on top. Jane added: “Our research revealed the serious impact erectile dysfunction can have, with 42 per cent of people in relationships having less or no sex with their partner. Forty per cent of singles admitted it made them feel anxious about having sex, and 25 per cent had less body confidence as a result of the experience. More than two thirds of adults over 40 believed impotence is caused by stress or anxiety, with an equal number pinning the blame on drinking too much alcohol. More than half reckoned it’s the side effect of taking medication and 44 per cent said it’s a result of old age. Jane explains: “Contrary to popular belief, old age does not cause impotence. Many men experience occasions when they struggle to get or maintain an erection, and this is usually due to stress, tiredness or drinking too much, and is nothing to worry about. \u0027\u0027However, if erection problems keep on happening, it could be a sign of an underlying health condition such as high blood pressure, high cholesterol or even diabetes.

And Maryanne, 46, and Tommy Pilling, 60, are no different - as they recently proved with their choice of anniversary cards for each other.  The happy couple, who both have Down\u0027s syndrome, celebrated an incredible 23 years of marriage last month with their loved ones.  But when they handed each other the cards they had lovingly chosen, they were met with a heartwarming surprise - because they matched.  Maryanne\u0027s card for her doting partner was a light green-blue colour, with the words: For my amazing HUSBAND on our anniversary.   And the one she received back was almost identical - but in a light pink colour and reading: For my beautiful WIFE on our anniversary.  Remarkably, the cards both had the same design.  The couple\u0027s stunned loved ones shared an image of the cards on a Facebook page which follows Maryanne and Tommy\u0027s romance. They wrote: The anniversary cards that Maryanne and Tom bought for each other..... I never realised they knew each other quite so well!! Maryanne and Tommy, who live together in Southend-on-Sea, Essex, tied the knot in a beautiful church ceremony in July 1995. The beaming bride wore a Cinderella-style gown for the Shoeburyness service, while her groom donned a made-to-measure suit.  Almost a quarter of a century on, they remain happily married, sharing kisses and cuddles and making amazing memories every day. Maryanne tells her husband she loves him three times a day, lights up when she speaks of him and enjoys going out to concerts with him.  But sadly, in recent years, Tommy has been diagnosed with Alzheimer\u0027s disease - and continues to display early signs of the condition.  He is getting more forgetful, while it is becoming harder for him to speak and be understood by those who aren\u0027t close to him. Maryanne\u0027s mum Linda Martin explained what she and other loved ones have told her daughter about Tommy\u0027s condition and the future. At the moment, we just say that Tommy is getting older and he forgets things, and he needs a bit more care, she said in a recent podcast.  And that is enough for Maryanne to deal with at the moment. We go on a day -to-day basis. So at this moment, baby steps, she added. Linda spoke out about her daughter and son-in-law on Jo Piazza\u0027s Committed Podcast earlier this year, ahead of their anniversary.  She also revealed her joy at the couple\u0027s beautiful love for each other.  This love has defied both the odds and critics - who have previously called Linda a \u0027bad mother\u0027 for allowing Maryanne to get married. But as far as the mum is concerned, the fact her daughter has found somebody to love is the best thing she could have ever wished for. She said: I wish I could have found a love like it in my life - because it\u0027s very honest, it\u0027s very true and it really is a beautiful thing.  She added: I can always remember saying I don\u0027t care what she [Maryanne] achieves, I just hope to God she finds somebody to love. And she did, she has. And to me, that\u0027s the best thing I could have ever wished for her. Maryanne and Tommy\u0027s fairytale relationship began 28 years ago. The couple, who share a passion for cooking, met through fate in 1990 while working in a local training centre for people with disabilities. At the time, Maryanne was 19 - 13 years younger than Tommy. But from the moment they met, they shared an incredible connection. When asked what she thought of her first encounter with her future husband, Maryanne told podcast host Jo: That I love him. Just true love. It wasn\u0027t long after that Maryanne brought Tommy home to meet her family. She giggled happily as she proudly introduced him.  That\u0027s when I realised my little girl was falling in love, said Linda. Although Tommy was fairly quiet, Maryanne soon brought him out of his shell. And a year after they met, things became very serious. Deciding he wished to propose to his beloved girlfriend, a besotted Tommy bought a plastic ring for her from a vending machine. He then gave it to Maryanne, who was elated. She excitedly showed her mum the ring, saying Tommy wants us to get engaged. Linda, who admitted her first thought was good God, sat down with her daughter and Tommy and asked them what they wanted. In response, the couple said they wished to marry each other.  Linda then took the pair to get a proper ring and for the next four years, they remained engaged, getting to know each other properly. In mid-July 1995, they finally tied the knot in a perfect\u0027 ceremony, surrounded by hundreds of family and friends, and so much love. Linda said her daughter looked stunning in her white dress, tiara and long veil, while Tommy proudly wore his made-to-measure suit. For their honeymoon, the couple stayed in a seafront hotel, according to the podcast, \u0027Love Me Tender\u0027, which was released earlier this summer. Afterwards, Tommy moved into Maryanne’s family home. However, amid the post-wedding bliss, Linda received cruel messages telling her that she shouldn\u0027t have allowed her daughter to get married. But she told Jo: For me as a mother, I would have felt I\u0027d failed her if I hadn\u0027t acknowledged the fact that she was in love with somebody.  Maryanne and Tommy later moved into their own flat. Today, they continue to live independently there, next door to both of their mums and across the road from Maryanne\u0027s sister, Lindi. And despite needing assistance from their loved ones with most aspects of their life, including cooking and washing, they manage superbly. They go out on dates and day trips and, recently, Tommy celebrated his 60th birthday with a huge party. As always, his wife was by his side. Pictures of the happy pair - who were thought to be the first couple with Down\u0027s syndrome to wed in 1995 - are regularly posted online.  The Facebook page about their relationship - set up by Lindi - has amassed more than 40,000 followers, with the numbers rising.   A post on the \u0027Maryanne and Tommy\u0027 page reveals the couple renewed their wedding vows 13 years ago - then again three years ago. It adds: They have now been together for 28 years, since Maryanne was 19 years of age. Tommy is 13 years older than Maryanne and he recently celebrated turning 60! On World Down Syndrome day too! Their marriage is like a fairytale and they are the most blissfully happy couple that I know. I think most of us could learn a thing or two from them! When they got engaged 25 years ago many many people doubted them, said it was disgusting and they shouldn’t be allowed to get married, they also said that it would never work. But I like to say they are still as happy as they were 28 years ago when they first met. This page shows their love for one another quite clearly, it shows how happy they are, how much they adore each other and it proves to all the doubters that anything is possible with love.

Lisa Roberts says she cannot understand why Nigel Roberts Jnr was not at least given an anti-sickness tablet to ease the suffering after he was taken to hospital with stomach pains. They arrived by ambulance at around 10am on Sunday but were not sent home until 1am the following day. And despite, throwing up 18 times, Mrs Roberts says her son was forced to wait hours to be transferred to the paediatric ward, and only then was he given a pill. Ysbyty Glan Clwyd hospital admitted staff were under pressure due to a “particularly challenging weekend” with an “exceptionally high level” of ambulances arriving at the site in Wales.   Mrs Roberts told the Daily Post : “Nigel had really bad pains in his stomach and wasn’t able to keep any food or liquids down.  “We called 999 for an ambulance and got to hospital at 10am where we waited in A\u0026ampE for 30 minutes before he was seen by a triage nurse. “We were taken through into another waiting room and were left in there for four hours. “A nurse came and told us that the wait would be another two hours. Meanwhile, Nigel was constantly being sick and crying with pain. “He was eventually seen by a doctor at 5pm, who said he either had a bug or a viral infection.  “We were sent back to the waiting room until 9.30pm when the doctor said she needed a urine sample from Nigel. “It was 10.45pm when he was sent up to the paediatric department.” Mrs Roberts said Nigel was seen straight away once he got to paediatrics and was given an anti-sickness pill. “I don’t understand why the doctor in A\u0026ampE couldn’t have given it to him instead of leaving him being sick for all those hours, it’s absolutely disgraceful,” she added. “We counted he was sick 18 times while he was there.  “It wasn’t until 12.30am that he managed to eat some toast and we were allowed to go home at 1am on Monday. “It’s like we were forgotten about – meanwhile, the police were in and out bringing drunk people in. It was like being in a third-rate country.” A spokesperson for Betsi Cadwaladr University Health Board said: “Due to patient confidentiality we are unable to comment on individual cases, however we would like to offer our sincere apologies to Mrs Roberts for the delay experienced while waiting for treatment for her son Nigel. “We’re very sorry to hear that Mrs Roberts is unhappy with the care her son received and we would encourage the family to contact us directly with any concerns. “It was a particularly challenging weekend at Glan Clwyd Hospital with an exceptionally high level of ambulances arriving at the hospital site.

Their money comes from a number of different sources, and they\u0027ve both had paid jobs in the past. But a lot of their fortune is from inheritance, with their mum Diana and their great-grandmother leaving them money in their wills. While Diana\u0027s fortune was split evenly between them, Queen Elizabeth, the Queen Mother decided to leave Prince Harry a lot more than his older brother.  But it wasn\u0027t just because she preferred Harry or had some strange problem with William, and there was actually a very thoughtful reason behind it. Years before she died, the Queen Mother reportedly put a large chunk of her money into a trust fund for all her great grandchildren. Harry and William shared about \u0026pound14m of this, with the bulk going to Harry, reports the BBC . When the Queen dies and Prince Charles becomes king, the Duke of Cambridge, Prince William, will become the new Prince of Wales. This means he will take on the Duchy of Cornwall, a private estate which funds the public, charitable and private activities of the heir to the throne. Prince Harry on the other hand, won\u0027t get any of this.  After her death, Buckingham Palace released an outline of the Queen Mother\u0027s will, after going through the high court to try and keep it private. Her estate, which was valued at between \u0026pound50m and \u0026pound70m at the time, was passed onto her daughter the Queen. Her majesty did not have to pay inheritance on the fortune. Many items from the Queen\u0027s private art collection were given to the royal collection and went on display at the Palace. Prince Charles moved into her home Clarence House. A statement released at the time read: Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother has bequeathed her entire estate (which mainly comprises the contents of her houses) to The Queen.

The airline said it had notified fliers affected by the cancellation of 250 flights on Friday, offering them a refund or another route. Ryanair pilots in Sweden, Belgium and Ireland had already voted to stage a 24-hour strike that day, leading to the cancellation of 22 flights for Sweden, 104 for Belgium, and 20 for Ireland. All affected customers have already been contacted. Pilots\u0027 union Vereinigung Cockpit (VC) announced that Ryanair pilots in Germany will also be striking on Friday over pay and conditions.  Around 45,000 passengers were to be given 48 hours’ notice or less that their flights had been cancelled, according to the Independent. The airline said the strike in Germany was unjustified and apologised to customers for the regrettable disruption. It added that it had been forced to cancel 250 flights of over 2,400 flights scheduled to operate on Friday. Ryanair\u0027s Kenny Jacobs said: We regret the decision of the VC to go ahead with this unnecessary strike action given that we sent through a revised proposal on a Collective Labour Agreement (CLA) and stated our intention to work towards achieving a CLA together.

Soccer-mad Jade Almond, 16, hit her head on a door frame after leaning back too far on her chair three weeks ago. Within 12 hours the budding goalie was left with uncontrollable shakes and unable to put her pressure on her right leg. The condition has left her right leg \u0027shivering constantly\u0027 with extreme shaking \u0027like she was wearing a bikini in the Antarctic\u0027. Doctors have now said the bump triggered a mystery condition called functional neurological disorder (FND).  The Wigan Athletic Ladies goalie is suffering multiple sclerosis and Parkinson\u0027s disease-like symptoms and will need to undertake a strict rehabilitation regime in order to recover. Jade\u0027s anxious mother Michelle Almond, 41, says the teenage goalkeeping starlet had her whole life ahead of her before the bizarre injury. Michelle, of Wigan, Lancs., said: Jade is a trooper and doing really well - she had the whole world ahead of her and now this has happened. Jade was undertaking a four week long National Citizen Service (NCS) course, an annual school holiday scheme set up brimming with activities, which included rafting and climbing in the first week. But it was in the classroom in week two of the four week task at the University of Manchester when she hit her head on the back of a door frame on Saturday, July 14. It left the football mad teen feeling sick and \u0027spaced out\u0027 but she continued with her pals and partook in the afternoon session. However, Jade then hit her head again on the window of their mini bus, due to the motion of the vehicle, while travelling to another part of the campus.  Jade said: I can\u0027t remember much of the day after hitting my head on the door frame. It\u0027s all a blur really to be honest, I was just out of it. All I want to do now is to get better, be able to go to Sixth Form in September and continue doing what I was doing. After becoming ill and not being able to walk at 9pm the same evening, she was sent to Manchester Royal Infirmary by worried course organisers. I got the dreaded call from the organisers of the award who said Jade had bumped her head and was being sent to hospital, said call handler Michelle. The mum-of-three added: Jade being a goalkeeper, we knew it was bad because she is a tough goalkeeper. She\u0027s had broken bones and cuts and bruises - she\u0027s tough. She has never suffered from headaches or have any family members who have neurological diseases. Jade just shakes and to look at her you would think she has Parkinson\u0027s - it\u0027s that bad. It\u0027s like she is wearing a bikini in the Antarctic and is just shivering constantly on her right leg.

Charlotte Jones fell in love with the luxury shoe brand - worn by celebrities including Kate Moss, Beyonce and Melania Trump - when her partner gave her a pair as a gift.  The 30-year-old wore the black heels into the ground and, after booking a holiday to Ibiza three years ago, she realised they were so battered she needed new ones. But she didn\u0027t want to pay \u0026pound800 and feared she would end up with fakes if she bought them online.  It was then that Charlotte got the idea to set up her own shoe salon specialising in unworn and unwanted Loubs at a fraction of the cost. She spent a year learning how to properly authenticate the shoes named after high end French stiletto creator Christian Louboutin, who has been designing women\u0027s heels since 1991. Charlotte now runs her own brand Love Luxe from her home in Barnsley, South Yorks.  Her earnings now trump her partner Dael Baxter, 33, an internet marketer who helped her set up the business officially last year. It means she can stay home with stepson Jack, 11, and daughters Anyssa, seven, and Briseis, three months. Charlotte said she has sold upwards of 400 pairs of Louboutins and celebrity fans include glamour model Chloe Khan and reality star Jodie Marsh. She also sells other high end designer gear like Chanel and Alexander McQueen.  But her real passion is still Louboutins. She now has a network of private sellers, many with collections in the hundreds. Most of the shoes she sells are boxed and unworn, with their owners being given so many pairs by partners and husbands that they simply can\u0027t wear them all. Charlotte said: It\u0027s hard to believe, but there are ladies out there with hundreds of pairs and many of them aren\u0027t even fussed. It started by chance really. About three years ago, I only had one pair of Louboutins and I\u0027d worn them to death.  Me and my partner had a nice holiday planned, we were going to Ibiza and planned to try out some really nice restaurants and I wanted to look good. Obviously I needed some new shoes but I didn\u0027t want to buy two or three pairs of Louboutins at full price because they\u0027re so expensive. I was looking around and realised that there wasn\u0027t really anything in between. You can either buy them full price or you can chance it [online] ... but you never really know whether they\u0027re authentic.  I contacted some private sellers and managed to get two or three pairs at less than half the price. I just thought \u0027There\u0027s a market for this\u0027. It started as a hobby and then just snowballed. Part of the job is driving hundreds of miles to pick up pairs from across the country and her car is often crammed full of Louboutin cardboard boxes. As well as selling the brand, she also has her own collection of 11 pairs - including her first ever \u0026pound495 Irizas - but says her tastes are always evolving. Her aim was to allow women just like her the opportunity to be able to afford a pair of designer shoes without having to fork out for the huge price tag, which for many was unaffordable.  She even offers prospective purchasers credit if they need it as well as a 14-day return window. Charlotte said: A lot of the shoes are brand new, the ladies have been bought them as gifts and they don\u0027t fit or they don\u0027t like them. You\u0027d be amazed, some women have huge collections and they never wear them. Every lady should be able to buy a pair of high end shoes. She added: I don\u0027t make too much of a profit. I try and keep the price as low as possible.

But when she read what the man had to say, she was completely shocked. Instead of opening with a cheesy chat up line, an interesting fact about himself or even a safe hello, he decided to tell Adele how hot he thinks her mate is - and even asked if she could give him her number. Wow. But luckily Adele, 23, saw the funny side of it and passed on her pal India\u0027s details - but then things took a very strange, but very funny, turn when she decided to have a bit of fun with the bizarre situation.  Speaking to the Mirror, she said: I laughed when I first saw the message. I wasn\u0027t surprised because India always get the attention on nights out too. Typical man thing to do.

So she told the man the situation and gave him both of their Instagram accounts. How helpful! She said: I passed on their details because I didn\u0027t want to get in the way of him and true love.  And because I thought it was funny for him to work out which twin he should message. The determined guy messaged one of the twins and explained the situation - but awkwardly got the wrong sister. Oh dear... She quickly told him his mistake, and quickly pushed the blame back onto Adele.

Zac Edwards, 37, was posing for pictures with bride Cindy Edwards, 32, on Friday when panicked guests spotted the teenager struggling in the water. The marine science technician immediately plunged into the water and swam 150 feet to help the boy. He had got into difficulty in strong currents while playing on a boogie board at Shell Beach in Gulf State Park in Alabama.  Zac propped the youngster on the boogie board and arrived at his own wedding reception soaked and covered in sand.   You could just tell by the look on his face he was in difficulty. When we first saw him he was about 50 yards out. I took off my shirt, but my wife said I didn\u0027t have time to take off my pants. I ran into the water. I told some kids to go back to the beach and I took a boogie board. I’m so glad I did that, Zac said. The newly wed, of Spanish Fort, Alabama, added: I eventually reached him but we were about half a football field away from the shore. He just kept saying \u0027I can’t breathe\u0027. I tried to keep his head above water and I propped him up onto the boogie board.  The current was really strong and it was stopping us coming in any further. I was starting to panic slightly. The pants were making it hard to kick too. But when I saw the first responders I knew it was going to be okay. A jet ski came out to us and I managed to wedge him up onto it. I didn’t really take in the gravity of the situation until I laid down that night. Afterwards my hands were shaking but the adrenaline was just pumping. Orange Beach Fire Department and Orange Beach Surf Rescue, who had been attending to another emergency on the beach, assisted the marine expert and wedged the teenager onto a jetski. Zac jumped on himself and returned the lad to shore. Cindy, who had been with Zac for one year before tying the knot, admitted she panicked her husband was tiring during the dramatic rescue.  She said: I could tell Zac was tiring and they couldn’t get over the current. They had stopped and I was worried. Thank God the first responders arrived. The lifeguards dived into the water and there were helicopters were patrolling the waters. Our emergency services in Orange Beach can’t be commended enough. Luckily, the teenager has since recovered. Now Cindy and Zac, who each have three children, have warned of the importance of water safety.

The trick is working out how to respond to the picture - if you don\u0027t just delete the thing the second it comes through and try and forget it ever happened. Thankfully there\u0027s a woman among us who has shared her own creative way of dealing with d*** pics, and unsurprisingly people on social media are loving it.   Ginger Banks from Scottsdale, Arizona, shared a screenshot on Twitter of a recent conversation she had with a man, during which he sent her a random photo of his genitals.  Thinking fast, the entertainer replied with: Did you just send me a picture of a child penis? The man, clearly taken aback, said: WTF no, what\u0027s wrong with you? But Ginger didn\u0027t stop there.  She told the anonymous contact that she would be reporting them for sending the image, before sending them a picture of the CyberTipline website for reporting incidents of child pornography. Ginger wasn\u0027t really going to send a tip, but it was enough to strike fear into the heart of the man - and many others. Her post went viral, with more than 25,000 people sharing it and 113,000 people liking it.  People praised the idea and were quick to share their own ways of dealing with situations such as this.

They are reported to have been terminally ill and in so much pain they asked doctors to to end their suffering. They were given the lethal injections in Belgium, where euthanasia is legal regardless of a person\u0027s age. The identities of the children have not been revealed. Their deaths came to light after a new report was published by the CFCEE the commission that regulates euthanasia in Belgium.  It was confirmed by an official that the nine-year-old had a brain tumour, and the 11-year-old was suffering from cystic fibrosis, according to the Washington Post .   The children would have had to follow a procedure where they make their wish known in writing. They would then be examined by child psychiatrists to ensure they are intelligent enough to make the decision and are not influenced by a third party. However, parents can overrule their child\u0027s wishes. The pair were given the fatal injection between 2016 and 2017, along with a 17-year-old who had muscular dystrophy.  Of the 4,337 who asked for assisted dying in Belgium in 2016 and 2017, most were cancer patients.  Belgium amended its euthanasia law in 2014 to make it legal for doctors to end the life of a child, however young, following their request. Luc Proot, a member of the CFCEE, defended the decision to authorise the young euthanasia cases, saying: “I saw mental and physical suffering so overwhelming that I thought we did a good thing.” "},{"url":null,"title":"air ambulance called to local building site after worker gets trapped","story":"\t\t\t\t\tA workman has been rescued after falling down a trench at a local building site.Emergency services are at the scene on Napier Road, Glenrothes following the incident just before 1pm.It\u0026#8217s understood the worker sustained a serious leg injury after falling down a hole on the construction site.He is believed to have become trapped with his leg caught on an object within the hole.A spokesman for the fire service said the casualty was freed by 2.25pm.She added: \u0026#8220We were called to Napier Road at 1.10pm,\u0026#8220A man fell down a trench and became trapped by his lower limb.\u0026#8220Firefighters used rope rescue gear to free the casualty.\u0026#8221\u0026#8220He has since been released and is in the care of the ambulance service.\u0026#8221A Scottish Ambulance Service spokeswoman said: “We received a call at 12.57pm to attend an address on Napier Road in Glenrothes.“We dispatched one ambulance, our special operations response teams, the trauma team, an officer and our Helimed air ambulance to the incident.“Our teams are still currently on scene.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/08/SNS-15266981-Ayr-United-v-Partick.jpg-794x564.jpg ","title":"ayr united receive 150k bid for dundee target lawrence shankland","story":"\t\t\t\t\tAyr United have revealed a £150k bid for Lawrence Shankland has been turned down.Dundee have been widely linked with the Championship hotshot who has already netted nine times this campaign.The club who made the six-figure bid is from England but has not been identified.It was previously reported any side who would want to acquire the 22-year-old\u0026#8217s services would have to stump up at least £250k, with add-ons.A statement from the Honest Men today read: \u0026#8220To pre-empt any speculation in the media we can confirm that we have today received a bid of £150k from a club south of the border.

We all make mistakes. We’re trying to encourage him to play – maybe at that time it wasn’t the right thing but I think he got his mind a bit clouded, took the wrong decision and we paid a heavy penalty for it.“We should be ahead in the game anyway before then.“We’ve got a gilt-edged opportunity from the penalty spot, it’s a good save from Craig Samson – whether he should still have been on the field of play, I’ve got thoughts on that.“I don’t have a problem with the new rule, the triple punishment can be hard on teams, but it’s whether he makes a genuine attempt to get the ball.“If they’re clever enough, they go low but he knows he’s not getting the ball, never. He stays on the field and makes a good stop.”The manager, though, wasn’t too hard on his own goalkeeper despite the costly mistake.He added: “He was upset, that’s obvious. He came in and apologised to the boys, he’s made a mistake.“I’m not going to go through him because I thought he made some good stops in the first half, he’s coming out, he’s brave and taking crosses, plenty of them.”Midfielder Glen Kamara was left out of the squad sparking plenty of speculation that a departure was on the cards.

It can be summed up with the following words – tough luck, because both are going to be in short supply.When it comes to the first, the fact is the time to be ready for any league season is on day one.At the weekend, United were not and that’s why, despite losing out to the odd goal in five, they were comprehensively beaten by a Pars outfit that was ready for action while they were found lacking.In pointing that out, it’s worth remembering that, although Dunfermline’s wasn’t quite to the same extent, over the summer circumstances meant they were forced to undertake a major overhaul of their squad that saw players leave and 10 new faces brought in.That was not least because they lost two of their key performers, Nicky Clark and Fraser Aird, to the Tangerines. Despite that, particularly during the second half of the weekend game, the visitors looked a strong and cohesive unit that was sound at the back and dangerous going forward.By way of contrast, the longer the game went on the more disjointed United became.However valid the reasons for that may be, the rest of the Championship is not going to sit back and give them time to get their act together.In Dumfries this weekend it’s more than reasonable to expect Queen of the South to do all they can to come out of the blocks quickly, hit United hard and early and try to stay on top of them.That’s just common sense and an approach that’s to be expected from the opposition for weeks to come, if not longer.Put simply, when a team looks as vulnerable as Csaba Laszlo’s do, they are going to be tested early in games and it’s only by winning matches they can expect opponents to start cautiously.As for patience, something being sought from fans, there has to be a realisation that among Arabs it’s not so much worn thin as disintegrated.A support that’s been used to top-six finishes in the Premiership and cup final appearances, has been put through hell and are now facing a third season out of the top flight.So much so that when new chairman Mike Martin addresses them, he often starts off with an apology, and wisely so.Through no fault of their own, supporters have been stuck in a long dark tunnel and, if they cannot see any light at the end of it, they cannot be asked to show understanding.Make no mistake about it, their team is where it is because results dictate that’s their true position in Scottish football.But when they look at where Dundee United have been and the lingering perception of it as a size of club, the very least Arabs have a right to expect is a side that’s challenging to get back up.Some 5,000 of them turned up for the league opener and gave yet another indication of where United could be.No other clubs outside of the Old Firm, Aberdeen, Hearts and Hibs can rely on that kind of turn-out on a Saturday.If this team don’t start producing, they’ll not be able to either.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"She did it  Swindon star Maisie Sly s film wins at the Oscars","story":"                          Swindon\u0027 own Maisie Sly has topped off her trip to Hollywood in style, after the film she starred in, The Silent Child, was announced as the winner Best Live Action Short Film at the 90th\u0026nbspAcademy Awards."},{"url":null,"title":"pet-collar-melts-into-cats-neck-in-heatwave","story":"                          A WOMAN has issued a stark warning to other cat owners after her furry friend\u0027s newly-bought collar melted into its neck -

The result is that many find themselves having to move their business bases from Cromarty to Dingwall, Tore or Inverness when they outgrow their own homes, with the resulting loss of employment opportunities in the town.\"\u0026nbspThe society hopes to screen at least one movie a week drawn from the film programme at Eden Court in Inverness.It would initially be volunteer-run but there are plans to eventually train up managers and projectionists \"who would also be able to work at Eden Court\".Mr Mackenzie-Blackman said sharing films in this way would allow the film society to avoid having to pay licensing fees.He said, in addition, Eden Court may handle online bookings from its box office in Inverness.He added: \"If Cromarty and Resolis Film Society raise the money needed to make the project happen I will be firmly supportive of it.\"We will work in collaboration with them to help them project the cinema in Cromarty.\"Wednesday 8 Aug 2018 8:35 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.inverness-courier.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04116000/04116925.jpg","title":"Moves being made for new Culloden sports hub","story":"\u0026nbspPLANS are in the pipeline for an all-weather sports pitch in Culloden \u0026ndash and Highland Council is being tapped to foot the bill.Smithton and Culloden Community Council is shopping around for a fully-enclosed playing surface which could be built at the top end of Keppoch Road\u0027 Culloden Pitches.And there are longer-term plans for an adjoining open-air multi-gym area with exercise bikes, benches and other equipment.Community council chairman David McGrath said his group had saved \u0026pound15,000 to put towards the all-weather sports pitch, which is expected to cost around \u0026pound80,000.Mr McGrath said: \"We want to put those pitches in for the kids and we think it\u0027 very do-able because Highland Council has \u0026pound98,000 in planning gain money in their coffers and it\u0027 for projects like this \u0026ndash it technically belongs to this community so it should be spent here.\"The local authority has confirmed it holds nearly \u0026pound98,000 in developers contributions for building work approved in the Culloden area.It was underlined that this fund \"related to upgrading of the Culloden Academy pitches\".However, a spokesman said a funding request from the community council\u0026nbsp would be considered.There are currently three football pitches on the Culloden Pitches site.Two are cordoned-off as part of the work on a flood alleviation scheme.

Initially thought to be those of a notorious clan chief nicknamed the Old Fox, they were discovered to be those of a young woman plus four others.Previously, the mausoleum and burial ground drew in a few hundred people each year but last year numbers were between 2000 and 2500 - although it could be higher as not all visitors are recorded.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspWhile the burial ground is owned by Highland Council, the 17th century building is owned by the voluntary-run Wardlaw Mausoleum Trust which faces a constant challenge regarding its maintenance.Trust member Erik Lundberg said it was a technically-challenging task to carry out appropriate upkeep and repairs to the building given its age and construction.There was a problem with persistent moisture, for example, caused by an adjoining burial area having a higher ground level than the mausoleum.\"The trust was set up in the early 1990s to take over the ownership and eventual restoration of the mausoleum and that was done in 1998,\" Mt Lundberg said.\"The only income the trust gets is from donations from visitors. When you don\u0026rsquot get as many visitors as you would like especially up until recent years, you don\u0026rsquot really have the funds to maintain the building as you would like.\"He explained that the building should undergo lime rendering to the outside and lime plastering to the inside plus coats of lime wash about every five years. But it is now 20 years since such work was carried out.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\"There should be a rolling programme of things to keep a building in good order especially if it is historical,\" he said.\"But with a lack of funds we have only been able to do simple things. There is a backlog of things which need to be done.\"The trust is raising the mausoleum\u0027 profile online and via social media thanks to the volunteer efforts of Mr Lundberg\u0027 student daughter who studies away from home.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBut Mr Lundberg believes much more could be done with the development of the website and an app.\"We really need to have better interpretation of the building,\" he said. \"At Culloden Battlefield, they have got display panels and we would like something similar for the mausoleum.\"He estimated the cost of renovation and improved interpretation would come to about \u0026pound100,000.\"It is going to need a serious fundraising exercise,\" he said.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspHe welcomed the recent award of \u0026pound36,000 from Highland Council for work in the graveyard including urgent repairs to structures such as perimeter walls and gravestones.It also includes the removal of several trees including six dead elms.

Construction of the road has been held up by bad winter weather, including the so-called Beast from the East, and the collapse of construction firm Carillion, a major partner in the project.The folding of Carillion led to Galliford Try, another partner, having to fork out a further £25 million towards the project.The then Scottish Government economy minister Keith Brown told the Scottish Parliament the autumn deadline is still the aim for the complete opening of the bypass – with one section, between Blackdog and Goval, already being open – despite Galliford Try stating it will be complete during the summer.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"charity cyclists return","story":"\t\t\t\t\tA group of north-east cyclists has returned home after completing a five-day 700-mile cycle for charity.Organised by Stonehaven community group Strive, the cyclists set out on Wednesday and covered the length of Scotland, from Stonehaven to Melrose, and back in aid of rugby legend Doddie Weir’s Motor Neurone Disease charity – the My Name’5 Doddie Foundation.During the challenge, the cyclists met Scottish Rugby Union chairman Colin Grassie, the Glasgow Warriors squad at Scotstoun Stadium and Doddie.Strive is aiming to hit a fundraising target of £75,000 this year, with a rugby tournament and charity ball on at Aberdeen’s Marcliffe Hotel still to come.Strive founder Willie Tulloch said: “The whole experience has been absolutely fantastic and we were completely overwhelmed by the support that was given to us as we travelled.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"sign up for great aberdeen family run before its too late","story":"\t\t\t\t\tOrganisers of the Great Aberdeen Family Run say they have just a few spaces left for people to enter their one-mile event.Less than 50 spots are available for the Simplyhealth run – part of a day of running events.The run begins on Union Street before finishing in front of the Music Hall.Participants will follow a route along Back Wynd, Schoolhill, Rosemount Viaduct, Skene Street and Summer Street.The event gives youngsters the chance to experience the thrill of running independently or alongside friends and family members, with thousands of locals spectating.Childre aged three to 16 are encouraged to enter and take part in the run while being accompanied by an adult.The one-mile course is to be held over the traffic-free circuit on August 26.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"locos wait in hope over new striker knee injury","story":"\t\t\t\t\tInverurie Locos boss Neil Cooper hopes they will have some idea about the extent of Jonny Smith’s injury by the end of this week.The Railwaymen’s new signing was stretchered off with a knee injury during the first half of Saturday’s 6-3 win over Huntly.Locos are arranging for the striker to be sent for a scan to find out the extent of the damage to his knee.Smith will miss tonight’s game with Turriff along with Jamie Michie, Andy Hunter and Neil McLean.Cooper said: “We’re still waiting to get a scan organised for Jonny.

While a quick fix is better than nothing, many of these short-term fixes need to be looked at again.I have been speaking to the BT Openreach staff across Islay who are expanding our island\u0026#8217s internet capabilities. I have contacted BT to make sure recent issues with phone lines in some local households are not a result of the broadband upgrades.There has been progress with local housing associations after pointing out many of their tenants are having trouble with mould in their housing. Measures are now being implemented to to rectify the problem. I was happy to hear Argyll Community Housing Association has fixed gate latches on four of its houses at Cnoc Na Faire in Port Ellen after I raised this with them a few weeks ago.I met with environment, development and infrastructure committee member councillor Gary Mulvaney about Kintyre and Islands\u0026#8217 crumbling infrastructure, alongside our growing industrial output with the success of distilleries on Islay and Jura.Later that day I spoke directly to my constituents in Tarbert after a number of locals \u0026#8211 some business owners \u0026#8211 contacted me about the recent flood of sewage on Harbour Street as a result of blocked drains. Scottish Water were coming under fire from locals because of its slow progress on the matter.I made my anger about the poor conditions in Tarbert very clear when I contacted Scottish Water. A long-term solution to needs to be put in place.Councillor Alastair Redman, Isle of Islay.Sir,Scottish Water is asking customers to use water wisely in their daily activities to help maintain supplies during the current hot summer weather.Following a sustained dry period without any significant rainfall, customer use has increased significantly.In some areas, there has been a 30 per cent increase in demand for water and an additional 140 million litres are currently being produced and pushed through the system every day.The situation is being monitored closely to manage supplies across the country.This includes deploying additional resources to move water between distribution areas and tankering water to supplement local networks.Average reservoir levels are generally normal for this time of year but the current level of use and continuing dry weather means stocks of stored water available for use are reducing.Try to reduce use wherever possible.Businesses are also being asked to consider their use and how they can use water more efficiently.Simple, practical steps include: taking shorter showers, using a watering can rather than a hose to water plants, using a bucket rather than a hose to wash vehicles only washing windscreens/lights instead of the whole vehicle, turning off taps whenever possible and use washing machines and dishwashers fully loaded.More advice on using water wisely is online at www.scottishwater/savewaterscotland or call 0800 0778778.Peter Farrer, Chief Operating Officer, Scottish Water.\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column week 27","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 11/07/18, 6:12 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowThe pages of the July 6 edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser contain too many stories of sadness and pain.

He played for two seasons at Murray Park, taking part in tournaments at Turin in Italy  and in Russia at Shakhtar Donetsk before moving to Ralston, where he signed for St Mirren FC and had an enjoyable two seasons before returning to Lochgilphead Red Star YFC.Proud dad Dougie also happens to be the Red Star manager, and he said: \u0026#8216As a manager, it is always sad to lose your best players, but after the team\u0026#8217s success last year we had rumblings that something may happen at the end of the season.\u0026#8216As a club, we are delighted that one of our players has been given the chance to go and make an impact at senior level and just goes to show the hard work put in by the volunteers at the soccer centre, youth and amateur teams that there will be chances if players show the right attitude and commitment, whether at our level or at the youths.\u0026#8216Locally there are a number of youngsters who are with Partick Thistle, Hamilton, Rangers and others, which is great for such a small town like Lochgilphead.\u0026#8217Taking off his manager\u0026#8217s hat, Dougie added: \u0026#8216As parents, both myself and Fiona are delighted.

Sadly the rally was over for both crews after stage four due to electrical problems and other issues.Donald Bowness battled it out in the usual competitive class two with his Vauxhall Nova with Andrew Blackwood on the notes. Bowness enjoyed the battle with Michael Harbour during a Saturday which saw crews struggle to keep cars cool while specators looked on in glorious sunshine. Rally journalist John Fife was prompted to comment: \u0026#8216It\u0026#8217s like watching two spoilt weans scrapping over one tube of smarties.\u0026#8217Sunday saw a complete change in the weather and crews continued to battle it out in some very wet and slippy stages. Donald Bowness finished 11th overall and first in class two, followed by Michael Harbour in second. Another local man, Jamie Miller, finished an impressive third in the class on what was his first time out in his new car \u0026#8211 without so much as  a test drive in his the Citroen C2R2 Max.Class one saw Innes Mochrie and Paul Hunter battle it out in Innes\u0026#8217 newly built Rover , with another excellent drive from the pair who also finished the rally with a trophy win, coming third in their class. Alan \u0026#8216Goldie\u0026#8217 Ross decided not to enter this year as he is selling his Citroen Saxo rally car and instead enjoyed the rally from the spectating areas.The overall winners of the 2018 Mach 1 stages were Bruce Edwards and Jim Smith in the Darrian follwed by Gordon Morrison and Calum Macpherson in their Subaru Impreza and third place went to Ian Paterson and Callum Shanks also in a Subaru Impreza.All the local drivers appreciate the efforts of Davie Hatrick and the team behind the scenes of DCC, who put so much time and effort to bring this fantastic rally to Argyll each year.The rally is always on the lookout for new volunteers to marshal at the event, this is a great opportunity for locals to get up close to the action and learn more about the sport.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor week 30","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 30/07/18, 9:27 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Sir,As usual with Councillor Redman, he was so desperate to berate the SNP in his letter published in the July 20 edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser that he is unable to see the hypocrisy of his own stance.He talks of \u0026#8216stealth taxes\u0026#8217 hitting \u0026#8216the most vulnerable people in our society, particularly elderly people living alone\u0026#8217.His accusation of \u0026#8216taking their eye off the day job\u0026#8217 begs the question as to where he was when the Tory government introduced its bedroom tax \u0026#8211 a tax on those who needed an extra room for live-in carers, a tax on grandparents who wanted to have their grandchildren to stay for weekends and at holiday times a tax on widows with sons and daughters in the armed forces expected to sleep on a sofa when home on leave.A disgraceful tax which the SNP government abolishedDavid Hay, MinardSir,It was superb to once again meet up with locals in Whitehouse and across west Kintyre. As well as hearing about numerous problems with local road repairs I also listen to concerns about slow internet speed with some areas lagging behind others when it comes to getting access to superfast broadband.I heard similar concerns when I attended the latest West Kintyre Community Council meeting. As ever, I will looking into every issue brought to my attention by local residents across my council ward.After travelling back to Islay I checked up on the state of road repairs across the island. Some progress has been made in many areas like the Hospital Road in Bowmore and Mansefield Road in Port Ellen. The potholes in Port Askaig that I had been telling our roads department about have been filled in.After calling and emailing around about the large and dangerous potholes at An Creagan Place in Port Charlotte, I have been informed that the road in this area is not the responsibility of Argyll and Bute Council. It belongs to ACHA, and since obtaining this information I spoke in person to the very helpful and hard-working staff at the Bowmore ACHA office and asked them to fill in these potholes.Aside from road concerns on Islay, quite a number of my fellow Ileachs have mentioned lack of bed spaces in Islay\u0026#8217s hospital. Being an island community obviously means that transferring more and more patients to the mainland is hardly ideal.The consensus from my constituents who I have been in contact with is that the number of beds in Islay\u0026#8217s hospital is not enough. I have contacted NHS Highland to voice my constituents anger about this situation.Cllr Alastair Redman, Isle of IslaySir,The Marine Conservation Society (MCS) is seeking volunteers to clean up Scotland’s beaches in the 25th anniversary Great British Beach Clean from September 14-17.Volunteers also record the litter they find, and this has really helped change policy and behaviours.Last year 1,588 volunteers in Scotland took part, cleaning 111 beaches in four days. A staggering 491.4 pieces of litter were found for every 100 metres cleaned, a seven per cent rise on the amount recorded during 2016\u0026#8217s event.The fight to stop the plastic tide has only just started and we need everyone to take part now more than ever. We need the evidence from these surveys to highlight the action we all need to take for the sake of Scotland’s seas.To volunteer visit www.mcsuk.org/greatbritishbeachclean or call 01989 566017.Catherine Gemmell, MCS Scotland Conservation Officer.Sir,The Tories’ hypocrisy on MoD wages has been exposed – after it was revealed that around 220 staff in Scotland don’t receive the Real Living Wage, just days after the Tories topped up the pay of some of the best paid MoD staff.An MoD Freedom of Information response revealed that 220 staff in Scotland earn below the Real Living Wage of £8.75 an hour – yet they are not in line to receive any pay boost from their employers. The Tories’ policy is set to cost around £4 million – yet boosting the wages of those receiving less than the real living wage would cost, at most, under £400,000.This smacks of utter hypocrisy from the Tories, after their comments of recent days regarding pay for forces personnel.What the Tories are choosing to overlook is the immense benefits service personnel have living in Scotland, like free prescriptions and university tuition fees for their children.  And it’s only those earning above £33k who pay a fraction more.If they are so concerned with equality – why aren’t they ensuring that all MoD staff are paid the living wage?Boosting the incomes of the lowest paid MoD staff could cost the Tories less than a tenth of what they are spending to top up higher incomes – yet once again, for people on lower incomes they are not prepared to lift a finger.The Tories’ double standards know no bounds – it’s one rule for the elite and another for the rest.Brendan O\u0026#8217Hara, MP for Argyll and Bute\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures 3","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 30/07/18, 6:22 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowReader Robin Morton provides this week\u0026#8217s photograph, which features a popular subject \u0026#8211 the Paps of Jura.

In the Bible for example: ‘I will…make thy seed as the sand of the sea, which cannot be numbered for multitude.’ But despite estimates that Earth contains roughly seven quintillion, 500 quadrillion grains of sand, world stocks are running dangerously low.Chemically, sand is mostly silicon dioxide, and is non-renewable.  It is essential for manufacturing bricks, plaster, glass, microchips, and above all concrete the most popular and versatile modern building material.  Concrete accounts for 75 per cent of our demand for sand with around 20 billion tons produced globally each year.  Even so, surely there’s an almost infinite sand supply from deserts.Unfortunately not.  Sand grains come in different shapes and sizes, and while desert sand has small, smooth grains, concrete requires large, coarse-grained sand.  This is generally mined from rivers, beaches and the sea bed.  And because international control of sand mining is well-nigh impossible, sand piracy is rife, causing huge ecological damage.Recently, 24 Indonesian islands were mined to extinction, with most of the sand used for land reclamation in Singapore, the world’s largest sand importer.Our dependence on concrete is not just for new builds.  Concrete’s life expectancy is just 50-60 years, after which so-called ‘concrete creep’ allows water seepage that corrodes supporting metal structures. So more concrete is required to repair or replace old buildings.Now engineers are coming up with ingenious ideas for repairing cracked concrete, including using bacteria and fungi that produce calcium carbonate.This could heal micro-cracks but the process will be years in development, while right now the US spend around $79 billion annually on bridge and highway maintenance and there are an estimated 188 million daily trips across ‘at risk’ bridges.Many UK bridges are similarly at risk, so do we have a solution? The short answer is ‘no’, but right now the race is on to find new, more durable building materials to replace the need for sand and in so-doing preserve marine ecosystems.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures 4","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 02/08/18, 11:35 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowReader Fiona McCuish provides this week\u0026#8217s photograph, which features the Crinan Basin in colourful glory despite driecht overcast weather.

Fraser Watt gave them the lead on 17 minutes and Lewis Montgomery added a second on 33 minutes.A second from Fraser Watt five minutes later made it 3-0 at the break.James Cameron pulled a goal back for Inverness on 54 minutes but most of the pressure was around the Inverness goal. Inveraray had plenty shots but didn’t hit the target as often as they would have liked.They did get a fourth goal though when Allan MacDonald scored on 64 minutes.Bute 5 Kilmory 0Bute stay in the title race after they beat Kilmory 5-0 on the island.Bute attacked from the start and a combination of dogged Kilmory defending and wastefulness in front of goal meant the hosts only had a good Steven Dunn finish on 30 minutes to show for their first half efforts.When referee Des McNulty pointed to the penalty spot on 54 minutes, Iain McDonald stepped up to slam the ball home.Robert Walker scored on 63 and 85 minutes, either side of a 70th minute Craig MacKay goal, to complete the 5-0 victory.Aberdour 0 Inveraray 1Inveraray\u0026#8217s second team moved off the bottom of the table after a \u0026#8216smash and grab\u0026#8217 job on fourth-placed Aberdour.The Royal Burgh side travelled with only 12 players. Despite having a hand injury, 16-year-old Gregor Mather returned between the sticks after missing the previous week’s defeat to Col Glen and he would go on to turn in a man-of-the-match performance. Coll Mackay and Calum MacDonald, both aged 15, started up front.Aberdour started the brighter, creating many chances, but a combination of wasteful shooting and superb goalkeeping prevented Lisa MacColl’s side taking the lead.Inveraray’s centre line grabbed a hold of the game towards the end of the first half, with wingers Campbell Watt and Steven Cameron adapting well to their unaccustomed roles.Aberdour dominated large chunks of the second half but struggled to break down the visitors.Inveraray, though, have Gregor Mather to thank for some heroic saves to keep the scoreline blank.Aberdour goalkeeper Tom Bowerman had a quiet afternoon until 89 minutes when he picked the ball out of the net. Young Calum MacDonald, the smallest player on the park, ran through several challenges to push the ball into the back of the net and give Inveraray the lead.There wasn’t much time for referee David Mitchell to add and his final whistle signalled an Inveraray victory.Photo: Stephen Lawson\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"letters week 31","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 03/08/18, 11:38 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Sir,On behalf of local walkers I would like to thank the Forestry Commission for mowing the path between the Mealdarroch water tank track and The Kintyre Way.It is a beautiful forest walk and one of the least muddy in the area during the wet weather.Ann Thomas, TarbertThanks to the separatist\u0026#8217s tax hikes, Scotland has seen a 12 per cent rise in personal insolvencies.There were 3,208 bankruptcies and protected trust deeds from April to June this year, up from 2,869 in the same period last year.More and more Scots are struggling with debt yet the SNP has chosen to hammer families with higher income taxes.While taxes continue to rise in Scotland the revenue generated is being wasted \u0026#8211 a recent bullying claim probe into a police chief has wasted almost £100,000 of public money. The Scottish Police Authority disclosed the money spent on lawyers during the probe.Taxpayers have footed the legal fees of investigating the claims against former police chief Phil Gormley, who quit earlier this year amid multiple bullying allegations.The public was angry enough at how this case has been handled by the SNP Government and SPA, so it is even more frustrating to find out that tens of thousands were wasted on this fruitless task.It seems that the separatist\u0026#8217s wastefulness and incompetence which we have seen so much of in their mishandling of our economy also extends to their mismanagement of Police Scotland matters.Councillor Alastair Redman, Isle of IslaySir,With the Edinburgh Festivals about to start, can I remind your readers to helpfully inform visitors to our city that, unlike the made-up and damaging \u0026#8216tradition\u0026#8217 of rubbing Greyfriars Bobby\u0026#8217s nose, it is a genuine Edinburgh tradition to pause for a moment in the Royal Mile beside St Giles to lick the Heart of Midlothian.John Hein, EdinburghSir,I am writing to invite your readers to join me in hosting a World Tea Party this summer in support of working animal charity SPANA.Holding a Moroccan, Indian, British, Kenyan, or another world-themed party, is the perfect way to get together with friends and try out exciting and exotic new recipes, while also raising vital funds to help the world’s most hardworking animals.In many developing countries, working animals transport food, water, goods and people, and make it possible for millions of the poorest families to earn a small income. However, they often endure short, painful lives without the most basic requirements.This is where SPANA makes such a huge difference, ensuring animals have access to the free veterinary treatment they urgently need when they are sick or injured.Actors Dame Judi Dench and Joanna Lumley are throwing their support behind this year’s event, and we hope your readers will be inspired to take part and help transform the lives of working animals around the world.The SPANA World Tea Party fundraising pack, full of free recipes, is available from www.spana.org/teaparty or by calling 020 7831 3999.SPANA World Tea Party Host, Tom HorsfieldSir,It only takes one person to put a stop to the accidental loss of life to drowning.With recent headlines being filled with tragic stories of people losing their lives to drowning, Lesley Laird, Shadow Scottish Secretary and the Royal Life Saving Society UK (RLSS UK) urge the public to be that \u0026#8216one person\u0026#8217: take some simple precautions and get \u0026#8216water smart\u0026#8217, before cooling off this summer.For more information on the issue, the statistics involved and interview opportunities, please contact Claire Huggins on 0300 323 0096 or email clairehuggins@rlss.org.ukSenior Communications Executive, Claire HugginsSir,There are more people using Instagram for interiors inspiration than ever before, but 70 percent of Scottish Instagram users feel dissatisfied with their homes after looking at images of other people’s houses on social media, a study has found.Researchers who polled 1,500 UK adults using social media for inspiration with their homes, found that a whopping 66 percent of those are displeased with their home. They admit to feeling this way once a month or more after scrolling through other properties on Instagram, with 25-34-year-olds feeling dissatisfied most frequently.The findings describe people having an unrealistic idea of what their home should look like, spending time worrying about flaws which would be unnoticeable to others, whilst feeling pressure to maintain a certain appearance in their home and being self-conscious of it in front of visitors. This mindset has been described by Chartered Psychologist, Dr David Lewis, as ‘Home Dysmorphic Disorder’ (HDD).energypr representative, Beth ReynoldsSir,Researchers at the University of St Andrews have shown for the first time that some of the standard measures of memory in rodents and humans are likely based on the same cognitive process which could have implications for development of treatments for memory disorders such as Alzheimer’s disease.One of the most widely used memory tests for rodents is the novel object recognition test, in which animals explore two objects one of which is new and the other they have seen before.The results of new research showed that their participants object recognition scores were far more associated with their memory abilities than their preferences for newness.One of the research team, Dr James Ainge, of the School of Psychology and Neuroscience at St Andrews said: \u0026#8216This is important as it provides some of the first evidence that the standard memory tests in humans and rats are testing the same cognitive process. If we want to find a treatment or cure for disorders of memory like Alzheimer’s disease then we need to have a test of memory in animals that is analogous to human memory tests.\u0026#8217Steve Bargeton, St Andrews\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"jenny celebrates 90 years","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 04/08/18, 7:00 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowJenny Speirs of Inveraray recently celebrated her 90th birthday.She celebrated the milestone in style with a lunch party for family, friends and neighbours including cousins from Australia.Jenny thanks everyone for the lovely cards, flowers and gifts given to her during the celebrations.Donations in lieu of presents, at Jenny\u0026#8217s request, raised £300 for Cancer Research.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"soccer centre scores with support from ardrishaig community trust","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 04/08/18, 5:52 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowIn a fantastic boost for youth football in Mid Argyll, the Ardrishaig Community Trust and Lochgilphead Soccer Centre have jointly announce that Ardrishaig Community Trust will be the main sponsor of Lochgilphead Soccer Centre for the next three years.The funding package, worth £5,000 for each of the next three years, will make a huge contribution to the centre’s ambitious development plans – it already has more than 120 members, including around 40 from Ardrishaig.The development plan will see the Soccer Centre invest in new equipment, quality coaching to help the youngsters develop their football skills, participation in football festivals, and attend Scotland games, among other things.The funding will meet the cost of around 100 new football strips, all branded with Ardrishaig Community Trust, and will help ensure all Lochgilphead Red Star YFC teams are kitted out the same, from primary one to sevens (including the girls’ teams).The cost of kit to keep the coaches – who contribute the equivalent of around £15,000 a year in time – warm and dry throughout the year, will be part funded by the sponsorship. The coach kit will also bear Ardrishaig Community Trust’s logo.The funding will also see more than £2,000 per annum set aside to allow teams to take part in football festivals throughout Argyll and further afield, and also to pay for festivals to be held locally.This will allow local youngsters to benefit from the experience of playing in festivals against a wide range of teams from all over Scotland, and help to tackle remoteness and exclusion.As part of the funding agreement, the Soccer Centre will display a banner recognising the role of Ardrishaig Community Trust as its main sponsor.The player of the year award for each age group at the annual awards evening will be dedicated to the Ardrishaig Community Trust.And, finally, the Soccer Centre will look to encourage, support and participate in the work of Ardrishaig Community Trust.

We are confident our proposals have reached an optimum balance between these aspects.\u0026#8216As a responsible developer, we believe it is important to seek public opinion on our proposals and take that feedback into consideration when developing our projects.

Before the roads were made these were important links- the sea unites and the land divides.Arguably the most important ferry followed the Inveraray \u0026#8211 St Catherines route, connecting with coach services to Loch Goil and the onward steamer to Greenock or Glasgow.At one time a large sailing boat carried horses and cattle. A rowing or sailing yawl conveyed pilgrims, pedlars, travellers and soldiers. Pilgrims and blind persons were carried free.From the 17th Century the ferry and ferryman\u0026#8217s house were auctioned annually by Inveraray Town Council to the highest bidder, with the burgh providing the two vessels. The ferryman kept the fares, and part of the deal was that the minister and magistrates would travel free of charge.When Inveraray new town was built in the 18th Century the Ferry Land housed the ferrier, who supplemented his income by running a dram shop. The Ferry Inn was a popular pub until 1917, when its licence was revoked.In 1827 David Napier, later a famous shipbuilder, introduced two steamers, the Thalia and Robert Bruce, from Inveraray to St Catherines and other ports on Loch Fyne. In 1836 the Lochgoil and Loch Long Steamboat Company became tenants of the ferry with a small paddle steamer, though the rowing/sailing boats were still available for a lower fare.From St Catherines their horse-drawn coach conveyed passengers to Lochgoilhead, from where they joined a steamer to the central belt.In 1856 the company introduced a new steamer, the Argyle. She was not a success, with author Alexander Smith describing her as \u0026#8216a small wash-tub of a steamer that carries you across Loch Fyne in an hour\u0026#8217.In 1865 the Inveraray Ferry and Coach Company took over with their beautiful little steamer, the Fairy.The route did not pay, however, and in 1892 the town council set up the ferry as a municipal enterprise with Fairy II, a little steel paddle steamer. When to town council gave up running the service in 1909, Mr John Dewar continued until the Fairy II was wrecked in the great storm of November 1912.Thereafter there were a number of ferriers. James Douglas used a Loch Fyne skiff fitted with a motor and Hope MacArthur operated launches called the Happy Return and the Jean.The car and bus rendered the sea link unnecessary and the service ended in 1963.A winter trip across Loch Fyne is recorded in the following song, sung to the tune \u0026#8216Kitty of Lochgoil\u0026#8217. Here are some of the verses:The Fairy in the Fog\u0026#8216Twas in the year of \u0026#821781On Januar\u0026#8217 the fourth dayThe steamer Fairy crossed Loch FyneTo Sweet St Catherines bay.Our Captain Bold was Duncan BellOur pilot Donuil DhuThe engineer Shon GilliesAnd Dugal Piobair was the crew.The passengers were soon aboardThat Coachy Jock had broughtAnd then again through blinding fogOur homeward way we sought.The day with fog was thick and darkYou could neither hear nor seeBut Donuil Dhu just kept her noseStraight from St Catherines quay.The pilot at his stemmy postStood firm as any rockThe compass true before his eyesJust like my grandfather clockAs we came near the Newtown bay.Our reckoning scarce could failSaid Dougal Piobair to himself\u0026#8216I wish we saw the jail\u0026#8217.The captain stood upon the deckA few feet from the funnelAnd to the pilot passed the word\u0026#8216Keep clear of Mackenzie\u0026#8217s tunnel\u0026#8217.Already we were sheering offOur course we knew quite wellWhen through the fog some lengths awayThere came a dismal yell.\u0026#8216Now what was that?\u0026#8217 the captain cried\u0026#8216I ne\u0026#8217er heard the like before\u0026#8217Said Dugal Piobair: \u0026#8216Sure it is a Pochkan on the shore\u0026#8217.\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"crunch meeting on ardrishaig club future","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 06/08/18, 11:31 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowA meeting is to be held next month to gauge interest in reviving a Mid Argyll sailing club.Disquiet has been growing in Ardrishaig while weeds grow up around sailing boats and canoes belonging to Mid Argyll Water Sports Club.The boats, bought with the help of grant funding from Ardrishaig Community Trust, are lying on the Ardrishaig waterfront, unused in 2018.The Argyllshire Advertiser spoke to Peter Hogbin, who was involved in the club for many years.

Wages were 45p/hour and the telephone bill was £32.\u0026#8217Mrs Coats reflected on those early days: \u0026#8216I  could type, so I was asked to be the association secretary,\u0026#8217 she recalled modestly.The truth is, though, that her passion held Earra Gael together for decades with the help of many different volunteers in the shop.She continued: \u0026#8216Earra Gael is really a community. We have always had a good team. It was a lot of hard work, but very enjoyable.\u0026#8217One of the tasks shop staff were required to perform was to operate the weighbridge \u0026#8211 and this continued until 1987.There was more to running the association that selling pottery and weighing lorries, as Mrs Coats\u0026#8217 daughter Amanda remembers. \u0026#8216There was very little storage in the shop, so mum stored the stock at home.\u0026#8216Mum travelled all over to visit suppliers and she would set off on the bus in the morning and we never knew what she would come back with.\u0026#8217After running the shop for 20 years, Mrs Coats is taking a well-earned rest as Tarbert artist Wilma MacKenzie takes over the reins.Mrs Coats said: \u0026#8216It\u0026#8217s nice to feel it is going to continue, slightly differently perhaps, but it\u0026#8217s going to continue.\u0026#8217PICS:Sarah Coats pictured outside the shop in the 1970s. no_a31EarraGael02Mrs Coats with her friend, Tarbert artist Ann Thomas who was one of the original members of the association in 1973. 08_a30GiftShopSarah02Members and volunteers at Earra Gael today.

And the bid to future-proof Craig Tara at the Heads of Ayr is being seen as a huge measure of confidence in the park. A zip-line flying high above a completely refurbished building is the highlight of the new proposals. Bosses at owners Bourne Leisure believe the move is essential to keep families interested in coming to the park. The development follows thousands of pounds being spent already this year on a new pool reception and Millie’s Cookies outlet.  It followed a \u0026pound2.2million Airspace sports development including golf simulator  and climbing wall three years ago.  The 85-acre site traded under the Butlins name until 20 years ago. Now it has also lured in food franchises such as Burger King and Papa Johns. Hastings-based A\u0026ampM Architectural Partnership have just had plans lodged with South Ayrshire Council. They said: “The proposed development will provide a much improved sports and leisure facility for the holiday park guests within a central location. “The proposed works represent a major investment in the park and also confirm Bourne Leisure Limited’s aspirations to provide improved guest facilities and to generally enhance the holiday park by creating a desirable holiday environment, which therefore attracts more guests and in turn contributes a positive economic benefit to the wider area.”  The plans centre on  the sprawling Turnberry Gardens building in the heart of the park.  It could include more sports facilities such as an archery centre. The plan shows a tots zone, a performance area with stage, an RNLI playground and a mini-golf site South Ayrshire Council will determine the application later this year.Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnAyrAyr NewsRNLISouth Ayrshire Council"},{"url":null,"title":"holidaymakers coaches cannot parked ayr","story":"NewsHolidaymakers coaches cannot get parked in AyrBroken parking barrier causes furyShare\u0026nbspByStephen Houston12:31, 8 AUG 2018NewsCoach drivers cannot get past this barrier (Image: Elaine Clark)Get daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailOne hundred and fifty children and parents were dropped off by holiday coaches ... but the drivers couldn’t get parked anywhere legally. They had been directed to a council bus park in Ayr by a policeman, only to have access blocked. Entry to the coach park is via an intercom and barrier – but nobody was answering. Now veteran driver Ian Jackson warned: “The town must get its act together or visitors will go elsewhere.” He led a convoy of three coaches nearly 60 miles from Whitburn in West Lothian. The 53-seater coaches dropped off their passengers outside Pirate Pete’s on the Esplanade last Monday. And Ian,73, of Wishaw, said: “A policeman told us to turn right towards the harbour as there was a coach park there. “We all turned off the esplanade and arrived at the coach park where there was a barrier with an intercom. “I spent 20 minutes pressing it with no answer. “It mean’t all three buses had to reverse out of the street and we had to drive out of the town. We all don’t understand how the council can be so stupid. “The turn-in for buses more than 13 metres long is narrow because of a foot-and-a-half traffic island anyway, so it was chaos reversing out. “Next time the visits might have to be to Largs or somewhere else that can properly cater for us. “These trips can be worth a lot of money for the towns we visit and it is usually a great day out.” There are 20 coach bays behind the car park in Cromwell Road and it has a barrier entrance. Ian also claims he hung on the phone for 25 minutes trying to reach South Ayrshire Council. Ian added: “I was ninth in the queue and I kept on holding I was so incensed. “When I got through they simply said they were not the roads department and I had to call another number. “What a mess.” South Ayrshire Council confessed officials knew there was a problem ... and alleged there were “alternative arrangements”. A spokesman said: “There is an issue with the entrance barrier at the coach park on Cromwell Road and work will be carried out to fix the problem. In the meantime, there are alternative arrangements in place for buses to access the coach park and we’re sorry if these did not work on this occasion.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnAyrAyr NewsSouth Ayrshire CouncilWishawWest LothianWhitburnLargs"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"locals ayr discuss what theyd","story":"NewsLocals of Ayr discuss what they\u0027d put in a time capsuleLast week we featured a time capsule that was set to be buried at Burns Monument in Alloway.Share\u0026nbspByLochlin Highet15:51, 7 AUG 2018NewsTime capsule to be buried (Image: Ken McKissock)Get daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailCherishing memories is just part of life, everyone does it.

And John Scott MSP believes the 22 homes will breathe new life into an area, off McCall’s Avenue. Mr Scott visited the Britannia Place site, being developed by Hanover Scotland Housing Association, with funding from South Ayrshire Council and the Scottish Government. Builders are CCG (Scotland) Ltd, and the new development, once completed, will be known as Cuthbert Gardens. The name reflects the history of the site, which used to contain the Newton Shoe Factory owned by the Cuthbert family. People are expected to move into the general needs social housing, ranging from two to four bedrooms, early in 2019. Mr Scott met with senior managers from both Hanover Scotland and CCG and was given a tour of the site. He heard about valuable engagement with local residents during construction and how the design had come about, as well as health and safety precautions.  Janice McDonald is the Enhanced Housing Manger for Hanover Scotland. She said: “We already have nine developments in South Ayrshire, and Cuthbert Gardens is our tenth.” She added: “This area is important to future plans and we look forward to delivering more high quality social housing.” John Scott MSP added: “I am delighted to have been able to visit, and look forward to returning to Cuthbert Gardens when it is completed in the New Year. “My office receives regular calls from constituents looking for, in particular, ground level accommodation which is affordable. “So it is hugely welcome that Hanover Scotland and CCG are able to deliver this kind of new supply to the area.” Calum Murray, Director of CCG, said: “This now takes our overall number of homes presently under construction to 61 units. “By utilising ‘offsite’ methods of construction, these new homes will be constructed to the highest quality standard and thanks to a bespoke manufacturing process, their environmental performance will ensure long-term energy savings for the future residents. “CCG can also confirm that as a direct result of this project, we have been able to engage with local colleges to provide training and employment opportunities for the South Ayrshire community.” "},{"url":null,"title":"rolling back years troon class","story":"NewsRolling back the years for Troon class of \u002798Marr College pupils reunite for great hotel partyShare\u0026nbspByStephen Houston13:39, 8 AUG 2018Updated13:40, 8 AUG 2018NewsParty girls They loved catching up (Image: Lynda McFarlane)Get daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailMore than 50 partying pupils rolled back the years to live life like it was 1998. Former pupils from Marr College took to the dance floor at the Marine Hotel last Saturday night to celebrate their 20-year reunion – those who would have started at the Troon school in 1992. There was lots of great banter, reminiscent 90s music and some interesting moves on the dancefloor. People had been sending old photos of themselves from back in the day which was collated into a slideshow. This ran throughout the night, showing that some people had hardly changed at all! Former pupils travelled from all over Scotland to meet old friends, some even came from England, America and as far a Hong Kong to join in the fun. It was a great night enjoyed by all those in attendance. A glass was raised to those from the year group who are no longer here and a “just giving” page was created for donations to be made to Cancer Research and the British Heart Foundation in their memory. DJ Steven James, was one of the pupils from the year group and did a great job spinning the decks and taking everyone back two decades. The event was staged by the now Lynda McFarlane, Mhairi Lammie (Miller) and Vicki Cameron. Mhairi said: “Several months of planning by a small dedicated group of former pupils paid off spectacularly. “My only complaint is that the evening was over all too quickly.” Ben Glasgow added: “It was fantastic meeting up with so many people from our year group in the same room at the one time. “The dancefloor and bar did very brisk business.” DJ Steven James summed it up when he said: “It was slightly surreal looking out at a dance floor full of people that I hadn’t seen in such a long time. “By the end of the night, I felt like any barriers or negative preconceptions had been broken down. It’s amazing what a little progressive samba (and alcohol) can do.” Do you have a human interest story that you would like to feature in the Ayrshire Post then give us a call on 01292 294463Like us on

An inn sprang up here known as the Brighous Inn and it was at this site that the famous Linton markets were first held.\nRobert Burns would visit Linton where he had a friend named Graham, the innkeeper at the Brighous. Twice he came but didn\u0026rsquot find his friend at home, so he scratched these words on a window pane of the inn: \u0026ldquoHonest Graham, aye the same, never to be found at hame.\nThe old inn was considerably enlarged in 1862, becoming Medwyn House, the home of William Forbes, a great benefactor of the village, who spent large sums in draining and improving the land. A new turnpike road between Carlops and Dolphinton had been built in 1831, and, as a result, a way-side inn appeared on the east side of the road called Rutherford Castle Inn.\nThe owner, James Greig, considerably improved the property and transformed the inn, which faced west, into the present dwelling house which faces south and is approached by an avenue from the main road.\nA later owner, Andrew Webster, extended the planting and enclosed a mineral spring, \u0026ldquoHeaven Aqua, less than two miles from Carlops.\nNot all the fine local houses around West Linton survived. Coldcoat or Macbiehill was one. It had a long pedigree, being built about 1600, but was demolished about 1950.\nIt was owned by the Hamiltons of Coldcoat and Grange the last of the Hamiltons being Alexander who died in 1697. Before he died he managed to repair the house and in so doing contrived that there were exactly 15 sleeping places in the house, so that he might have it in his power to accommodate the whole of the 15 judges of the Court of Session without the necessity of putting two in one bed.\nThe Coldcoat estate was then acquired by William Montgomery of Magbiehill in Ayrshire, who transferred this name which later became Macbiehill. Three of this family are buried in a mausoleum on the estate.\nAnother house that did not survive was Broomlee House. It was originally the manor house of Broomlee estate until it was acquired by Sir William Fergusson and absorbed into Spitalhaugh estate. After his death it continued to be occupied by his three spinster daughters until after their deaths when it was demolished and became part of the grounds of Broomlee Camp.

The Bustler was called in to coordinate 17 other tugs in a successful action to re-float her.The outcome was to try to find more of the human side of the life and times of Bustler and its crew, especially as we knew that many of its 45 crew were Campbeltown and Kintyre natives.The objective I had in mind is a shorter document that might be of considerable interest to visitors and readers of the Courier.During the months since our visit, I have gathered a wealth of material from RN service records, family photos, official books, The Campbeltown Book, newsletters and my father’s curriculum vitae.I have also found that another Bustler model is on show in the National Museum in Edinburgh.Most of my father’s papers are with family in Australia. He died there in 1981 \u0026#8211 and the family have some that should be of interest, so I am arranging  to bring them over here.One book stands out: \u0026#8216The Tattie Lads,\u0026#8217  by Ian Dear, published by Bloomsbury in 2016, available from Amazon at £22.50 hardback, also on Kindle.It tells \u0026#8216the untold story of the Rescue Tug Service in two World Wars and its battles to save cargoes, ships and lives.\u0026#8217Chapter one tells the history and background of the Rescue Tug Service (RTS).Chapter two is simply named \u0026#8216Campbeltown.\u0026#8217 Its 40 pages tell how the town became the world centre for rescue tug boats in the First World War and reopened in the next war.The chapter charts the rise of the U-Boats and the threats from aircraft, the re-establishment of the Royal Naval base from six tugs in 1939 to 85 world-wide by the end of the war.Campbeltown became the national training base and was responsible for naval discipline, including pilfering, looting and even a minor mutiny.Incidents, some amusing and others not so give a flavour of what life was like in those days, especially the anecdotes of the actual rescues that were attended round the world.The rest of the book recounts the feats and some failures of the RTS worldwide and RTS’s eventual closure at the end of the war. The only  direct  reference to my father, Lt Archie Leckie, is at pages 153/4 while stationed at an outstation of RTS at St John’s, Newfoundland.In March 1942, he had strongly reported after a tricky rescue with a tanker there that his then tug, Tenacity, should have had a modern towing winch.Shortly afterwards he was promoted to Lieutenant-Commander and appointed maintenance officer, rescue tugs base at St John”s.There is also a photo of \u0026#8216Bustler\u0026#8217 towing a conundrum used to lay the fuel pipeline Pipe Line Under The Ocean (Pluto) to Cherbourg after the Normandy landings.My father was mentioned in despatches for this action. I have donated a copy of the book to the museum and Elaine has placed it beside the model.I think there should, be a much bigger project to tell this story.My sister and I have many happy childhood memories of Bustler, and have even sailed on her but there are gaps as we were children at the time.We were shielded from the dangers my father faced and, of course, he was unable to tell us where he was going.Another of our difficulties is that having left school and Campbeltown in 1953, we also lost touch with Kintyre people.We are interested in any written experiences, or details of any surviving sailors.Donald Leckie,North Berwick.donaldleckie7@gmailHMRT Bustler in Campbeltown museum.

More than six in 10 claim to have kept at least one of the postcards they’ve received over the years.’A spokesperson for Lyrical Scotland, which produces Mr McMillan\u0026#8217s best selling card, said: \u0026#8216Similarly to Royal Mail, we have seen a steady increase in our postcard sales to retailers, which we attribute to refreshing and modernizing our designs and images.\u0026#8216We continue to focus on both popular places of interest and the more unusual and interesting views and vistas of Scotland.\u0026#8217Michael McGregor is a photographer and postcard printer, based at Ardnamurchan and said that the days when he used to print a million cards a year are long gone.Mr MacGregor added: \u0026#8216However, many of the big players have left the market leaving us specialists.\u0026#8216If they are unusual of striking images tourists will often buy cards, not to post but to remember their trips.\u0026#8216We have a herd of Highland cattle and they are certainly cash cows for featuring in many postcards.\u0026#8217In 2001, before 9/11, one of Mr MacGregor\u0026#8217s cards was sent to a banker at Morgan Stanley.  It was found among the wreckage of the World Trade Centre\u0026#8217s twin towers and posted back to Ardnamurchan by a New York fireman.Andrew Wallace, 21, is a sales assistant in Cadenhead\u0026#8217s Whiskey Shop, he had an opposing view on postcards.He said: \u0026#8216We do not sell many postcards, I think that this is because people are using social media instead\u0026#8217.He also admitted: \u0026#8216I have never sent a postcard, it\u0026#8217s a thing of the past and we are heading into a paperless world.\u0026#8216I think that this may be a good thing.\u0026#8217When asked about his view on the future demand of postcards, and if he believes that more people should purchase them, Mr McMillan laughed and said: \u0026#8216They certainly should because I\u0026#8217d make more money.\u0026#8217All postcard images are used with permission of the copyright holders.George McMillan\u0026#8217s best selling card.

The Silent Child follows Libby, a profoundly deaf child born to a hearing family who struggle to communicate with their daughter.  As a result, she grows up isolated and develops behavioural problems until a social worker, played by Rachel Shenton, comes in to help.  Rachel, most famous for her role as Mitzeee Minniver in Channel 4\u0026rsquos Hollyoaks, wrote the film to raise awareness of the issues around hearing impairment and to improve viewers\u0026rsquo understanding of the condition.

The film was directed by Rachel\u0026rsquos fianc\u0026eacute Chris Overton, with a \u0026pound10,000 crowdfunded budget.  Maisie earned her role following a nationwide search, during which over 100 children auditioned for the part.

The plans went before by the council\u0026rsquos planning committee in March last year but members agreed to delay a decision while consideration was given towards improvements being carried out at the junction of the A199 and B1407.  But the developer opted to go straight to appeal and Christopher Warren, a reporter appointed by the Scottish Ministers, gave an indication that the plans would be approved towards the end of November last year.  Now he has issued a final decision, which allows 93 houses and 20 flats to be built on land beside Orchardfield.  Gerry More, managing director of Stewart Milne Homes Central Scotland, said: \u0026ldquoThe sensitively designed new homes planned for East Linton will have a mix of 19 individual home styles, with house prices set to appeal to a wide range of buyers, from first-time buyers through to growing families.  \u0026ldquoOur vision is to create a series of new communities in East Lothian that incorporate traditional values and features from historical East Lothian towns and villages.  \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos encouraging that this vision is being shared and supported by the local authority.  \u0026ldquoWith substantial investment planned for landscaping, design and placemaking, The Orchard in the market town of East Linton is set to be a prime example of Stewart Milne Homes\u0026rsquo innovative approach to creating unique, sustainable and aspirational communities.  Thirty-one objections were lodged with the council\u0026rsquos planning department ahead of councillors considering the plans last year.  Dunpender Community Council raised concerns that the development was \u0026ldquotoo large-scale and building so many new homes at once would \u0026ldquoput undue pressure on existing services and infrastructure both within East Linton and in the wider area.  Ward member Councillor Norman Hampshire, who is also the chairman of the council\u0026rsquos planning committee, said: \u0026ldquoObviously we as a council support the development \u0026ndash it is part of the Local Development Plan. However, we did have concerns regarding the entrance into East Linton and we had hoped to have made improvements to that entrance.  \u0026ldquoHowever, Stewart Milne Homes have now got consent.  \u0026ldquoWe can still try to negotiate with the company to see if improvements can be made to the entrance.  \u0026ldquoMy preference would be a roundabout, like we have on the eastern side of East Linton, but that might be difficult now they have got consent but we will still negotiate to try to make improvements for access in and out of East Linton.  \u0026ldquoIt is a fast road and cars come down that hill and try to make a left turn into East Linton.

Mr Hampshire described East Linton as \u0026ldquoa very attractive village and noted the development would fund an extension to its primary school.  Of the 93 houses, 64 would be detached, 16 semi-detached and 13 terraced.

But while Musselburgh\u0026rsquos research showed a high number of off-sales operating in the town, in North Berwick the map was red because of the number of licensed premises such as restaurants and pubs.  A report presented to East Lothian Licensing Board as a tool to help it set its policy placed East Lothian as 18th out of 30 local authorities for alcohol availability, but that figure rose to 13th out of 30 for number of on-sales and fell to 21st out of 30 for number of off-sales.  It also found that alcohol-related death rates were four times higher in neighbourhoods with the most outlets when compared to areas with the fewest in the county and crime rates were also two-and-a-half-times higher.  However, it also revealed that, in general, the county performed far better than Scotland\u0026rsquos national average when it came to alcohol-related health harm and crime. The average crime rate in East Lothian is 218.7 per 10,000 population, 34 per cent lower than the Scottish average of 331.2 per 10,000 population.

More than 620 entries were received from across the county, elsewhere in the UK and even as far afield as the USA and New Zealand.  Four flag designs\u0026nbsphave been shortlisted to go forward to a public vote.  The voting process is now open and runs until the end of this month, with final votes being accepted no later than 5pm on Friday, August 31.  The result will then be kept under wraps while the winning design is made into a flag, which will be launched around St Andrew\u0026rsquos Day.  Run jointly by East Lothian Council and the Scottish Flag Trust, in association with the Lord Lyon and the Courier, the competition was open to anyone and was free to enter.  The judging panel comprised the Lord Lieutenant of East Lothian, Michael Williams Lord Lyon Joseph Morrow East Lothian Council Provost John McMillan and chief executive Angela Leitch David Williamson, chairman of the Scottish Flag Trust and Courier editor Robbie Scott.  The four designs are below:  Design A    This saltire design on blue reflects the local birthplace of the\u0026nbspnational flag, with the cross in gold signifying the wealth of \u0026nbspEast Lothian\u0026rsquos farmlands and reputation as the granary of \u0026nbsp Scotland. The lion rampant is a traditional emblem of the county \u0026nbsp\u0026ndash it appears in many local coats of arms while King William the \u0026nbspLion was born in the royal palace in Haddington. The blue\u0026nbspstripes through the gold represent the rivers Esk and Tyne.  Design B    Using three horizontal bands in strong colours, this design\u0026nbsp depicts the key industries of the county \u0026ndash blue for the sea\u0026nbspand fishing, above yellow for the county\u0026rsquos beaches and\u0026nbsptourism, above green for the farming. And in the centre,\u0026nbspa fluttering saltire reflecting the birthplace of Scotland\u0026rsquos flag, within a map outline of East Lothian\u0026rsquos territory.  Design C    This design employs two distinctive curved bands of colour\u0026nbsp\u0026ndash the blue upper band representing the importance to East\u0026nbspLothian of the sea, and the lower green band representing\u0026nbspthe rolling countryside and the Lammermuirs. In the first quarter is a white saltire, one of which is like a beam of light,\u0026nbspto acknowledge the county being the birthplace of the national flag.  Design D    The centrepiece of this design is a gold lion rampant \u0026ndash a traditional emblem of East Lothian appearing on the council\u0026rsquos coat of arms and on the arms of many of the\u0026nbspcounty\u0026rsquos ancient families. It sits over a white saltire\u0026nbsprepresenting the local origins of Scotland\u0026rsquos flag. The field\u0026nbspof the flag comprises three horizontal bands \u0026ndash blue for the sea around the county\u0026rsquos coastline, yellow for its beaches, and green for its rich farmland.  Mr McMillan said: \u0026ldquoIt was a very difficult decision for the judges, having to choose four final designs from the huge number of high-quality submissions we received.  \u0026ldquoI hope that East Lothian residents will get involved again and let us know what their favourite design is.  \u0026ldquoHaving a distinctive new civic flag for East Lothian will allow individuals and groups across the county to express pride in their local community, to celebrate their heritage and help raise recognition and awareness of East Lothian nationwide.  \u0026ldquoI will be very excited to see the outcome of the public vote.  David Williamson, chairman of the Scottish Flag Trust, said: \u0026ldquoExperience elsewhere suggests that involving the public in choosing a civic flag is by far the best way to progress, and the hope is that the interest already shown in the East Lothian competition will continue into the voting stage.  \u0026ldquoVoting on the four shortlisted flag designs has been held back until after the main holiday period so that people don\u0026rsquot miss out on the chance to participate.  Lord Lyon Dr Joseph Morrow added: \u0026ldquoThere was a wealth of talent expressed in the entries which reflected very positively on the area.  \u0026ldquoI now look forward to the vote of the people and the taking of the ownership of a flag to be a symbol of pride in East Lothian.

A meeting of Cockenzie Community Forum yesterday evening (Wednesday), was told that the company was considering a number of sites with Prestonpans Community Councillor Calum Miller suggesting the former\u0026nbspCockenzie Power Station site could be\u0026nbspa possible home for it or\u0026nbsped that East Fortune Airfield could be a potential home for the company\u0026rsquos site.  Skyrora describes itself as a launch vehicle development company with aims to cater for the growing demand to send small satellites into space.  It is developing rockets which it hopes to launch from a UK spaceport.  The engine testing would not involve the launching of rockets but would require fuel to be stored on-site to fire up the engines.  The UK Space Agency announced it was investing millions of pounds in a site in Sutherland as the new home of the UK\u0026rsquos first spaceport for launching rockets.  Skyrora said it was looking for an engine test site within an hour of its Edinburgh offices to give it a local base.  Presenting the proposals to the forum yesterday evening, Prestonpans community councillor Calum Miller said that the engine testing would sound no louder than a jet engine to those within 500 metres and the benefits the site could bring would outweigh the \u0026ldquominor inconvenience.  He said: \u0026ldquoWe can bring top scientists and engineers into East Lothian, there is potential for localised manufacturing and supply of goods and services, to interest local schools in engineering, science and the next space race.  He added that the community council had not taken a view on the proposals and was looking for feedback.  Earlier this year it was revealed that Glasgow produced more space satellites than any other city outside of the USA.  Robin Hague, lead engineer with Skyrora, said that the company was designing a new Scottish launch vehicle and looking at a number of locations around Edinburgh, the Lothians and Fife to ground test its engines.  He said: \u0026ldquoEast Lothian has some excellent possibilities and we look forward to seeing if we can find a home there.

But it showed that residents who both live and work in East Lothian earn 15 per cent less each week, taking their pay packets well below the national average.  East Lothian Council says the gap in pay reflects the nature of the county\u0026rsquos economy, with many jobs traditionally low paid such as part-time or seasonal roles.  But one community councillor said the problem was \u0026ldquolow ambition and called for East Lothian to learn to compete with Edinburgh rather than providing employees for the Scottish capital.  Calum Miller, who supports the ambitions of Prestonpans Community Council \u0026ndash of which he is a member \u0026ndash for a cruise terminal to be built at the former Cockenzie Power Station site, said: \u0026ldquoIncreasingly, East Lothian sees itself as an appendage to Edinburgh rather than an independent entity.  \u0026ldquoGraduates are almost expected to leave once qualified for a better paid job in Edinburgh or elsewhere. Workers who can\u0026rsquot move have their horizons limited to jobs in the social care sector, manual labour and/or part-time.  \u0026ldquoEast Lothian needs to learn how to compete again with Edinburgh and pull employers here rather than push employees into the city.  \u0026ldquoTo do that, the infrastructure needs to take a big leap forward housing needs to be cheaper and more accessible, fibre broadband needs to enter houses and businesses directly, and East Lothian Council needs to allocate land for enterprise plus foster a hunger for new business.  The community council has produced a brochure outlining its vision for a Port of Prestonpans which it says would bring in new income and employment.  Mr Miller said it was just one of the new ideas which could benefit the county.  He said: \u0026ldquoThe Port of Prestonpans would not only transform the tourist potential of East Lothian, it would bring in new local companies that we haven\u0026rsquot even imagined.  The latest report from the Office of National Statistics (ONS) found workers who lived and worked in East Lothian have gross weekly earnings of \u0026pound517 on average \u0026ndash well below the \u0026pound595 for residents working outwith the county.  The number of households in the county which are classed as \u0026ldquoeconomically active is also above the national average, with over 81 per cent of residents employed in some way.  The number of men of working age living in the county who were not employed was considered too low to count by ONS.  East Lothian Council said it was looking at ways to develop the local economy.  A spokesperson said: \u0026ldquoThis is an indication of high commuting rates out of East Lothian and the nature of the East Lothian economy \u0026ndash eg. rural, hospitality, part-time/seasonal \u0026ndash that tend to pay lower rates. The refreshed East Lothian Economic Development Strategy will outline the context of such differences and consider means of appropriate support for the local economy and workforce.  The average UK gross weekly wage in 2017 was \u0026pound552 while the Scottish average was \u0026pound547."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/8157352.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"work-taking-place-at-blindwells-ahead-of-houses-being-built-there","story":"  Planning permission for homes at Blindwells, which is sandwiched between the A1 north of Tranent and the A198 south of Cockenzie, was granted in spring last year.

It is one of the few islands on the West Coast I don\u0026rsquot know, and for sure I will be back. It is a less-known treasure, I think.  I was camping with my family so our accommodation was pretty basic, but the kids absolutely loved it. As I write, we have just returned and I am in recovery mode from five nights under canvas.  We could afford it because my wife and I were stewards, two shifts each then we were able to access the festival. My main responsibility was the \u0026lsquobeach gate\u0026rsquo, a quieter access point which allowed festival-goers to visit the beach and return without needing to go through the main gate.  And so there I was, with a high-visibility vest and a walkie-talkie, checking people\u0026rsquos wrist bands as they left and entered. I met lots of wonderful people, but most of the time I was sitting on a mound of sand by the gate, admiring the stunning view of Ettrick Bay and the mountains of Arran in the distance.  It was a rare and wonderful time for reflection. The rest of the family were nearby but having a ball inside, so I was free to enjoy my thoughts.  There was a prehistoric standing stone circle close to the site of the festival which gave the same view I was enjoying. It made me realise that although I had vague idea of the general history of the area, I did not know the tales steeped in the landscape.  Story anchors our relationship with the land, and sitting in that beautiful and wild place made me want to make that connection there as well. I can simply enjoy a view, of course, but perhaps a burden storytellers carry is the need to pick the wisps of stories from the land wherever we go.  I thought of a possible connection with East Lothian in the travels of St Kenneth. He was a monk from Ireland and an associate of St Columba. He must have known this shore, perhaps he walked the sand of Ettrick Bay itself.  His name is embedded in many place names, both in Ireland and Scotland, and one of them is Cockenzie. The legend states that this name comes from the Gaelic Cul Cionnich, meaning Kenneth\u0026rsquos Cove.  He is said to have arrived in the small picturesque natural harbour, now called the Boat Shore, in the sixth century, and thus baptised the community with his name. The Boat Shore was for many years the harbour of what was to become the village of Cockenzie. For sure it seems the saint\u0026rsquos travels took him to the Forth valley so the legend may be rooted in a real event.  I love the Boat Shore at Cockenzie. I played there in my childhood, as so many have. Both high and low tide has it different pleasures there.  I reflected on the fact that perhaps the main difference between the Boat Shore and Ettrick Bay on Bute is not their varying size but the fact that Cockenzie is now \u0026lsquobuilt up\u0026rsquo.  Yet when I walked the shore from Port Seton to Cockenzie recently, the sea was no less dominant on my senses. In fact the remains of old salt pans, the survival of a fishing community and its traditions, the gable ends of houses facing defiantly at the sea all added to the experience.  Cockenzie is a place where the tiny threads of personal memories entwine with ancient stories and history of fishwives and fishermen, salt makers and coal miners, where the tracks of the past run literally at your feet. Yet there is still a vibrant local community, a living connection to the ancestral past. That makes the place extra special.  My thoughts were interrupted by a comment from a festival-goer: \u0026ldquoLook! That\u0026rsquos the sea, I mean the real sea, so cool. He and his friends left through the beach gate and headed down to the beach to take photos.  The comment made me realise something obvious. A real connection is the sea, and it also made me feel lucky that I live next to it.  It was on the Saturday night that the sea brought me new thoughts. The blue sky turned grey, then a dark, brooding black. The calm water began to boil with rage as it brought warm air from the south which had turned into a storm. We managed to get into our tent just in time.  Howling winds and torrential rain swept through the festival campsite like a reaper, ripping up tents. I double-pegged our tent with the help of my friend Chris Yule, and then we huddled inside as the winds did their worst. The kids were both excited and a little scared by it, but mostly excited!  The family slept as the storm howled in anger outside, the canvas walls of the tent bending this way and that. If we needed to evacuate, Chris had kindly offered the floor of his caravan as a refuge.  I lay there listening to the storm and was glad I was not at sea. My home town, Prestonpans, was born of such a storm when a pirate, possibly a Viking, was shipwrecked on the shoreline a thousand years ago. He stayed and founded the village, his name still echoed in Aldhammer House.  I stayed awake until the worst was over, then fell into sleep. In the morning, birds were singing and the sun shining. The campsite looked like a battlefield site collapsed tents and stuff blown everywhere, including a small tent blown into the hedge by us. But the festival site was repaired and a great final day had.  We took the longer, scenic route home, via Argyll\u0026rsquos \u0026lsquosecret coast\u0026rsquo, a deeply wooded and beautifully quiet part of the West Coast.  \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos great to be home, said my four-year-old as we arrived. It was, not least to have a shower and to eat something that wasn\u0026rsquot from a tin!  \u0026ldquoCan we go for a walk by the sea? I was asked first thing this morning.  \u0026ldquoAfter I have written my story, I replied.  \u0026ldquoWhat are you going to write about this time?  \u0026ldquoNot sure, let\u0026rsquos see what comes to my mind, I said.  And so now we will head to the Boat Shore, and the walk by the coast there.  I love living by the sea."},{"url":null,"title":"day-centre-welcomes-zambian-visitors","story":"  The centre received a visit from the country\u0026rsquos social welfare minister Emerine Kabanshi and Julien Mwape, director general of Zambia Agency for People with Disabilities (ZAPD), who are in Scotland to see firsthand a range of health and social care facilities.

So what do this year\u0026rsquos results actually tell us?  The flagship qualification of Scottish education is the Higher and this year\u0026rsquos results continue a pattern emerging since it was revamped in 2015 under the Curriculum for Excellence (CfE).  This suggests that Higher enrolments and successes have declined slowly, but steadily - in contrast with the period from 2000 to 2014 when Higher numbers improved.  It will be another year or two before a fuller picture is evident, but since no other initiatives have affected Higher since 2000, it seems reasonable to ask whether CfE and the new qualifications are linked to this pattern.  Higher and other late-school qualifications such as Advanced Higher are built on a platform generated by earlier schoolwork and there is still much uncertainty about the results of CfE and the results of this may be clearly seen in the 2018 National 3 to 5 results.  Overall attainment in Scotland at these levels is now down nearly 34 per cent on the last pre-CfE results in 2013 which is a highly significant decline which cannot be explained away as a result of the narrowed S4 curriculum adopted by many of Scotland\u0026rsquos secondary schools since 2013.  Several issues are hidden inside the global figures. The numbers of pupils attempting National 4 and, especially, National 3 have crashed since 2013.  Whereas over 60,000 pupils passed a National 3 course in 2013, only 16,138 did so in 2018.  It does not look as if this is a result of improved learning and teaching which is helping pupils to achieve National 4 or National 5 instead, with significant reductions in the numbers attempting these qualifications over the same period.  Indeed the latest figures show a reduction in entries at National 5 of 12,000 in this year alone.  This is significant because this is the first major drop since 2014 and would appear to suggest that the opportunities to study courses at National 5 have been reduced.  Because CfE encourages pupils to spend longer in the so-called broad general education in the first three years of secondary it means in many schools they do a smaller number of subjects once pupils reach S4.  This is a trend that seems to be growing with a greater number of schools now offering only six courses whereas previously the offer was more likely to be seven or eight.  There are more alarm bells in the pass rates for National 5. Part of the two per cent decline in the pass rate this year is likely to be because of the removal of teacher assessments which might have been more favourable to pupils in the past.  But there is another issue of pupils being put into the wrong level of qualification because of misplaced school or parental expectation.  One particularly worrying aspect of the National 5 numbers is that, whereas only one pupil in 11 failed such courses in 2013, it is now the case that one child in four fails.  Such a failure rate is doing an injustice to pupils and society in general.  In the case of higher ability pupils, the declines identified at National 5 and Higher represent a challenge to their ability to enter university, find high-value jobs or contribute to the economic progress of the country.

Moves to widen access to students from the poorest backgrounds have also been given a boost.  This year, 4,340 students from the most deprived areas were placed \u0026ndash 14.6 per cent of all Scottish applicants - compared to 4,150 last year.  However, there was a decline in the number of students from the rest of the European Union following the Brexit vote - which makes the future for EU students much more uncertain.  The figures are produced by university admissions service UCAS every year to coincide with the release of Scottish exam results.  Liam McCabe, president of NUS Scotland, welcomed the rise in students from deprived backgrounds, but said further progress was required.  He said: \u0026ldquoWhile it is encouraging to see a modest rise in the proportion of acceptances for those from the most disadvantaged backgrounds, we can\u0026rsquot lose sight of the fact there is much more to do to ensure more students from the poorest areas make it into higher education.  \u0026ldquoWe need to see every institution - without exception - pulling their weight to change the current culture and boost admissions for these students.  Commenting on the fall in acceptances for EU students, he added: \u0026ldquoAs Brexit draws nearer the UK Government must work more closely with the Scottish Government and our universities and colleges to protect all students from the impacts of Brexit.  John Swinney, the Education Secretary, also welcomed the figures.  He said: \u0026ldquoThese show we are making good progress on widening access with the number of students from Scotland\u0026rsquos most deprived areas accepted into university increasing to a record high for the third year in a row.  \u0026ldquoThis increase has been achieved at the same time as the total number of Scottish students from all backgrounds getting a place at a Scottish university has hit a new record.  \u0026ldquoWe know that there is still much to do in closing the attainment gap and in widening access, but this is welcome progress.  Alastair Sim, director of Universities Scotland, which represents principals, said the increase in Scots getting a place was \u0026ldquogreat news.  He added: \u0026ldquoA big success story which shouldn\u0026rsquot be ignored is the rising number of students from the most deprived backgrounds attending universities - this has more than doubled since 2009.  John Kemp, interim chief executive of the Scottish Funding Council, said the figures showed positive progress in key areas.  He said: \u0026ldquoThese results show overall demand for higher education remains strong for Scottish students despite a decrease in the number of pupils in fifth and sixth year.  \u0026ldquoA number of applicants are still waiting to be placed through the clearing process, so a fuller picture is likely to emerge at the end of the applications cycle in a few weeks.  Shona Struthers, chief executive of Colleges Scotland, said pupils should also consider the range of options available in further education - including courses that lead on to university.  She said: \u0026ldquoWe would urge those who have not yet decided what to do next to contact their local college for advice and support.  \u0026ldquoColleges are increasingly becoming the first choice for people as there are a wide range of opportunities that lead to successful careers or further study available at colleges across Scotland."},{"url":null,"title":"how-a-modern-day-tufty-club-scheme-has-helped-red-squirrel-numbers-soar","story":"  Thanks to the Tufty Fluffytail series of public information films, the red squirrel has become one of Britain\u0026rsquos national icons.  Now, the threatened species has enjoyed a big population boost in the Highlands thanks to a road safety campaign launched on its behalf.  Conservationists have revealed that a specially designed rope bridge slung between trees high over a road in Wester Ross has dramatically cut the number of squirrels being killed by cars.  Together with nearby road signs alerting drivers to the squirrels\u0026rsquo presence, it is believed the suspension bridge has helped a colony of the vulnerable animals to thrive.  Charity Trees for Life installed the bridge over a road near Shieldaig last summer as part of its project to reintroduce the species to the northwest Highlands.  The rope bridge is suspended over the A896 outside Shieldaig, which is part of the hugely popular North Coast 500 tourist route, alongside the Ben Shieldaig woodland, which is one of Scotland\u0026rsquos few remaining fragments of ancient Caledonian Forest.  Since the bridge and road signs were introduced, only one known red squirrel death has been reported on the road, with none reported so far in 2018this year.  In the year prior to the safety measures, there were three reported road deaths of reds in the immediate area, with another two on another nearby road.  And, over the same period, two litters of red squirrels have been born that is helping to bolster the local population.  Becky Priestley, Trees for Life\u0026rsquos wildlife officer, said: \u0026ldquoSadly, road traffic is a major risk for wildlife \u0026ndash including red squirrels.  \u0026ldquoWe wanted to take positive action to help the red squirrel population spread into the local woodlands as safely as possible.  \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos safer for reds to travel in the tree canopy rather than on the ground, so it\u0026rsquos likely that if they have the option of using a bridge rather than crossing the road, they will take it.  \u0026ldquoWe also installed feeders at each end of the bridge to encourage the squirrels to use it. The combination of bridge and road signs definitely appears to be working well, which is great news.  The Peoples Trust for Endangered Species says an estimated one million mammals are killed on UK roads each year.  Saving Scotland\u0026rsquos Red Squirrels, a partnership led by the Scottish Wildlife Trust, has also said in recent years that three per cent of red squirrel sightings recorded via its website are of animals dead on roads, with the actual figure believed to be higher.  Estimates suggest there are only 120,000 red squirrels left in Scotland, which is the UK stronghold for the species.  The main threat to their survival comes from the alien grey squirrel, which was introduced from North America in the 1800s.  Larger greys can out-compete their native counterparts for food and nest sites, while also spreading diseases such as squirrel pox. The disease causes no harm to invasive greys but is deadly to reds.  Squirrel pox has helped destroy 95% of native reds in England and Wales since 1952.  For the last three years, Trees for Life has been carefully relocating red squirrels from their strongholds in Inverness-shire and Moray to isolated fragments of suitable Highland forests where reds would once have lived, but to which they cannot return on their own.  The reintroduced populations have been seen exploring their new woodland homes, and have been breeding and spreading into new areas.  Numerous young squirrels have been sighted at the release sites throughout 2018.  Experts say the west Highlands has ideal territory for establishing new colonies of reds because woodlands there are cut off from places with established grey populations and so provide a natural safe haven for native squirrels.  Ms Priestley added: \u0026ldquoEarly indications are that this could be a real wildlife success story. The new squirrel populations are not only flourishing and breeding, they are also starting to spread out into new areas \u0026ndash with squirrels being sighted as far as 15km away."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/8174602.jpg?type=article-full","title":"nicola-sturgeon-hedges-on-independence-vote-call-after-talks-with-theresa-may","story":"  The First Minister said she had a \u0026ldquohuge amount of scepticism that the UK Government would produce enough detail on Brexit and future relations with the EU by the autumn.\u0026nbsp  After previously promising a \u0026ldquoprecise timetable on another vote, she said she now didn\u0026rsquot know what she would say when she updated MSPs on her plans in October.\u0026nbsp  Ms Sturgeon indicated the shift after a 30-minute meeting with Theresa May in Edinburgh, in which she said she gleaned almost nothing new from the Prime Minister.  \u0026ldquoYou\u0026rsquove got a government that I don\u0026rsquot think knows what it\u0026rsquos doing from one day to the next on Brexit, she said, after pressing Mrs May on her Plan B if Brexit negotiations\u0026nbspbreak down.  Asked about the implications for her scheduled update on a second referendum, she said: \u0026ldquoLet\u0026rsquos not get ahead of ourselves.

What the content of that update is, by definition, I don\u0026rsquot know right now.    Ms Sturgeon stressed her decision depended not just on the UK striking a withdrawal agreement, but also on it setting out detailed plans for future relations with\u0026nbsp Brussels, a recently added pre-condition.\u0026nbsp  She said: \u0026ldquoThe Prime Minister said she is still planning to be in a position where there is a detailed statement on the future relationship in October. I\u0026rsquoll leave everybody to draw their own conclusions as to how we get from here to there, given the state of things just now, but that\u0026rsquos what she\u0026rsquos just told me, so we\u0026rsquoll see where we get to.  The First Minister called a second referendum in March 2017 because of Brexit, but then \u0026ldquoreset her plans after the SNP lost a third of its MPs in the general election.\u0026nbsp  In June last year, she said she planned to update MSPs on \u0026ldquothe precise timetable for offering people a choice over the country\u0026rsquos future this autumn, although this was contingent on the UK finishing its negotiations with the EU, \u0026ldquowhen the terms of Brexit will be clearer.  Ms Sturgeon also said she could not back Mrs May\u0026rsquos Chequers deal for a soft Brexit that kept common rules on goods and agri-foods but not services or migration.  She would not support a deal that \u0026ldquoshafted Scotland\u0026rsquos service-based economy, she said.    After talking with Mrs May, Ms Sturgeon said it was still unclear if the Chequers plan was a starting point for talks with Europe or a final offer, and she feared there was an \u0026ldquoawful long distance between the UK and Europe on avoiding a hard border in Northern Ireland.  Ms Sturgeon also attacked former Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson over his remarks that Muslim women wearing the veil look like \u0026ldquoletter boxes and \u0026ldquobank robbers.  She said the comments were a \u0026ldquodisgraceful and deliberate \u0026ldquodog whistle to the right, and urged Mrs May to condemn Mr Johnson\u0026rsquos \u0026ldquoIslamophobia.  However in a media briefing, Mrs May repeatedly refused to condemn Mr Johnson\u0026rsquos words in those terms, saying merely that they had caused offence and merited an apology.  Mrs May and Ms Sturgeon\u0026rsquos meeting, convened on the margins of a signing ceremony for a \u0026pound1.2bn City Deal for Edinburgh, was their first face-to-face encounter since March.  In the months since, relations between Edinburgh and London have nosedived because of profound disagreements over devolution and the constitution, including a UK challenge at the Supreme Court on the validity of Holyrood\u0026rsquos alternative Brexit Bill.  After the meeting, Mrs May insisted the Chequers plan would deliver a good deal for all of the UK, and called on the SNP to get behind it, not \u0026ldquosow division.\u0026nbsp  She said: \u0026ldquoWe have set out a clear proposal in the Chequers plan that delivers on the Brexit vote while protecting jobs and livelihoods in the UK. That\u0026rsquos important for all parts of the UK.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp  \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquore negotiating [with the EU] as the United Kingdom.\u0026nbsp I think it\u0026rsquos incumbent on all parts of the United Kingdom to be supporting the proposals that we\u0026rsquore putting forward in their interaction with Brussels.  \u0026ldquoI think it\u0026rsquos important we see those proposals being supported rather than, sadly, what I fear what we see here, which is an attempt to sow the politics of division.  International Trade Secretary Liam Fox said on Sunday, who previously predicted a deal would be the \u0026ldquoeasiest in the world, said the odds of a chaotic no deal were now 60-40.    Mrs May ducked questions on whether she agreed with his assessment.  Ms Sturgeon said on Monday the negotiating \u0026ldquoscare tactic only made a no deal more likely.\u0026nbsp  Official analyses have suggested a no deal, in which the UK crashed out of the EU with a future relationship on trade and customs agreed, could damage the economy, lead to log-jams at the ports, create food and drug shortages, and potentially lead to civil unrest.  Professor Sir John Curtice of Strathclyde University said he expected a second referendum to be \u0026ldquokicked into the long grass.  He told the Courier newspaper: \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos very contingent on Brexit. I think at the moment the odds are against it, but probably only marginally.  He said if the SNP was planning a referendum, Ms Sturgeon would have been much more politically active this summer, rather than keeping a fairly low profile.  He added: \u0026ldquoIf you make the assumption that Ms Sturgeon wants to remain first minister until at least May 2021 \u0026ndash and if you also make the not unreasonable assumption that if she holds an early referendum and loses she\u0026rsquos out \u0026ndash you can see that she has a strong disincentive at the moment to go (for Indyref2).  Ms Sturgeon said she respected Prof Curtice but he \u0026ldquodoes not live inside my head.  Mrs May would almost certainly reject another call for a second independence referendum if Ms Sturgeon were to ask for one, especially given her reliance on the DUP at Westminster.  However even a rejection could be useful to Ms Sturgeon, as she could claim it as evidence of the UK treating Scotland with contempt in the run-up to the 2021 Holyrood election.\u0026nbsp"},{"url":null,"title":"scottish-government-urged-to-act-on-bed-blocking","story":"  Official statistics reveal 1,436 people were delayed in being discharged from hospital when a census was taken in June, up 10% from 1,300 in June 2017.  Delayed discharge \u0026ndash also known as bed blocking \u0026ndash occurs when patients are fit to leave hospital but are unable to, often due to a lack of social care.  Age Scotland said older people put off going into hospital for fear of becoming \u0026ldquostuck in the system and called on ministers to act.  Health Secretary Jeane Freeman said nearly \u0026pound500 million is going to health and social care to drive down delayed discharge.  Of those patients affected in the June census, the vast majority \u0026ndash 1,187 \u0026ndash were delayed for more than three days.  For almost three-quarters (74%) this was due to health and social care issues, followed by having complex needs for 23% and patients and family reasons in 3% of cases.  A total of 573 patients at the census point were delayed for more than four weeks while 28 had been waiting to leave for more than a year.  The daily average number of beds blocked rose for the sixth consecutive month to 1,413.  In total, patients spent 42,375 days in hospital due to delayed discharge in June, up 8% from 39,252 in June 2017.  Age Scotland claimed this increase would cost around \u0026pound727,000, based on an average of \u0026pound233 a day.  Chief executive Brian Sloan said: \u0026ldquoAround four in 10 people who are ready to leave hospital are waiting more than a month to do so. This is scandalous.  \u0026ldquoKeeping people in hospital longer than necessary delays the start of their recovery, puts them at risk of infections, causes loss of mobility and can have a devastating effect on their mental health.  Ms Freeman said: \u0026ldquoJune has seen a 2% decrease in bed days lost to delay compared with the previous month.  \u0026ldquoDuring 2017/18, we achieved a 7% reduction in bed days lost to delay and we are looking to continue that overall progress this year.  \u0026ldquoTo support that, we have transferred nearly half a billion pounds from the NHS into social care and integration this financial year, and the health budget will increase by almost \u0026pound2 billion 2021."},{"url":null,"title":"oil-giants-face-new-campaign-to-root-out-corruption","story":"  Global Witness launched what it called a groundbreaking new tool called Finding The Missing Millions to check whether corporate giants, including North Sea operators, are delivering on promises of tax.  The group said payments from firms such as Shell, BP and Glencore amount to hundreds of billions of dollars and are a vital source of government revenue.  Yet Global Witness added that all too often the money gets siphoned off by elites instead of benefitting people in resource-rich countries.  Now big companies in Europe and Canada have to publish their payments.  This data can be used to check if money gets to communities.  Dominic Eagleton, senior campaigner at Global Witness, explained: \u0026ldquoScrutinising payment data from extractive companies has the power to change the lives of millions of people around the world.  \u0026ldquoThis is money for investing in hospitals, doctors, medicines, teachers, schools, universities, roads and railways.  \u0026ldquoFinding The Missing Millions will help people use these game-changing new disclosures to hold governments and industry accountable for vital public funds.  The handbook features 10 different methods for using data from oil, gas and mining projects to check whether companies are paying the right amount to governments. Each method features \u0026ldquoreal life case studies to show how this can be done.  One example looks at payments that are earmarked for development projects to benefit mining-affected communities in South Goa, India. The payments were due to be transferred by the mining company Vedanta to a local district authority.  Previously, a lack of transparency made it impossible for local people to know how much they were owed from Vedanta\u0026rsquos mine, and to follow the money into government accounts. By using a method shown in the handbook, the group revealed that Vedanta owed $2.1 million (\u0026pound1.6m) to local communities.  Mr Eagleton added: \u0026ldquoSecrecy in the oil and mining industries has enabled corrupt elites to loot hundreds of billions of dollars while people in resource-rich countries live in poverty.  \u0026ldquoRevenue transparency can help put an end to this scandal, but the full benefits will only be realised if people actively use the data. Citizens, campaigners, journalists and others can now take advantage of this important new tool to hold the industry accountable, and ultimately ensure that communities reap the full benefits from their resources."},{"url":null,"title":"early-viewing-figures-positive-for-glasgow-2018","story":"  Germany\u0027s public-service broadcaster has reported more than two million viewers over the first five days of the inaugural European Championships, with positive numbers also coming from France.

SDLP politician Declan O\u0026rsquoLoan said he was the first person to sign the petition in Ballymena, which has been dominated by Paisleyism for generations.  Although the law allows for up to 10 locations where constituents can sign the petition, the Electoral Office of Northern Ireland has established just three, leading to criticism.  Sinn Fein have complained some voters would have to make a 25-mile trip to sign a petition, and would be unable to do so outside working hours.  It also suggested some would be reluctant to sign the petition in heavily unionist Ballymoney.

The board has refused to publish what it gave Ms Mclay, telling the media to submit freedom of information requests, despite the figure ultimately having to appear in its annual accounts.  The BBC reported on Wednesday her exit deal was around \u0026pound90,000 including pension.  Ms Mclay left the board after going on sick leave in April, the day after she was told she could no longer continue in the role after a series of financial scandals at NHS Tayside.  Besides requiring \u0026ldquobrokerage loans of \u0026pound33.2m from the Scottish Government over five years to avoid going bust, NHS Tayside\u0027s top management team was replaced after cash from a charity endowment fund was used to pay for projects including a new IT system.  On Monday, Ms Marra, the chair of Holyrood\u0026rsquos public audit committee, which had tracked the financial problems at the board, claimed Ms Mclay\u0026rsquos pay-off had been \u0026pound300,000.  She also said the \u0026ldquogolden handshake was a \u0026ldquoslap in the face to local people.  The board denied the number and its chair John Brown has now written to Ms Marra with more details, but the number has still not been officially verified.  SNP MSP Sandra White demanded Ms Marra retract her \u0026ldquosmears against NHS Tayside.  Ms White, who sits on Holyrood\u0026rsquos Health committee, said: \u0026ldquoJenna Marra must now retract these utterly bogus and baseless claims after the health board has proven them to be utterly false. We are used to this sort of thing from Labour, as they continually seek to mislead when it comes to the NHS in Scotland.  \u0026ldquoBut Ms Marra\u0026rsquos claims aren\u0026rsquot just wrong and misleading, they are wildly off the mark \u0026ndash and it appears to be a deliberate attempt to undermine our health service.  \u0026ldquoPeople have legal entitlements and the NHS simply cannot refuse to make those payments, but as Tayside has said throughout there has been no \u0026lsquopay off\u0026rsquo or golden goodbye as Ms Marra claimed.  \u0026ldquoJenny Mara must now apologise and publicly retract her baseless claims \u0026ndash as well as setting out on what basis she made them.  Ms Marra said: \"I am sure most people will agree that such a huge severance payment is inappropriate in this case.  \"SNP politicians should explain to their constituents why they think it is acceptable for a health board that has been chronically underfunded by their own government to reward failure.  \"If NHS Tayside had been honest about the extent of this pay off in the first place, the board could have gone some way to starting to rebuild trust with patients and staff. Instead, it has now been forced to release this information that should have been made public in the first place.  \u0026ldquoI look forward to seeing Audit Scotland\u0026rsquos opinion on this payment when they publish their latest emergency report in September on the financial mess at NHS Tayside.\"  Tory MSP Bill Bowman demanded clarity about the cost of Mclay\u0026rsquos exit.  He said: \u0026ldquoPeople in Tayside will be confused this morning with wildly conflicting reports of the payout received by Lesley Mclay.  \u0026ldquoThe convener of Holyrood\u0026rsquos public audit committee suggested the figure was more than three times that outlined in the media today.  \u0026ldquoIn order to restore full confidence in the process and the way in which taxpayers money is being spent, the arrangements should be verified by an independent source.  \u0026ldquoThe public - and in particular patients and staff at NHS Tayside - have the right to know exactly what has happened.

The issue was highlighted by NFU Scotland during a round table discussion at the New Deer Show last month and farmers are concerned they will have difficulty transporting livestock, particularly those making the journey from Ellon to the other side of the city at Portlethen.Mr Chapman, who is also a farmer, said the situation also raises the question of increased greenhouse gas emissions from agricultural vehicles being forced to travel through the city.He said: “My view is that this road is not a motorway, it is a dual carriageway and therefore tractors should be permitted to travel along the route.“I have written to Transport Scotland, but I have yet to receive a response.

While staying there in 1952 the Queen Mother saw Barrogill Castle, purchased it and renamed it the Castle of Mey.She restored it and stayed there regularly from 1955 until her death in 2002. The castle has been open to the public since then and attracts 25,000 visitors a year.After the Vyners sold their property it was run as a hotel from 1967 until 1974. When it then went on the market, the rock band Led Zeppelin looked at it with the aim of turning it into a recording studio although the plan did not come to fruition.Stuart \u0026ldquoWoody Wood from the Bay City Rollers also showed interest as a buyer but it was purchased by a clothes manufacturer before he sold it to the current owner\u0026rsquos family in the mid-1980s.The house \u0026ndash built between 1895 and 1908 \u0026ndash was also said to have been used as the backdrop for a horror film in the 1970s.The property is in need of refurbishment but could be developed as a hotel, as serviced apartments, as a bed-and-breakfast business or as a family home, according to the auctioneers.The 1800 acres of land is suitable \u0026ldquofor sport and grouse shooting, while the six lochs are said to be ideal for brown trout fishing.

Another is from Sandra Gow, of Lybster, who stated that the plan would be detrimental to the \u0026ldquoexisting, privately owned hotels, B\u0026ampBs and self-caterers in the surrounding areas with the potential of closure to many small businesses during the winter months.The chamber, however, has since sought to clarify its stance, stating in a post on the planning department\u0026rsquos website that the original objection was \u0026ldquomade specifically on behalf of our members in the hospitality industry.Of the documented cases submitted to planning, the Caithness Disabled Access Panel has written in support of the hotel plan.It says it accepts the development could impact on other hotels, but adds: \u0026ldquoIt will be the only hotel in the county with completely disabled bedrooms and showers and adhering to the laws on discrimination.The organisation says it has had \u0026ldquonumerous complaints from visitors in the county on the lack of disabled rooms in the area.Since the chamber\u0026rsquos objection was first reported on July 13, social media users have voiced their feelings.Those posting online generally have fallen onto two sides \u0026ndash those in support of local hoteliers, and an opposition accusing them of self-interest.\u0026ldquoWe need more beds.

People with physical, vision and intellectual disabilities are eligible to compete.\u0026ldquoThis is a golden opportunity for local groups, individuals and businesses to raise awareness to their cause and raise funds from their stalls on the day, he said. \u0026ldquoWe are hoping the event will showcase Caithness in a positive way for tourism, business and the community.Sixty para-athletes will travel from as far afield as America and Australia and all over the UK to take part in the milestone event. The Mey Games will be unique as it welcomes both para and Invictus athletes to compete in traditional Highland track-and-field competitions.

But we are aware that this could cause difficulties for some community groups and we are asking for views on the sort of events where we should consider waiving a kitchen charge. An example of this might be an event to raise funds for the local community.”The council has said the budget simulator exercise they carried out in 2016 demonstrated a willingness among the public for an increase in charges for services if this helped reduce the need for cuts to frontline services.Initial discussions on the possibility of charging for the use of community school kitchens have been held with the chairs of many of Orkney’s community associations, who will be contacted again and asked for further feedback — including suggestions for the types of events that should be excluded from a kitchen hire charge.Other groups and individuals can also provide views and ideas by sending an email to education.leisure@orkney.gov.uk  or writing to Community Learning and Development, Council Offices, School Place, Kirkwall, Orkney KW15 1NY.\u0026copy The Orcadian - 2018A division of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The ONWP is keen that people come along to find out more, and specifically what will be happening in Orkney.The events are open to the public, and it’s hoped that Orkney’s landowners will attend. Additional events will be held on the islands that Macca and Angela will be working on.The ONWP, which is a partnership between Scottish Natural Heritage (SNH) and RSPB Scotland, aims to protect Orkney’s native wildlife by removing stoats, an invasive non-native predator that was first recorded in Orkney in 2010.Since 2010, stoats have spread and established across Mainland Orkney, Burray and South Ronaldsay.There have also been a handful of sightings reported on other islands including Hoy and, most recently, Shapinsay. Traps and motion-activated cameras have been used to try to determine whether stoats are present on these other islands following possible sightings. However, the presence or absence of stoats on all “high-risk” islands must be determined before the eradication programme to remove stoats can commence.Stoats are notoriously difficult to detect particularly when they are at low densities. Therefore, the only way to be certain that stoats are not present is to use specially-trained dogs to systematically search for signs and scent of stoats.Plans are in place to train six dogs as part of the main project, but, as they take years of training, Macca has been brought in from New Zealand to help confirm the presence or absence of stoats on islands that are at high-risk from stoat invasion due to their proximity to Mainland Orkney.High-risk islands are those that are within a swimmable distance of islands where stoats are established. Stoats can swim considerable distances (at least 3 km) over open water.\u0026copy The Orcadian - 2018A division of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

track","story":"\u0026nbspMULTI-million pound efforts to improve water supplies in Ross-shire have been welcomed by a local MP.Jamie Stone visited a Scottish Water site near Evanton this week to view progress on a \u0026pound5.5 million project to improve security of the water supply for customers across much of Easter Ross and beyond.Work at the site has been underway since February this year and is expected to be complete in early 2019.A new tank is being built with a capacity to store up to eight million litres of drinking water, improving security of supply for around 30,000 customers across Easter Ross, Dingwall and the Black Isle.The work is being carried out by Scottish Water alliance partner ESD, in partnership with contractor Coffey Construction.After seeing the work in progress and receiving an update on Scottish Water\u0026rsquos current work across his Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross constituency, Mr Stone said: \"The long period of dry weather this summer is a reminder that, even in the Highlands, water is a precious resource that we all rely on in countless ways.\"The work currently taking place will help to improve the security of water supply for Easter Ross in the event of any future issues at the water treatment works or disruption to the local water network.\u0026nbsp\"At the same time, it is good to hear of the work Scottish Water\u0026rsquos operational teams are currently carrying out across the north to maintain supplies and protect the local environment.\"Despite some recent rainfall, it is still important that we use water wisely to help lochs and reservoirs recover so that supplies can be maintained through the rest of the summer and beyond,\" he added.ESD project manager Kevin Williamson said the works remained on track for completion next year.He said: \"The work we are delivering reflects a significant investment for one of the key water supply areas in the Highlands, which serves communities right around the Cromarty Firth.\"Work on site is going well and we anticipate it will be complete early next year.\u0026nbsp\"Once in place, the new storage tank will give Scottish Water improved ability to carry out important maintenance work at the water treatment works, and deal with any short term issues affecting the local water network, without impact on customers\u0026rsquo water supply.\"\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspMeanwhile, Scottish Water has urged customers to do what they can to conserve water amidst this year\u0026rsquos very dry summer.Its strategic customer service planning team Leader for the north, Jim Briggs, said: \"Separately from this longer term investment, we are continuing work in consultation with Sepa to manage water resources across the north following the prolonged period of dry weather.\"Despite some rainfall in many areas over the past week, our frontline teams are continuing to work hard to ensure we can maintain supplies to all of our customers.\"We continue to need customers to help us by using water wisely, for example by using a watering can instead of a hose in the garden and only using dishwashers and washing machines when fully loaded.\u0026nbsp\"The support of thousands of customers with these small and simple steps can make a big difference to maintaining water supplies for everyone and allowing water resources to recover when rainfall occurs.\"He added that the Evanton project will help to provide \"clear, fresh-tasting drinking water to our customers in a wide range of circumstances\".Wednesday 8 Aug 2018

The number of property viewings conducted by Galbraith in the Highlands has increased from 167 this time last year to 216 in 2018, a rise of 29 per cent.Increased demand has also seen the average time taken to sell property drop by 21 per cent since last year.Phiddy Robertson, who handles residential sales for Galbraith in Inverness, revealed that the average price of property sold from the firm\u0026rsquos Inverness office during the quarter rose 14.8 per cent from \u0026pound284,992 in the previous quarter to \u0026pound327,21\"The market has picked up significantly since 2015 and in 2018 the first six months show a steady increase in activity,\" she said.\"Demand for well-sited property remains high, with competition leading to more closing dates, most of which achieve significant premiums over the asking price, while there is also greater movement at the top end of the residential market.\"The region continues to be a draw for new residents moving in from outside the area.\"While prices are rising, the Highland area remains less expensive than many other parts of the UK and we see buyers from all over the country making the move here to enjoy a better quality of life,\" Ms Robertson added.The UK government House Price Index for May 2018 noted that the largest regional increase in sales by volume in Scotland was for the Highland region, where volumes increased by 3.9 per cent on the previous year.Currently on the market with Galbraith in Inverness are the following properties:The Galbraith letting department for Inverness also enjoyed a busy quarter.The number of relets agreed increased by 25 per cent compared with the previous quarter. Viewings also increased by five per cent for rental properties and the average time taken to find a tenant for a rental property was just six days.Sarah Hazzard, who manages lettings for Galbraith in Inverness, said: \"We find that both city-centre properties and well-presented cottages in rural areas are snapped up soon after becoming available.\"Landlords are able to increase the rents they charge between tenancies due to the very limited supply of rental property in Inverness-shire and the very strong demand from tenants. We offer a full service which takes the hassle away from the owner and gives them peace of mind that we will manage the whole lettings process, ensure the rent is paid, and find the best possible tenant.\"Wednesday 8 Aug 2018 8:38 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

The disastrous roll-out of universal credit that was piloted in the Highlands has resulted in vast swathes of unnecessary suffering.\"Folk, many of whom are working, are being driven into destitution and families are being left with no choice but to rely on foodbanks.\u0026nbsp\"These are political choices and it\u0026rsquos high time those in power in Westminster took responsibility for the unnecessary suffering they are causing to folk in the Highlands, and indeed across the UK.\"Ms Todd and fellow SNP MSP Kate Forbes have now opened up their office for use as a food drop-off point in a bid to encourage more Ross-shire residents to donate as organisations struggle to keep up with demand.The kind-hearted pair said constituents will be able to leave food parcels, containing non-perishable items including pasta, rice and coffee, at their office in Dingwall High Street.And they have teamed up with Blythswood Care, which runs the Highland foodbank network, in response to the news that the number of children using the Dingwall site has risen by more than 50 per cent. The facility has also been appealing for extra donations to meet demand.\"When we saw the recent plea for food bank donations, we thought this was something we could do to help,\" Ms Forbes said. \"For the first six months of the year, 40 children have received food parcels from the Dingwall food bank, which is more than a 50 per cent increase on the previous year. This is deeply concerning.\"Across the Highlands there is a 10 per cent year-on-year rise in the number of adults receiving food parcels, whilst the number is over 25 per cent for children.\"It\u0026rsquos a sign of the times that people are dependent on food donations in a rich country \u0026ndash and an indictment on welfare reform which has left people with no other choices.\"Although the total number of people across the Highlands and the number of children using food banks have both risen, the number of adults being referred to the Dingwall food bank has fallen.Blythswood Care\u0026rsquos projects manager Finlay Mackenzie spoke of his gratitude to the two MSPs for opening their office for donations.He believes families who normally receive additional support during the school term need more help during the summer holidays.He said: \"Sadly we see an increase in referrals to our food banks across the Highlands year on year.\"This summer there has been an even greater need with many families needing extra support who would usually receive free school meals and have children who attend breakfast clubs.\"Food donations usually drop during the summer but with media support we have been very encouraged by the generous donations by the public.\"We are very grateful for the support and involvement of Kate Forbes MSP and Maree Todd MSP whose backing helps to highlight the plight of local people in times of crisis.\"Wednesday 8 Aug 2018 8:38 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

I have been to a college fresher\u0026rsquos fair on Skye. They invite us each year and we have a stall, which is great.\"The people that we meet have no problems at all. But it\u0026rsquos quite interesting what you see when you\u0026rsquore on the stall.\"People walk down the stalls and then take a wide berth when they are going past our stall, and then continue. \"She added: \"The general public reaction can be quite funny because they\u0026rsquore not sure, they don\u0026rsquot know what to say to us, they do not understand \u0026ndash and that is one of the things we want to try and help people with. We want to help people to understand what LGBTI is and understand the terminology.\"The last known gay pride demonstration in Inverness was in 2002.Eden Court chief executive James Mackenzie-Blackman, who relocated from London in October to take on the theatre\u0026rsquos top role, strongly welcomed the forthcoming Proud Ness event.He said: \"My absolute position is that this is brilliant \u0026ndash and how exciting that something like this is happening in the Highlands.\"Wednesday 8 Aug 2018 8:38 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

But it has lodged an application in the hope permission will be in place to begin as soon as the funding target is met.The plans feature a cinema seating roughly 30 people and hosting weekly screenings, rising to twice-weekly in the summer.It would also be used to help house Cromarty\u0026rsquos growing annual film festival, which attracts fans and famous faces from across the country.Cromarty Estate plans to build an office hub alongside the cinema to cater for growing business demand.A spokesman said: \"Cromarty has a thriving entrepreneurial community but this is not matched by suitable office accommodation. The result is that many find themselves having to move their business bases from Cromarty to Dingwall, Tore or Inverness when they outgrow their own homes, with the resulting loss of employment opportunities in the town.\"\u0026nbspThe society hopes to screen at least one movie a week drawn from the film programme at Eden Court in Inverness.It would initially be volunteer-run but there are plans to eventually train up managers and projectionists \"who would also be able to work at Eden Court\".Mr Mackenzie-Blackman said sharing films in this way would allow the film society to avoid having to pay licensing fees.He said, in addition, Eden Court may handle online bookings from its box office in Inverness.He added: \"If Cromarty and Resolis Film Society raise the money needed to make the project happen I will be firmly supportive of it.\"We will work in collaboration with them to help them project the cinema in Cromarty.\"Wednesday 8 Aug 2018 8:38 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

At the start we were worried she wouldn\u0026rsquot make it.\"While Spirtle was stranded she suffered dehydration and sunburn and photographs taken at the time showed the extent of her injuries.Recently, she was photographed with her mother Porridge, sister Honey and a new-born calf believed to also belong to Porridge.Whale and Dolphin Conservation officer Charlie Phillips photographed the \"well-known\" family last week while on Dolphin Spirit\u0026rsquos Mischief RIB.

Local business figures have warned that caution should be taken when analysing the figures.David Richardson, Highlands and Islands development manager for the Federation of Small Businesses, believes the area\u0026rsquos vast size and sparse population must be taken into account.\"Before discussing the Highlands position in the rather grisly league table one must first ask whether deaths per 10,000 people is a fair measurement,\" he said.\"The Highlands\u0026rsquo enormous size, tiny and highly dispersed population, and relatively poor public transport provision means that people here are more dependent on cars than in many other parts of the UK.\"If comparisons are being made then deaths per mile of road should perhaps be given too.\"Moreover, for much of the year the local population is massively boosted by visitors. I understand that visitors are included in the road death figures but not in the population figures, and presumably this significantly skews the results.\u0026nbsp\"Whatever the case, all deaths and injuries on roads are tragedies and it is of the utmost importance that our road network is fit for purpose for all: locals, business users, and visitors alike.\"FSB has called for increased investment for many years now, and while Highland Council\u0026rsquos recent announcement that it is allocating an additional \u0026pound1.5 million to road upgrades is extremely welcome, one has to ask if it is enough.\"Wednesday 8 Aug 2018 8:38 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

Who’s Who in Scotland 2018 has just been published – at a price of £75  (a snip). It is not a book that will get a large number of reviews, I suspect, as many reviewers might find it difficult to find anything to say about it. What are they to write? “This book is short on plot but very strong on characters – there are 5,000 of them ...” Or, perhaps, “the alphabetical structure of Who’s Who in Scotland has much to recommend it ...”             This book, however, makes excellent reading and shows us just what a fascinating and peculiar country we live in. Take people’s private pursuits, for example: at the end of each entry there is a heading “recreations” and it is here that people disclose, usually in two or three words, what they get up to when they aren’t doing all the distinguished things mentioned in the main body of their entry. A trawl through the pages of Who’s Who in Scotland reveals that travel and walking are probably the most popular activities. Entrants do not disclose, though, where they are travelling to, nor indeed where they are walking and why. But distinguished Scots are certainly travelling and walking in great numbers.            READ MORE: Alexander McCall Smith: Should there be second referendums on Brexit and independence?Many of them state that their recreation is running. This is almost as popular as walking. Some of them may be running away from something, but this is not mentioned, which is probably just as well. One entrant, a politician, lists his recreations as rugby, family, and whisky (in that order). Jamie Byng, publisher of Canongate, reports his recreations as tennis, cooking, deejaying, reading, and drinking. Another, a minister of the Kirk, includes amongst his recreations wining and dining and visiting Vienna and York. Vienna and York would be tame destinations, though, for an earlier entry which records, amongst others, the following expeditions: East Greenland (1966) Elephant Island, Antarctica, 1970-71, and Everest in 1976.Recreations aside, it is encouraging to see that there are very large numbers of accomplished people in Scotland – undoubtedly rather more than one might expect in a country of Scotland’s size. If one is of the ‘wha’s like us’ school, one will find plenty of proof here of one’s thesis. After all, here we find Brown, Rt Hon (James) Gordon, Prime Minister Darling of Roulanish, Baron (Alistair Maclean Darling), Chancellor of the Exchequer and Higgs, Professor Peter Ware (recreations, music, walking and swimming) who started off with the Hughes Medal of the Royal Society in 1981 and ended up with the Nobel Prize in 2013. All three of these are people of immense achievement, but their entries are characteristically modest, which is encouraging. Scotland has never been noted for a fondness for bragging, and this is reflected in Who’s Who in Scotland. There is room for everybody in this volume, even those whose role in life is to be a local councillor or the deputy-head of a primary school. And why not? Civic life depends on people who undertake these roles. They may not be the most glamorous callings, but they are at the heart of our society and should be applauded, cherished, and duly recorded in books like this. Such people are worth any number of celebrities.  READ MORE: Famous discovery has ‘ruined my life’, says Professor HiggsThe gentry and above are here, all right, although they are, by and large, discreet – even diffident about their lineage. After all, Scottish nobles have been a somewhat rapacious lot throughout our history, and it is understandable that their descendants should limit themselves to only three or four lines in Who’s Who in Scotland. They often describe their occupation as farmer, but of course the real situation is given away by their recreations which are usually listed as hunting and fishing. The more tactful will write country sports, but we all know that does not include mah jong. Their addresses also reveal what’s what. They usually live in a House, or, quite often, a Castle. On the subject of addresses, the McEwens of Muck are not in this volume, which is a pity. The MacEwen family has the most wonderful address ever: McEwen, Muck, Scotland. And Andy Murray is not here either, which is odd, although everyone knows that his recreation is tennis."},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4780818.1533739806!/image/image.jpg","title":"john swinney the evidence shows scottish education is first class","story":"Sorry, we\u0027re having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...

The number of awards of skills-based qualifications increased to over 50,300 this year, more than double the number in 2012.            That reinforces to me, yet again, that we have fantastic young people led by dedicated teachers and lecturers delivering first-class education in our schools and colleges every day.

It will be a fitting local legacy of the Year of Young People 2018.”\n\n\nAre they going to remove the bus shelter to allow for the mural to be done\nI sincerely hope the art work or whatever, is not some form of contemporary, conceptual, expressionism or modern art rubbish, where splashing paint onto the wall is regarded as art when in reality it is utter rubbish\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.oh, but you can see the movement of the paint, the blending of colours and the meaningless shapes etc etc\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230and then give an equally rubbish title like Lerwick on a stormy night, the meaning of life or some other pointless title.\nOver the years art has very much lowered its standards significantly to make and justify it becoming more commercially viable\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.just as bad, selling a reproduction at almost the same price of the original work as a so-called \u0026#8216 limited edition rubbish \u0026#8216.\nI would think even Graffiti would be more interesting to look at\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230atleast, for the best part, you can still see what was being represented in terms of graphics and text.\nNo doubt the PC Brigade would like it because it gives the opportunity for somebody to express themselves through art and life experience\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230..despite the fact everybody else looks upon it as pointless and meaningless rubbish.\nLove the art, shame about the bus service, waiting for an area and all that. Never mind, the Morons have control!! I just hope no funds are wasted on this idiocy. How about a Council spend on a Shetland Wildlife centre based in Lerwick. Infinitely more valuable than Mareel, a far greater attraction for tourists,  hopefully, a better and local architect employed. Something less like an inverted bedpan with windows that Mareel so reminds me ..\n Oh, I forgot, the forcefield would need lowered to allow them to leave!!\nWhy not use that glaringly white, huge marquee beside the Clickimin Leisure Centre, called something like 60/40 ?  It\u0026#8217s crying out for some sort of camouflage before moss and lichen gradually take over that task.  Decorating it could become a regular summer holiday event for young people.  It has potential as an exciting, big, artistic canvas after all.\nThere are many young people who do not participate in sport but who might be more interested in such an art project. Great though it is that there are so many facilities for sporty types perhaps it is time to re-balance provision and support for those not so inclined.\n Next you\u0026#8217ll be saying Hjaltland should build houses with more than one bedroom outside of Lerwick!!\nI think the Mareel is a fine looking structure. It also won an award from the Civic Trust so I’m clearly not alone. That won’t stop the philistines from sticking their oars in I know but it would be nice to think that one day the scales may fall from their eyes and the axes they are so keen to grind will forever remain blunt.\nIf you like concrete and glass, gaudy displays and tarmac, Mareel fits the bill! As regards, \u0026#8220The Arts\u0026#8221, Mareel has hardly proved the game changer as so promised.  In fact, Shetland Arts at Mareel have achieved ?? SFA in my humble opinion. Mareel made a few pounds for a few usual suspects, talentless arty parasites. The talented have been left to fend for themselves.  Best live artistic performance on Shetland since Mareel opened, \u0026#8220Status Quo\u0026#8221, thanks, Malcomn Younger and \u0026#8220Scottish National Ballet, \u0026#8220Highland Fling \u0026#8220, just my view. No surprise Mareel featured in neither. !!!  Now, how about what matters, a Shetland Wildlife centre in Lerwick. Hardly need to spend £15 million on that. A scientific, educational asset that may help to educate our children and a massive tourist attraction.  Would not even need a bar!!!\nThe Shard in London, an amazingly beatiful structure is made from steel, glass and concrete.  Skyscrapers in New York are also made from the same materials. Buildings, too many to list here, in most countries on the planet also depend on their construction from the use of ——— steel, concrete and glass.   Building methods change along with building materials.  I suppose there are some people who would like to see the continued use of materials once employed in the construction of cathedrals and even the pyramids of Egypt but it’s not going to happen. One day, that simple truth may dawn on those trapped in a narrow focus world.\nCome on Haydn I agree there are many beautiful building all round the world made from concrete and glass, but the tin shed that is mareel is definitely not one of them.\nThe Shard is a massive glass pyramid\u0026#8230.I\u0026#8217m wholly indifferent to it in every way. At least its somewhat better than The Gherkin, which closely resembles a huge glass butt plug\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.\nMareel resembles a cheap mass produced tin shed which has broken its back.\nIf I have a point to make here, its that the choice of materials for any one given building are largely irrelevant to what that building is when completed. Massive useless carbuncles were created in the days when only timber and rock were the materials used \u0026#8211 There\u0026#8217s the most of one of them still sitting in Scalloway yet as proof.\nAll the choice of materials can do is either increase or decrease how much of a carbuncle it appears to be, but a carbuncle is always going to be a carbuncle whatever its made from.\nCall me old fashioned but I would love to see the modern  building business that could build a pyramid like the meg aliths of Egypt. Stones of 25 to 80 tonnes brought in from three to four hundred miles  ,all done 5000 years ago.It\u0026#8217s true you really can\u0026#8217t get the staff nowadays. I wonder if the Pharoahs had problems getting folk to pick their fruitcrops \u0026#8211 the British ways of one can\u0026#8217t get ones hands dirty and keep Johnny foreigner out is about  to finish off  another burgeoning industry.\nI’m curious to know how a concrete and glass building can also be made from tin (tin shed). Somebody seems to be a bit mixed up!   As for the Shard looking like a massive pyramid what about the Louvre pyramid in Paris which is made from the same materials already mentioned. It was designed by I M Pei, a Chinese -American architect and it is a marvel.  May I suggest that those who have never stood next to it or walked around inside it make the effort to include it in their  bucket list of things to do before the grim reaper does his job and whips them off to the pyramid in the sky.\nAluminium, tin the terms are interchangeable when it comes to foil and sheds.\nI’m sure your terminology is correct Ali but would you not agree that the use of the  term ‘ tin shed’ lies not so much in  identifying the material nature of that being used but more an attempt  to denigrate the quality of the end product by likening it to a humble run of the mill structure?  Rather like calling a van a box on wheels? I am too well aware that for some people the only way to deliver criticism is to resort to demeaning  comments which, ironically, rebound on themselves. But that is just my personal approach to delivering an opinion.\nIf it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck and looks like a duck, it is probably a duck. The same goes for tin sheds.\n@ Haydn Gear.\nWhen there is nothing of note to differentiate one building constructed from certain materials apart from other run of the mill mundane buildings of similar materials and style, there is nothing to denigrate. It is a case of being factually accurate.\nPretentiousness is no more admirable than denigration.\nUnless you already know Mareel\u0026#8217s purpose and that its supposedly an \u0026#8216iconic\u0026#8217 design, it looks exactly like a run of the mill tin shed that\u0026#8217s broken its back, just the same as the Viking Bus Station looks like a certain style of building that earned itself the nickname \u0026#8216The Pagoda\u0026#8217 as soon as it was built.\nLet us not quibble over semantics, but I would compare the architectural award for \u0026#8220Mareel\u0026#8221 to be somewhat like The Turner award for Damiens Hurst\u0026#8217s \u0026#8220Pickled cow and calf.\u0026#8221, Just a load of pretentious codswallop! To the real point, for countless £ millions (£16?), Lerwick now has a cinema, a new bar and a Cafe. Shetland Arts have a splendid Gin Palace as a new headquarters. The contribution to original art on Shetland, by Mareel, since its opening, has been conspicuous by its absence! Nothing of lasting merit, since Mareel\u0026#8217s gaudy doors, were flung wide open.\nI have never seen any tin sheds on Shetland which resemble Mareel. If any actually do exist , maybe someone would be kind enough to direct me to them so that I can criticise them for looking like Mareel.   What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.  Further to that, there is never any shortage of those who seem to get a kick  out of venting there spleens in those directions.  I wonder how much input into the Shetland cultural activities these people contribute or is their primary function to stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments?  I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever, walk into an art gallery and loudly claim that their five years old grandson could do better. Pig ignorant prats.\nLeaving Lerwick on the boat last week, I happened to overhear some tourists comments on mareel, they were not impressed to say the least. And when I informed them that it had won an award for architecture, they laughed out loud and one comment was by who, a blind man?\nThose of us who are long in the tooth remember the foaming at the mouth and rending of garments that went on about Mareel prior to its opening. It all stopped soon afterwards, leaving the field to a few cranks.\nPurely as an addendum, I don’t suppose that the nickname The Pagoda was  in any way at all a reference to China or of people of Chinese ancestry was it?  I wonder if takeaway customers are over concerned about certain mild architectural  similarities.\nThe viking was a chippy when it opened.\n\u0026#8220What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.\u0026#8221 Well said Hadyn Gear, Especially well illustrated by, \u0026#8221 is their primary function to stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments? \u0026#8220, \u0026#8220I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever\u0026#8221 and \u0026#8221 Pig ignorant prats.\u0026#8221 Your words, Haydn! A Turner for you for contemporary hypocrisy perhaps!\n\nWell Ian, I think the key word in your missive is the last one —PERHAPS.    I submit that it more truthfully should be PERHAPS NOT.  There’s really not much mileage in playing this game of tug of war is there? All is does is underpin the fact that opinions, both informed and uninformed , proliferate.  Those who shout the loudest and longest think they have won when they have actually simply become hoarse.  I know that to be true since it came from the horse’s mouth.\nLove hate relationships are usually destined to cause pain and disillusion for all concerned and lead to all round disaffection. Having spent a major part of my life involved in “ the Arts”, mainly writing and the visual arts, I find it most interesting that so much attention and invective are directed towards the creative endeavours of some  by those who appear to be totally opposed to so much ——— apart from their own claimed preferred cultural snippets, just to avoid being labelled as philistines and to  maintain ( hoped for ) credibility from the watchful public at large.         In regard to the Turner prize, it might be pertinent to remember that both Constable and Turner were derided and scoffed at by the critics for being mere Impressionists.  Look what happened!      So let today’s critics mock on if it makes them feel better.\n\nParaphrasing MGM\u0026#8217s famous motto, the phrase \u0026#8220Arse gratia artis\u0026#8221, springs to mind. LOL 🙂\nAs an artist myself (mainly in graphite but also in pastel and acrylic) doing mostly portrait work but also the occasional wildlife, I do question whether certain art styles are indeed representative of art or just plain utter rubbish.\nI have been to many art exhibitions and  art shops where I question what is deemed as art and what is deemed as \u0026#8216 ripping off the customer \u0026#8216 with questionable so-called art skill to this of ridiculous prices for a piece of art which looks like it was done in less than a few seconds. It all fair and square in regards to art, but when art only becomes the interpretation of the artist and nobody else can see what they see, one has to look closely at the motive behind such art, and usually the motive is commercial.\nIt takes me about 20 hours to do a portrait, and I charge a minimum fee such work. I have been told by an art expert, I should be charging atleast double for my work. I do art because I enjoy it, but moreso, the joy it gives to other people who admire my art work.\nI have sold art work to collectors in France, Western Australia , USA, Spain and even Scotland and Wales but, so far, none in Shetland.!  Yell gallery has lovely work by Ruth Brownlee and those who find some art products difficult to accommodate should pay a visit.   Ripping off the customer as mentioned by David Spence  is an all   too common feature in most  walks of life —— not Just in the art world. Buyer beware should always be the watchword.    Freedom to express ideas of whatever kind should be encouraged. To condemn out of hand as has happened in these columns is  not too far removed from the  actions of the infamous dictatorial methods of the now dead Soviet Union. Beware the Nikita Kruschevs who take swipes at anything that does not conform to dogma. Roll on the Turner prize!!!\nSo talented, and yet so humble. You forgot blowing your own trumpet when lavishly covering yourself with plaudits.\nNobody has questioned freedom to express ideas apart from yourself here Hadyn referring the expressions an opinions of others as \u0026#8220pig ignorant\u0026#8221. What I question is the countless £ millions wasted on promoting such \u0026#8220arty things\u0026#8221.  We have human problems aplenty without such utter waste of funds on pretentious arty nonsense. Shetland needs food banks, yet we squander £16 million on a waste of public space such as Mareel, which at the end of the day contributes next to nothing to anyone! That is apart from the trivial entertainment to a very few, who are hardly in need of anything that was not there before this White Elephant was ordained/consecrated.\nNo doubt it was deliberate  (John Tulloch) and the  opportunity to be a comedian was irresistble but the phrase “Arse gratis artis” should, of course be “Ars gratis artis”—— Ah so !\nHad you checked out Ian\u0026#8217s link you would be in no doubt as to whether I was joking. I\u0026#8217d say the Turner Committee deserve credit for poking fun at themselves and, especially pricking the bubbles of any pompous \u0026#8220Sam the Eagles\u0026#8221 among us. That said, it\u0026#8217s a concept I wouldn\u0026#8217t wish to see spread any farther!  🙂\n\nNo insult was ever meant to you, Haydn. You are a real artist. If I ever get back to \u0026#8220The Black Mountains\u0026#8221. I  will try and visit. What I genuinely loath are the artistic parasites, sadly some on Shetland, who exploit grant money, to feather their nests! We have plenty of those talentless people around most can be found in  Mareel\u0026#8217s bar, a further few in Shetland Arts. They usually promote and do nothing else, nasty little creatures!!! (I use the scientific meaning of parasite here).\nFair  enough Ian. I take you point and concede that you probably have a better overview of the local scene than most.  I do understand that parasitic ARTISTS do exist and I met but rejected plenty of such types when I was a student all those years ago in London.  Have no fear, I adopt a pretty cynical approach to people who pass themselves off as artists ( or any other activity) when it is obvious to anybody who has the capacity to question, argue and then dismiss them as frauds. Too many around in all walks of life. Nice to have these little chats from a distance and always enjoy reading your submissions.  HG\nIs the winning artist of the Turner Prize, representing what many think of the Turner Prize and this of being a club for elitist artists where their work is highly questionable or just giving art the \u0026#8216 shock value \u0026#8216 when it comes to expressing what art is or should be?\nPersonally, I would do away with this and just put a pile of shit onto a white surface with a white background and title it \u0026#8216 And the winner of the Turner Prize is\u0026#8230. \u0026#8216. lol\n“ And the winner of the Turner Prize is\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.?”.  Go on David,since you are consumed with what is appropriate why not have a go yourself ?  You said “ personally , I would just put a pile of shit onto a white surface with a white background and title it “ And the winner of the Turner Prize is\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.David Spence.   I’ll lend you a trowel to apply the “paint” provided that you are prepared to produce it \u0026#8230\u0026#8230.. on stage at Mareel perhaps. After all, anything goes these days and you could bask in the glory for the rest of your days.  Plus free drinks at the bar with all the trendies.   LoL\nThank you for the offer Haydn, but my style of art is recognizable and is representable to those people to whome I have done portraits of.\nBased on this, and the feedback from people I have done portraits of as well as people who have seen my work, I can categorically say my artwork is recognized for what it is, this of a portrait. To my surprise, even the people I have done portraits of say \u0026#8216 there is a strong likeness to themselves \u0026#8216 and they are very pleased with the outcome.\nAlternatively, I could always paint and draw a few squiggles and indistinguishable shapes on a canvas and pawn this off as a master class in doing a portrait, but I think most people would see the flaw and question whether I was taking the mick or ripping them off. lol.\nI could always get away with this by saying \u0026#8216 It is contemporary, conceptual or modern art \u0026#8216 and it is how I see your face. lol I am pretty sure the majority of people would be wanting a refund. lol\nWell, David I think you’ve made your point and I have every regard for it.    I’m not actually a sqiggles man myself and if you look at my products you would find this to be true.   My concerns are mainly moved by what I perceive to be ideas, thoughts and principles which may or may not generate  sympathetic responses.  It’s a matter of giving freedom of movement rather than swallowing everything hook, line and sinker. Remember, many artists who were once derided eventually grew in stature and became accepted in spite of inordinate criticism. Picasso was a prime example as was Henry Moore.  All artists were modern in their own time. Dare I say that you are and I are too but to dismiss us as makers of Modern Art in the way that critics use the term would be unfair and short sighted. I hope that I’ve made it clear.\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"rubber duck wins first bergen lerwick leg of shetland race ","story":"Espen Børresen (left) and Morten Offendal celebrate their victory.

There is no doubt the English are cute enough to take full advantage of the introduction of VAR system with three penalty kicks so far despatched by captain Harry Kane.\nPenalising defenders for holding at corners and other set pieces is, I have to say, a major step forward. This has been going on for far too long in most levels of football, and thankfully the days of pundits uttering the words “part and parcel of the game” will now be over.\nGrabbing someone in a bear hug is not football – never has been and never will be. I recall a European match some years ago when Glasgow Celtic should have had about six penalties but the referee gave none.\nWhat this needs now is for officials to be in accordance with one another. But sadly, and I can envisage a few whistlers spluttering over their cornflakes at this, the words “consistent” and “referees” are an oxymoron as far as I\u0026#8217m concerned.\nOn the subject of the English progression in the tournament, it has once again thrown up the perennial question of whether Scottish people should support their oldest rivals.\nThere are no doubt many north of the border who would find the prospect of England winning the World Cup a terrifying one. They could even be in the majority. A recent poll suggested that only 15 per cent of Scots would support the English while 28 per cent would back anyone playing against them.\nThe same survey found that only two per cent of Scottish National Party voters would get behind England, although I actually find that figure quite high.\nIt does appear to be the case that Scottish football followers have nothing against English players, many of whom they actually admire, but it is those in the press and the media who they reserve their anger for.\nI sincerely hope that England do go all the way. I have always supported them when Scotland are not involved, and in recent years that has become the norm.\nA few issues do bother me, such as the constant gormless look on Kane’s face and the insistence of manager Gareth Southgate on dressing as if he was taking part in the World Snooker Championships.

I particularly enjoy the ITV panel and even Ian Wright is growing on me!\n: : : : : : : :\nIt is just over a month since the tragic death of former Aberdeen footballer Neale Cooper and I would like to add my own tribute to the many which have been paid to such a popular man.\nThe late Neale Cooper made a memorable trip to Shetland.\nAt just 19 he was the youngest member of the 1983 European Cup Winners Cup side which defeated Real Madrid in the final at Gothenburg in Sweden.\nAlong with that memorable triumph he was in the team which won two Scottish league titles, four Scottish Cups, a league cup and the European Super Cup, all achieved before he was 24.\nHe later played for Aston Villa, Rangers, Reading, Dunfermline and Ross County, where he later became manager.\nIt was in the summer of 1999, when Ross County were invited to Shetland as guests for Scalloway’s centenary celebrations, that I had the privilege of meeting Cooper.\nThere was a gala dinner in the village hall after the friendly match where County defeated Scalloway 8-2, and he agreed to give me time for a short interview. But not until after his speech, he said, which he was dreading as he hated speaking at formal events.\nSadly the evening dragged on somewhat, with various Scalloway luminaries spending rather more time on stage than was really necessary, and it was approaching 1am when Cooper eventually got his turn.\nI decided to give up on the interview that night, and maybe catch him the following day after a game against a Shetland XI in Lerwick.\nAs I was wandering along the embankment at Gilbertson Park prior to the match I heard someone calling my name, and was surprised to see Cooper running towards me.\nHe was full of apologies about the previous evening, although he had no justification, and he said he would speak to me immediately after the game.\nThe match ended 2-2 and Cooper was generous in his praise for the opposition. Shetland were “as good as any top Highland League side”, he said.\nThe two-day visit had been excellent both from a football point of view and a social one, he added. “It’s been fantastic. We had a great welcome from Scalloway and it was an honour to be invited to their centenary celebrations. I’ve never been to Shetland before and I only found out last week that my mother had been here 40 years ago.”\nFollowing Cooper’s untimely death, and the loss of the first of the Gothenburg greats, there have been many kind words. Colleagues, writers and others have pointed out what a humble, friendly and likeable character he was.\nThey are absolutely correct. I’ve meet a few well-known footballers over the years but I have no difficulty in stating that Neil Cooper was the nicest one of them all.\n: : : : : : : :\nCyclist Chris Froome is now free to go for a record-equalling fifth Tour de France win after his anti-doping case was sensibly dropped.\nThe Team Sky rider had been under investigation by the sport’s world governing body Union Cycliste Internationale but proceedings were closed on Monday.\nFroome, who is bidding to move level with Eddy Merckx, Bernard Hinault, Jacques Anquetil and Miguel Indurain as the only five-time winners of the tour, has been under intense pressure since an amount of the asthma treatment salbutamol was found in his system.\nGet off this guy’s back and give him a break, I say. Just because he’s the best cyclist in the world does not mean he’s benefiting from a performance-enhancing drug.\n: : : : : : : :\nWith all the buzz of the World Cup an annual competition in southwest London has almost been forgotten about.\nYes, Wimbledon is in full flow once again and the British competitors are as usual struggling to make it into the second week.\nAndy Murray was probably sensible to withdraw, citing that he was not quite ready for five-set matches after his hip operation. There were signs at Queens and Eastbourne, however, that he may be able to scale the heights once more.\nThere is of course a capable replacement in Kyle Edmund, who is seeded having reached the Australian Open semi-finals earlier this year.\nEdmund’s half of the draw looks fairly open, and he could well still be involved come Monday. But of course anything can happen, and by the time you read this he could be gone. Let’s hope not.\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 22 ","story":"After being tasked with compiling a feature to coincide with the 100th anniversary of the senior football inter-county, it was a pleasure to speak to several of those with first-hand knowledge of the history of the Milne Cup competition.\nGeordie Hunter goes the furthest back, having made his debut in the 1953 game. On that occasion a top-notch Shetland team came away from Kirkwall with a 3-1 win courtesy of goals by Sammy Johnson, John “Pisco” Leask and Jim Black.\nHunter also played in the legendary 9-7 victory in Orkney 10 years later when, according to Orkney veteran Eric Hutchison, every shot that Bert Sinclair hit seemed to end up in the back of the net.\nSinclair himself has an amazing memory, and has kept records of some of his incredible achievements. His eight goals in one junior inter-county match and 11 in the next three successive senior counties have already been documented, but his scoring spree in the late 1950s and early 60s is something else.\nFrom 1957 to 1964 he played in just over 200 matches, at junior and senior level including representative games, and I can only find two occasions on which he failed to find the net. If anyone anywhere in the country has a record to beat that I’d be delighted to hear from them.\nSinclair also speaks of his greatest disappointment, being dropped from the county side in 1964, apparently for missing training when he had pretty valid reasons for not turning up.\nAnother who experienced the highs and lows was Derrick Bradley, who as manager led Shetland to an unprecedented 12 wins in 13 matches, the only blip being a 0-0 draw in Orkney.\nThen he was unceremoniously ousted, apparently because a few of the players had had enough of him. Bradley retains some bitterness, but it doesn’t stop him wishing the current side all the best for next weekend.\nLen Laurenson and John Johnston recount what it was like to play for both Shetland and Orkney, while James Johnston, Shetland’s equal most-capped player, reflects on 17 caps and how he went out on a high.\nBut the final word should go to two Orkney men, Hutchison and Morgan Harcus, both of whom are still avid fans of the annual event. As well as the fierce rivalry and hotly contested games, they mention the friendships they formed with their opponents.\nThat is probably what makes this contest so special. As Harcus says, they like to hate Shetland for an hour and a half, but the rest of the time it is completely different.\n: : : : : : : :\nDid the best team really win the World Cup? That question has been asked the length and breadth of the country after France’s 4-2 victory over Croatia on Sunday.\nPersonally I thought the Croats were very unlucky. The free kick from which the French opened the scoring should never have been given, while the penalty decision to make it 2-1 was debatable. There may just have been enough hand-to-ball movement for the spot kick to have been awarded, but it took several viewings by the referee through VAR before he was convinced.\n predictor competition, partly as a result of the scoring exploits of Antoine Griezmann, I was disappointed that it wasn’t a Belgium versus Croatia final. A new name on the Jules Rimet Trophy would only have been good for the game overall.\nFrance were ultimately the strongest team in the competition – they improved and became more resilient as the event wore on – but they were definitely not the most attractive. There was something almost German-like about the winners with their dogged organisation and ability to counter-attack with deadly efficiency.\nAs for England, I would say far too much has been made of a “new dawn” under manager Gareth Southgate. The English did get further than most people expected, but they came up well short on two occasions against the Belgians and only stuttered past Tunisia and Colombia. Two of the victories, it should be remembered, were against a shambolic Panama and a Sweden team which appeared to have no interest in winning other than by penalties.\nAfter England’s exit Graeme Le Saux – now there’s a twit if ever there was one – was going on about Southgate’s “emotional intelligence” whatever that is.\nA group of players came together and played as a team, it has been suggested by both Southgate and the media. But is that the first time in the history of football that this has happened to an English team? I don’t think so.\nIt happened at the World Cups of 1966, 1970, 1990 and 1998, and also at the European Championship in 1996. I’m sure the players who took part, for instance Bobby Charlton, Terry Butcher or Paul Gascoigne, would stress the team ethic involved.\nSpeaking of Charlton, the referee for Sunday’s final, Argentinian Nestor Pitana, had the kind of comb-over which the great man himself would have been proud of.\nThere were many who doubted the wisdom of granting the staging of this year’s event to Russia. But all in all it was a very satisfactory tournament. The organisation was good, the stadiums were tremendous, there was plenty of excitement and some great individual performances, and the introduction of VAR provided several talking points.\nMy team of the tournament, with a token Englishman in the mix, is: Thibaut Courtois (Belgium) Benjamin Pavard (France), Raphaël Varane (France), Diego Godín (Uruguay), Ivan Strinic (Croatia) Ivan Perisic (Croatia), Luka Modric (Croatia), Jordan Henderson (England), Eden Hazard (Belgium) Cristiano Ronaldo (Portugal), Edinson Cavani (Uruguay).\nIf anyone questions the omission of Kylian Mbappe, I would say the young French player has been somewhat over-hyped. He certainly has pace in abundance, and a touch of skill, but is also petulant in a way that would suggest he is more of a successor to the diving Neymar than the much more honest Lionel Messi.\n: : : : : : : :\nSeveral metro stations in Paris have apparently been temporarily renamed in honour of France becoming world champions.\nAmong them are Notre-Dame des Champs, which became “Notre Didier Deschamps” and Victor Hugo which was adapted to “Victor Hugo Lloris”.\nEngland quickly cottoned on to the idea as well, with the Southgate tube stop in London being enlarged to “Gareth Southgate”.\nMaybe if Shetland wins the Milne Cup 100th centenary match next weekend the top thoroughfare in Scalloway could be changed to “Kevin Main Street”?\nOr did the county manager not name enough village players in his squad for that to happen?\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"we are underdogs in milne cup clash says shetland manager main ","story":"Shetland football team\u0026#8217s coaches Kevin Main (on left) and Robert Geddes at a training session at the Gilbertson Park last Wednesday.

I think if there’s any doubt in any competitor’s mind, that will show up a weakness.\n“So it’s important our guys feel confident and from the experience of Shetland inter-county matches before – of which me and [assistant manager] Robert [Geddes] have had a couple – we know that this team is capable of meeting the standard required to win.”\nHowever, Main is under no illusion about the scale of the challenge facing his side.\nHe said: “Orkney at this moment in time in my mind are clear favourites [due to] their home record over the last year, albeit in a different format – the North Caledonian competition.\n“In addition, two years ago we went with great confidence and unfortunately came away with a defeat so we know they are extremely strong and difficult on their home park.”\n *Eighteen players will be travelling but only 16 can be selected for the match.\nMeanwhile, hopes are high that the Shetland women’s hockey team can improve on their recent record against Orkney.\nThis year’s game will see Orkney attempt to record a 14th straight victory.\nShetland’s last success came via a penalty shoot-out after a 2-2 draw in 2003, but joint coaches Derek and Brenda Leask believe the team is close to finally turning the corner.\nDerek Leask said: “The team is well prepared and have been focusing on strength and speed work with weekly Sunday morning training sessions at the Factory Gym at Whiteness.\n“Dhanni Moar and his coach Bryan Pearson, devised a 12-week training programme to have the lasses in peak condition. The squad demonstrated great commitment in tuning up in large numbers to every session. The hockey team really appreciated Dhanni and Bryan giving up their time to help them perform to their best in this fixture.\n“It’s been a long time since Shetland won the cup in Orkney [1982] but despite the reds’ recent success the team is confident of pushing them all the way this year.\n“We’re really looking forward to putting on a competitive display and showing that there is a high standard of hockey in Shetland too.”\nHockey squad: Megan Nicholson (Spurs), Francesca MacColl (Delting) Janetta Williamson (Delting), Rhiannon Inkster (Spurs), Megan Hibbert (Delting) Vicky Wiseman (Burra), Nicola Balfour (Delting), Kristen Jeromson (Burra), Emma Michael (Spurs), Aimee Keith (Zetland), Kayleigh Irvine (Zetland), Maggie Kay (Whalsay), Rhea Nicolson (Burra), Victoria Duthie (Whalsay), Cara Leask (Delting), Kristan Robertson (Burra), Stacey Laurenson (Burra) and Sarah Williamson (Burra).\n• Follow The Shetland Times\u0026#8217 website and Facebook page this weekend for scores and updates\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"37 bruce crescent lerwick ze1 0pb ","story":"Offers over £167,000\n\n Externally: Off-road parking, a large front, side and back garden and an outside bin store.\nThe property is in move into condition.

The 5-1 scoreline flattered the home side. Shetland could easily have had another two or three goals and it has to be remembered that Orkney only got their last two with the game either entering or having gone into stoppage time.\nMolloy’s introduction 10 minutes into the second half obviously made a difference, as he went on to score the type of goal I doubt if anyone else in the squad is capable of – muscling his way into the box, holding off a couple of defenders, creating space for himself and firing home.\nBut the damage had been done in the first half – at 3-0 down Shetland were always facing an uphill struggle and it was no surprise that Orkney put the icing on the cake with a couple of breakaway goals.\nSome have suggested it was a game too far for captain Leighton Flaws, who reversed his decision to retire after last year’s win in Lerwick. I wouldn’t necessarily go along with that. Flaws, who maintains it was not the carrot of the centenary match that prompted his U-turn, looked as good as anyone in the Shetland side in the second half.\nI felt really sorry for manager Kevin Main, who spoke openly beforehand about both his hopes for the big day and his selection tactics. As someone who was described this week as “the Gareth Southgate of Shetland football”, he deserves the chance to turn this setback around.\nTwo years ago the then management team of Allan Graham and John Scott Christie, whom Main had assisted, were basically forced out of their positions after a 3-2 defeat in Kirkwall.\nThere is no way that should be allowed to happen again. Hopefully Main and his assistant Robert Geddes will now take stock and work hard towards next year, when the match at Gilbertson Park in Lerwick will celebrate Shetland Football Association’s 100th birthday.\nIt’s just a pity we have to wait a whole 12 months until a chance of revenge.\n: : : : : : : :\nA couple of hours earlier another team in blue slumped to defeat, but with Orkney’s recent record on the hockey pitch that was less unexpected.\nThere are continuing signs of improvement among the hockey players, however, in spite of an ever-increasing list of failures at inter-county level.\nA score of 4-1 was probably about right, as Orkney were much more clinical and displayed a quality of crisp passing and control which was a shade above their opponents.\nThe Shetland players work incredibly hard and show much commitment, however, especially with the added handicap of having to travel to Brae for any kind of action.\nA few caught the eye on Saturday, among them goalkeeper Megan Nicholson who pulled off at least one fine save, Cara Leask who notched the opening goal and Kristan Robertson who got the nod as Shetland’s player of the match.\nI would also mention Victoria Duthie who was in the thick of the action throughout, making several excellent runs and showing much determination both in possession and when chasing an opponent. The fact that Duthie was still limping quite heavily a few hours later was testament to how much she gave for the cause.\n: : : : : : : :\nOrkney football historian Jockie Wood addresses the Milne Cup 100th anniversary reception at the PIckaquoy Centre in Orkney last Saturday. Former Aberdeen striker Joe Harper, the evening\u0026#8217s guest of honour, is in the centre of the picture. Photo: John Coutts\nThe reception at the Pickaquoy Centre later on Saturday evening, attended by over 400 guests, was a great opportunity for former county football adversaries to meet up again.\nUnfortunately the meal was nothing to write home about – the main course of roast beef and trimmings was cold – and the acoustics of the building were downright awful.\nThe speeches which followed, if anyone could hear what was being said, were on the lengthy side. And I have no idea at all what guest speaker Joe Harper, the former Aberdeen and Scotland striker, was on about. All you could hear was the occasional “effing” this and “effing” that.\nIt was fitting, however, when Jockie Wood called on a couple of former Shetland players to take a bow. Both Geordie Hunter, or the “big game Hunter” as Wood referred to him, and the inimitable striker Bert Sinclair certainly did their bit in years gone by.\nSinclair in particular was in his element, reminiscing with Orkney opponents Alan Findlay and Eric Hutchison who also featured in the famous 1963 game when he hit the back of the net five times in the 9-7 victory.\n: : : : : : : :\nAnd finally, as this week’s column is all about the inter-county weekend, it is surely fitting to end on a high note.\nOn Sunday morning, although the match really should have taken place as a warm-up to the main Milne Cup encounter, over two dozen veterans took to the field again.\nHelped by the fact that one or two of the team are still turning out occasionally at B-team level, the blues were much fitter and faster than their opponents.\nRobert Adamson, who fills out his shirt rather better than he did 20-odd years ago, was on the scoresheet along with his former Thistle team mate Stuart Smith who netted a hat trick.\nThe others came from Delting’s Stuart Hay and the aforementioned Main, who surely merited it after Saturday’s setback, and a penalty from the oldest man in the side Bruce Williamson of Spurs.\nThe final score was a 7-1 win for Shetland, which as some wise guy put it made for an aggregate 8-6 football victory.

By the end of this year that number is expected to fall to fewer than 8000.\nSome projections have suggested it could drop to as low as 600 branches in five years\u0027 time.\nBetween 2015 and 2018, 48 bank closures have taken place or are under way in the HIE area including 22 in the Highlands. Some of these are the last banks in their communities.\nConsultants Indigo House Group said banking facilities need to be understood as core to community infrastructure.\nIt said access to cash remained fundamental to the viability of the small retail businesses that are prominent in rural areas. This is especially true in relation to tourism businesses where the loss of access to cash via local banks could have a detrimental effect on long term prospects.\nAlthough there are potential alternatives, including online or Post Office banking and mobile bank vans, the report warned that these options raised concerns over such issues as cybersecurity, the fragile nature of Post Office contracts and accessibility of mobile banks for less able people. Customers facing a shift from a local branch to a mobile bank also consider this a backward step.\nIn its recommendations, the report calls for a collaborative approach involving Scottish Government, HIE, local councils, community members and delivery partners, including the banks and Post Office.\nIt also wants recognition of the importance of cash to local economies and support over time for a sustainable transition to digitally based economies. This includes the creation of digital inclusion strategies to help businesses benefit fully from online banking.\nThe report also recommended a Post Office banking strategy that would include securing the long-term sustainability of contract Post Offices to support rural economies and infrastructure.\n\nWednesday 8 Aug 2018 8:39 PM\n\u0026nbsp\n\u0026nbsp\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"https://www.strathspey-herald.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04116000/04116804.jpg","title":"Beauty spot gets the all clear from SEPA","story":"Gavin Musgrove\n\u0026nbsp\nBadenoch and Strathspey\u0027s most popular bathing spot has been given the all-clear from blue-green algae which can make humans very ill and potentially be fatal to dogs.\nThe Scottish Environment Protection Team attended at Loch Morlich at Glenmore on Tuesday following reports of an outbreak at the beauty spot which is enjoyed by hundreds of thousands of people every year.\nSigns had been erected at key locations around the loch warning visitors of the potential presence of the algae.\nIt is understood that a concerned local vet raised the possibility of the algae being present after a dog took ill showing symptoms of having been in contact with blue algae following a visit to the beauty spot.\nA SEPA spokeswoman said: \"A member of our team went to Loch Morlich on Tuesday to take a sample of the algae and none could be found.

Having beaten Juniors twice already this season \u0026#8211 2-5 and 0-6 \u0026#8211 Jamie MacGregor will have faith that his team can make it a hat-trick of success and book their place in the final.\nIn their last semi-final outing, Mallaig defeated Sleat and Strath 10-8 in an incredible game to secure their place in the GF MacRae Cup Final. The blues, however, will be keen to avoid a repeat of their performance in the final which saw Kyleakin run out 4-1 winners in a disappointing and underwhelming showing by Mallaig.\n\n \u0026#8220Another tough game for us, but it’s the type of games we wanted to be involved in at the start of the season. We now have a great opportunity to make a second cup final this season.\n\u0026#8220The season, in general, has been a learning experience but a very enjoyable one. The lads have picked up a lot quite quickly and we have had some good wins this season especially on our travels. It’s good to be back playing at home especially in such a big game, especially after being away for so long\n\u0026nbsp\nWith four wins from their last five matches in all competitions, and 37 goals scored in the process, Juniors have really hit their stride and will approach their third meeting with Mallaig with great confidence.\nNow just four points point off leaders Sleat and Strath with one game in hand, Phil McCaherty will hope his team can transmit their impressive league form into today\u0026#8217s cup match against the only side who have beaten them domestically this season.\nWhile Juniors\u0026#8217 recent free-scoring display will have given Mallaig some food for thought in their preparations for the match, the Portree side must avoid the lapses in concentration which cost them in their heavy defeats at home against Mallaig in the league and Loch Ness in the Highland Amateur Cup.\n\nIt\u0026#8217s a tough task for us away to Mallaig who have beaten us twice already 5-2 and 6-0. We are going with the same squad (minus Angie MacPherson and Paul MacKinnon) that played GA United in last round, with Nick Flanagan added for goalkeeping duties to free up backup goalie Will Brown to his normal defensive duties. I am hoping that David Potter doesn\u0026#8217t get lost this week!\u0026#8221\n\nIt\u0026#8217s been a fantastic season so far for the Broadford-based side who are the current league leaders, joint top scorers, and have the meanest defence to boot.\nWith an average of 5.2 goals a game in the league, Sleat and Strath have developed a ruthlessness in front of goal and appeared to have a strong belief when they take to the pitch that they can beat any team whether it be at home or away. Their most recent win in which they turned a 3-0 lead at half-time into an emphatic 12-0 victory in last week\u0026#8217s quarter-final tie against much-improved Glenelg is evidence they have the weapons to transform a tight match into a comfortable victory.\nHaving put in impressive defensive displays against both Kyleakin and Portree Juniors in the league, DL MacKinnon\u0026#8217s team have proven they can stand firm when required against tough opponents. That said, he will still be mindful of his side\u0026#8217s loss in their last semi-final encounter against Mallaig \u0026#8211 in what has been their only defeat so far this season \u0026#8211  and will be keen to avoid missing out on a second final.\n\n \u0026#8220It\u0026#8217s going to be a battle at our tight pitch. Key to the result will be our ability to defend set plays, which is not our strong point as we are a very small team. If we can keep Gordy (Mccarroll) and Innis (Thompson) quiet we will hopefully cause them problems with our pace.\u0026#8221\n\u0026nbsp\nWith Sleat and Strath having burst out of the blocks in the league and new boys Mallaig also making their mark, it is perhaps easy to overlook the fact that Kyleakin is not only very much in contention for the league title but have already won a piece of silverware this season with a convincing victory over Mallaig in the GF MacRae Cup.\nWith 22 goals in their last three matches, which included their 10-2 quarter-final win over Kyle, the reigning league champions know how to win games, and ultimately trophies. As well as being well-deserved, their 4-1 victory in the GF MacRae Cup Final against Mallaig was a superb example of game-management against difficult opponents on a big occasion.\nAlthough Kyleakin have put themselves in a good position to challenge on all fronts, they will have to address their inconsistency this season which has seen them held to draws recently by Glenelg and GA United.\nWith back-to-back matches coming up against Sleat and Strath in the cup, then the league, the reigning champions will look to draw on their past successes in the big games.\nBy Adam Gordon\n"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/web-ad-sales-large.jpg","title":"recruitment highlighted as a priority at first emergency services","story":"\nAn Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine\n\nRepresentatives of all the emergency services on Skye held their first ever partnership meeting in Broadford last week to discuss how they can support each other.\nPictured (left to right) are Dave Philips from the Maritime and Coastguard Agency, Nick Mort from the British Red Cross, Station Manager Mike Colliar from the Scottish Fire and Rescue Service, Sgt Andrew Shaw from Police Scotland, Neil Urquhart from Skye Mountain Rescue, Inspector Lynda Allan from Police Scotland, Area Service Manager Alan Knox of Scottish Ambulance Service.

It is central to community life and is active across the local community, working collaboratively with other sporting codes and community and civic organisations.\nThere are eight Gaelic Athletic Clubs active within the local council boundaries, with a combined membership reaching into thousands.\nPromotion and use of the Irish Language has been historically strong in the area. The language has become even stronger in the last 30-40 years particularly.\nToday in terms of Irish medium education (IME), four Naíscoileana (preschools) flourish, and there are two gaelscoileanna (primary schools), and another English medium school with IME provision.\nThe demand for IME in South Antrim is growing.\n\nSo, many citizens in South Antrim possess an innate sense of their own Irishness. It really matters to them.\nLike everywhere else in Ireland the rich local heritage and history of townlands, place names, geography, and topography of South Antrim cannot be understood without reference to the Irish language.\nTo take two local examples: Cranfield has its origins in Creamh choill, the woodland of the wild garlic: Farranflugh is the anglicised version of Fearainn Fliuch, otherwise, the boggy or wet ground.\nBilingual signage captures that rich heritage by making it visible and providing an educational reference point for the local community and visitors.\nThe council’s ‘English only’ policy effectively air brushes out access to a heritage we all share regardless of political allegiance.\nThe English language is only a small part of who we are and where we have come from as a community.\nSome in the leadership of both the DUP and UUP have sought to weaponise the Irish language and to demonise those who support its use and visibility.\nThey have prosecuted their own version of a ‘project fear’ which deliberately misrepresents the campaign for Irish language rights as cultural warfare.\nThat type of exclusive and bigoted mind-set goes right to the crux of why the political institutions do not currently exist in Stormont.\nThe DUP wrecked power sharing and partnership in recent years as the culmination of their 20-year campaign opposing the GFA since 1998.\nThose presently in charge of the DUP don’t want to exercise proper power sharing with Sinn Féin and are opposed to a rights-based society. \nThat’s the message which comes from the leadership of the DUP, and as a result, why unionist councillors in Antrim and Newtownabbey have now adopted an ‘English only’ policy in an act of abject disrespect to their Irish neighbours.\nPolitical unionism in South Antrim has form in the history of exclusion.\nNever once in the history of local government in Antrim and Newtownabbey have unionists shared the position of Mayor or deputy mayor with a Sinn Féin councillor.\nIn the 2017 Westminster general election 18.1% of the electorate voted for Sinn Féin in South Antrim.\nThat section of the electorate is synonymous, albeit not exclusively, with those citizens who consider themselves to be Irish.\nAn additional 12.9% voted for other non-unionist political parties.\nImportantly some citizens who vote for the unionist parties consider themselves to be both Irish and British. Unionism is not a culturally homogeneous bloc.\nSo when the unionist councillors in Antrim and Newtownabbey vote to adopt an ‘English only’ policy that tells a substantial cross section of local rate payers that they are unequal and do not deserve to be treated with parity of esteem and respect.\nThe only conclusion is that those in charge of the local unionist parties are not committed to a shared future and inclusion, and instead want to make South Antrim a cold house for the Irish identity.\nAnd, that mind-set is a throwback to the days of the old apartheid, orange state in the north of Ireland.\nThe ‘English only’ policy in Antrim and Newtownabbey borough council is now the subject of a judicial review.\nLocal Irish language activists and rate payers have begun a campaign to overturn this disgraceful policy.\nI have been encouraging local people to register their objections with the Chief Executive.\n\nIf there is ever to be a shared and united future in the north that must also apply within Antrim and Newtownabbey council politically, culturally and in respect of every aspect of community and civic life.\nLocal councillors and council officers have an obligation to ensure the operation of this council is conducted in a legally compliant, fair, equal, inclusive, transparent and democratic matter.\nThey should be actively promoting and ensuring adherence to the principles of parity of esteem, mutual respect, equality, and anti-sectarianism enshrined in the GFA.\nThat is what the republican and nationalist electorate and other progressives and fair-minded people in South Antrim expect from those charged with administering local government.\nCitizens in Antrim and Newtownabbey pay high rates with the expectation of good quality council services.\nThey do not pay high rates to be treated with such abject disrespect.\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27429  ","story":" Oisín Mac Canna\n\nSpeakers at today\u0026#039s march urged attendees to make their way to Belfast over the next week to celebrate Belfast Pride, who will host Ireland\u0026#039s biggest LGBT festival, with the annual parade held on Pride Day which is celebrated on August 4th.\nSinn Féin were among the thousand strong crowd of people who marched at the first ever Transgender Pride parade that took place in Dublin this afternoon.\n The march started outside Liberty Hall and made its way to Fairview Park, where Declan Flynn was murdered by a gang of five so-called “queer-bashing” teenagers in the early hours of September 10th, 1982.\nThe suspended sentences for his attackers triggered a long march towards equality in Irish society.

Universal Credit is definitely a part of that, I am in no doubt about that. We have been dealing with people who have said that they are in need of help because of Universal Credit. \nThe figures cover the six month period May to October 2017 and the period January to May 2018 with an average of 30 vouchers a month dealt with in the first period, jumping to 38 in the second.\nPeter acknowledges that these figures are from quite a small area over a limited time \u0027but something must have triggered it.\u0027 He said:There is an unmistakable trend, more people are needing help after Universal Credit.

We can\u0027t forget their big sister Kaia who has kept us all smiling.\nThe family\u0027s agony began on June 8 last year when Caden, a pupil at St Brigid\u0027s Primary School, was diagnosed with aplastic anemia, a rare blood disease where bone marrow fails to produce sufficient blood cells.\nSabrina, who has taken time off from her job at Limavady Grammar School to care for Caden, recalled: Bruises started appearing all over his body and Caden was tired, so we knew something wasn\u0027t right.\n    \n        \n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n    \n          \n\n full newspaper \u0026#187\n\n    \n\nSend this page to a friend \u0026#187\n\n  \n// \n\n\n      \nSend to a friend\n  \nPlease complete the following form to inform a friend about this page.\n  \n    \n    \n      \n        \nYour Name\n*\n\n        \n      \n      \n        \nYour E-Mail\n*\n\n        \n      \n              \n        \nFriend\u0027s Name\n*\n\n        \n      \n              \n        \nFriend\u0027s E-Mail\n*\n\n        \n      \n                      \n        \nComment\n        \n\n      \n                    \n                  \n      \nIn order to process your information we must ask you to enter the letters in the image into the box:\n      \n        \n          \n            \n            \n\nplay audio version\n\n            \n\nReload Image\n\n          \n          \nVerify Code:\n          \n        \n      \n    \n                   \n          \n\n*\n Mandatory field - please complete\n          \n              \n      \n    \n  \n\n    \n  \n     \n        \n      \n        \nNews Search\n        \n          \n          \n        \n        \nsearch news, sport and features across all publications\n      \n    \n                      \n      // \n      \n                                                                                                                                        \n                      \n      \n        \n\nNorthern Constitution\n\n        \n          \n\nColeraine\n\n          \n\nLimavady\n\n          \n\nMagherafelt\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n      \n        \n\n\n\n        \n          \n\nAntrim\n\n          \n\nBallymena\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n      \n        \n\nThe Chronicle\n\n        \n          \n\nBallycastle\n\n          \n\nBallymoney\n\n          \n\nColeraine\n\n          \n\nLimavady\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n                  \n      // \n      \n      \n        \n          \nSubscriber Login\n          \n            \n              \nUsername:\n              \n            \n            \n              \nPassword:\n              \n            \n          \n          \n            \n          \n        \n      \n            \n              \n\n\n                          \n\n\n            \n\n\n                      \n\n\n          \n  \n    \n    \n\u0026copy Copyright 2018 Alpha Newspaper Group\n    \n\n        // \n        \n\n    \n      \n        \n\nTerms \u0026amp Conditions\n\n        \n\nPrivacy Policy\n\n              \n    \n  \n      \n    var gaJsHost = ((\"https:\" == document.location.protocol) ?

They know the Cadet movement is as much committed to building confidence and friendships as it is to building skills.\n\n“Our Banbridge Cadets embraced every opportunity brought to them at this year’s Summer Camp, held at Strensall, near York, with great good humour and seemingly boundless energy. \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n“Now, following a Summer packed with challenge and achievement, they’ll be turning their attention to their annual new membership campaign and I am sure they will all become highly persuasive recruiters as they invite local teenagers to come along and see what Cadet life has to offer.”\n\nIf you would like to find out more about what membership of the Army, Sea or Air Cadets can offer you or your children, contact 0800 730 730 or visit www.reservesandcadetsni.org.uk.

To cater for the individual needs of the every member of the community, the team can also provide guidance on the bank’s Post Office service, its telephone banking system and its Bank on Wheels.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nThroughout the year Richard will be organising a series of events open to the public as well as delivering presentations for schools and community organisations about the importance of staying safe and secure when banking, good practice for identifying fraud and scams, using the Ulster Bank Anytime Banking app and transitioning from traditional to digital banking services.\n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\nCommunity Banker Richard Gill explained: “I’m really looking forward to engaging with people right across Co. Down and being an active part of this community.\n\n“Being financially fit, aware of how to keep your money safe and secure, and feeling confident in using digital technologies are important skills, and the events I’m planning to run will reflect that.”\n\nRichard will host regular drop-in clinics in Rathfriland and Dromore and on call to help customers Monday to Friday, between 9am and 5pm.

There will also be shops and food and drink options on the site, which has been renamed \u0027The Sixth\u0027 in a reference to Belfast\u0027s  evening edition, \"the sixth late Tele\".\n\nWork is due to begin by the end of the year if the plans get the go-ahead.\n\nStephen Surphlis of Bel Tel LLP said: \"Offices and workspace are evolving and UK and international companies are looking to Belfast and the wealth of talent we have on tap from our universities and within our professional, creative and technology sectors.\n\n\"These firms are placing a premium on employee satisfaction and are seeking working environments that facilitate team interaction, innovation and creativity. \n\n\"Our plans for The Sixth emphasise quality, heritage-led design that makes a contribution to both user wellbeing, and the fabric of our city.\"\n\nArchitecture firm Allford Hall Monaghan Morris (AHMM), winner of the 2015 RIBA Stirling Prize for its work on Burntwood School in London, has been enlisted to work on the scheme.\n\nPaul Monaghan, founding director of AHMM, said: \"The Sixth is a bold project, focused on the experience of its users and mindful of the site\u0027s landmark status and importance as part of Belfast\u0027s built heritage. We have taken cues from the surrounding buildings and the city\u0027s lost Victorian arcades, and will restore features removed or lost from the original listed building.\n\n\"For example, we\u0027re planning to reinstate the building\u0027s main access onto Royal Avenue and reintroduce dormer windows removed from the original roofline.\n\n\"New features such as the roof-top running track, roof-top terraces and break-out spaces complement the building\u0027s focus on the user.\n\n\"A new public atrium space serves as walkway through the building, which alongside a range of ground floor retail and food and beverage offers will enliven the street level space around Royal Avenue and Donegall Street.\n\n\"The Sixth will contribute to the rapid regeneration of the area and with its close proximity to Ulster University, it will be at the centre of an emerging creative district serving the education, culture, media and technology sectors.\"\n\nCouncillor Aileen Graham, deputy chair of Belfast City Council\u0027s City growth and regeneration committee, said: \"The partnership is pleased to have submitted its full planning application for The Sixth. \n\n\"We\u0027ve made a commitment in the Belfast Agenda to growing our city\u0027s economy and positioning the city to compete internationally. Quality, innovative workspaces like The Sixth will attract the high-value jobs necessary to grow our economy and help our people reach their full potential. \n\n\"Not only will The Sixth boost the city centre\u0027s vibrancy as part of an emerging creative district, it\u0027s going to breathe new life into one of Belfast\u0027s most loved and iconic buildings.\"\n"},{"url":null,"title":"belfast pride parade 2018 thousands take to streets to celebrate","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

However, in a second clip, taken outside the airport, Novo is seen approaching the man and asking him why he “disrespected” him, saying he had done nothing to deserve the abuse and that he “was not scared of him”.\n\nLast night the Celtic fan said he wanted to apologise unreservedly to Novo for his “indefensible behaviour”. He said: “I had been over to watch football and had returned on the same day and I was the worse for drink. That is not an excuse but it is true. I’ve let myself down.\n\n“Since the incident went viral, I’ve had an insight into the effects of abusive behaviour. Threats have been made online and I can appreciate how upsetting the original incident was.”      \n\nNovo, posting on social media later that evening, said: “Arrived at Belfast International Airport tonight to support the local community for all sides of the divide.\n\n“As soon as I walked out of the airport I was surrounded by Celtic supporters that hurled abuse and tried to attack myself. I would like thank genuine Celtic supporter.”\n\nNovo was left fighting for his life in January after suffering a heart attack while starring in a Rangers legends tournament in Germany. The star received thousands of goodwill messages.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"ian paisley recall petition about restoring trust in politicians","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

government following the Westminster expenses scandal, although the DUP has a massive majority in North Antrim.\n\nShould 10% of the electorate, or 7,543 people, sign the petition, then a by-election will be held and Mr Paisley is currently suspended from the DUP pending a party investigation.\n\n\nSinn Fein Stormont Assembly member Philip McGuigan said the Ian Paisley recall petition was an issue of public integrity. \npic.twitter/1JEuarGyIC\n\n— michael mchugh (@mmchugh02) \nAugust 8, 2018\n\n\n\n\nIf he loses the backing of Northern Ireland’s largest unionist party, his prospects for re-election would be damaged.\n\nSinn Fein’s Stormont Assembly member Philip McGuigan said: “This is an issue of integrity in Government, it is not an orange and green issue.\n\n“This is not even about nationalism versus unionism.\n\n“This is an issue about trust in your politicians that they will do their jobs with integrity.”\n\n\nIt’s 9.01am and there’s a queue out to the door at Ballymena 7 Towers to sign the petition to unseat Paisley!\n— Patrice Hardy (@MisssPatrice) \nAugust 8, 2018\n\n\n\n\nIn March 2014, senior Democratic Unionist Mr Paisley lobbied the then Prime Minister David Cameron against a proposed United Nations resolution to investigate alleged human rights abuses during a civil war on the Indian Ocean island without disclosing his financial benefit.\n\nMr Paisley has already apologised for what he said was his “unintentional failure” to register the hospitality.\n\nHe has vowed to fight any by-election campaign.\n\nThe DUP’s 10 pro-Brexit MPs are crucial allies of Prime Minister Theresa May’s minority Government.\n\nThe recall petition will be open for signing for six weeks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSignage for the recall petition which opened at the Joey Dunlop Leisure Centre in Ballymoney\n\n\n\n\nMr Paisley has been MP for the constituency since 2010, following in the footsteps of his father and DUP founder Ian Paisley.\n\nThe petition can be signed at centres in Ballymena, Ballymoney and Ballycastle.\n\nThe Electoral Office is running the petition process and those signing have to produce a driving licence, UK or Irish passport, electoral identity card or bus or rail pass.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"new belfast rapid transit bus lanes to go live in city centre","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n

Monday 27 August, during which drivers parking or driving illegally in the bus lanes will be issued with a warning notice instead of a Penalty Charge Notice (PCN) for a first contravention. \n\nDrivers who contravene the bus lanes for a second time during this period will be given a penalty charge notice.\n\nA Department for Infrastructure spokesperson said: \"The bus lanes will provide increased priority and a faster, more efficient service for existing bus services in the short term and, from 3 September, for Glider services.\n\n\"Motorists will have the opportunity to get used to

Zeplin, Blaise, Maverick, Ace and Jupiter on the other hand, were some of the less common names given to baby boys in 2017.\n\nIn terms of girls’ names, Grace has once again taken second place in the top 10, whilst Olivia comes a close third. Roise climbed the greatest number of places to join the top 100 names for girls, moving from rank 151 in 2016 to rank 90 in 2017. Isla and Charlotte both joined the girl’s top 10 for the first time in 2017.\n\nCompared with boys, a greater number of girls’ names have held the top spot since the reporting of first names began in 1997.  Some of the less common names given to baby girls in 2017 were Lady, Divine, Rio, Star and Vogue.\n\nAlmost 1,000 new baby names were registered in 2017 that had not been registered since the reporting of baby names began in 1997. Blockbuster movies, popular television series, current celebrities and memorable places continue to appear to be influencing factors for some parents.\n\nOf those registrations containing details of the father, almost 500 boys were given their fathers’ name as a first or additional name.  However fewer than 100 girls were given their mothers’ name.\n\nMore generally, the statistics published today highlight that the popularity of baby names in 2017 (both boys and girls) varied, for example, by District Council, age of mother, country of birth of mother and month of registration.\n\nTop 10 baby names in Northern Ireland, 2017\n\n\nBoys:\n\n\nJames  – 243 Babies\n\nJack  – 226 Babies\n\nNoah  –  189 Babies\n\nCharlie  – 185 Babies\n\nJacob  – 180 Babies\n\nHarry  – 169 Babies\n\nThomas  – 158 Babies\n\nDaniel  – 147 Babies\n\nOliver  – 143 Babies\n\nLogan  – 125 Babies\n\nGirls:\n\nEmily  – 216 Babies\n\nGrace – 202 Babies\n\nOlivia  – 179 Babies\n\nIsla  – 153 Babies\n\nAnna  – 142 Babies\n\nSophie  – 132 Babies\n\nElla  – 128 Babies\n\nAmelia  – 127 Babies\n\nCharlotte  – 124 Babies\n\nSophia  – 121 Babies\n"},{"url":null,"title":"time drawing near for ireland border poll sinn feins mcdonald tells hunger strike event","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

The march in Castlewellan was attended by Sinn Fein President Mary Lou McDonald.It marks the anniversary of the deaths of 10 republican hunger strikers, including Bobby Sands and Raymond McCreesh in 1981.In previous years tens of thousands of republicans have attended the event, which changes location annually.Relatives of IRA victims have accused Sinn Fein of \"insulting\" their loved ones memories, saying the commemoration compounds their grief.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe latter, she continued, had a responsibility to take a lead on the process.\n\n\"Political leaders must begin practical preparations for a new, inclusive Ireland beyond partition,\" she added.\n\n\"We are entering a defining period in Irish political history.\n\n\"Change is coming and it must be managed, sensitively and imaginatively.\n\n\"A process of national reconciliation must be central to any genuine effort to unite the people of this island.\"\n\nAddressing the ongoing Brexit fallout, Ms McDonald said Remainers within the unionist community would be increasingly attracted to being part of a \"new and outward-looking Ireland\" as the UK continues to \"turn away from Europe\".\n\nShe also reiterated Sinn Fein\u0027s commitment to forging a united Ireland that would accommodate unionists and their culture.\n\n\"British identity can and must be accommodated in a united Ireland and I believe nationalist Ireland is open to constitutional and political safeguards to ensure this,\" insisted the party leader.\n\n\"The right of unionists to celebrate their history and tradition, to recount their experiences and suffering, and to remember and honour their dead must be, and will be, respected.\"\n\nAnd to claps and cheers, she added: \"Just as our right to remember, to commemorate and honour our dead will be respected.\"\n\nMs McDonald also stressed that the party would continue to build on its equality agenda in the event of Irish unity as she laid out Sinn Fein\u0027s vision.\n\n\"It will be an Ireland united and at peace with itself. It will be a successful, prosperous Ireland of opportunity for all, regardless of class, colour, religion, gender or sexual orientation,\" she told the crowd.\n\nReasserting her party\u0027s commitment to seeing the Executive and Assembly restored, Ms McDonald said the political stalemate could only be overcome if progress is made on a number of social issues, such as the extension of same-sex marriage legislation to the North, which the DUP is strongly against.\n\n\"Marriage equality, the right to inquests and language rights are for everyone,\" she insisted.\n\n\"Fifty years on from the civil rights movement, sections of political unionism still resist equality and rights, but they will not succeed.\n\n\"It is not sufficient for the two Governments to only call a talks process. They must bring something to the table. They need to make clear that agreements must be implemented in full.\"\n\nMs McDonald added that the DUP\u0027s \u0027confidence and supply\u0027 agreement with the Tories continued to be a sticking point in getting the Assembly\u0027s institutions restored.\n\n\"We are dealing with a British Government that is dependent on DUP votes and sees Ireland as collateral damage in their desire to remain in office,\" she added. \"That is why we need a strong Irish Government leading on these issues.\"\n"},{"url":null,"title":"politicans applaud housing activists who occupied vacant property","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

All affected customers have already been contacted.\n\nPilots’ union Vereinigung Cockpit (VC) announced that Ryanair pilots in Germany will also be striking on Friday over pay and conditions.\n\n\n\nOur pilots in Germany enjoy excellent working conditions\nRyanair\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\n\n\nTwitter\n\n\n\n\n\nThe airline said the strike in Germany was “unjustified”.\n\nRyanair’s Kenny Jacobs said: “We regret the decision of the VC to go ahead with this unnecessary strike action given that we sent through a revised proposal on a Collective Labour Agreement (CLA) and stated our intention to work towards achieving a CLA together. We also invited VC to meet us on Tuesday but they did not respond to this invitation.\n\n“Our pilots in Germany enjoy excellent working conditions. They are paid up to €190,000 a year and, as well as additional benefits, they received a 20% pay increase at the start of this year. Ryanair pilots earn at least 30% more than Eurowings and 20% more than Norwegian pilots.\n\n“We asked VC to provide us with at least seven days’ notice of any planned strike action so that we could notify our customers of cancelled flights in advance and offer them alternative flights or refunds, but they have refused to do this and instead call an unnecessary strike in Germany in just two days’ time.\n\n“Ryanair is ready to continue these negotiations. We again call on the VC to remove the threat of an unjustified and unnecessary strike, to commit to providing reasonable (seven days) notice of strike action and to accept our invitations to meet for meaningful negotiations on a CLA for our German pilots and minimise disruption to German customers.\n\n“Ryanair is now forced to cancel 250 flights of over 2,400 flights scheduled to operate on Friday. We apologise to our customers for this unnecessary strike and regrettable disruption.”\n"},{"url":null,"title":"temporary morgues planned for popes visit to ireland","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

But outbreaks have occurred at Muslim, Christian and Hindu religious events, at sports events, and at large-scale open air festivals in the past. \n\n\"When they occur, they most commonly involve vaccine preventable diseases such as measles, influenza, mumps and hepatitis. \n\n\"Other reported outbreaks are mainly of gastrointestinal infections caused by a number of different pathogens,\" Dr O\u0027Riordan said. \n\n\"Given the nature of this historic papal visit, a large number of young children and elderly visitors are expected to attend the final mass, including many international visitors. \n\n\"In the current context of ongoing measles spread in Europe, it is highly advisable that all attendants, especially young children, ensure that they are up to date with their vaccinations,\" Dr O\u0027Riordan added.\n\nAccording to the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, the measles outbreak is continuing across Europe, with more than 30 deaths reported in 2018. \n\nThe Papal visit is expected to attract 15,000 overseas visitors and the final mass will draw a crowd of around 500,000 people. \n\nThe World Health Organisation (WHO) defines a mass gathering as \"a planned or spontaneous event where the number of people attending is sufficient to strain the planning and response resources of the community, state or nation hosting the event\". \n\nDr Jack Lambert, specialist in infectious diseases at the Mater Hospital, Dublin, said the reality is people risk contracting diseases during mass gatherings.\n\n\"There are real outbreaks, as with the Hajj in Saudi Arabia in the past… but most of the population in Ireland are protected against diseases like measles,\" Dr Lambert said. \"But, in saying that, if one person with measles is walking around 15,000 people and coughs, some individuals might get it.\" \n\nHe cautioned, however, that while infectious disease spread is not impossible during the Papal visit, it is \"highly unlikely\" and the risk is \"minimal\". \n\nPope Francis will attend the \u0027Festival of Families\u0027 in Croke Park on August 25 and a final mass in Phoenix Park on August 26.

of local MLA, Mark H Durkan, during a protest organised by Glen Development Initiative against a planning decision to refuse social housing and a community centre in the Glen area.\n\nThe proposed development was refused last week at a council planning meeting citing a lack of assessment into a potential flood risk from the Creggan reservoir.\n\nThe development of a community centre and 79 residential units of 60 houses, 19 apartments and one communal unit was planned to be built on lands between Glen Road and Templemore Park/Grafton Street and Lower Nassau Street by the applicant, Apex Housing Association, and agent, McAdam Design Ltd.\n\nHowever, the development was refused on recommendation from planning officials at last Tuesday’s Derry City and Strabane District Council Planning Committee meeting in the Guildhall.\n\nWhen it came to a vote of the planning committee, all DUP members and SDLP members of the committee alongside independent councillor, Warren Robinson, voted against the development. \n\nAll Sinn Féin members on the planning committee voted for the development but they were outvoted seven against six.\n\nThe reasons for refusal included the area of development being downstream of Creggan reservoir and a lack of assessment and planning into a potential flood risk from the Creggan reservoir.\n\nOutline planning permission had previously been granted on November 13, 2009, for a similar development under for 59 dwellings in which there is an agreed Concept Master Plan (CMP) associated with the lands to facilitate the comprehensive

This permission lapsed on the in November 2012.\n\nLast Thursday night, the Glen Development Initiative (GDI) issued a statement on their Facebook page and issued letters around the Glen area calling for people to join them in protest outside the offices of Mark H Durkan MLA.\n\nThey claimed that the decision was made ‘due to an act known as the Reservoir Act’. GDI said that ‘It means that in the event of the reservoir walls collapsing and all the water escaping the new builds would be in danger.\n\n‘We must also make clear that the area IS NOT a flood plain and this was clarified at the planning meeting.\n\n‘We would therefore call upon you to join us tomorrow to show our disappointment at the SDLP office on Strand Road (Long’s Supermarket) at 11.30am.’\n\nMr Durkan responded on Facebook by saying he was ‘shocked and saddened to learn that a \u0027politically neutral\u0027 community group, managed by a former SF Councillor’ were ‘planning to stage a protest outside my office...over a decision taken by Derry City and Strabane District Council.’\n\nHe added that he had advised constituents who had appointments during this time that they would be postponed but added that he was ‘looking forward to the engagement’ with GDI.\n\nMembers of the GDI arrived outside the office and were met by Mr Durkan and party colleague, Tina Gardiner, who sits on the planning committee and voted against the Glen Development.\nGerry MacLochlainn of GDI presented Mr Durkan and Ms Gardiner with letters of objection to the decision.\n\nDuring sometimes fraught exchanges that lasted almost a half an hour, Mr Durkan questioned why the group had chosen to protest outside his office and asked if they were going to protest outside council offices and DUP offices or protest against the independent councillor who voted according to the planning experts’ recommendations.\n\n\n\n        googletag.cmd.push(function () {            var mapMpu = googletag.sizeMapping()                .addSize([100, 100], [[320, 50], [300, 250]])                .addSize([980, 200], [[300, 250]])                .build()            slot = googletag.defineSlot(\u0027/29764278/derrynow_article_mpu\u0027, [1, 1], \u0027div-gpt-mid-article\u0027)                .defineSizeMapping(mapMpu)                                                            .setTargeting(\u0027section\u0027, \u0027news\u0027)                                            .setTargeting(\u0027page\u0027, \u0027article\u0027)                                            .setTargeting(\u0027id\u0027, \u0027241156\u0027)                                                    .addService(googletag.pubads())            googletag.display(\u0027div-gpt-mid-article\u0027)            googletag.pubads().refresh([slot])        })    \n\n\n\nMr MacLochlainn said they were going to protest at these places, however, Mr Durkan said this information was not shared in their message on Facebook or in the letter delivered around the Glen and he accused some members of GDI of being ‘politically motivated’.\n\nAt this point, some protesters presents said they had no political interest but simply an interest in the betterment of their community.\n\n\n‘Anger and frustration’\n\n\nSpeaking after the protest ended, Mr MacLochlainn said: “The SDLP are accusing us of a political stunt, the people in general aren’t. \n\n“Certainly, the feeling that we’re getting on the doorsteps was extreme anger at the decision to stop housing being built in this area and I think the people who decided to do that would need to answer questions. They can twist this whatever way they like but the minutes of the meeting will be clear.\n“Planning had to intervene and tell Councillor Gardiner that she was wrong, she had it wrong – there was no danger of that type of flooding at all. This is purely about a worst case scenario of a total and utter collapse of the reservoir. The Head of the Rivers Agency and the Chair of Civil Engineers of Northern Ireland were publicly on the record as saying that type of assessment was extremely unlikely, in fact, he said ‘hugely unrealistic’.\n\n“It was not decided on the basis of people being flooded in Ivy Mead or on the basis of people being flooded out of their houses because the type of risk assessment that the Minister thought was ok for there was the type of risk assessment that Cllr Gardiner insisted shouldn’t be used when it came to looking at the reservoir.”\n\nHe added said that, although he can’t speak on all of the councillors who voted, in relation to Cllr Gardiner he believed she voted against it on the grounds the site was a flood plain even though she was told it wasn’t, she persisted with that and repeated it on Radio Foyle the next day.\nMaurice Bowe, Director at GDI, added that the guidance the councillors voted on does ‘not permit standard risk assessment on the Reservoirs Act’.\n\nIn response, Cllr Gardiner said: “I want to reassure people that the proposal that I made was based on reading the application that was in front of us, looking at the expert advice, having no evidence to contradict that expert advice and I felt that I couldn’t make any other call.\n\n“Had there been different evidence there presented to us, we would’ve looked at it and weighed it up and possibly come up with a different decision but we were left with no choice because the only evidence that was there was a recommendation to refuse.”\n\nMr Durkan said he would stand over his comment that he believes the protest was ‘politically motivated’.\n\n“They said that they were going to other places to protest but clearly what they put on social media and leaflets delivered around the Glen area, here was where they wanted the protest.\n\n“I can understand anger and frustration at this decision and I share the frustration that we are going to have to wait even longer for homes to be built in the Glen.\n\n“There was originally an approval for social housing there nearly 10 years ago now that I worked on and that I welcomed and here we are 10 years later and not a sod has been turned and people are still waiting for houses.\n\n“We have countless people in here week in week out trying to get housing so I’m acutely aware of the shortage in Derry but the fact is, if this was an application for a private development, it would have been laughed out of the chamber. There would be no consideration whatsoever given the risk associated with that site.\n\n“Are they suggesting that people in social housing shouldn’t be afforded the same protection and the same standards – that’s absolutely preposterous.”\n\n\nPictured above: Gerry MacLochlainn of GDI speaks to Mark Durkan SDLP MLA and his party colleague, Cllr Tina Gardiner.\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"royal welsh cabinet heavyweight michael gove meets farming unions","story":"\nRoyal Welsh Show 2018..Pictured from left to right, Alun Cairns MP and Michael G\u0026ltspan class=truncate\u0026gt\u0026ltspan class=truncate-preview\u0026gtove, Secretary of St\u0026ltspan class=truncate-full-screen\u0026gtate for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs.
