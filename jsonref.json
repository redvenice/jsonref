I just went about my day. I didn\u0027t see anyone, I never cheated on Kate.\u0027Jon says it didn\u0027t help that long after he had separated from Kate and paparazzi shots emerged of him dating other women, the show, which was filmed six months in advance, showed him still married.\u0027Knowing what I know now, it was a smear campaign,\u0027 he said.\u0027I was gagged, my paycheck was cut off and they (TLC) needed an excuse why I left the show.\u0027They also needed to come up with a story line to garner the ratings, they wanted me to be the most hated person in America.\u0027Ten years on and Jon is very much out of the limelight.He says he is loving life in Reading, where he lives with daughter Hannah and son Collin, as well as his girlfriend, Certified Registered Nurse Practitioner Colleen Conrad and her daughter Jordan. "},{"url":null,"title":"A historic Israels Arabs lead parliamentary opposition","story":"Share this article He would also meet visiting heads of state, among other perks, and provide an outlet to voice Arab complaints of discrimination against them.

It has a lot of influence,\u0027 Odeh told reporters outside his home in Haifa, a mixed Arab and Jewish city in northern Israel.But although the Joint List will be the single largest group, other opposition parties combined would have enough seats to block his appointment through an absolute majority vote, analysts said.         Israel\u0027s head of the mainly Arab Joint List alliance Ayman Odeh casts his ballot accompanied by his family during Israel\u0027s parliamentary election at a polling station in Haifa \u0027There\u0027s no way the other parties will agree to have Ayman Odeh as head of the opposition, and grant our community recognition and legitimacy,\u0027 said Aida Touma-Sliman, an Arab lawmaker from Odeh\u0027s Hadash faction.  Arab lawmakers often call for an end to Israel\u0027s occupation of the West Bank and Gaza, a Palestinian state with East Jerusalem as its capital and the dismantling of Israel\u0027s settlements in the West Bank.The Arab community in Israel is mainly descendants of the Palestinians who remained in Israel after its creation in 1948.And some in the younger generation still identify as Palestinian.They make up 1.9 million of Israel\u0027s nine million population, and say they face discrimination in health, education and housing.They are living in cities such as Nazareth and Acre in the north and Bedouin towns in the southern Negev desert.         An Arabic-language election banner displaying a portrait of Arab Israeli candidate Waleed Taha is pictured in the Israeli town of Kfar QassemThe Mossawa Center rights group says Israel\u0027s state budget often favours Jews, allocating more funds to Jewish localities and schools than to Arab ones. Some 47 per cent of Arab citizens live in poverty, far above a national average of 18 per cent, it says.But Netanyahu\u0027s Likud party\u0027s 15 billion shekel ($4.19 billion) investment plan for the Arab sector during the last parliament was \u0027the largest such commitment in Israel\u0027s history\u0027, according to Eli Hazan, Likud\u0027s foreign affairs director.In Tuesday\u0027s election, Odeh and his group of four Arab parties ran a united front and Arab turnout increased sharply. That helped them regain seats lost in April when they were ided and turnout plummeted.Eid Jbaili, a 55-year-old gym teacher from Haifa, said he boycotted the April election but voted on Tuesday \u0027because my community\u0027s leaders showed they could exude unity in the face of adversity\u0027.

It was impossible to know who was in the photos.\u0027While she and her husband gently questioned their son, trying to find out if anyone had harmed him, he was too young to understand what was going on.\u0027He was a happy child and you just had to hope nothing had happened to him.\u0027Today, she says, her teenage son knows who George is, that \u0027the horrible lady\u0027 was in prison for abusing children and that he once attended the nursery where she worked, but he has never asked his parents directly whether he was one of those she targeted.\u0027He always moaned about going to nursery,\u0027 says the mother, \u0027and of course now I feel terribly guilty about that. Once, when were on the way there, he kept saying his leg hurt and I thought he was just making it up. Now we will never know if there was a more sinister reason.\u0027One incident in particular is still painfully etched on her mind.         George, who had been married for more than 20 years at the time she was arrested, took 124 obscene images of children on her mobile during a six-month period       \u0027I\u0027d arrived to pick him up and he\u0027d wet himself. Vanessa George asked if I wanted her to change him into his spare clothes before I took him home. I said yes.\u0027She finds it torturous now to think of her son lying on the changing mat where George abused many of her tiny young victims, sexually assaulting them with toothbrushes, crayons and even a plastic golf club.It is this poisonous legacy of uncertainty, says the mother, that makes her and other parents certain George is not fit to be released from prison.George, who had been married for more than 20 years at the time she was arrested, took 124 obscene images of children on her mobile during a six-month period. She shared them with two other paedophiles she met on the internet — Colin Blanchard, who was the lynchpin of the group, and Angela Allen.The trio, who had never met in person until they appeared in the dock together, egged each other on to abuse children and were only caught when one of Blanchard\u0027s business colleagues came across the explicit images on his computer.In court, where George pleaded guilty to seven sexual assaults on young children and six counts of making and distributing indecent images of children, her barrister claimed Blanchard had encouraged her to commit the abuse.That claim was rejected by Mr Justice Royce, who said: \u0027She is not a child. This is a married woman who can make up her own mind whether she indulges in this sort of activity or not.\u0027 He appealed directly to George, who described herself online as a \u0027paedo whore mumma\u0027, to reveal the names of the children she harmed.\u0027I would like your help,\u0027 he said, adding that she \u0027must know\u0027 who was in the photos. Speaking to her lawyer, he added: \u0027If I were a parent, I would want to know if my child was abused or not. Would it not be decent for her to indicate who she has abused?\u0027Plymouth MP Luke Pollard told the Mail this week that George\u0027s release was \u0027a dark day\u0027 for the parents whose children were once placed in her care, and one that \u0027reopened all the wounds of ten years ago\u0027.\u0027She\u0027s not just any criminal,\u0027 he said. \u0027She is Britain\u0027s most prolific female sex offender and she is still wielding power over these families by not naming their victims.\u0027Having been quietly released under licence from Bronzefield women\u0027s prison in Ashford, Middlesex, on Wednesday, George is believed to be staying in a probation hostel, at a cost to taxpayers of about £30,000 a year.Such hostels, managed by National Probation Service staff, each have between 15 and 20 bedrooms. Bathrooms are shared and the women are provided with three meals a day. George will also attend weekly meetings with a dedicated probation officer, at which she will be expected to talk about how she has spent her time and discuss her feelings, as well as the risks she faces on the outside.She is subject to strict conditions including a night-time curfew and a ban on using social media or owning any device with access to the internet. She is not allowed to return to Devon and Cornwall or to travel to a third county where one of her victims is believed to have moved, as well as 20 other exclusion zones connected to those affected by her crimes.She will never again be allowed to work with children or have unsupervised contact with them, and will be on the sex offenders\u0027 register for the rest of her life.Despite all these conditions, Luke Pollard said there were real concerns among families about how George\u0027s parole conditions will be enforced.\u0027The idea that in today\u0027s society they can keep her away from the internet for ever is ludicrous,\u0027 he said. \u0027We\u0027ve got to be certain that adequate resources are being made available to ensure there are no lapses.\u0027These parents have been through hell and now they have a whole new set of worries.\u0027The criminal justice system is not listening to victims. I want to see the rules around parole changed, particularly for those who refuse to name their victims.\u0027Such was the strength of feeling about George\u0027s impending release from prison that Mr Pollard had a meeting with Devon and Cornwall police, who subsequently re-examined their files to see whether further charges could be put to George so she could be kept behind bars.But officers were only able to find \u0027corresponding charges\u0027 — lesser charges relating to crimes of which she had already been found guilty. As these would not increase her sentence, no further action was taken.The contradictory message sent out at the time of her sentencing — when parents were told she could be out in seven years but would probably be in prison for life — goes back to a policy brought in by the last Labour government.Sentences of Imprisonment for Public Protection (IPPs) were introduced under the Criminal Justice Act 2003 by then Home Secretary David Blunkett. The Home Office originally estimated they would imprison only 900 \u0027dangerous\u0027 criminals under such sentences.Those convicted would be given a fixed tariff like any other prisoner but could be kept in prison for as long as the Parole Board deemed them a threat to society.The maximum sentence George could receive for her crimes was seven years — but by giving her an indeterminate sentence, Mr Justice Joyce may well have believed she would be kept inside for much longer than that.Sentences of IPP were scrapped in 2012, amid claims they were violating human rights and causing prison overcrowding. As the numbers of IPP prisoners grew, more and more convicts demanded access to the rehabilitation and resettlement programmes they had to undertake to show they were no longer a risk to society.There were claims, too, that such sentences were affecting prisoners\u0027 mental health, with a report by the Prison Reform Trust stating that IPP prisoners suffered the highest rates of self-harm in prison.Last year, Sam Gyimah, then Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Prisons and Probation, said the Government was focused on increasing the number of IPP prisoners released by processing their cases \u0027as quickly as possible\u0027.In March this year, 2,400 such prisoners remained. Of those, 43 —including George — were women.The decision to release her was taken after a Parole Board hearing in July this year which determined that she was safe to be freed from jail, after she convinced them that she had undergone treatment for her low self-esteem.The board noted how \u0027all the professional witnesses recommended that Ms George be released\u0027.But is it possible that George — who now goes by her maiden name, Vanessa Marks — is no longer a threat to the public? The families of the children she once cared for don\u0027t think so.Victims\u0027 rights campaigner Harry Fletcher says George\u0027s apparent lack of remorse means her release is \u0027worrying\u0027.\u0027Scores of parents in the areas where she worked don\u0027t know whether their child was a victim,\u0027 he says. \u0027The prison system should have taken that into account. Given the enormity of what she did, her sentence was grossly inadequate.\u0027Mr Fletcher said he understood ministers were urgently looking at George\u0027s case with a view to changing guidelines on sentence length.Given the level of hatred directed at her, it is hard to imagine how George will be able to revert to anything resembling a normal life.She is unable to return to the South West of England, the only place she ever lived before going to jail, and was orced by her husband Andrew shortly after being sent to prison. She is estranged from their two daughters, who are now adults, and her parents are dead.For those affected by her crimes, George\u0027s wellbeing is of no concern. \u0027I hope her life is torture because that\u0027s what she\u0027s done to us,\u0027 says the father who spoke to the Mail this week.Families with connections to Little Ted\u0027s Nursery have spent the past decade trying to put the horror of her crimes behind them. That the monster who preyed on their children is back out on the streets again is, for them, the greatest injustice of all.Additional reporting: Izzy Ferris"},{"url":null,"title":"Family quiet hero refuses charge elderly says nice good","story":"Share this article Mother to Annalise, 13 and Thomas, 11, from her first marriage, Barbara was left with severe disabilities, after breaking her back when she was mowed down by a car aged 18. Together they formed a contented and close \u0027patchwork family\u0027, but their happiness was almost destroyed when the couple\u0027s son William died in 2013 at 16 weeks old following a bowel operation. Born prematurely, weighing just 1lb 13oz and with a heart defect, his loss devastated the Andersons. Pictures of their boy decorate their home, and they have created a memorial in their front garden.However, far from retreating from the world, consumed with grief, this tragedy — and Barbara\u0027s own experience of disability — inspired them to help others instead.Mr Anderson was earning about £30,000 a year when two years ago he decided to launch a non-profit Community Initiative Company called Depher — Disabled and Elderly Plumbing and Heating Emergency Response.As far as he is aware, it is the only plumbing business of its kind in the world, reliant on donations and grants to offer free or discounted services to needy customers.The idea was sparked after Mr Anderson saw an elderly disabled man poorly treated by another engineer, who\u0027d landed him with a hefty repair bill and a £5,500 quote for a new boiler which wasn\u0027t necessary.\u0027The next day I couldn\u0027t get this gentleman out of my head,\u0027 he says. \u0027I was furious with the way he\u0027d been treated. I thought: \u0027If this has happened to him, it\u0027s probably happening all over the UK.\u0027 That\u0027s when I decided I had to do something.\u0027Mr Anderson spoke to his accountant, who registered his new non-profit company, and he used the money from his regular plumbing jobs to finance the free ones.But with elderly vulnerable customers making up 90 per cent of his workload in the winter, compared with 25 per cent in the summer, there was a shortfall in funding so he raised £77,000 through crowd-funding and received other donations, including a £2,000 grant from the Duchy of Lancaster.\u0027Since then, we have done 2,389 jobs for elderly and disabled — mostly it\u0027s free, but if we don\u0027t have the funds then it\u0027s discounted by 25 or 50 per cent,\u0027 he says proudly.\u0027When I started out as a plumber, I just went for the best paid jobs, but now I take home £100 a week, which I give straight to Barbara. Everything else goes into the company or paying off the £8,000 debt.\u0027Though they live in a mortgage-free home paid for by Barbara\u0027s compensation from her accident and mostly exist on her disability benefits, it\u0027s been a tough two years, financially and emotionally.Daughter Paige, 24, says: \u0027I am really proud of my Dad, but it\u0027s also been hard to sit and watch my parents struggle through all the sacrifices they\u0027ve had to make.\u0027Barbara adds: \u0027James was very down when he started to receive death threats and told me \u0027Perhaps I should give it up\u0027. But it\u0027s something he has to do and I never tried to stop him, even though it was frightening.\u0027Of his decision to carry on, despite the threats, James says: \u0027There were always going to be some people who thought I was too good to be true or out to take away their livelihoods. But it\u0027s not about me.\u0027Since James was dubbed \u0027Britain\u0027s kindest plumber\u0027 he has been overwhelmed by the response. One company has offered him free business insurance, worth £2,000 a year, Reliance Bank has offered free lifetime banking for his business and others have offered free holidays.He says hundreds of tradespeople have been in touch offering their services for free, too, and a London firm wants to discuss joining forces to expand his idea nationwide.Abroad too, James\u0027 selflessness is inspiring others, with people in the U.S., France and Australia wanting to exchange ideas and set up similar companies. His vision is for free plumbing for every single vulnerable, elderly or disabled person in the UK.He says: \u0027I spoke to a woman from North Wales just yesterday who had an engineer quote her £2,500 to take out a toilet, put in three pieces of floorboard and then put the same toilet back. I was disgusted, so I told her: \u0027Give me 14 days and ring me back and if I\u0027ve got enough funds, I will do it.\u0027On call 24 hours a day, seven days a week, Barbara laughs when she says the downside of being married to the nation\u0027s most caring tradesman is that he\u0027s too busy to fix their own dripping taps.\u0027It takes him a long time to do anything at home,\u0027 she says, adding: \u0027And when he does, he cuts corners so he can get back to the customers who need him.\u0027"},{"url":null,"title":"Nancy Pelosi demands new law make possible INDICT sitting president","story":"Share this article          President Donald Trump was insulated by DOJ guidelines that state a sitting president can\u0027t be prosecuted.

Rae Ritchie looks at why getting the right answer is so addictive, and why getting the wrong answer can be so funnyWhat Q is one of the nation’s favourite pastimes? Nope, it’s not quidditch. It’s quizzes. We love racking our brains for that obscure bit of knowledge that we’re sure we once heard somewhere. Whether we are in the pub with our mates or at home shouting at the television, the feeling of getting an answer right is addictive. But why do we find quizzes so compelling?A buzz from the buzzerThe very nature of a quiz lures us in. As veteran question writer David Bodycombe observes: “If a question is posed, you can’t help but wonder what the answer is.”When we get the answer correct, various factors make us want to go back for more. Michelle Tolfrey, a clinical psychologist and member of the Welldoing.org community of therapists, explains: “Physiologically, when we win something, we experience a nice hit of dopamine, which can be quite a euphoric and ‘buzzy’ feeling to have. As a result, we may want to replicate this again and again to get the same sensation.”Tolfrey also points out the psychological rewards involved in quizzes. “They can be particularly enjoyable if we are doing them in the context of socialising with peers, where it can help us to feel connected with others and part of something special.“And there are, of course, lots of other social rewards involved with quizzes, such as receiving praise from others or being given a certain title, prize or accolade that boosts our self esteem.”Fellow clinical psychologist and Welldoing.org therapist Patapia Tzotzoli agrees that quizzes can meet basic human needs. “People are creatures of emotion and are motivated by pride and vanity,” she says. “Quizzes offer a platform where our knowledge is being assessed by our ability to retrieve information quickly while others are watching. Doing so offers us quick gratification and a sense of achievement that nourishes our self-esteem and gains us immediate recognition.“In other words, quizzes offer a setting with the right conditions to feed our need to be important and appreciated for it.”But if quizzes are so rewarding, why do our brains seem to crack under the pressure of needing to come up with the right answer – and quickly?“Sometimes anxiety kicks in and interferes with our memory – and consequently our performance,” states Tzotzoli. “The more anxious we become, the harder it is to remember the information we are after and we experience what we commonly describe as our ‘mind going blank’.”Not quite the answerTimes when a contestant’s mind goes awry make for comedy gold on quiz programmes. On the iconic 80s and 90s show Blockbusters, for instance, participants still had “mind going blank” moments despite being given the first letter of the answer. When asked by legendary host Bob Holness “What D, rhyming with a synonym for defraud, means to decrease in number or grow smaller in size?”, quizzer Susie somehow managed to come up with shrink (correct answer: dwindle, rhymes with swindle).At other times, contestants stuck to the right letter, but under the pressure of studio lights, got the wrong word. After answering “What O is the generic word for any living animal or plant, including bacteria or viruses?”, a young man cringed when he realised that he’d replied orgasm not organism. Contestant Pauline looked even more mortified when the penny dropped that the response to “What K is a Chinese ceremony of abasement?” was kowtow – not Kama Sutra.More such moments follow on the new series of Blockbusters that’s about to hit our screens on Comedy Central. Host Dara Ó Briain is met with laughable responses to questions including “What Q is a type of pen that is made from a bird’s feather” and “What N are potatoes when they first come into season?” No, the answers are not quail and nugget.As in the original, this latest incarnation features student contestants, although a celebrity special with Strictly Come Dancing’s Stacey Dooley and Oti Mabuse against comedian Josh Widdecombe starts the series off.For us armchair quizzers joining in from our sofas, the Blockbusters style of question has major appeal. As Bodycombe puts it: “It’s a clever format because there’s a clue inherently built into the question, which automatically makes you think you might have a chance of getting it right.”Bodycombe is spot-on. No matter how smart, we all need a little help. Just try to distinguish between organism and orgasm.What B has a brand new series?The new series of Blockbusters – hosted by Dara Ó Briain – hits our screens at 8pm on Thursday 26 September on Comedy Central."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3169ecc41d3ec20850bbf74c75bb61522702e6cc/0_0_2500_1500/master/2500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e20e9b2e1ddadc4b6ae43646f32c744e","title":"question are two heads really better than one","story":"Blockbusters, the classic gameshow that pits two players against one, is returning for a second series. So in quizzes – and indeed life – do you get the best results working in a team or flying solo? Abi Smith unpicks the scienceHow good are you at quizzes? Go on, you can be honest. You think you’re pretty good, right? Well, you might have a superior intellect – but then again, you might just be overconfident. “This is known as the Dunning-Kruger effect, which states that the majority of people tend to overestimate their abilities,” says Matt Shaw, a performance psychologist at coaching company InnerDrive.“Interestingly, this is more pronounced in those with the lowest ability, such as inexperienced players,” says Shaw. “Experts tend to underestimate their abilities, which is sometimes called ‘the burden of expertise’.”Knowing whether you are the type of person who is burdened with expert knowledge or likely to overegg your skills is the kind of insight that would come in handy when playing Blockbusters – the classic TV gameshow that pits a single player against a team of two students.Recently relaunched on Comedy Central with comedian Dara Ó Briain presiding, the game sees contestants making their way across the iconic hexagon-filled game board, answering questions that begin with a particular letter of the alphabet. The format rewards general knowledge, lateral thinking, quick reactions and – in the case of the paired-up players – teamwork.“It’s really important that you choose your thinking partner wisely,” says Robert Ritchie, who’s made a career by cultivating positive mindsets and behaviours across different types of teams.Currently head of organisational development at the University of Salford, Ritchie says “one head is better than two” in the idea-creation stages. After that, he says, you can deliberately decide who to bring in and when. “In a quiz format, that process is accelerated. You have to have that initial moment of reaction and decision on your own, otherwise you’ll only ever be going around consensus or groupthink,” he adds. Get the right teammate and gameplay can be dazzlingly swift: just check out this pair of Cambridge students trouncing their single opponent.Intriguingly, however, two heads are likely to be better than one even if you’re not both Blockbusting naturals. “There is a quirky phenomenon called the Köhler effect,” says Shaw. “This is when working with other people, the weaker teammate tends to elevate their performance. Not only do people work harder if their partner is outperforming them, they are also more motivated when they know that the team’s performance relies on them. This is more prominent when team members’ abilities are similar, like in a quiz.” It’s perhaps no surprise, therefore, that across the two Comedy Central series of Blockbusters, 11 out of 20 have been won by the pair – despite pairs requiring one more correct answer each round than the solo players.Question setter Charlotte Hazzard, who runs the quiz at the historic Grapes pub in Limehouse, London, also believes that two heads are better than one. “When you’ve got two brains, you’re able to pull on a greater bank of knowledge, and pub quizzes often need quite a wide spread of general knowledge,” she says.Knowing the information and having it ready at the right moment are two very different skills, however. Team player Philip fell foul of this when asked: “What U is something designed for both men and women?” His immediate response – underwear – was factually correct but not what the question was looking for. The word Ó Briain wanted, of course, was unisex.There’s a reason that the first answer that comes into your head won’t necessarily win you points, according to Shaw. “Gut responses are essentially shortcuts that help us make decisions quickly and when under pressure. However, they’re not always accurate. Under stress or pressure (like in a quiz), our focus can become too narrow, meaning we stop searching for alternative answers, which can lead to mistakes,” he says.Comedian Josh Widdicombe learned this to his cost on the celebrity edition when he buzzed in too soon on a question about West End musicals, proffering West Side Story as his W answer. This allowed professional dancer and presenter Oti Mabuse to swoop in with the correct response – Wicked – and salvage the point for herself and her presenter teammate, Stacey Dooley.Sometimes though, one head is all it takes. “At the end of the day, if you go with your gut instinct and get it incorrect, you’re more forgiving of yourself than if you hadn’t gone with your gut,” says Hazzard, whose quiz is often frequented by the leaseholder of the Grapes pub, Sir Ian McKellen. The other benefit of going it alone is that you don’t need to negotiate the politics of playing in a team. In one of many Blockbuster bust-ups, teammates Manreet and Nyah disagreed on the choice of letter and subsequently lost a point, with Manreet jokingly defecting to their opponent’s side. So, are two heads really better than one? It depends on the problem and the people – and whether you can keep playing nice.What B has a brand new series?The new series of Blockbusters – hosted by Dara Ó Briain – hits our screens at 8pm on Thursday 26 September on Comedy Central."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/893da5cdc3ec1deff5552379302619933196e9ca/0_0_10417_6250/master/10417.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5912083babaa3d15b02a00c5a18ba515","title":"quiz revival of the fittest","story":"Blockbusters is back.

Read the reviewIn this existential eco-thriller, a William Blake-obsessed eccentric investigates the murders of men and animals in a remote Polish village. More accessible and focused than Flights, the novel that won Tokarczuk the Man International Booker prize, it is no less profound in its examination of how atavistic male impulses, emboldened by the new rightwing politics of Europe, are endangering people, communities and nature itself. Read the reviewIn this savagely beautiful novel set during the Indian wars and American civil war, a young Irish boy flees famine-struck Sligo for Missouri. There he finds lifelong companionship with another emigrant, and they join the army on its brutal journey west, laying waste to Indian settlements. Viscerally focused and intense, yet imbued with the grandeur of the landscape, the book explores love, gender and survival with a rare, luminous power.Read the reviewLos Angeles Times journalist Barbara Demick interviewed around 100 North Korean defectors for this propulsive work of narrative non-fiction, but she focuses on just six, all from the north-eastern city of Chongjin – closed to foreigners and less media-ready than Pyongyang. North Korea is revealed to be rife with poverty, corruption and violence but populated by resilient people with a remarkable ability to see past the propaganda all around them. Read the reviewAn agenda-setting book that is devastating about the extent to which big tech sets out to manipulate us for profit. Not simply another expression of the “techlash”, Zuboff’s ambitious study identifies a new form of capitalism, one involving the monitoring and shaping of our behaviour, often without our knowledge, with profound implications for democracy. “Once we searched Google, but now Google searches us.” Read the reviewAt the time when Ware won the  first book award, no graphic novel had previously won a generalist literary prize. Emotional and artistic complexity are perfectly poised in this account of a listless 36-year-old office dogsbody who is thrown into an existential crisis by an encounter with his estranged dad. Read the reviewSheba, a middle-aged teacher at a London comprehensive, begins an affair with her 15-year-old student - but we hear about it from a fellow teacher, the needy Barbara, whose obsessive nature drives the narrative. With shades of Patricia Highsmith, this teasing investigation into sex, class and loneliness is a dark marvel.Read the reviewThe Spanish master examines chance, love and death in the story of an apparently random killing that gradually reveals hidden depths. Marías constructs an elegant murder mystery from his trademark labyrinthine sentences, but this investigation is in pursuit of much meatier questions than whodunnit. Read the reviewThe master of the cold war thriller turned his attention to the new world order in this chilling investigation into the corruption powering big pharma in Africa. Based on the case of a rogue antibiotics trial that killed and maimed children in Nigeria in the 1990s, it has all the dash and authority of his earlier novels while precisely and presciently anatomising the dangers of a rampant neo-imperialist capitalism. Read the reviewIf the western literary canon is founded on Homer, then it is founded on women’s silence. Barker’s extraordinary intervention, in which she replays the events of the Iliad from the point of view of the enslaved Trojan women, chimed with both the #MeToo movement and a wider drive to foreground suppressed voices. In a world still at war, it has chilling contemporary resonance.Read the reviewA theoretical physicist opens a window on to the great questions of the universe with this 96-page overview of modern physics. Rovelli’s keen insight and striking metaphors make this the best introduction to subjects including relativity, quantum mechanics, cosmology, elementary particles and entropy outside of a course in advanced physics. Read the reviewThe deliciously dark US crime thriller that launched a thousand imitators and took the concept of the unreliable narrator to new heights. A woman disappears: we think we know whodunit, but we’re wrong. Flynn’s stylishly written portrait of a toxic marriage set against a backdrop of social and economic insecurity combines psychological depth with sheer unputdownable flair.Read the reviewWritten after a near-fatal accident, this combination of memoir and masterclass by fiction’s most successful modern storyteller showcases the blunt, casual brilliance of King at his best. As well as being genuinely useful, it’s a fascinating chronicle of literary persistence, and of a lifelong love affair with language and narrative.Read the reviewHenrietta Lacks was a black American who died in agony of cancer in a “coloured” hospital ward in 1951. Her cells, taken without her knowledge during a biopsy, went on to change medical history, being used around the world to develop countless drugs. Skloot skilfully tells the extraordinary scientific story, but in this book the voices of the Lacks children are crucial – they have struggled desperately even as billions have been made from their mother’s “HeLa” cells. Read the reviewThe fourth of the autobiographical Patrick Melrose novels finds the wealthy protagonist – whose flight from atrocious memories of child abuse into drug abuse was the focus of the first books – beginning to grope after redemption. Elegant wit and subtle psychology lift grim subject matter into seductive brilliance.Read the reviewA man drives his three sons into a deep pond and swims out, leaving them to drown. But was it an accident? This 2005 tragedy caught the attention of one of Australia’s greatest living writers. Garner puts herself centre stage in an account of Robert Farquharson’s trial that combines forensic detail and rich humanity.Read the reviewThis book-length poem is a mesmerising tapestry of “the river’s mutterings”, based on three years of recording conversations with people who live and work on the River Dart in Devon. From swimmers to sewage workers, boatbuilders to bailiffs, salmon fishers to ferryman, the voices are varied and vividly brought to life.Read the reviewOne of Canada’s most celebrated poets examines love and desire in a collection that describes itself as “a fictional essay in 39 tangos”. Carson charts the course of a doomed marriage in loose-limbed lines that follow the switchbacks of thought and feeling from first meeting through multiple infidelities to arrive at eventual orce.This grand survey of Europe since 1945 begins with the devastation left behind by the second world war and offers a panoramic narrative of the cold war from its beginnings to the collapse of the Soviet bloc – a part of which Judt witnessed firsthand in Czechoslovakia’s velvet revolution. A very complex story is told with page-turning urgency and what may now be read as nostalgic faith in “the European idea”. Read the reviewA love story to the golden age of comics in New York, Chabon’s Pulitzer-winner features two Jewish cousins, one smuggled out of occupied Prague, who create an anti-fascist comic book superhero called The Escapist. Their own adventures are as exciting and highly coloured as the ones they write and draw in this generous, open-hearted, deeply lovable rollercoaster of a book.Read the reviewA beautifully written and profound book, which takes the form of aseries of (often hair-raising and claustrophobic) voyages underground– from the fjords of the Arctic to the Parisian catacombs. Trips belowthe surface inspire reflections on “deep” geological time and raiseurgent questions about the human impact on planet Earth. Read the reviewAn entertaining and highly influential book from the writer best known for his advice: “Eat food, not too much, mostly plants.” The author follows four meals on their journey from field to plate – including one from McDonald’s and a locally sourced organic feast. Pollan is a skilled, amusing storyteller and The Omnivore’s Dilemma changed both food writing and the way we see food. Read the reviewBased on Beard’s lectures on women’s voices and how they have been silenced, Women and Power was an enormous publishing success in the “#MeToo”’ year 2017. An exploration of misogyny, the origins of “gendered speech” in the classical era and the problems the male world has with strong women, this slim manifesto became an instant feminist classic. Read the reviewCarey’s second Booker winner is an irresistible tour de force of literary ventriloquism: the supposed autobiography of 19th-century Australian outlaw and “wild colonial boy” Ned Kelly, inspired by a fragment of Kelly’s own prose and written as a glorious rush of semi-punctuated vernacular storytelling. Mythic and tender by turns, these are tall tales from a lost frontier.Read the reviewPitted against a backdrop of prejudice, this London-set novel is told by four protagonists – Hortense and Gilbert, Jamaican migrants, and a stereotypically English couple, Queenie and Bernard. These varied perspectives, illuminated by love and loyalty, combine to create a thoughtful mosaic depicting the complex beginnings of Britain’s multicultural society. Read the reviewTóibín’s sixth novel is set in the 1950s, when more than 400,000 people left Ireland, and considers the emotional and existential impact of emigration on one young woman. Eilis makes a life for herself in New York, but is drawn back by the possibilities of the life she has lost at home. A universal story of love, endurance and missed chances, made radiant through Tóibín’s measured prose and tender understatement.Read the reviewIn the first book in her dystopian MaddAddam trilogy, the Booker winner speculates about the havoc science can wreak on the world. The big warning here – don’t trust corporations to run the planet – is blaring louder and louder as the century progresses. Read the reviewThe title is the question Winterson’s adoptive mother asked as she threw her daughter out, aged 16, for having a girlfriend. The autobiographical story behind Oranges Are Not the Only Fruit, and the trials of Winterson’s later life, is urgent, wise and moving. Read the reviewPratchett’s mighty Discworld series is a high point in modern fiction: a parody of fantasy literature that deepened and darkened over the decades to create incisive satires of our own world. The 29th book, focusing on unlikely heroes, displays all his fierce intelligence, anger and wild humour, in a story that’s moral, humane – and hilarious. Read the reviewSatrapi’s autobiographical graphic novel follows her coming-of-age in the lead up to and during the Iranian revolution. In this riotous memoir, Satrapi focuses on one young life to reveal a hidden history.The Nobel laureate tends to the fragments of memory and loss with moving precision in his final poetry collection. A book of elegies and echoes, these poems are infused with a haunting sense of pathos, with a line often left hanging to suspend the reader in longing and regret. Read the reviewThe British novelist combines fiction and non-fiction to form a searing essay on grief and love for his late wife, the literary agent Pat Kavanagh. Barnes ides the book into three parts with disparate themes – 19th-century ballooning, photography and marriage. Their convergence is wonderfully achieved. Read the reviewWriting against “the tremendous despair at the height of the Bush administration’s powers and the outset of the war in Iraq”, the US thinker finds optimism in political activism and its ability to change the world. The book ranges widely from the fall of the Berlin wall to the Zapatista uprising in Mexico, to the invention of Viagra. Read the reviewFrom the slow emergency response in the black suburbs destroyed by hurricane Katrina to a mother trying to move her daughter away from a black passenger on a plane, the poet’s award-winning prose work confronts the history of racism in the US and asks: regardless of their actual status, who truly gets to be a citizen? Read the reviewThe author of The Big Short has made a career out of rendering the most opaque subject matter entertaining and comprehensible: Moneyball tells the story of how geeks outsmarted jocks to revolutionise baseball using maths. But you do not need to know or care about the sport, because – as with all Lewis’s best writing – it’s all about how the story is told. Read the reviewThere are echoes of DH Lawrence and EM Forster in McEwan’s finely tuned dissection of memory and guilt. The fates of three young people are altered by a young girl’s lie at the close of a sweltering day on a country estate in 1935. Lifelong remorse, the horror of war and devastating twists are to follow in an elegant, deeply felt meditation on the power of love and art. Read the reviewWith cold, clear, precise prose, Didion gives an account of the year her husband, the writer John Gregory Dunne, collapsed from a fatal heart attack in their home. Her devastating examination of grief and widowhood changed the nature of writing about bereavement. Read the reviewSet around the unlikely bond between two wartime friends, Smith’s debut brilliantly captures Britain’s multicultural spirit, and offers a compelling insight into immigrant family life.Oxford graduate Nick Guest has the questionable good fortune of moving into the grand west London home of a rising Tory MP. Thatcher-era degeneracy is lavishly displayed as Nick falls in love with the son of a supermarket magnate, and the novel records how Aids began to poison gay life in London. In peerless prose, Hollinghurst captures something close to the spirit of an age. Read the reviewA reunion dominates the Irish novelist’s family drama, but the inidual stories of the five members of the Madigan clan – the matriarch, Rosaleen, and her children, Dan, Emmet, Constance and Hanna, who escape and are bound to return – are beautifully held in balance. When the Madigans do finally come together halfway through the book, Enright masterfully reminds us of the weight of history and family. Read the reviewKnown for the firecracker phrases and broad satires of his fiction, Amis presented a much warmer face in his memoir. His life is haunted by the disappearance of his cousin Lucy, who is revealed 20 years later to have been murdered by Fred West. But Amis also has much fun recollecting his “velvet-suited, snakeskin-booted” youth, and paints a moving portrait of his father’s comic gusto as old age reduces him to a kind of “anti-Kingsley”. Read the reviewIn this exquisite family memoir, the ceramicist explains how he came to inherit a collection of 264 netsuke – small Japanese ornaments – from his great-uncle. The unlikely survival of the netsuke entails De Waal telling a story that moves from Paris to Austria under the Nazis to Japan, and he beautifully conjures a sense of place. The book doubles as a set of profound reflections on objects and what they mean to us. Read the reviewThis startling work of autofiction, which signalled a new direction for Cusk, follows an author teaching a creative writing course over one hot summer in Athens. She leads storytelling exercises. She meets other writers for dinner. She hears from other people about relationships, ambition, solitude, intimacy and “the disgust that exists indelibly between men and women”. The end result is sublime. Read the reviewThe American cartoonist’s darkly humorous memoir tells the story of how her closeted gay father killed himself a few months after she came out as a lesbian. This pioneering work, which later became a musical, helped shape the modern genre of “graphic memoir”, combining detailed and beautiful panels with remarkable emotional depth. Read the review“Normal cells are identically normal malignant cells become unhappily malignant in unique ways.” In adapting the opening lines of Anna Karenina, Mukherjee sets out the breathtaking ambition of his study of cancer: not only to share the knowledge of a practising oncologist but to take his readers on a literary and historical journey. Read the reviewAn electrifying memoir that captured a moment in thinking about gender, and also changed the world of books. The story, told in fragments, is of Nelson’s pregnancy, which unfolds at the same time as her partner, the artist Harry Dodge, is beginning testosterone injections: “the summer of our changing bodies”. Strikingly honest, originally written, with a galaxy of intellectual reference points, it is essentially a love story one that seems to make a new way of living possible. Read the reviewA thrilling, genre-bending tale of escape from slavery in the American deep south, this Pulitzer prize-winner combines extraordinary prose and uncomfortable truths. Two slaves flee their masters using the underground railroad, the network of abolitionists who helped slaves out of the south, wonderfully reimagined by Whitehead as a steampunk vision of a literal train. Read the reviewThe first instalment of Knausgaard’s relentlessly self-examining six-volume series My Struggle revolves around the life and death of his alcoholic father. Whether or not you regard him as the Proust of memoir, his compulsive honesty created a new benchmark for autofiction. Read the reviewA moving, book-length poem from the UK’s first female poet laureate, Rapture won the TS Eliot prize in 2005. From falling in love to betrayal and separation, Duffy reimagines romance with refreshing originality. Read the reviewCanada’s observant and humane short story writer, who won the Nobel in 2013, is at her best in this collection. A housekeeper’s fate is changed by the pranks of her employer’s teenager daughter an incorrigible flirt gracefully accepts his wife’s new romance in her care home. No character acts as at first expected in Munro’s stories, which are attuned to the tiniest shifts in perception. Read the reviewThe beautifully written product of 15 years of research, Capital made its author an intellectual star – the modern Marx – and opened readers’ eyes to how neoliberalism produces vastly increased inequalities. Full of data, theories and historical analysis, its message is clear, and prophetic: unless governments increase tax, the new and grotesque wealth levels of the rich will encourage political instability. Read the reviewRooney’s second novel, a love story between two clever and damaged young people coming of age in contemporary Ireland, confirmed her status as a literary superstar. Her focus is on the dislocation and uncertainty of millennial life, but her elegant prose has universal appeal. Read the reviewInspired by both Proust and The Sopranos, Egan’s Pulitzer-winning comedy follows several characters in and around the US music industry, but is really a book about memory and kinship, time and narrative, continuity and disconnection. Read the reviewEmerging from Solomon’s own painful experience, this “anatomy” of depression examines its many faces – plus its science, sociology and treatment. The book’s combination of honesty, scholarly rigour and poetry made it a benchmark in literary memoir and understanding of mental health. Read the reviewThis warm yet biting collection of short stories by the Booker-winning American author will restore your faith in humanity. No matter how weird the setting – a futuristic prison lab, a middle-class home where human lawn ornaments are employed as a status symbol – in these surreal satires of post-crash life Saunders reminds us of the meaning we find in small moments. Read the reviewIn his Olympian history of humanity, Harari documents the numerous revolutions Homo sapiens has undergone over the last 70,000 years: from new leaps in cognitive reasoning to agriculture, science and industry, the era of information and the possibilities of biotechnology. Harari’s scope may be too wide for some, but this engaging work topped the charts and made millions marvel. Read the reviewAtkinson examines family, history and the power of fiction as she tells the story of a woman born in 1910 – and then tells it again, and again, and again. Ursula Todd’s multiple lives see her strangled at birth, drowned on a Cornish beach, trapped in an awful marriage and visiting Adolf Hitler at Berchtesgaden. But this dizzying fictional construction is grounded by such emotional intelligence that her heroine’s struggles always feel painfully, joyously real. Read the reviewFifteen-year-old Christopher John Francis Boone becomes absorbed in the mystery of a dog’s demise, meticulously investigating through diagrams, timetables, maps and maths problems. Haddon’s fascinating portrayal of an unconventional mind was a crossover hit with both adults and children and was adapted into a very successful stage play. Read the reviewIn this urgent examination of free-market fundamentalism, Klein argues – with accompanying reportage – that the social breakdowns witnessed during decades of neoliberal economic policies are not accidental, but in fact integral to the functioning of the free market, which relies on disaster and human suffering to function. Read the reviewA father and his young son, “each the other’s world entire”, trawl across the ruins of post-apocalyptic America in this terrifying but tender story told with biblical conviction. The slide into savagery as civilisation collapses is harrowing material, but McCarthy’s metaphysical efforts to imagine a cold dark universe where the light of humanity is winking out are what make the novel such a powerful ecological warning. Read the reviewThe members of one ordinarily unhappy American family struggle to adjust to the shifting axes of their worlds over the final decades of the 20th century. Franzen’s move into realism reaped huge literary rewards: exploring both domestic and national conflict, this family saga is clever, funny and outrageously readable. Read the reviewThe science journalist examines with clarity and memorable detail the current crisis of plant and animal loss caused by human civilisation (over the past half billion years, there have been five mass extinctions on Earth we are causing another). Kolbert considers both ecosystems – the Great Barrier Reef, the Amazon rainforest – and the lives of some extinct and soon-to-be extinct creatures including the Sumatran rhino and “the most beautiful bird in the world”, the black-faced honeycreeper of Maui. Read the reviewMoving from the underworld dens of Victorian London to the boudoirs of country house gothic, and hingeing on the seduction of an heiress, Waters’s third novel is a drippingly atmospheric thriller, a smart study of innocence and experience, and a sensuous lesbian love story – with a plot twist to make the reader gasp. Read the reviewIn this modern classic of reportage, Ehrenreich chronicled her attempts to live on the minimum wage in three American states. Working first as a waitress, then a cleaner and a nursing home aide, she still struggled to survive, and the stories of her co-workers are shocking. The US economy as she experienced it is full of routine humiliation, with demands as high as the rewards are low. Two decades on, this still reads like urgent news. Read the reviewWhat if aviator Charles Lindbergh, who once called Hitler “a great man”, had won the US presidency in a landslide victory and signed a treaty with Nazi Germany? Paranoid yet plausible, Roth’s alternative-world novel is only more relevant in the age of Trump. Read the reviewPowerfully intimate and unashamedly domestic, the first in Ferrante’s Neapolitan series established her as a literary sensation. This and the three novels that followed documented the ways misogyny and violence could determine lives, as well as the history of Italy in the late 20th century.When Nigerian author Adichie was growing up, the Biafran war “hovered over everything”. Her sweeping, evocative novel, which won the Orange prize, charts the political and personal struggles of those caught up in the conflict and explores the brutal legacy of colonialism in Africa. Read the reviewThe epic that made Mitchell’s name is a Russian doll of a book, nesting stories within stories and ning centuries and genres with aplomb. From a 19th-century seafarer to a tale from beyond the end of civilisation, via 1970s nuclear intrigue and the testimony of a future clone, these dizzying narratives are delicately interlinked, highlighting the echoes and recurrences of the vast human symphony.Read the reviewSmith began writing her Seasonal Quartet, a still-ongoing experiment in quickfire publishing, against the background of the EU referendum. The resulting “first Brexit novel” isn’t just a snapshot of a newly ided Britain, but a dazzling exploration into love and art, time and dreams, life and death, all done with her customary invention and wit. Read the reviewCoates’s impassioned meditation on what it means to be a black American today made him one of the country’s most important intellectuals and writers. Having grown up the son of a former Black Panther on the violent streets of Baltimore, he has a voice that is challenging but also poetic. Between the World and Me takes the form of a letter to his teenage son, and ranges from the daily reality of racial injustice and police violence to the history of slavery and the civil war: white people, he writes, will never remember “the scale of theft that enriched them”. Read the reviewChildren’s fiction came of age when the final part of Pullman’s His Dark Materials trilogy became the first book for younger readers to win the Whitbread book of the year award. Pullman has brought imaginative fire and storytelling bravado to the weightiest of subjects: religion, free will, totalitarian structures and the human drive to learn, rebel and grow. Here Asriel’s struggle against the Authority reaches its climax, Lyra and Will journey to the Land of the Dead, and Mary investigates the mysterious elementary particles that lend their name to his current trilogy: The Book of Dust. The Hollywood-fuelled commercial success achieved by JK Rowling may have eluded Pullman so far, but his sophisticated reworking of Paradise Lost helped adult readers throw off any embarrassment at enjoying fiction written for children – and publishing has never looked back. Read the reviewSebald died in a car crash in 2001, but his genre-defying mix of fact and fiction, keen sense of the moral weight of history and interleaving of inner and outer journeys have had a huge influence on the contemporary literary landscape. His final work, the typically allusive life story of one man, charts the Jewish disapora and lost 20th century with heartbreaking power. Read the reviewFrom his 1989 Booker winner The Remains of the Day to 2015’s The Buried Giant, Nobel laureate Ishiguro writes profound, puzzling allegories about history, nationalism and the inidual’s place in a world that is always beyond our understanding. His sixth novel, a love triangle set among human clones in an alternative 1990s England, brings exquisite understatement to its exploration of mortality, loss and what it means to be human. Read the reviewThe Belarusian Nobel laureate recorded thousands of hours of testimony from ordinary people to create this oral history of the Soviet Union and its end. Writers, waiters, doctors, soldiers, former Kremlin apparatchiks, gulag survivors: all are given space to tell their stories, share their anger and betrayal, and voice their worries about the transition to capitalism. An unforgettable book, which is both an act of catharsis and a profound demonstration of empathy.Robinson’s meditative, deeply philosophical novel is told through letters written by elderly preacher John Ames in the 1950s to his young son who, when he finally reaches an adulthood his father won’t see, will at least have this posthumous one-sided conversation: “While you read this, I am imperishable, somehow more alive than I have ever been.” This is a book about legacy, a record of a pocket of America that will never return, a reminder of the heartbreaking, ephemeral beauty that can be found in everyday life. As Ames concludes, to his son and himself: “There are a thousand thousand reasons to live this life, every one of them sufficient.” Read the reviewMantel had been publishing for a quarter century before the project that made her a phenomenon, set to be concluded with the third part of the trilogy, The Mirror and the Light, next March. To read her story of the rise of Thomas Cromwell at the Tudor court, detailing the making of a new England and the self-creation of a new kind of man, is to step into the stream of her irresistibly authoritative present tense and find oneself looking out from behind her hero’s eyes. The surface details are sensuously, vividly immediate, the language as fresh as new paint but her exploration of power, fate and fortune is also deeply considered and constantly in dialogue with our own era, as we are shaped and created by the past. In this book we have, as she intended, “a sense of history listening and talking to itself”.Read the review• To order any of these titles go to bookshop or call 0330 333 6846.

Dutch media has called it “organised crime in pinstripe suits” and one of the original German whistleblowers saying he now welcomes Britain’s exit from the EU in the hope it could weaken the influence of London investment banking on European financial institutions.This week, a British former investment banker involved in developing the scheme for the first time gave the public an insight into how the scheme worked and what spurred on its architects.Speaking at a regional court in Bonn, Martin Shields, one of two former bankers on trial for 34 instances of serious tax fraud between 2006 and 2011, painted a picture of a London banking scene which lured in the brightest scientists from the country’s top universities and used them to boost their profit margins – without teaching them about the moral and legal consequences of their actions in return.A cum-ex deal, from the Latin meaning with-without, is a complex set of share transactions with the purpose of getting the state to reimburse a tax that was never paid in the first place.Cum-ex transactions work by trading shares at high speed on or just before the idend record date – the day the company checks its records to identify shareholders – and then claiming two or more refunds for capital gains tax which had in fact only been paid to the state once. Because the payout is automated, the trade can be repeated again and again.Some financial experts have likened the practice to the banking equivalent of parents claiming child benefit for multiple children when they only have one.“This was the environment at that time: a financial industry that – at least as far as I could see – was geared towards maximum profit optimisation,” the 41-year-old told a packed courtroom on Wednesday.“One tool to achieve this goal was tax optimisation: avoiding taxation as far as possible – and taking advantage of any opportunities that could be found or created. This was not the clandestine approach of a few. Rather, I saw it as the clear and openly communicated expectation of most major banks and their customers.”Hailed as a maths prodigy at school, Shields accepted a junior position at Merrill Lynch after studying engineering, economics and management at Oxford University because the trading room floor offered him a thrilling, dynamic environment. He was not alone: of 120 engineers in his year group at university, Shields added, only five went into engineering.Wearing a navy blue suit and the latest Apple Watch 5 with a white strap, Shields on Wednesday used a Powerpoint presentation to talk the court through the “cum-ex ecosystem” of labyrinthine trade chains he helped conceive and control, which prosecutors say cost the German state €450m. A translator tasked with rendering City trader jargon into German legalese was struggling to keep up.The financial rewards were breathtaking: for the five years in which Shields practised cum-ex trades through Gibraltar-based investment vehicle Ballance Capital, his personal income amounted to €12m. In 2010 Shields and his wife managed to purchase a £9.7m mansion on Chelsea’s Egerton Crescent, followed by a €6m Edwardian terrace on Shrewsbury Road, Dublin’s most expensive residential street.While Shields did not respond directly to the charges of serious tax fraud this week, he said in hindsight he had started to feel regret about devising the schemes, which hoovered up money that could have otherwise been spent on building roads, hospitals or nurseries.He told the court: “I often ask myself whether if I had my time again I would do things differently. Knowing what I now know, the answer is obvious. I would not have involved myself in the cum-ex industry.”He had made the “difficult decision” to cooperate with the investigation, which increases his chance of reducing a potential 10-year jail service. Co-accused Nick Diable (39), who worked with Shields for Germany’s fourth largest bank HypoVereinsbank (HVB), will also give a testimony in the trial, which is expected to last until next year.Shields said cum-ex trades were practised on an “industrial scale” in the first decade of the 21st century, and involved a vast network of banks, companies, brokers, lawyers and financial advisers. Even the most basic cum-ex deal involves at least 12 transactions.A spokesman for Deutsche Börse, which was raided in connection with the wider investigation in August, said it was cooperating with the authorities.During Shields’s appearance this week, the back benches of the court were packed with numerous lawyers representing high-profile banks and financial institutions that could be dragged into the scandal if the judge in Bonn rules that cum-ex trades did not merely exploit a legal loophole but violated the law at the time.Three characters mentioned in the testimony were notable by their absence from the court proceedings: Shields’s long-time boss and later business partner Paul Mora, and the renowned German tax lawyer Hanno Berger, who allegedly introduced him to cum-ex methods at HVB. A third man, Dubai-based British citizen Sanjay Shah, is alleged to have copied their methods to defraud the Danish treasury on a vast scale.Until 2015, Mora was a director of the Cinnamon Club, an opulent ​Indian restaurant located in a grade II-listed Victorian building next to the Department for Education and popular with politicians and business people. According to Die Zeit, the restaurant was where cum-ex deals were contrived and later celebrated, and one insider referred to it as the “cum-ex lounge”. Mora has denied wrongdoing, telling New Zealand media that all his trades were “approved by legal experts and undertaken in accordance with advice”.In separate investigations into the same scheme, the justice minister of North-Rhine Westphalia said that Cologne prosecutors are now conducting 56 probes with a total of about 400 suspects related to cum-ex. More than 400 iniduals and companies have been charged in connection with the scheme in Denmark.Estimated losses include an estimated €31.8 bn Germany, at least €17bn for France, €4.5bn in Italy, €1.7bn in Denmark and €201m for Belgium“The Cologne investigations have now reached a point that prosecutors say that cum-ex wasn’t a legal tax-driven trading strategy, but organised white-collar crime of unimaginable magnitude,” the minister said.A prominent German tax official turned tax lawyer whose past clients include the owners of BMW and companies like Adidas, Berger has been described as the mastermind behind the cum-ex scheme and was charged with tax fraud at a court in Wiesbaden last year. Based in Switzerland, he insists all of his dealings were within the law and has not appeared in court so far.A 51-year-old Kiwi with a penchant for rugby and Hawaiian shirts, Mora had a background in tax law before moving into investment banking in the City of London. At HypoVereinsbank and his own investment vehicles Ballance Capital and Arunvill, Mora is alleged to have worked with Berger to construct a vast number of cum-ex trades. Believed to have returned to New Zealand, where he has property investments in Christchurch, Mora has also not appeared in the German courts to far.A British-born son of Indian immigrants from Kenya is the key figure for investigations in Denmark, where prosecutors say he defrauded the treasury to the tune of €1.3bn, mainly through his hedge fund Solo Capital LLP, by copying the system used by Berger. Shah has denied any wrongdoing."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e264a18547854f49ba3e86fa91b4cc7fe7c691b8/0_13_3500_2099/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cdc15cde68253af4002246e4312bbfa4","title":"bankers corbyn tories no deal capitalism radical government","story":"Faced with the Tories’ no-deal extremism and a glaring crisis in capitalism, the financial establishment is losing its fear of a radical Labour governmentBeneath all the noise of Brexit, an unexpected question is being quietly asked in British politics as an election nears. Is a Jeremy Corbyn government actually the safe option? If you’ve been persuaded by the years of warnings from most of the media and countless politicians that such a government would be extreme, chaotic, authoritarian and doomed to failure, you may find this question ridiculous. If you’re still a Corbynista, then the notion of him as a stabilising premier for today’s turbulent Britain may be equally absurd. For many believers, the whole point of Corbynism has been the possibility that it might lead to “the most radical government in British history”, as the leftwing theorist and activist Jeremy Gilbert yearningly put it in 2017.Off the record, other senior people in the City tell me they find the shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, who has been circulating among them busily in recent months, a serious and intriguing figure: a supposed Marxist who looks, and sometimes talks, a bit like a bank manager.A similar thaw is under way in the more thoughtful parts of the business press. With western capitalism having a crisis of confidence, at the very least – this week the Financial Times announced “Capitalism: time for a reset” – Labour’s radical economic alternatives have begun to look more reasonable to some business journalists. The Economist, despite its longstanding support for the Thatcherite free-market reforms that McDonnell would like to reverse, has been covering the development of Labour’s new economic thinking with intense curiosity since 2017. This month, the more cautious, centrist FT has published a succession of long articles about “Labour’s new establishment” and its ambitions for Britain. While the pieces were still spiked with criticisms, the scale of the coverage has suggested a degree of respect – and that corporate Britain needs to understand Corbynism, and be prepared to make some accommodations with it. Why are sections of the establishment being drawn to Corbyn and McDonnell now, having ignored or dismissed them for so long? On the face of it, the shift is all about stopping or moderating Brexit, at any cost. A little less obviously, it’s about the condition of the Conservative government: its snowballing incompetence, its increasingly manic and fantastical policies, its disregard for democracy and the law, its readiness to break up the UK, and its shallow pool of talent after almost a decade in power. (Priti Patel doesn’t seem likely to become one of the great home secretaries.) As Westminster participants and observers used to say, in more consensual times, it’s time for a swing of the pendulum.Since Corbyn became Labour leader, he and McDonnell have worked hard to seem more respectable. During Corbyn’s decades on the backbenches he was a bit of a scruffy ranter but in the Commons these days, with his neat white beard and stern glasses, he often acts more like a veteran school inspector, casting a disapproving eye over the government’s shoddy work. Both he and McDonnell now wear trim suits and ties to most public occasions the contrast with Boris Johnson and Dominic Cummings’ careless dishevelment might make a good election poster.This air of solidity is not a complete illusion. Since Corbyn took over Labour, the Tories and Liberal Democrats have each had three leaders. Meanwhile Labour’s policies – relentlessly dismissed as weird and naive by newspapers that saw no downsides to austerity and Brexit – have in fact often carefully gone with the grain of public opinion: renationalise the railways, raise taxes on the rich, put more police on the streets, avoid fighting foreign wars that lead to terrorism.Potent governments, such as Tony Blair’s or Margaret Thatcher’s, usually have a good understanding of how most voters are thinking and living. Under Corbyn, Labour is at least trying to do the same, by beginning to confront the crises of capitalism and the climate breakdown, and how they affect people’s everyday lives.In less than half a decade, despite never being in power, and only rarely leading in the polls, Corbyn’s Labour has helped crystallise what students of the great Italian leftwing thinker Antonio Gramsci would call a new political common sense: a widespread feeling that free-market capitalism has run its course, public spending needs to rise, and the way we manage society and the economy needs to change. As a keen Gramscian, McDonnell must be delighted.But Labour’s new respectability brings dangers. First, do British voters actually want a sober, reforming government? The polls currently suggest not: since Johnson began his cartoonish premiership, Labour has been consistently behind (though the margins have varied from substantial to tiny, usually according to the pollsters’ different methods).Britain has arguably not had a Labour government with ambitions to profoundly alter the country since Harold Wilson’s first in the 1960s (and his reforming zeal didn’t last long). With Labour so often cautious since, many voters – and political journalists – have become unused to making the effort needed to consider novel and ambitious leftwing policies, such as McDonnell’s plan to change the balance of power in companies permanently by making their workforces into major shareholders. It’s easier just to dismiss such proposals as anti-business, and then get back to gossiping about the latest Tory leadership shambles.Another problem for Labour with trying to play the grownups is that clearing up messes left by Conservative governments can be a thankless task. In 1974, Wilson’s second administration inherited an economic and industrial relations crisis from the disastrous 1970-74 premiership of Edward Heath. Wilson never quite managed to resolve the crisis, and soon his party was blamed for it – so much so that Britain’s struggles during the 1970s have been synonymous with Labour ever since.Corbyn and McDonnell’s smart suits and new ideas will only get them a fair hearing from the establishment for so long. A Corbyn government, if it ever comes, will disrupt the status quo: “Change is coming,” McDonnell warned the FT this month. For the moment, some business figures may prefer a Corbyn government to a Tory one that can’t guarantee the food supply but they may soon decide that an actual reforming Labour government is not such a good idea after all. As Oliver Harvey of Deutsche Bank reassured the , “any market-unfriendly policies instigated during a Labour government” need only be “temporary”. They would apply only “until the government is voted out of office”. And just in case that doesn’t happen quickly enough, the papers read by Britain’s rich are full of articles about how to get your money out of the country. • Andy Beckett is a feature writer for the "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a8071e51da61c9a0ac157fcc94126d0cdf2c846a/0_0_2064_1238/master/2064.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1b4a9e85769a1883ef75171eca13579f","title":"downton abbey film fantasy reality","story":"The American south may seem a long way from the estates of England, but in both places a veil of caprice covers harsh truthsThe son of a Scottish immigrant who worked as a servant, Donald Trump could hardly wait for his banquet at Buckingham Palace. A seat next to Elizabeth II conferred a sense of accomplishment little else could.To many, such behavior from an American president appeared downright unseemly. But how could we scoff? How else have so many of us been eagerly awaiting the return of Downton Abbey?TV and film can be transporting, giving us glimpses of lives we can only imagine imperfectly. Decades before Julian Fellowes’ creation came forth to conquer America, PBS offered a steady diet of British clotted cream. Royals, aristocrats, castles, servants, sex. Such is the stuff of which Downton daydreams are made.We make our own fantasies too. As a boy, watching Gone With the Wind, I saw plantation houses for which I thought I could sell my soul. It seemed such an alluring way of life.No wonder people complain of being lectured about slavery when they visit Savannah or Charleston. They, like me, have imagined themselves in the master’s place. No work to be done, fanned on white-pillared porches, sipping cooling drinks, pondering pleasures to come. Is it surprising so many, confronted by the nightmare behind the reverie, recoil in unacknowledged shame?I came to this crossroads early, no longer able to overlook the anguish of my ancestors. I saw exquisite architecture and ideas of gracious hospitality but knew both to be built on the worst criminality.Fortunately, thanks to green England, I was able to transfer my affections. The Forsyte Saga, Upstairs Downstairs, Brideshead Revisited, The Admirable Crichton. The Shooting Party, The Remains of the Day, Gosford Park. They became my refuge and taught me much. Entranced by an elegant aesthetic, reading countless books, even attending the Attingham Summer School to study famous country houses, I sought an elusive loveliness, untroubled by oppression.I know I never escaped. I had only embraced a new quagmire of contradictory caprice.At the very lightest level, all this means I know that Downton – the whole phenomenon, the TV series, the film, the traveling exhibition, the merchandising – is a ludicrous and ahistorical fancy.I know, for example, that contrary to what we see on Fellowes’ screen, non-royal butlers did not wear white waistcoats and that waiters did not wear dinner jackets at all. I know ladies were never gloved while drinking or eating, candles were never used on a luncheon table and candle shades, now found only in royal residences, were in fact universal. For enthusiasts like me, it’s such esoterica which makes Downton so enjoyable.But as in my love affair with the plantations of the American south, there was a wriggling worm in the bud.How alike our ruling classes are. How nefarious the sources of their vast wealth, on which such beautiful homes were built.In the UK, to take just one example, a house as sublime as Harewood, near Leeds, altered by Robert Adam, was funded by the infamous triangular trade. Even English currency came to be defined by slavery. With abolition by Britain in 1833 came compensation to 46,000 slave owners for 800,000 liberated Africans, until the banks were rescued in 2009 the largest government bailout in history.There were other sources of income. Indian opium, imposed on China. Farms in Ireland. The wealth behind many of the estates of England was no less tainted than that which built plantations in Virginia, Alabama and Georgia.Fellowes was careful to give his great house a more benign foundation. The Earl of Grantham, we are told, derives his affluence straight from his Yorkshire estates.Hit hard by agricultural depressions, he takes an option not available to his tenants: he marries the daughter of an American millionaire. That said millionaire is an untitled Jew, a dry goods merchant from Cincinnati, is among storylines meant to show us what a good egg the earl really is, an unlikely egalitarian in tweeds. But he’s an imprudent one too: by investing his wife’s millions in a Canadian railway that goes bankrupt, Grantham places all his loved ones in peril.Worse occurred in real life, of course. Much worse. Take the brutal, polluting mills and mines, like so many plantation fields, that often lay just outside the gates.Of course, Downton isn’t real. So, to stay in the realm of art, consider Shipley, the neo-Palladian masterpiece DH Lawrence invented for Lady Chatterley’s Lover. There, Squire Leslie Winter talks of the miners who work his pits with all the condescension a planter might have for his slaves.Chatting with the Prince of Wales, Winter quips: “The miners are perhaps not so ornamental as deer, but they are far more profitable.”HRH replies: “If there were coal under Sandringham, I would open a mine on the lawns and think it first-rate landscape gardening. Oh, I am quite willing to exchange roe-deer for colliers, at the price.”In the real world, many fine homes have been lost. Their deaths, like their lives, are all about the money.In Lawrence’s book, the squire dies and his heirs tear down his hall to build semi-detached “villas” for workers. Lady Chatterley is shocked to learn such people are as capable of love as she is. One suspects Fellowes, the author of a novel called Snobs, no less, might feel a similar shock if told us ordinary people who love Downton, his facile but beautiful and seductive creation, are capable of sincere feeling too.We are. And while we are equipped to daydream of such luxury for ourselves, or to pick nits with Fellowes’ staging while we swoon at his stars in their gorgeous firmament, we are also the heirs to those who did all the work, those who built the Downtons and the plantations.We know a profound truth behind all their costly beauty and misery. Every stately home, in every land, belongs to us too."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0ed66154bfd5c7cc978f6158743f0ca6212cfa81/0_27_957_574/master/957.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=969a6e72d12c6d18202ad50c0169d637","title":"historic houses improve wellbeing","story":"With its low gables and sunny verandahs, the empty former cottage hospital of Winsford is a building like no other in the world. The result of a philanthropic dream shared by a rich widow and a leading Victorian architect, in the 119 years since the ailing people of north Devon were first welcomed under its slate roof, the place has aided many a recovery, including shell-shocked soldiers seeking sanctuary from first world war trenches.And soon Winsford, at Halwill Junction near Beaworthy, will be helping people again. The disused hospital, designed by Charles Voysey as a gift from the wealthy Maria Medley to the surrounding rural communities between Dartmoor and the coast, and now being restored by the Landmark Trust, is the latest example of a growing faith in the healing powers of heritage buildings. For in the same way that walks through Britain’s forests are now being prescribed as an effective way to help counteract anxiety and stress, so the conservation trusts and charities of the heritage industry are starting to promote the power of ruins and historic buildings to improve mental wellbeing.“It is a common theme we get back from all our stayers,” said historian Caroline Standford, of Landmark, a charity that rescues, restores and then rents out significant historic buildings. “So many say how much calmer they feel. It is so appropriate that we can use Winsford next year, because it is a place that has such a strong sense of nurturing about it.“It is so much more welcoming than what we think of as a medical centre today. Before Voysey built it, his only cottage hospital, the villagers in the 13 surrounding rural parishes who fell ill had to travel all the way to Exeter or Okehampton.”From next year, not only will a third of the old hospital be restored for continued use as a community health resource, but each year the remainder will be offered out at no cost for selected dates, along with some of the trust’s other buildings, as a place for those in need, including bereaved children, traumatised veterans and carers, to come and recuperate.The scheme, called 50 for Free, has been running for five years and was inspired by the way that visitors to the trust’s buildings commented on how their mood was boosted by a stay in an ancient place, or unusual historic venue, away from the trappings of modern life. Applications for the next charitable visits open next month.English Heritage and Historic England, two of Britain’s other major heritage and conservation charities, are also exploring the therapeutic side of their properties. English Heritage has set up days for people living with mental health problems and on low incomes at Stonehenge, a site it maintains jointly with the National Trust. Human Henge events focus on the site’s strong associations with natural healing and contemplation, much as the Japanese therapy of shinrin-yoku, or forest bathing, is now being prescribed by some doctors treating depression.Historic England has also found that visits to historic towns, ancient places of worship and archaeological sites have the same beneficial effects on blood pressure and general wellbeing as social sporting activity.Research by University College London five years ago was among the first to make the link between heritage sites and mental wellness. It showed that contact with a heritage site, whether as a visitor or a volunteer, frequently improved mood and even promoted a sense of citizenship among isolated and disadvantaged groups.And this weekend, at the culmination of the annual Heritage Open Days week, many of Britain’s local authorities will be encouraging families to visit nearby museums, stately homes and historic sites as a healthy way to break the repetitive pattern of work, shopping and domestic chores.While a period of respite in a beautiful castle or folly would probably benefit anyone, Stanford believes that Winsford, offering a moment “out of time”, with no phone or television, was always destined to be a haven of peace and healing again. Now, as the last nails are hammered in by conservationists, it is a place of restoration in both senses of the word."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a566e13a0e577da0431900841ebdb135bb2c17a2/0_134_2000_1200/master/2000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3d63c1b6a63e69b08c00b134f6b30cc5","title":"nature conservancys global photo contest winners 2019","story":"The global conservation body Nature Conservancy, working in 72 countries to tackle climate change and to conserve lands, waters and oceans, has announced its latest photo winners, selected from more than 100,000 entries"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8e53c2960554d5a8ca117846a0bcc4d341fd2d5d/0_0_4000_2667/master/4000.jpg?width=480\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2a62defafa5c35b866a0f0961f0532e2 480w","title":"high octane glitz for versace as j lo brings the house down","story":"The actor’s appearance in ‘That’ dress from 2000 had the crowd in Milan whoopingOne of the lesser-known aspects of Versace’s brand mythology is its role in the inception of Google Images.The story goes like this. In the year 2000 – as fashion scholars will recall – Jennifer Lopez wore a sheer, low-cut green Versace dress to the Grammys. “The whole world wanted to see that dress,” said Donatella Versace at a press conference in Milan on Friday. And so the world surfed the net – as we used to say – but couldn’t find the picture within the mainly text-based system. And lo, Google Images was born.The gown – inevitably known as ‘That’ Dress – melted the internet again when it appeared on the catwalk at Versace’s springsummer show on Friday. Donatella teased the audience at first, using its print on tote bags, hooded jackets and denim skirt suits, its palm fronds interpreted as crystallised details on pool sliders and appliquéd on shirts.At the end of the show, Jennifer Lopez herself appeared in the dress, in a move that had US Vogue editor-in-chief Anna Wintour beaming and the upstanding, whooping, Instagram-posting fashion crowd proclaiming it even more spectacular than the moment, in 2017, when the designer reunited five supermodels.Even before J-Lo turned up, the show felt cranked up to 11, quite a feat for a brand so seeped in glitz and hedonism. All the biggest Insta supermodels – Bella and Gigi Hadid, Kendal Jenner and Vogue cover star Kaia Gerber – were there. The music pumped while palm tree fronds were projected on to floor-to-ceiling digital screens on the walls.The clothes were larger-than-life, literally, being a millennial take on 80s power dressing. Exaggerated proportions – T-shirts and cardigans with rolled shoulders built in and leg o’mutton sleeves on trench coats and leather dresses – ensured even the most waif-like models took up space as they strode down the catwalk. The Versace-logoed T-shirts and marble dyed tights were social media catnip.It was all strategically choreographed, of course. In September 2018, Versace – until then famously one of the last family businesses standing in fashion – was acquired for $2.1bn by Michael Kors Holdings, which then rebranded to Capri Holdings. With Versace, Michael Kors and luxury shoe label Jimmy Choo under its umbrella, Capri Holdings aims to become the first American luxury conglomerate to rival French behemoths LVMH and Kering. Versace is key to that growth, with the company seeking to double revenues and open 112 more stores by 2022.Versace was one of the brands that signed up to the Fashion Pact, launched at the G7 summit in August, and as such has pledged to achieve zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 and protect and restore natural ecosystems and oceans.The environmental impact of this particular show and collection was, at time of press, unconfirmed by the brand. There had been a lot of talk of tree-planting and carbon offsetting at some of the other shows this fashion month. At this show a tree was actually erected but it was part of the set – a 9-metre-tall gilded statue of a palm, which felt very Versace.You wondered whether some attendants might object to such high-octane glitz on global climate strike day. But with the ultimate feel-good moment of Jennifer Lopez strutting down the catwalk and Donatella Versace beaming beside her such concerns were too easy to forget."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/206d1e07b10f5fca405f8726285bb8b4e713c0d1/0_102_4168_2501/master/4168.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c06f36327d050323ccf9f4a7db11709b","title":"marni ss20 show repurposes waste milan fashion week","story":"Francesco Risso unveils collection as Milan fashion week coincides with Global Climate StrikeThe timing of Milan fashion week coinciding as it does with the Global Climate Strike, is a challenge for an industry that is seen as one of the main culprits in the climate crisis. On the one hand, it puts brands who continue with business as usual into the shade, while on the other it highlights eco-conscious designers.Marni fell into the latter category on Friday at its springsummer 2020 show. Creative director Francesco Risso said after the show that he would not join the hundreds of thousands of people protesting around the world, but that he was striking in his own way.His show proved to be a vehicle for the second part of a collaborative art project that started with his menswear show in June, in which guests sat under a suspended ceiling of plastic bottles that his team had collected. For Friday’s show, the same bottles had been recycled into a set of palm tree leaves by the artist Judith Hopf, with cardboard trunks repurposed from mechanical pulp and old clothing. They were, he said, “pieces we will keep and treasure – they aren’t pieces we are going to waste. I hope they are going to have their own life.”He extended the repurposing idea to the collection itself. Fabric that appeared on 1950s prom dresses looked like taffeta but was actually made from recycled plastic bottles. Other outfits comprised fabric from the archives that the brand will remake in limited editions to be sold.Risso said he was in Brazil when the Amazon rainforest fires started last month, an experience which left him “crying for weeks” and inspiring an energy in him that reminded him of the protest songs of Brazilian musicians Gilberto Gil and Caetano Veloso. “They were so joyous and political and it’s the lure of nature that for us it’s the only possibility to connect with our own tribes.”It accounted for the Fauve-like brushstrokes that resembled the colour palette of a thriving jungle and appeared hand-painted on everything from those dresses to large oversized leather jackets. What the collection had in credentials it somewhat lacked in accessible takeaways. Marni is usually a brand that can be relied upon to deliver tension between eccentricity and everyday clothes, whereas this collection did not balance the scale.Many will see it as problematic for a fashion house to be presenting another new collection of clothes while simultaneously despairing at the state of the environment, but credit should still be given to a brand addressing the issue when so many are not. Risso said: “I don’t like to proclaim myself as doing something sustainable because it’s easy to promote that word and not really be sustainable, but we are starting – this is our joyous process.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/78ed4169ea27b4262b51f0cf3a2e25c22be62f54/0_782_4964_2977/master/4964.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a097192909fb3b89e71879e0726826a8","title":"zandra rhodes interview fashion textile museum","story":"As a show celebrate 50 years of her work, the designer talks about the inspiration of Pucci and the joys of ice-cream and jamZandra Rhodes was born in 1940 in Chatham, Kent, where her mother taught at the local art college and her father drove a taxi. After studying printed textile design at the Royal College of Art, she opened her first fashion shop in London’s Fulham Road in 1967. Her debut collection featured in American Vogue, modelled by the actress Natalie Wood, and she quickly became one of the most fashionable designers of the 70s and 80s, with everyone from Princess Diana to Freddie Mercury wearing her clothes. She continues to be a major influence in fashion, seeing her designs and prints revived by fashion labels such as Valentino, Dior and Fendi in recent years. A retrospective of her work opens later this month at the Fashion and Textile museum in London.What was it like to put together a retrospective of your work?You mean while I’m still alive? Ha. Well, 50 years is a good number to mark. I found it particularly interesting looking at photos of my fashion shows from the 80s. I was the first to do big, dramatic productions and looking back now, I think: “My God, how did I do that?”Fashion exhibitions are very popular now why do you think that is?I haven’t got a clue, but I do think fashion deserves credit. It takes as much effort to create as a painting, but if you’re a textile designer you’re described as doing “decorative” arts. If you’re a painter, it’s “proper” art. I don’t think there’s any difference. There have been some wonderful fashion shows in London. I enjoyed the Azzedine Alaïa at the Design Museum last year – he was a lovely little knitter.One of your dresses is currently on display at the politan Museum of Art in New York in Camp: Notes on Fashion. What do you think of the show?I don’t agree with the Met’s concept of camp. It’s not the word I would use to describe the clothes on display. Most of them are just beautiful – they’re not camp.There’s a lot of debate around gender and the words associated with sex and orientation at the moment. Are you interested in that discussion?It intrigues me, in part because it has a big influence on fashion. How you want to be perceived affects what you wear. Some of my dresses are objectively very feminine, for instance, but who wears them – and how – can change that.You live next door to the Fashion Museum in London. Are they good neighbours?Well, I founded the place in 2003. I started it because I feel British fashion gets forgotten – my work influenced the world so I decided to preserve it. I’m not involved on a daily basis. I help out if they need me. My career is ducking and ing between different projects. I go where the work is, which, at the moment, is Sweden.What’s happening in Sweden?My apartment was recreated at the Formex interiors fair in Stockholm this year as an art exhibition and now Ikea has asked me to work on a homeware line.Your apartment is amazing. The collections of ceramics and stones are beautiful. Are you pleased it’s been seen as art?It feels like art to me. It has floor-to-ceiling windows and it feels like the outside comes inside. And all the colours make me feel very happy.You let students live here, don’t you?Yes if interns don’t have anywhere to live while they work for me they can stay.Most people can’t wait to stop living with students.I love having people around, it’s a nice thing. And I can ignore them if I want to.So you don’t have communal meals?I cook for everyone on Sundays. Just vegetable soup and ice-cream with jam... You should try it. Tesco Basics with a spoonful of posh blackcurrant jam on top. It’s delicious.How did you get into fashion when you were a print student?My mother taught dressmaking and we always had fashion magazines around the house, but it was only when I was at the RCA in the early 60s that I started to think about using my prints on dresses. Emilio Pucci had just become really fashionable – that was a big influence. I got introduced to him when he came to London because everyone thought he’d give me a job, but he didn’t.Was your mother pleased that you went into dressmaking?She died when I was 24, before I got started.That’s a shame.Oh, don’t worry, I’m sure she knows.How has the fashion industry changed since you started?It’s all about big business now and I’ve always been independent. Years ago, I was huge in America but now I have to fight to keep it going. I love my job and I’m happy to fight to do it but it can feel like a struggle. I feel a bit of a has-been.That’s not true – one of the things we’ve talked about is a forthcoming major show of your work at a museum…Well, I’m hardly Mr Gucci with the world at his feet.No, but would you want to be?Actually, I don’t think I would. I don’t think I’d be very good at it either. And I do get to do wonderful projects – the Ikea range has been great and creating prints for the Valentino show last year was wonderful.The title of your show is Fifty Years of Fabulous.

Now my mess-up has made it to the big screenHave you ever wondered who’d play you in a film? I had, occasionally, until the day I got the answer. In spring 2018, a message pinged on to my phone via Facebook from a journalist friend. “So this is a bit weird,” it read. “A sister of a friend is playing you in a movie, apparently. You aware of this?” I wasn’t.“Hanako Footman is playing you in the film Official Secrets. She wants to meet you, like actors do. She saw we were pals and asked if I’d ask you. What did you do in that story?”“That story” concerns British whistleblower Katharine Gun, played by Keira Knightley in a film that premiered at Sundance festival in January. Fluent in Mandarin, the 28-year-old Gun was employed as a translator at GCHQ in Cheltenham. In 2003, she leaked a top-secret memo to the Observer about an illegal spying operation ordered by the US National Security Agency. It intended to bug the phones and emails of six United Nations delegates, from Angola, Cameroon, Chile, Mexico, Guinea and Pakistan – nations that could determine whether the UN approved the invasion of Iraq.The memo, which outraged Gun, ordered staff to increase surveillance operations “particularly directed at… UN Security Council members (minus US and GBR, of course)” to provide real-time intelligence for Bush officials on voting intentions. I was working at the Observer at the time. And, although I was just a bit-player in the story, the film dramatises a monumental mess-up on my behalf – the biggest mistake of my career.It’s 2003. The airwaves are filled with Beyoncé’s Crazy In Love, Justin Timberlake’s Cry Me A River and Hey Ya! by OutKast. Cool young things wear absurdly small clothing – low-slung jeans nicknamed “bumsters”, for obvious reasons thongs crop tops and, most ill-advisedly, “shrugs”, unflattering miniature cardigans. An incredible heatwave sweeps Europe, too, with the mercury hitting 38.5C in Brogdale, Kent.The feverishness of those days extends to geopolitics. Three years earlier, George W Bush narrowly won the 2000 US presidential election after a recount in Florida and a debacle involving hanging chads. In 2001 came the terrorist attacks of 911, propelling al-Qaida and Osama bin Laden into the public consciousness. Britain’s “special relationship” with the US grew ever closer, thanks to the manoeuvrings of the then prime minister, Tony Blair.It was an interesting time for a young journalist with no newspaper experience to be joining the foreign desk of the Observer. Aged 24 and having held only junior positions at women’s magazines, I applied for the role of foreign desk assistant in late 2002. State-schooled in Sussex and with no newspaper contacts, I had a thirst for foreign news. As a teenager, my heroes had been foreign correspondents Kate Adie, Michael Buerk and John Simpson. At university I devoured the works of George Orwell – himself a former Observer journalist – Ernest Hemingway, Martha Gellhorn and Graham Greene, before devoting a year of my degree to the impact of reporting on the Vietnam war. What I offered in keenness must have made up for my lack of experience because, after two interviews, I took a call and was told: “You’ve got the job… if you want it?” Of course I did.Joining was a culture shock. Our working week ran from Tuesday to Saturday, with knocking-off times getting progressively later (9, 10, 11pm) as Sunday approached. Everyone was constantly available on their BlackBerry – the height of tech at the time. The neighbouring Coach \u0026amp Horses pub was our unofficial canteen. My colleagues were impressive: charismatic raconteurs, supremely well-read and worldly wise. I was entrusted with an A4 contacts book – a ringbinder of phone and satellite phone numbers and emails for correspondents all over the globe. Dusty reporters would fly in from assignments in far-flung places, handing over a bundle of disorganised receipts for obscure items: four camels, for instance, “replacements for a herd accidentally hit and killed on a road by driver”.It was intense, collegiate and fun, and I felt privileged to be part of the team – but also out of my depth. My brilliant predecessor had left to make documentaries for Channel 4. I set about looking after flak jackets and foreign currency, visas and travel plans. I called to check in with reporters on high-risk assignments and watched the international news wires for stories. Not long after I started, I was asked to look into flights for a foreign correspondent to go from London to Diyarbakir and then help find a fixer to assist with crossing a border. I didn’t even know which country that was, let alone which border they might be crossing.Towards the end of my second week, I was handed a printout of an email by Martin Bright (then the Observer’s home affairs editor, played in Official Secrets by Matt Smith) and Peter Beaumont (the foreign affairs editor – played by Matthew Goode). Could I type it up and save it into the system? I wasn’t given any other information. Their only instruction: “Don’t make any mistakes.” And so I set to painstakingly typing in each sentence.Importance HIGHTop SecretAllAs you’ve likely heard by now, the Agency is mounting a surge…… We’d appreciate your support in getting the word to your analysts who might have similar, more in-direct access to valuable information from accesses in your product lines.It took about 10 minutes. I double-checked it, sent it through, moved on to my next task.On Sunday morning, I woke up to see the paper’s front-page splash: “Revealed: US dirty tricks to win vote on Iraq war”. Underneath was the memo I’d typed up.Of course, the story – broken by Bright, Beaumont and the inimitable New York correspondent and investigative journalist Ed Vulliamy (played with great aplomb and accuracy in the film by Rhys Ifans) – was huge. But my pride in being a tiny part of the team soon crumbled when, first thing on Monday morning, my phone rang. It was an unknown number and, as Monday was a day off for most of the news team, I didn’t expect it to be the office. It was – I think – Stephen Pritchard, the paper’s readers’ editor. He was very polite, but informed me with deft understatement and a total lack of drama that I had caused “something of an international incident”.Fastidiously typing in the memo, and not knowing what the document was or its origins, I’d changed all the American spelling “mistakes” to British English. “Recognize” became recognise, and “emphasize” emphasise. “Favorable” was amended to favourable. I thought I was being helpful. Instead, it was a disaster.The story that Gun had risked so much to reveal was thrown into doubt. How could this be a leaked US memo, asked websites such as the Drudge Report, when it was all spelled in British English? The wobble caught on. Was it a fake? Some outlets due to report on the Observer’s story cancelled interviews over doubts about the memo’s authenticity. It was decided the readers’ editor should publish a special dispatch to counter the thousands of complaints from readers, many American, calling us “lying limey bastards”, claiming that the story’s authors had fallen victim to a hoax and that the email was part of a campaign of misinformation.Of course, it was not. Despite my “administrative error”, the story still made shockwaves around the world. Some days later, Gun went on to reveal her identity, and her life imploded she lost her job, was arrested and ultimately faced a trial under the Official Secrets Act, which collapsed after the prosecution declined to offer its evidence.Meanwhile, I struggled to make peace with the ramifications of what I’d done. Humiliated, and just a few weeks into my dream job, I rang my former magazine editor and asked for my old job back it had, of course, been filled.By Tuesday morning, there was nothing to do but go in and face the music. I assumed I’d be fired, and sobbed in the office loo before going to my desk. But while I am sure everyone involved was cursing my name – one of the biggest stories of their careers had been plunged into unnecessary doubt – they were outwardly kind and magnanimous. I was summoned to meet Pritchard and Bright to explain what had happened, and while there were a few eye rolls I think they understood why I’d done what I did, being in the dark about the genesis of the document. How the mistake wasn’t spotted by anyone else was also a matter of some consternation.Somehow, I managed to put the disaster behind me. The senior editors forgave me, and I remained on the foreign desk for three years.When, 16 years later, I found out that not only was the story being made into a film, but my mistake had been included, I had some sleepless nights. I met Footman, the young actor who plays me, at a cafe in London early last year with some trepidation. She told me she couldn’t ulge any specifics about the movie. “But is it made clear I wasn’t fired over what happened?” I asked. She was noncommittal, but said I did appear in a later scene. She wanted to talk details: what did I wear back in the day? What colour did I paint my fingernails? How did I get on with my colleagues? What were the foreign correspondents like? “Most of my outfits were probably too casual,” I said. “I was frequently hungover and more than once fell asleep in the canteen.” And how to describe the foreign correspondents? Simultaneously impressive and unpredictable.Around nine months after we met, I was invited to a first-cut screening of the film. I watched as “Nicole” got bawled out by the Observer’s famously sweary then editor, Roger Alton (played by Conleth Hill, Lord Varys in Game Of Thrones) in front of the entire team – thankfully not something that happened in real life. Footman played a blinder as me – albeit a more groomed version.I knew it would be hard to watch my mistake unfold, but when it came, it felt like being punched in the throat. I felt the shame all over again, and sobbed silently into my tissue. Nevertheless, the film is as brilliant as it is important. And while I wouldn’t recommend carrying the burden of a catastrophic fuck-up, as Alton would term it, through one’s career, it did provide a salutary lesson in attention to detail. It was my first serious mistake, and hopefully it will be my last.• Official Secrets is released in the UK on 18 OctoberIf you would like a comment on this piece to be considered for inclusion on Weekend magazine’s letters page in print, please email weekend@the, including your name and address (not for publication)."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e9fa167d0b9c895b93629d06623dfedd911dc134/0_252_6628_3976/master/6628.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=dd9c052d87f4a28ae171c2ae91111a55","title":"dairy farmers turn back clock customers take fresh look at milk","story":"“When the milk price crashed five years ago, we were in a bad way,” says Bryce Cunningham, a third-generation farmer running Mossgiel farm in Ayrshire. “Fifty, sixty years ago, you could make a living on a dairy farm now you’re expected to just survive. So I thought, ‘If we did it the way they did it before, could we survive?’”The farm sits on the land that Robert Burns farmed in the 1700s. “Farming the land that he worked, could we recreate the milk that he drank?”It’s a romantic concept, but Mossgiel farm is part of a wave of dairy farms witnessing a resurgence in demand for the unadulterated, glass-bottled milk of yesteryear, before standardised, plastic-bottled became the norm, and long before plant-based milks hit Instagram.Commercial homogenisation (emulsifying the cream into the milk rather than letting it float naturally on top) began less than a century ago, but it didn’t dominate the market until relatively recently. Today, most milk consumed in the UK is pasteurised, homogenised as well as standardised – which is to say, processed to assure a consistent percentage of fat.There are countless hotly contested theories professing the merits of raw, unpasteurised, unhomegenised milk. Pasteurisation heats milk to destroy potential pathogens but, say raw milk advocates, kills many vitamins and minerals which could be beneficial to health. The homogenisation process – emulsifying the milk to distribute fat molecules evenly so the cream does not rise to the top – also destroys beneficial nutrients.Now, farms such as Mossgiel are opting to raise their cows organically, and not to homogenise their milk. For Cunningham, it’s this approach that brought his family farm out of crippling debt.Geoff Bowles, who runs Ivy House farm in Somerset, which provides Harrods, Fortnum \u0026amp Mason and Selfridges with their unhomogenised, organic milk, cites the high price of the equipment needed as one of the reasons he has never homogenised his milk but, aside from the purported health benefits, he also highlights its practical value.“It will mask the early stages of souring,” he says. “Whereas with non-homogenised milk, the fat coagulates and floats to the top – that’s how you know it’s on its way out.”Mossgiel moved all its packaging over to glass and reusable plastic in January. Last November it produced 8,000 to 9,000 litres a week for 251 customers today that has risen to more than 15,000 litres for 379 customers. Cunningham thinks the packaging is responsible for this increase.The environmental impact of plastic is likely impacting these figures, particular since awareness was raised by David Attenborough in his much-publicised criticism of its catastrophic effect on the world’s oceans in Blue Planet II last year. Vending machines have emerged where customers can fill up their own containers with non-homogenised, organic milk – Mossgiel supplies four in Scotland. Ivy House delivers its milk to coffee shops in churns.Roger Kerr, chief executive of Organic Farmers and Growers and former managing director of the Calon Wen cooperative in Wales, thinks people are becoming more aware of their impact on the environment. “I think some of these changes are happening because of the plastic thing. People are wanting to do something: ‘What can I do, given I’m not going to stop flying to Ibiza, or driving my car?’The move to glass is part of that, as is the rise in doorstep delivery.”In the age of Brexit and cultural uncertainty – like the nursery food that gained popularity during the 2008 recession – old-fashioned milk seems to have become part of Britain’s nostalgia safety-net. Except this time, there’s a positive result for the producers’ efforts: financial, not to mention environmental, gain."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d3e1abe2f0a20f407c5a9dbeb25e1c645274700c/0_121_3628_2177/master/3628.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=692836b3014d73c6a137cc20297890e7","title":"leicester city tottenham premier league match report","story":"Leicester have not been bashful about their lofty ambitions for this season and they certainly have no reason to lower their sights after emerging from this high-class showdown with maximum points. This was a rollicking contest featuring fast and muscular action, an extraordinary goal by Harry Kane, two dramatic interventions by VAR, a terrific equaliser by Ricardo Pereira and, finally, a late strike by James Maddison that can only do Leicester good as they strive to upset the Premier League’s established order again.“We have to be seen as one of those top sides,” said Maddison. “Nobody will want to come to this place when it’s rocking like this. If you look at our performances at Chelsea and Manchester United, we came away shaking our heads in disappointment because we didn’t get what we deserved. We’re showing we’re a big threat now.”Leicester had to dig deep and show a range of qualities – mental, physical and technical – to get the better of a strong Spurs team.Tottenham will feature plenty in the highlights but ultimately left deflated, having let another lead slip on the road. They have not won away in the Premier League since January. But Mauricio Pochettino professed to being satisfied with the performance for most of this match, the turning point coming when Serge Aurier had a goal expunged after a VAR review because Son Heung-min was judged to have been offside by a matter of millimetres in the buildup.Leicester took heart from that reprieve, Pereira equalising two minutes later before Maddison secured all three points.Pochettino did not grumble about the decision, saying he trusted the officials and could not blame their ruling for the defeat even if Leicester got a boost when Aurier’s strike was annulled.Brendan Rodgers said he had held several meetings with his players to stress the importance of staying mindful during any VAR confusion. “VAR is part of the game now,” he said, “so whether it goes for you or against you, just keep your focus.”Pochettino made six changes to the lineup that began Wednesday’s Champions League draw at Olympiakos, with Christian Eriksen demoted to the bench, Dele Alli omitted and Hugo Lloris’s absence on paternity leave meaning Paulo Gazzaniga started in goal.The visitors swarmed over the hosts early on, with Son shooting wide in the third minute after being set up by Erik Lamela.Leicester started giving better than they were getting in a match of fearsome intensity. But then Spurs stole the lead with an amazing breakthrough by Kane. The striker’s 170th goal for his club was unlike any of his others. It originated in a pass by Lamela to Son, who backheeled into the path of Kane. A shunt in the back from the retreating Caglar Söyöncü unbalanced Kane, who was falling as he beat Jonny Evans at the edge of the area. He was practically horizontal as Kasper Schmeichel rushed out to meet him but the striker’s instinct overrode any inclination to claim a penalty and he instead brought down his right leg on the ball in a chopping motion, hitting it in the ground and over the goalkeeper. It was marvellous improvisation.All of which rather sickened Leicester, who had celebrated taking an apparent lead a quarter of an hour earlier, only for their goal to be disallowed by VAR owing to Ayoze Pérez having strayed offside. That was a mighty relief to Gazzaniga, whose failure to hold a shot by Youri Tielemans enabled Pérez to set up Wilfred Ndidi.Spurs went into the break in front but the game remained up for grabs. Tielemans released Jamie Vardy early in the second half, Jan Vertonghen did well to keep up with the striker and get a nick on his shot, enabling Gazzaniga to make a plunging save.Son should have increased Spurs’ lead on the counterattack but fluffed his chance after deft service by Harry Winks.Play continued to hurtle to and fro until Aurier thought he had killed off Leicester with a ferocious strike near the hour. But when VAR ruled Son offside by the width of a nasal hair earlier in the move, Leicester scented a comeback.There could be no quibble with their equaliser. It came from a slick attack, with Maddison and Harvey Barnes involved before Vardy fizzed a low pass from the left to Pereira, who rammed the ball into the net from eight yards.Both teams generated further chances before Maddison collected a pass from Hamza Choudhury and lashed a low shot past Gazzaniga from over 20 yards.“I was very proud of the team,” said Rodgers. “But we’re only six games in, we’re not getting carried away.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3b17b081e774f7c5340c95a19d71163abd225427/0_4_4226_2536/master/4226.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0ba650dc1a7bb56da730e0c5b8d1db90","title":"manchester city watford premier league match report","story":"A rout initiated by David Silva after 52 seconds showed one way Manchester City can negotiate having Aymeric Laporte and John Stones missing because of injury: simply make it 5-0 inside 18 minutes and so nullify any concerns regarding being weakened in central defence.Pep Guardiola’s side will, of course, have tougher challenges than bottom-placed Watford, who are yet to win this season. But when in this imperious mood most teams would struggle to contain the champions of the past two campaigns, who ended with a record league victory under the manager.After Silva’s opener, Sergio Agüero (who has now scored in all opening six league games), Riyad Mahrez, Bernardo Silva and Nicolás Otamendi all placed their name on the scoresheet in a start to the opening half that will be recalled for a while.Following the break Bernardo scored twice more to make it 7-0 and Kevin De Bruyne hit a rocket past Ben Foster near the end, and that made it a 35-3 aggregate to City in their past eight meetings with Watford. So comfortable were the home side that Eric García was handed a Premier League debut after the seventh strike, the 18-year-old in effect the third-choice centre-back behind Otamendi, whom he replaced, and Fernandinho.This had been only the second match of Quique Sánchez Flores’s second Watford tenure. It would be interesting to know what Javi Gracia, sacked despite taking them to the FA Cup final, will think when seeing this scoreline."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/22cb175555bf2c3124716a37bf7a6cf39565795b/0_176_3000_1801/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=36d8943c4839727286566416e6263619","title":"leicester v tottenham premier league live","story":"James Maddison’s delightful late goal settled a brilliant game that included an extraordinary finish from Harry KaneThat’s it for today’s blog.

If you look at our performances at Chelsea and United, we came away shaking our heads in disappointment because we didn’t get what we deserved. We’re showing we’re a big threat now.That was great fun. Harry Kane scored an extraordinary goal to give Spurs the lead. Ricardo Pereira equalised from close range and then James Maddison scored a delightful late winner. He is going places so are Leicester. Peep peep! Leicester move up to second in the table, at least for a couple of hours, after a stirring comeback victory. It was a fine game between two excellent sides, but Leicester just about deserved to win after an excellent second-half performance.90+4 min Leicester look reasonably comfortable, despite the inevitable late pressure from Spurs. 90+3 min Maddison is still out there but he can’t run. That’s a worry, especially if it’s an ankle ligament injury.90+1 min There will be six minutes of added time.90 min The impressive Soyuncu makes a couple of important interceptions, one with his head and one with his left foot. Brendan Rodgers is developing a really fine young side.89 min Maddison is limping heavily. He’s going to continue, though, as Leicester have used all their substitutes.88 min Maddison has a problem with his left ankle. He landed awkwardly while trying to play a through pass, and is receiving treatment.87 min Lucas Moura replaces Ndombele for Spurs. The most exciting young player in England gives Leicester the lead with a superb goal. Choudhury played a short pass to Maddison 25 yards from goal he took two quick touches to set humself up and then belted a low, curling shot that snaked past the ing Gazzaniga and into the corner. That’s a lovely goal.A brilliant goal from James Maddison!84 min Leicester make their last substitution: Youri Tielemans off, Hamza Choudhury on.84 min “Hi Rob,” says Andrew Buddery. “I thought VAR was supposed to eliminate clear and obvious errors, not make them.”83 min Gray is booked straight away for a studs-up lunge on Rose. That could have been a red card. Just before that, Kane shot too close to Schmeichel after a nice Spurs move.82 min Rose’s cross clears everyone in the middle and comes to Aurier beyond the far post. He takes a touch and lashes a low shot that goes well wide of the far post. That was a good chance.80 min “Of all the valid complaints against VAR, offsides isn’t one of them,” says Mary Waltz. “He. Was. Offside. Yes, by less than an inch.”But how does VAR judge when the ball is played? The split-second between the ball touching the foot and then leaving it makes all the difference. I’d like to see how that works before I trust it on such tight decisions.79 min Erik Lamela is replaced by Christian Eriksen.79 min Son quickens the pace, skinning Tielemans and hitting a dangerous cross that is palmed away by Schmeichel. Evans completes the clearance. Moments later, Kane misses with an attempted overhead kick.77 min The Leicester fans are making a fair old noise. It does feel like the kind of game that will have a late winner, although I’m not sure who will get it.74 min “The Son offside call on VAR,” says Sandile Xaso. “This cannot be our sport, this cannot be right.”You’re right: it’s not right, and it’s not our sport any more.73 min Leicester are pushing for a winner. Maddison threads a nice pass down the inside-right channel to Vardy, who bullets a rising drive just past the angle of post and bar. I think Gazzaniga had it covered.Yep, this one counts. The move was started by Barnes, who found Vardy on the left side of the penalty area. His cross deflected off Alderweireld and fell perfectly for Ricardo, whose close-range shot hit the sliding Rose and beat Gazzaniga.67 min A substitution apiece: Praet for Perez, Wanyama for Sissoko.VAR has decided that Son was 0.0000001 centimetres offside in the build-up.Leicester will feel they’ve been mugged. Soyuncu made a fine tackle on Son in the box, but Kane picked up the loose ball and found Aurier in space on the edge of the area. He controlled the ball and lashed a shot that took a slight deflection before spinning past Schmeichel.A goal was coming - but it’s Spurs who have scored it!63 min It feels like a Leicester goal is coming, and Chilwell wins another corner on the left.62 min Barnes shifts the ball to the side of Aurier and hammers a low cross that flashes right across the face of goal.60 min Barnes heads wide from eight yards. It was a difficult chance, because Ricardo’s lofted cross had no pace on it at all. But the build-up play was lovely, particularly Maddison’s control in a phonebox as he pulled down Perez’s pass from the right.58 min: Son misses an excellent chance! Spurs broke from the Leicester corner and should probably have gone 2-0 ahead. Winks, on the left, played an angled through pass to find Son in the area, but he dragged a left-footed shot wide of the far post.57 min: Good save from Gazzaniga! Tielemans slipped a through pass to Vardy, who surged into the area and hit a left-footed shot across goal. The sliding Vertonghen took some of the heat out of the shot, having done brilliantly to stay with Vardy, and Gazzaniga ed to his left to push it away. Rose completed the job by putting the loose ball behind for a corner.56 min Here’s Ian Copestake. “As a chant in response to Leicester fans’ implying ref bias, I am not sure if ‘Paul Tierney’s done really well, in very difficult circumstances’ will scan.”I can add a few effs and cees if you think it will help.55 min Son finds Lamela in a bit of space on the edge of the D. He takes a touch and then, as defenders converge, whips a shot over the bar.53 min Maddison’s corner is headed away by Lamela.52 min Tielemans wins a corner after a nice run down the inside-left channel. Leicester look much sharper than they did towards the end of the first half.50 min Leicester have started the second half really well. After a nice move down the left, Chilwell’s early cross is just too far in front of Vardy.46 min Barnes beats Aurier on the left of the area and hits a shot that is headed away by Alderweireld. Ndidi’s follow-up dribbles wide.46 min Peep peep! Leicester begin the second half.“Was the VAR decision correct?” says Liam. “They looked at the moment when the shot was struck but if you watch it again none of the Leicester strikers followed the shot they ran back to get onside and then ran in. If this is correct will a goal scored by a keeper be disallowed because a striker near the halfway line was offside?”Yeah, it was the correct decision. Perez had an advantage by being in an offside position, because he was able to get to the loose ball before the Leicester defenders. Thus it counts as the same phase of play. At least I think that’s the logic. To be honest, I’ve given up trying to understand how football works in a post-VAR world.“Some half-time thoughts on Spurs: while the pundits want to declare the Pochettino project in decline, as a fan I see them as trying to maintain a high level whilst navigating a transition,” says Matthew Carpenter-Arevalo. “The thinness of the squad showed cracks as they made their turn at the end of last season. Now, almost the entire defence and some of the midfield (SissokoEriksen) needs to be replaced in the short and mid-term. Despite all this, when they’re trailing in a game you can never count them out of the game. That resilience is probably Poch’s biggest achievement and hopefully will transcend even his time with the club.”Is the squad that thin? I think the problem – in terms of catching City and Liverpool – is the first XI rather than the back-up. They’re still the third best team in England, though, which is only a slight decline from 2015-17.Peep peep! Spurs lead through a unique goal from Harry Kane. See you in 10 minutes for the second half!43 min “Lamela’s got that no-look look on,” says Jeremy Dresner. “A very fun player to watch when he is passing like this.”That he is. I love the way he hugs the ball on his left foot.41 min Lamela, who has had so much space between the centre-backs and Ndidi, surges forward and finds Kane on the right of the box. His left-footed shot is surprisingly tame and Schmeichel makes an easy save.39 min Perez, found by Tielemans, thrashes a shot towards the near post that is beaten around the post by Gazzaniga.37 min “Lightning quick beautiful goal,” says Mary Waltz. “How did Kane do that?!!”Instinct, the footballer’s best friend.33 min Ricardo Pereira shoots a few yards wide from distance. Gazzaniga had it covered.31 min Lamela finds Kane, who drags a low shot well wide from the edge of the area. That goal, though. It reminded me a little bit of Gianluca Vialli’s incredible sliding header against Bari in 1991-92.What a stunning piece of improvisation. Son, found by Lamela, moved to the edge of the area and backheeled the ball into the path of the onrushing Kane. He was bumped by Soyuncu, which meant he was off balance as he dragged the ball past the last man Evans. By the time Kane was in a position to shoot he was in the process of falling flat on his face. Yet he still had the awareness and ability to chop down on the ball, stunning it into the ground so that it bounced over Schmeichel’s shoulder and into the net. That’s an astonishing goal."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bf5edafaa8d594092f83279f973b0c8c358869ef/0_245_4012_2408/master/4012.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1cdabc2eb55b3b16fccce5f533465fe8","title":"manchester city v watford premier league and more clockwatch live","story":"Bernardo Silva got a hat-trick as Manchester City destroyed bottom club Watford, while Everton slumped to a home defeatOK, that concludes the clockwatch for today. We almost saw history together. Thanks for reading. Paul Wilson was at Goodison Park. Ben Fisher was at Ashton Gate. Report on Burnley 2-0 Norwich. Bernardo Silva, the hat-trick hero speaks to the BBC: It was a great performance, 8-0 says everything. It’s very good to get the three points after defeat at Norwich and I’m very happy with my first hat-trick of my career. My first match ball at home. All teams have good and bad moments, the way you react to the bad is the most important thing. Once again this team showed we want to fight for the Premier League and all the titles.Those Manchester City 8-0 Watford stats in full. Watford goalkeeper Ben Foster has bravely fronted up to speak to Sky Sports.It’s probably a bit of shock, embarrassment. I think we let ourselves down today and the fans a bit. The fans were giving it everything, all they’ve got, unfortunately we on the pitch didn’t give it all we have got.As a keeper coming to City and Liverpool, if you let five in in 20 minutes you fear the worst, you think cricket scores. They are without doubt the best team I have ever played against. We were poor, didn’t lay a glove on them but at times it was breathtaking watching them.You come away to City and I’m not joking, you come here and think if you keep it to two or three - they are so good. Them and Liverpool are a different level.We didn’t do our job today. We have to take some positives but that’s football. You have to clean yourselves up, move onto the next one.We have a few experienced lads but you have to keep smiling. I have just let eight in. I’m not happy but it is what it is. There is no point in dwelling, get ready for the next game and get ready.Brad Wilson on Everton: “Dismal. Lack of, well, everything. Sam Allardyce did better.” It hardly needs saying that Watford stayed bottom of the Premier League but Everton in 14th is a tale of woe and will lead to a week of speculation over Marco Silva.A mention for Southend United, who got a first win of the season in winning 1-0 at MK Dons. They had to hang on after Charlie Kelman’s fourth-minute goal. Here’s Jamie Jackson’s report from the Etihad. News from Germany: Bayern Munich beat FC Cologne 4-0, with Robert Lewandowski scoring twice and then letting Philippe Coutinho take a penalty to score a first goal for Bayern. They are top of the table after Freibug could only draw 1-1 with Augsburg. David Hindle protests too much: “This isn’t sour grapes, but surely the problem is losing last week, 3-2 to Norwich? 9-0 or 10-0 this week won’t make that go away. And Liverpool might well edge the match tomorrow by the odd goal. And still be 5 points ahead. That’s without even mentioning Champions League QF’s.”Norwich undone by Dycheball, muscled out of it and very disappointing while Burnley were excellent. A big day for Chris Wilder and Phil Jagielka, potential doomsday for Marco Silva. That’s it. A record win for City, a record loss for Watford and still, it could have been more. Disaster for Bolton, as Sunderland equalise through a penalty from Aiden McGeady. Another 1-1 for Sunderland, then, and a fairytale denied. “Come on City,” sing their fans. They want nine, they want nine. Swansea down to ten men at Bristol City after Jake Bidwell has been dismissed. They might fancy hanging on for that 0-0 now.De Bruyne almost makes it nine for Manchester City after a solo run, and nine looked on as he gave Ben Foster the eyes and then missed the target. The Belgian has been the architect of this slaughter. There is just a minute left of normal time left. Pablo Miguez says: “I remember a few years ago two Barcelona players got balls for scoring a hat-trick in the same match. Imho, the losing goalkeeper should get one too, as a consolation, since he could not get close to the ball during the match obviously...”A right-foot smasher into the roof of the net and City have their record number of goals in a Premier League match.Can you be accused of bottling it when you fail to win 10-0? Go on, then, yes you can. Manchester City’s next game? Everton, so perhaps they can attempt to score ten against them. Barry Bryan: “Agree that if we’re going to have VAR, it should be limited like cricket. But I think 3 is far too many. You’d virtually guarantee every goal gets reviewed (I mean, in normal matches). One per half? One per game?”What did we talk about before VAR?A defensive shambles as Mousset sashays through some awful defending. Boooo! Oh dear, Marco. There are 14 minutes left for Manchester City to either level or surpass that record 9-0 margin of victory from Manchester United. Ben Foster in the Craig Forrest role? Phil Jagielka, on as a sub and sat in front of the Sheffield United defence in midfield, has been outstanding at an ever more insurrectional Goodison Park. Burnley have been denied what looked a certain penalty when Ashley Barnes was on the receiving end in the Norwich box. They still lead 2-0. Championship: Swansea and Bristol City still deadlocked, as are Stoke and Brentford, while Nottingham Forest are well set, leading Barnsley 1-0 and set to climb up for fourth. “Serious question here,” asks Jeremy Dresner.” If more than two hatricks are scored who gets the match ball? How is it decided? Do they both get one? Asking for a sky blue team.” Must be a Coventry fan. Maybe look back to Paul Stewart, David White and Tony Adcock and the 10-1 v Huddersfield in 1987.“This Evertonian would have started Iwobi and used just 1 holding midfielder, especially at home,” says Brad Wilson. “Silva’s tactics seem senseless and then he winds up panicking. Not a productive combination.” Riyad Mahrez hits the bar with a header from an Angelino cross. City now wasteful? There’s the not unfamiliar sound of boos coming from the Goodison not-so faithful. A loss to Sheffield United would be a severe blow to Marco Silva’s cachet and he seems powerless to change matters."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8f9b1395008049b68954b7f0db04ab28a919c1d6/0_136_1997_1198/master/1997.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5e0e00941d632389d7d2969a5fd1da55","title":"newcastle v brighton premier league live","story":"4 min A confident start from Brighton, who have had most of the possession so far. 1 min Peep peep!

At last year’s race, The Cliffsofmoher was euthanised on the track after fracturing his shoulder.The Coalition for the Protection of Racehorses had run a social media campaign to ask Swift to say #NupToTheCup.“Taylor Swift has put money before compassion by agreeing to perform at the 2019 Melbourne Cup,” the group posted online after the announcement Swift would appear.“Horses are being killed for gambling profits and entertainment. If Taylor Swift cares at all about other animals the way she appears to care about cats, she will cancel her show and make a strong statement that animal abuse is unacceptable.”On Saturday, music booking agency Mushroom Events said the change was due to scheduling issues with Swift’s world tour.“Regrettably, Taylor is no longer able to make it to this year’s Melbourne Cup,” said spokesman Michael Gudinski. “Changes to her Asian promo schedule have made it logistically impossible for her to be here.”Wilson said it was “disappointing for everyone”.Swift had initially been slated to perform two tracks from her new album, Lover, which is Australia’s highest-selling album of the year so far."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6c71c0ed93baaabd6dd5c721a337425890aca95b/0_323_4928_2957/master/4928.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=aeb7ce9e94dc20ba082b3bc74272fb83","title":"revoke and remain inside lib dem conference podcast","story":"With a new leader in Jo Swinson and the defection of six MPs to the party, Lib Dems are hoping for a resurgence.

His daughter Nancy is on the line. She wants to know if he will be free to come and see her awarded a school prize. “I’ll be there, darling,” he assures her. “I’ve almost finished all these hideous interviews.”For the past week, and for the first time in more than three years, Cameron has barely been off the airwaves or out of the media. The hideous interviews have come thick and fast. Some of the headlines they have made have been calculated, like the settling of scores with Boris Johnson and Michael Gove over Brexit. Others have been inadvertent, like the revelation that Cameron lobbied for the Queen to “raise an eyebrow” about the Scottish independence campaign during the referendum in 2014.At his launch party on Tuesday, the former prime minister joked that there were two hardback bestsellers being published this month. “One’s a book about a riven society and a dangerous dictatorship,” he told guests. “And the other’s by Margaret Atwood.” His own book, it is clear from our interview, has a wider purpose. Three years after his premiership collapsed in the wake of the vote to leave the EU, Cameron is trying to regain the right to be heard, above all on Brexit and on the referendum that swept him from office.“I totally understand that there will be some people I will never convince, who will say you should never have had it,” Cameron says of the 2016 vote. He knows that millions of remain voters blame him viscerally for everything that has happened since then and probably always will. “But I think there are a lot of people who can also see that there was a growing inevitability about having a referendum and, yes, there was a problem in the Tory party, but the relationship with the EU was a far bigger one. Britain’s position was becoming more tenuous, and we had to fix it. I hope that I can convince people that it was an honest and thought through attempt to deal with the issue.”This is the nub of the case that weaves its way right through the 700 pages of Cameron’s memoir and through much of what he has said in interviews this week. The UK’s relationship with the EU was always both necessary and contingent, he argues. Until now, every prime minister for the last 40 years has simultaneously wanted a seat at the top table and a special deal for Britain. Every one of them, even Tony Blair, felt they had to fight off moves to political union. “These weren’t pretend ghouls and ghosts,” Cameron says. “They were real.” It’s a useful reminder that Cameron, so often dismissed as an insouciant optimist, is at heart a very practical politician.He is insistent that British ambivalence has origins that long predate the migration crisis or the rise of Nigel Farage. Cameron traces the roots back to Margaret Thatcher’s support for the EU single market in the 1980s. “The single market was both the best thing and the worst thing for Conservatives. We created it. But then we didn’t like the legislation that was needed to make it work.”“The EU is a law-based organisation that doesn’t like exceptions,” he continues. “The differing speeds issue had to be addressed, especially with the eurozone.” Cameron thinks the balancing act would have had to continue even if remain had won in 2016. He quotes the downbeat assessment of an anonymous official (surely the Bank of England deputy governor, Jon Cunliffe) telling him “it would have kept us in the EU for another 10 years”.“My biggest regret”, he says, is that he let expectations about his 2015-16 renegotiation get too high. “I should have made it clear that some of the things my colleagues were arguing for were not available – picking and choosing which laws to obey, radical cuts in the budget, some sort of country club membership. These things are not possible.” He thinks there was more substance to the renegotiation deal he brought back from Brussels in February 2016 than is now acknowledged. The concessions he achieved were “a big deal for the EU. They hated it.”Some of that defiant confidence drains away when Cameron talks about the referendum process itself. He thought “a lot” about writing a enhanced majority threshold into the referendum legislation, but it never happened. “I agonise about that one.” He thought the Electoral Commission “got it wrong” by insisting the choice on the ballot was between remain and leave, not yes (Cameron wanted a yes-to-Europe campaign) and no. He had always thought June 2016 would be the optimum date. Now he is not so sure. “We lost the vote so it’s worth asking the question.” He is scathing about Labour’s role in the campaign under Jeremy Corbyn. “They were awol.”Cameron’s own stance on Europe has not changed three years on. “I’m a remainer,” he says, without equivocation. And it is as a remainer, albeit a pragmatic one, that he has watched events unfold – and now unravel – since he walked away in July 2016.He says supportive things about Theresa May. “She was definitely a moderniser.” But his disagreement with her Brexit strategy is barely concealed. He approves of the fact that “she got a deal”. He “shares her frustration” that it was then voted down by “the people who most wanted Brexit”. But, crucially, he says that “picking one of the existing models, a Norway-style model, would have been a safer and more secure way to deliver Brexit while safeguarding the economy.”And he is critical of her failure to adapt her strategy after the 2017 election. “If you think about it like that, then the red lines, the election result and not reaching out more until too late to other support have had an impact. You need Labour support for a partnership Brexit. If you go back to the beginning, to 2016 and particularly after 2017, you might have been able to get more buy-in. The government went in a different direction, with the red lines and all the rest of it.”And, now, today, under the very different leadership of Boris Johnson? Cameron’s answer may surprise many, since he admits he is open to a second referendum if Johnson fails to make a deal. “I think it is more difficult now. Logically, where we are is either Boris gets his deal and brings it back and passes it, or there are three options: you can find another deal, you can have a general election, or you can have a second referendum.

Sorry your browser does not support audio - but you can download here and listen https:audio.guim20190919-69059-20190920_TIFDCAm.mp3 Cameron’s memoir ranges wide across many issues. He remakes the case for his Tory party modernisation project during the opposition years from 2005 and for the Conservative-Lib Dem coalition’s austerity programme after 2010. Though he admits that “some of the early speeches were a bit ‘Hello birds. Hello trees.’” he is convinced that his 11-year leadership has been hardwired into “a modern compassionate Conservative party”. The book also contains some very good anecdotes about everything from Brussels summits to visiting Balmoral. Many who read the pages on the death of his son Ivan in 2009 will be moved to tears.In the end, though, everything in Cameron’s story always comes back to Brexit. “It is very difficult to try to put Brexit to one side because it’s so massive,” he admits. But he sticks to his fundamental argument about his defining legacy. “It wasn’t some cranky view that there would have to be a referendum. The idea that this was just a Tory party drama, a Tory obsession, is not correct. Yes, it was a particularly big problem for the Conservative party and the pressure was growing and growing.

We would have to consider it seriously. We would,” Thornberry said.And the Islington South MP struck a markedly different tone to Jeremy Corbyn when she warned the Labour leader that it “wouldn’t be right” for the party to remain neutral in a second Brexit referendum.Speaking after an article by Corbyn in the  appeared to suggest that the Labour leader would not campaign on either side in a new vote, the shadow foreign secretary said: “It’s a really, really big decision that the country has to make.“I think it wouldn’t be right for Labour to have no opinion on such a big decision. I just don’t think it is.”Writing in the  earlier this week, Corbyn said a Labour government would seek a “sensible” Brexit deal, and then “put that to a public vote alongside remain”, adding: “I will pledge to carry out whatever the people decide, as a Labour prime minister.”But Thornberry, who will speak at a People’s Vote rally in Brighton on Saturday, said that Labour should make clear at the outset, and before any general election, that it would recommend that voters supported remaining in the EU.“I think we should have three parts to our policy: we have a referendum, remain’s on the ballot paper and Labour should campaign for remain,” she said.Late on Friday John McDonnell poured cold water on the suggestion that Labour could back a Johnson deal in return for a referendum, saying he did not believe the prime minister would come back with anything the party could seriously consider getting behind.“Everyone is saying let’s see what comes back. All the Tory media seem to be interested in is the Irish backstop, but there’s a whole range of other stuff we wouldn’t touch with a bargepole,” the shadow chancellor told the Daily Mirror.Thornberry’s intervention came as senior Corbyn loyalists try to head off a confrontation over Brexit in Brighton.The shadow home secretary, Diane Abbott, who was among those encouraging the Labour leader to embrace the idea of a referendum earlier this year, said his current position was now one all party members should be able to support.“I do think there is an element, in Westminster, of people pursuing a remain argument because they want to undermine Jeremy,” she said. “And the thing is, whatever Jeremy does is not enough.“At one point they were all saying, ‘Jeremy’s got to come out for a people’s vote.’ Well Jeremy’s come out for a people’s vote. He’s saying – and he’s very clear on this – it’s got to go back to the people. But all these people who were calling for a people’s vote, they’re not saying, ‘Oh that’s good.’ They’ve got some other impossibilist demand.”She urged activists to focus instead on other issues in Brighton, including tackling the climate crisis and liberalising immigration policy, which she believes is more of a motivating factor for many younger voters than Brexit.Labour’s Brexit policy has shifted significantly in a series of stages since last year’s party conference passed a motion saying a referendum must be among the options “on the table”.More than 90 constituency Labour parties have submitted Brexit motions this year, with the majority demanding a remain position.Their views will be hammered out into one or more “composite motions”, to be debated on Monday, and the party’s national executive committee (NEC) could also table its own Brexit policy statement.Some anti-Brexit Labour activists are wary of sparking a direct conflict with the party leadership. But Thornberry warned that unless it took a clear stance, Labour risked losing voters on both sides of the Brexit ide.She added: “I think that a lot of the leave voters are already extremely ambivalent about the Labour party. What we don’t want to do is lose people on both sides.“It is like, if you walk in the middle of the road and a car’s coming towards you, you have to decide which side you’re going to jump.”Thornberry is backed by remain-supporting shadow cabinet members, including Tom Watson, in entertaining the idea of supporting a Johnson deal on condition it is put to the public.A similar plan was proposed by the Labour MPs Peter Kyle and Phil Wilson as Theresa May tried to win MPs’ backing for her Brexit deal – and its proponents believe they could potentially win a majority, with the support of the 21 former Conservatives expelled by Johnson.Watson said: “Emily is right to try to find an understanding with others that allows the people to decide on whether a government deal is credible. We should all be looking for solutions to end years of parliamentary deadlock.”However, other shadow cabinet members remain deeply sceptical. Abbott said: “I don’t think we should be supporting a bad deal, just because it’s got a referendum attached. That’s why I was against Kyle-Wilson.“Either it’s a good deal, which says something about the customs union, and alignment with the single market – or it’s not. The referendum is not an end in itself.”“Kyle-Wilson has resurfaced, and it was a bad idea the first time around, and I don’t support it,” she added.Unlike Thornberry, Abbott also believes it would be legitimate for Corbyn to take a back seat during a future referendum.“If Jeremy is going to be a prime minister for the whole country, it is difficult for him to take a position which is contrary to 17 million voters,” she said.Thornberry was scathing about Johnson, whom she shadowed during his time as foreign secretary – the one cabinet role he held before becoming prime minister in July.“He doesn’t have any grasp of detail so the way to beat him was to be a girly swot,” she said, pointedly using the same phrase Johnson applied to his predecessor David Cameron, in a leaked memo.She said such language, together with Johnson’s taunting of Corbyn as a “big girl’s blouse”, was indicative of the prime minister’s attitude to women.“I think it’s deeply ingrained, the way that he talks about women. I think he has a contempt for women,” she said.She believes Johnson’s tough-guy rhetoric, including comparing himself to the Incredible Hulk, will not endear him to female voters.“I think they see him as a buffoon and somebody who doesn’t understand people, but also doesn’t care about the things that lots of women care about,” she said.“I just don’t think women want to be governed by the Hulk. They don’t.”And she argued that Johnson – with the aid of his key adviser, Dominic Cummings – was deliberately styling himself as a political “strongman” in the mould of Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin.“We have all these strong men in politics – whether it’s Brazil, or the Philippines, or Trump, or Putin. They’re all big men: it’s let’s look up to them, don’t be afraid, they’re looking after things. It’s so fundamentally anti-democratic. And Boris seems to be modelling himself on that.”In his Mirror interview, McDonnell also said that should Labour succeed in defeating Johnson in an election but fail to win a parliamentary majority it would not enter a coalition.“We’ll not do it with any of them,” he said. “We’ll go in, we’ll get a majority government, if we don’t get a majority government we’ll go in as a minority party government. We’ll implement the manifesto. If any of those minor parties refuse to support us we’ll go back to the people.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/84c3953eaa9f31d65d8f43f237e558b3928a5de3/0_192_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3b78e3ee22caa3430f8aa6c22aae2b88","title":"party houses neighbours revolt","story":"Everyone loves a good party, apart from the neighbours. The rise of dedicated party houses, from Edinburgh to Sandbanks, is being met with a growing backlash and now MPs and influential residents’ groups are calling for ministers to step in.A large and apparently growing number of ordinary residential houses are being let out for one-off events – often stag or hen parties, or big birthday celebrations – using platforms such as Airbnb and HomeAway.MPs in popular tourist towns are fielding more and more angry complaints from residents in otherwise quiet neighbourhoods who report loud music and raucous behaviour every weekend. Now Caroline Lucas, the Brighton Pavilion MP, and Wera Hobhouse, who represents Bath, are calling for a registration scheme where owners must log their property so that local authorities can ensure they meet safety standards or be shut down for flagrant breaches.“People who live in crowded towns and cities have to tolerate the occasional noisy party at a neighbouring house. But it’s completely unreasonable to expect people to put up with this every weekend,” Lucas said. “We need better regulation, including requiring planning consent for anyone changing property use from a home to a short-term let.”Hobhouse said currently local authorities have far too limited powers to deal with any noise and disturbance issues that neighbours have who live next to a party house. Airbnb has transformed the DIY holiday market, with an estimated 80,000 short-term lets in London alone. But the growth in unregulated holiday lets has brought with it challenges. A survey of popular hen and stag destinations by the Observer indicates there are hundreds of potential party houses available through Airbnb and HomeAway. A total of 160 properties are advertised in Brighton as being suitable for 12 or more people, with 122 in Liverpool, 120 in Manchester and 76 in Edinburgh.While these properties may also be used by quieter groups, such as families or for corporate training, some owners, or hosts as Airbnb terms them, are explicit about the party options. The “Princes Street Party Palace” in Edinburgh advertises beds for 22 people, as does the “Hen Party Palace Group Townhouse”, where one guest mentioned that a problem with the heating was resolved with “large amounts of alcohol as an apology”.Others are more circumspect. David Morley has put up with a party house in Sandbanks, Poole, since June, but its listing suggests no loud music after 10pm. He says the parties go on much later, and claims the owner and Airbnb have not taken notice of complaints.“It’s basically turned what is an ordinary residential house into a commercial party house,” said Morley, who runs the 500-strong Sandbanks community group. He is calling for compulsory registration, a new planning-use category, and a maximum density for short-term lets, similar to the powers that allow councils to limit the number of house in multiple occupation (HMO) properties. Airbnb commented: “Inappropriate, illegal or disruptive behaviour has no place on our platform.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6f86d634297e6085c75dd500d1e5743793a4c935/0_249_5321_3193/master/5321.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=218a4282bf00bed494e6f038157a4c28","title":"rugby world cup fans previews predictions japan","story":"South Africa are confident. Scotland are hard to predict. Wales have high hopes. And Uruguay just want to win a gameWe hope to win it, but is that realistic? We will be competitive and we will trouble top teams, may even upset one if it all comes magically together. We have a decent draw if we can beat Wales. If we top our pool, we play France or Argentina in the quarter-finals and will be too strong for them. That gives us a semi-final, most probably against South Africa or New Zealand, maybe Ireland, at which time our tournament will end. If we are very lucky and face Ireland – who are a much more settled team but have shown some weaknesses recently – we might make a final. But I very much doubt it.We have a decent pack and lineout, but our No 6 is not a No 6. Michael Cheika will unbalance the pack and play the Michael Hooper and David Pockock combo, which does not work. Our bench players does not give us depth. We have brought an out-of-form and ageing Ashley Cooper instead of some of our best performers. One full-back can’t catch high balls and the other has no pace. At least one winger has no pace. And, crucially for a World Cup, we don’t have a consistent goal kicker. Still ... we can come together once in a while. Aiden Smith•\u0026nbspFixtures, tables and results• Top try and points scorers•\u0026nbspSign up to The Breakdown, our free rugby union email newsletterThe “glory days” of the 1990s, when Canada could be competitive against all but the very big boys, are long gone and there is a widespread acceptance that the standard of rugby here has slipped and with it a huge opportunity has gone. Couple that with being placed in a “pool of death” and expectations among Canadian rugby fans are very low. The Namibia game represents our final. If we win that and put up a creditable performance against Italy, most fans will be satisfied. Tim YobiloEngland are not favourites but we are one of the main contenders. This World Cup is one of the most open, so I expect to see a lot of surprises and new heroes emerging from all countries. Hopefully England can win it all!||Here in Greece the faithful few are organising ourselves to see the games where we can, all together, even though we support different countries! I personally, due to my Newcastle heritage, want to see Mark Wilson continuing his good performances, making the North proud. Anthony KiousopoulosI fear an elimination at the pool stage, especially taking into account recent results. Argentina are a strong team and England are above us by far. Although, if we beat Argentina, we could reach the semi-finals. Wales or Australia in the quarter-finals are both winnable games. The good thing is that for the first time in years, the French have had time to work as a unit, particularly on tactics. The enhanced management team also changed the defence, which worked well during warm-up games.It might be too early for some of the brand new players such as Romain Ntamack, Demba Bamba and Peato Mauvaka, but the exceptional gifts of some of the young guns like Antoine Dupont, Damian Penaud and Grégory Alldritt mixed with the rebirth of some old guns like Maxime Médard and Louis Picamoles could bring some good results. The problem is that the team isn’t rock-solid and it has some weaknesses better teams can exploit. Arnoud XavierSadly this year will almost certainly be a huge comedown for the Lelos after the highs of automatic qualification in 2015. After taking that step four years ago, the aim should be to, at least, finish third in the group again. However, Georgia were dealt a horrible hand in the draw, which could not have been worse.Georgia could have had the USA, Russia or Namibia as fourth seeds, which would almost certainly have guaranteed third place. Despite the poor build up, there would have perhaps been talk of “targeting” one of Australia or Wales for a last eight spot. Unfortunately, Georgia find themselves in a group with Fiji, who have a squad good enough to threaten Australia and third place seems far harder this time around than it was last time. Pool D is the only group with four teams in the top 12 of the World Rugby rankings.One should be positive, it isn’t a foregone conclusion. Georgia has as good a scrum as anybody and if the game against Fiji comes on a horrible rainy day, hopefully played on a recently ploughed field, parity could be secured. If it is an arm-wrestle, Georgia has a chance. And of course, that scrum could also turn over Wales and Australia’s. But the team has shown consistently over the last four seasons, against second-tier nations as well as the few opportunities they have against the big boys, that they struggle to finish opportunities off and without a huge change in that area there really is no chance of anything better than fourth. Adam HookerIt seems mad to be saying I’m nervous when my team is ranked as world No 1, but that’s the mad position I’m in as an Ireland fan. 2018 was a dream year. If the 2019 Six Nations felt lacklustre by comparison, then the thrashing by England was a real bodyblow for a fan’s confidence.Recent results against Wales steadied the ship and I hope we can recover the magic that saw us outclass the All Blacks. I’m flying out to Japan and praying we hit the ground running against Scotland. I’m an Ulster girl and want Rory Best to go out on a high. One of the friends I’m going with is Scottish and I’ll be pure sickened if they have bragging rights for the rest of our trip. Emma CassidyWe hope to win the first two games against Namibia and Canada, and then we’ll go in pilgrimage to the Vatican and pray for a miracle. Maybe we’ll defeat South Africa again like in 2017, or maybe we will face an already qualified and content All Blacks. But whatever happens I really hope that Sergio Parisse and Leo will have some glory in their last Rugby World Cup. Damiano MartignagoHistorically we have played 19 lost 19, so a victory would be sweet. Scoring a try against South Africa or New Zealand would be awesome. As the lowest ranked team in the finals and, probably, the fewest fans able to afford the trip, our fan strategy will be to get the Japanese to love us and support us. I know our team will play with strength and stubborn optimism. We love Namibia and the fact that we are on the world stage. We will be few, but we will sing our national anthem, Land of the Brave, with passion. Jeremy SilvesterAfter the heartbreak of 2007, the nervousness and joy of 2011, and the excitement of 2015, it’s hard to say if New Zealand will raise the trophy once more. Of course, Kiwis are dreaming of the legendary three wins in a row. However, we know that having an amazing team doesn’t make it a winning team. With 2007 in our memories, no New Zealander is going to assume we will always make it through the quarter-finals.Ardie Savea and Brodie Retellick are the two players I am looking forward to watching the most. I’m excited for Retallick’s return from injury and I hope Savea receives the international recognition his abilities deserve. We will be proud of our boys no matter what. Nikki CarterWe just want to give it a good lash. We probably won’t get out of the group, barring a miracle. KT O’ConnorAnything less than the quarter-finals would be a big disappointment anything more a big surprise. It’s hard to know what to expect from Scotland anymore, such is their inconsistency. They are capable of blistering brilliance one day (running in six tries in half an hour or so at Twickenham) and abject incompetence the next (the error-strewn performances at home to Ireland and away to France in this year’s Six Nations). I’m left with the impression that we’re going backwards under Gregor Townsend.Vern Cotter gave the side a more steely, competitive edge. Though, let’s face it, Scotland could hardly have been any less competitive in the years before he took over, whereas with Townsend it seems to be a case of boom or bust. That might be harsh on him and you could point to the home warm-up win over France as evidence of steeliness, but one minute I find myself thinking we could beat the Irish, top the group and give South Africa or New Zealand a serious run for their money in the last eight, and the next I’m contemplating the very real possibility of losing to Ireland and Japan and going home early. Much will depend on Finn Russell, possibly too much. I’m also hoping the Ireland players don’t complete a hat-trick of sneakymistimed hits on Stuart Hogg this year. James CalderI’m approaching the tournament with building expectation and hope. The Boks are many people’s pick for the title. Their squad depth is unrivalled and their preparation under Rassie Erasmus has been meticulous. I expect their first game, against New Zealand, to be part one of a double header that will culminate in the final. South Africa have the forward power to generate both quick ball and field position for them to unleash their burgeoning back line.Handre Pollard is in the form of his life and will be one of the dominant players of the World Cup. At blindside flank Pieter-Steph Du Toit is already a candidate for world player of the year and can play a similar role to that of Juan Smith in the 2007 World Cup victory. Cheslin Kolbe has the potential to announce himself as a true superstar and be one of the stars of the World Cup. Fans across the world will be won over by his stepping ability and his huge courage. South Africa’s main weakness will be Faf De Klerk and Willie Le Roux, two players who waver from world class to dreadful. If either of them has an off day, it could cost the Boks hugely. Sam KantorowichI don’t have much hope really, but just want one positive result in our four games to show the amazing development rugby is having in Uruguay. I’m looking forward to watching Juan Cat, Santiago Civetta and Manuel Leindekar. Juan LaffitteOur hopes are simply to win one or two matches. Of our opponents in the pool – England, France, Argentina and Tonga – I realistically think we can beat Tonga and then produce another highlight, like we did in 2007 against South Africa. We can expect to come up against a second or third XV against England and maybe Argentina, but France will want to give their first team a run so we’ll have a hard time of it there. Tonga is the game we are setting our sights on. The boys are up for the challenge and won’t lack spirit. Brendan CareyThis year could be our year. I’m not reading too much into the warm-up games. Warren Gatland knows what he is doing to ensure we are in the best possible frame of mind for the start of the tournament. Losing Gareth Anscombe was a huge blow and, if Rhys Patchell misses out we’ll be very thin at No 10, but Dan Biggar knows how to play on the biggest stage and his kicking game is second to none. With Alun Wyn Jones leading from the front, George North on the wing, and a resurgent Jonathan Davies in the side, I expect us to beat all of the northern hemisphere sides. That just leads to the big three and, on our day, we are finally ready to dispatch them.

In a close qualifying session Sebastian Vettel was in third for Ferrari with Max Verstappen in fourth for Red Bull. Valtteri Bottas was in fifth with Alexander Albon in sixth.Under the floodlights of the Marina Bay circuit Leclerc took pole with an outstanding lap in qualifying that he left to his final run. Vettel had set a superb time on his first hot lap with a 1min 36.457sec. He was threading the needle with the flair he has shown in Singapore on previous occasions, going to within a whisker of the walls but keeping it clean. However he made an error on his second lap and aborted it while Leclerc found another plane altogether.His final lap was exceptional, gaining time in the first two sectors and nailing the third, where Ferrari were weakest, with inch-perfect execution. His time of 1:36.217 was untouchable. Hamilton did his best, taking second, but was almost two-tenths down. Ferrari, who had expected to struggle in Singapore, pulled off perhaps their best qualifying of the season, leaving Mercedes and Red Bull wondering just where they had found the pace.Carlos Sainz enjoyed another strong qualifying to claim seventh for McLaren with his teammate Lando Norris in 10th. Renault’s Daniel Ricciardo and Nico Hülkenberg were in eighth and tenth.This is Leclerc’s fourth career pole position, his first at the Singapore Grand Prix and his third in a row after he took the top spot at Spa and Monza. It continues his exceptionally strong form over the single lap in which he has out-qualified Vettel for the past eight races. With two wins already under his belt at the last two races he is in the best possible position to take a third.It will be especially satisfying for Leclerc to claim pole for Ferrari on a track where they expected and appeared to be behind both Mercedes and Red Bull. They have struggled through the slow corners all season and their straight-line speed advantage was mitigated at Marina Bay. However, they had brought a new front wing and floor to Singapore in a bid to find more balance and grip through the corners and unexpectedly they proved to have made a real step forward, showing great form. Leclerc made the most of it and once again gave notice of his credentials as a future world champion.With the Mercedes very strong through the corners, Leclerc put in a superb run to see off a determined effort from Hamilton and Verstappen, both of whom had shown great pace. The 23 corners of Marina Bay, including many slow 90-degree turns, demand precision execution and it is a track where the driver can really make a difference. While Hamilton with a sublime lap proved able to do so last season, this time Leclerc had the edge.Red Bull, who have proved to be very strong on the high aero circuits, expected to be in contention and Verstappen was fast throughout. He was quickest in first practice, with Hamilton on top in the second but by only two-tenths. In the final runs on Saturday morning Leclerc was fastest, again two-tenths faster than Hamilton.A win is far from guaranteed but Leclerc will be confident he can convert pole. The long runs in practice exhibited a distinct pace advantage for Mercedes over Ferrari but with overtaking very difficult on this circuit and a one-stop strategy almost certain, leading from the front of the grid may well be crucial if he can hold the place through turn one.Hamilton still enjoys a comfortable lead in the world championship, 63 points clear of Bottas, while Verstappen is in third, 99 points back, three in front of Leclerc, who now leads Vettel by 13 points.Bottas went quickest in the first session, with Leclerc and Vettel heading Q2, where the times were all set on the soft rubber with which they will start the race.Racing Point’s Sergio Pérez finished in 11th place but will take a five-place grid penalty for taking a new gearbox. Alfa Romeo’s Antonio Giovinazzi was in 12th with his teammate Kimi Räikkönen in 14th. Pierre Gasly was in 13th for Toro Rosso in front of the Haas of Kevin Magnussen.Daniil Kvyat was in 16th for Toro Rosso, with Lance Stroll 17th for Racing Point in front of the Haas of Romain Grosjean. George Russell and Robert Kubica were in 19th and 20th for Williams."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/90a454606cd1264e514779ffca97c01f1bd414b5/0_164_4242_2545/master/4242.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=72396c6bc8b12e9b33ebbb0ae881c43c","title":"new zealand south africa world cup analysis","story":"Quickly recall the epitaphs. Those wondering aloud whether the All Blacks were vulnerable, whether they still hold the mantle, have their answer. With one absorbing performance that embodied resilience and rampant running rugby, New Zealand confirmed their status as favourites for a third consecutive World Cup title.Nothing is guaranteed and no trophy is claimed in any side’s first match, but the spectacular manner of this victory and the six-minute attacking raid that blew South Africa away should send tremors through the other hopefuls.Much drama is yet to unfold at this ninth World Cup and the knockout arena is a completely different beast, but, undoubtedly, New Zealand are leaders of the pack. The target remains imprinted on their backs.At their peak, when the relentless pace, tactical kicking and offloads combine in such slick fashion, no one can stick with them. The All Blacks first needed to absorb the Springboks’ onslaught in the opening quarter but when they clicked, the support play and line breaks were impossible to stop.•\u0026nbspFixtures, tables and results• Top try and points scorers•\u0026nbspSign up to The Breakdown, our free rugby union email newsletterIn the lead-in to this heavyweight duel several question were raised about New Zealand. Their coach, Steve Hansen, appeared to roll the dice with a gamble of sorts by leaving the veteran full-back Ben Smith on the bench and placing faith in George Bridge and Sevu Reece, the wings who combined for five previous Test starts. So, too, did nerves persist about the fledgling dual playmaker combination of Richie Mo’unga and Beauden Barrett. New Zealand have a horror history of putting playing out of position at World Cups – the great full-back Christian Cullen at centre being one such example.Yet the late tactical switch to hand Mo’unga the reins at fly-half and move Beauden Barrett to full-back following Damian McKenzie’s injury may prove a masterstroke. Both proved influential in guiding the All Blacks.Mo’unga’s cross-field kicks that picked Reece out helped spark the 17-point turnaround when the All Blacks scored their two brilliant tries. Mo’unga, the Crusaders playmaker, also nailed a penalty and pulled off a tackle on the dynamic Springboks wing Cheslin Kolbe that Hansen described as the match‑winner.Many consider Barrett the world’s best fly-half and, yet, from full-back he has been more potent than from his more accustomed role. The extra time and space allows Barrett to regularly exploit mismatches and pick moments to hit the line and leave opposition defences stunned.This All Blacks backline has enjoyed little time together of late, largely because of injury, but that did not deter Ryan Crotty and Anton Lienert-Brown combining superbly in the midfield.Ardie Savea must be the world’s best loose forward with his presence at the breakdown and sustained leg drive in contact making him one of the most difficult ball carriers to put on the deck. Remember, too, that the lock Brodie Retallick, arguably the world’s most influential player, is not scheduled to return from a shoulder injury until the latter stages of the group games.The All Blacks are experts at staying grounded – they regularly use the phrase ‘you are where your feet are’ – but on the basis of this performance, it will take a supreme side to stop them again clinching the crown. If all goes to form, which it never does at World Cups, the All Blacks should now meet Scotland in their quarter-final while the Boks are on a collision course with Ireland. Many suspected the holders were vulnerable, not the team they were four years ago when they embraced their most experience team in history, led by Richie McCaw and Dan Carter, and stormed to successive World Cup titles at Twickenham.

Still hosted by Claudia Winkleman (once you defeat all the other fun aunts in combat, you must defeat Winkleman, the funnest aunt of all) and Tess Daly (what if a witch cursed a can of Elnett to live as a person?), still camp, still right on the edge of true glamour, still entirely baffling to the lay viewer, ie me.Strictly Come Dancing (Sat, 7pm, BBC One) is a lightheartedly competitive dance show that is still rigorously ruled by ancient stone tablets engraved with edicts and stored in a holy room at the back of the BBC archives ones that producers are too scared to deviate from in case they bring down an ancient blood curse like the one that already claimed Jamie Laing’s foot. So: Thou Shalt Always Hath a Slightly Clumsy Former Competitive Athlete Who Is Like 6’ 4” And Rhythmless (James Cracknell, David James) Thou Shalt Always Hath a Soap Actress Who Really Really Wants This (Catherine Tyldesley, Emma Barton) Thou Shalt Hath a Cheerful-Faced Breakfast TV Sub-Presenter Who Shall Dad Dance Throughout, Out By Week Two (Mike Bushell) Thou Shalt Hath a Comedian Who Will Never Quite Decide If He Wants To Be “Comedy-Bad” Or Just “Bad-Bad” (Chris Ramsey) Wherever Possible, Thou Shalt Hath Anneka Rice (Anneka Rice). This is a show that had to drip feed the idea of having Claudia Winkleman replace a 1,000-year-old Bruce Forsyth by having her alternate one-week-on, one-week-off for an entire series just so the viewing public wouldn’t riot. It is not a show that is built for change.Good, then, that the Strictly discourse is still what it is. To catch you up, say if you get into conversation with a Strictly fan at a dinner party (?), here are the main flare-ups: the sheer idea of a same-sex dancing partnership is so revolutionary that, if the BBC were to ever do it, an entire swathe of middle England would die instantly of a mass anger heart attack they have started letting vloggers on and nobody knows who these vloggers are Craig Revel Horwood, a man hired to be as decisively mean as it is possible to be without moving your jaw, is simply too decisively mean the one competitor who has previous dancing experience is too good and they are ruining it. The other constants: Tess Daly’s hand gestures, akin to a robot trying to overcome its pre-programmed desire to strangle all of the male professional dancers looking like those F1 drivers who only ever last one season the lad they have on who appears to be an actual vampire who everyone seems to ignore due to the fact that he is an actual vampire Anton du Beke still there, the ghost at the feast everyone trying to do elastic “dancing faces”, like your uncle playing charades and trying to convey the phrase “fatal orgasm”.

We just don’t know how many.”Michael Ian Borer, a University of Nevada, Las Vegas sociologist who researches pop culture and paranormal activity, called the event “a perfect blend of interest in aliens and the supernatural, government conspiracies and the desire to know what we don’t know”.The result, Borer said, was “hope and fear” for events that include the “Area 51 Basecamp” featuring music, speakers and movies in Hiko, and festivals in Rachel and Las Vegas competing for the name Alienstock.“People desire to be part of something, to be ahead of the curve,” Borer said. “Area 51 is a place where normal, ordinary citizens can’t go. When you tell people they can’t do something, they just want to do it more.”Eric Holt, the Lincoln county emergency manager overseeing preparations, said he believed authorities could handle a total of 30,000 visitors to Rachel and Hiko.Still, neighbors braced for trouble after millions of people responded to the Storm Area 51 Facebook post weeks ago.“Those that know what to expect camping in the desert are going to have a good time,” said Joerg Arnu, a Rachel resident who can see the festival grounds from his home.Those who show up in shorts and flip-flops will find no protection against “critters, snakes and scorpions”.“It will get cold at night. They’re not going to find what they’re looking for, and they are going to get angry,” Arnu said.

A Houthi military spokesman described the assault as a serious escalation and a reprisal for the Houthi-claimed assault on Saudi oil installations last weekend.Defending the attacks, the Saudi coalition spokesman, Turki Al-Malik, said: “The coalition’s naval forces detected an attempt by the terrorist Houthi militia backed by Iran to carry out an imminent act of aggression and terrorism in the southern Red Sea using an unmanned, rigged boat ... launched from Hodeidah province.”The Saudi attacks were seen by the Houthis as an attempted show of strength in response to the last Saturday’s devastating assault on the Saudi Aramco oil facilities, a strike that exposed the vulnerability of the Saudi oilfields to terrorism.The Houthis continue to claim responsibility for the attack on the facilities which temporarily knocked out half of Saudi Arabia’s oil production capacity, and raised deep questions about Saudi Arabia’s ability to press ahead with its IPO sale. Videos showing cars queuing for petrol in Saudi Arabia were posted on social media.Both Riyadh and Washington are continuing to point the finger directly at Iran, with the US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, describing the attack as an act of war by Tehran.3m people forced to flee their homes.85,000 -\u0026nbsp Save the Children estimate that this number of children under the age of 5 may have died through hunger and malnutrition.1m cases of cholera in 2017, the largest outbreak of the disease in recent history. 2,200 people died during it. A resurgence of the disease saw more than 137,000 suspected cases and almost 300 deaths in the first three months of 2019.Over 91,600 fatalities since the conflict started in 2015, as measured by the Armed Conflict Location and Event Data project.19,990 recorded air raids since the conflict began\u0026nbsp£770m - the amount of foreign aid given by Britain in food, medicines and other assistance to civilians over the last half a decade.£6.2bn - the amount of money Britain has earned in the same period selling arms to the Saudis and their coalition partners.Four UN weapons experts have arrived in Saudi Arabia, at the invitation of the government, to examine the weapons used in the assault on the two sites at Abqaiq and Khurais. Two of the experts have previous knowledge of the weapons used in the four-year Yemen civil war.The Saudi government also took representatives from international media to Abqaiq and Khurais to show the extraordinary scale of the damage and assure that the sites would be back to full production capacity within a month or two.Riyadh told reporters that the assaults, a mixture of cruise missiles and drones, came from the direction of Iran and the weaponry deployed is not in the possession of the Houthis.Saudi Arabia has not identified the precise point from which the attack was launched, but unnamed US intelligence sources claim it was southern Iran, and the attack was undertaken with the knowledge of Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.The Iranian foreign minister, Javad Zarif, said such such claims are false and designed to distract attention from Saudi breaches of humanitarian law in Yemen.The focus of the dispute is likely to move next week to New York where Zarif is expected to meet European foreign ministers, including the UK foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, at the UN general assembly. The chances of a direct meeting between the Iranian president, Hassan Rouhani, and Donald Trump is ruled out by Iran, but the French president, Emmanuel Macron, is likely to try to act as a mediator between the two sides since he will hold bilateral meetings with both men.Seeking a resolution is complicated by the political chaos inside the Saudi-backed Yemen government, as well as a dispute between Yemen and one of its nominal supporters, the United Arab Emirates. In a sign of the collapse of trust, Yemen’s transport minister, Saleh Al-Jubwani, accused the UAE on twitter of supporting al-Qaida in Yemen to undermine the government.Yemen’s president, Abd Rabbu Mansour Hadi, issued a decree on Thursday evening appointing new foreign and finance ministers in a cabinet reshuffle to lead the key state institutions. He appointed the former ambassador Mohammed Abdullah Mohammed Al-Hadrami as minister of foreign affairs, replacing Khaled al-Yamani, who resigned last June. He also appointed the fourth head of the Central Bank in as many years.In London Boris Johnson met the emir of Qatar on Saturday and in a statement from No 10 stressed Downing Street is seeking to de-escalate the crisis through negotiation.

Police fired teargas at protesters and dismantled makeshift barricades set up by protesters with plastic and metal roadside barriers while protesters threw petrol bombs in retaliation. Police said in Twitter posts that “radical protesters threw petrol bombs” and possessed “offensive weapons including metal rods, slingshots and laser guns” during the confrontations.About an hour into the protest, riot police charged towards a group of protesters and arrested a number of people. Many others got into a stand-off with police behind barricades they built earlier. Scuffles also broke out between the police and protesters near a light rail station after some demonstrators were accused of shining laser pointers at officers. They used fire hoses to spray water while police retaliated with pepper spray and fired several rounds of sponge bullets at them. Police said in a Twitter post that the protesters damaged the station facilities with metal rods and hurled objects into the track.Earlier, protesters near Tuen Mun town hall lowered the Chinese flag, trampled on it and set it on fire.The Saturday protest earlier in the afternoon targeted dance performances in a local park often staged by mostly mainland Chinese women but protesters were also venting their anger over escalating police violence in recent protests and calling for broader political rights.“Five demands, not one less!” chanted the mostly black-clad protesters, referring to their demands which include the setting up of an independent commission to investigate police brutality and universal suffrage. They also sang songs aimed at provoking the police.Earlier this month, the Hong Kong leader, Carrie Lam, withdrew the controversial anti-extradition bill that sparked the wave of protests in June, but the move failed to calm unrest. The protests had by then morphed into a wider and more violent anti-government movement as resentment mounted against the police and the government, which used threats and escalating force to deal with protesters. The bill, if passed, would have allowed people to be sent to mainland China for trial.The local metro station was closed by the authorities before the event on Saturday, making it harder for protesters to reach and leave the area. The city’s transit operator, MTR Corp, has also closed the train station at Yuen Long, where a sit-in was planned earlier to commemorate an indiscriminate attack carried out by pro-China gangsters on commuters two months ago. Earlier on Saturday, dozens of pro-China supporters tore down “Lennon Walls” of large collages of colourful anti-government protest messages in several districts. The installations have blossomed across Hong Kong, on and under footbridges, along pedestrian walkways, at bus stops and shopping centres. A pro-Beijing city legislator, Junius Ho, who has been a vocal critic of the protests, had urged his supporters to clean up the approximately 100 Lennon Walls around the city on Saturday.The anti-government protesters are angry about what they see as creeping interference by Beijing on Hong Kong’s “one country, two systems” formula that ensures freedoms not enjoyed on the mainland, including the right of assembly and an independent judiciary.China says it is committed to the arrangement and denies interfering. It has accused foreign governments including the US and Britain, of inciting the unrest.The demonstrations have turned ugly and tend to peak on the weekends, often with anti-government activists, many masked and in black, throwing petrol bombs at police, trashing metro stations, blocking airport roads and lighting street fires. At times, they have been confronted by supporters of Beijing wielding sticks.

friendly towns win status in bid to build more caring society","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t“Too often, autistic people and their families are excluded from discussions about autism and the design of services.” File photograph: GettyEleven towns across the country are to be designated “autism-friendly” after what was termed the “phenomenal” success of a pilot scheme in Clonakilty, Co Cork, it has been announced.Adam Harris, founder and chief executive of AsIAm, Ireland’s national autism charity, said he believes the roll-out will help the public to better understand that being autism-friendly is often simply about being a more caring society.With support from retailer SuperValu, which has autism-friendly shopping usually on Tuesday evenings at many of its outlets, Mr Harris drew up plans last year to include other shops, businesses and public services in Clonakilty in the scheme.The businesses and other bodies were asked to take measures to reduce sensory stimulation that could cause distress and difficulties, to undertake staff training to improve understanding of the condition and how to communicate better with those with autism, and other measures.Mr Harris said the response has been “phenomenal”, with more than 100 organisations involved, a new sensory garden opened in the town, new autism-friendly practices at the town’s festivals, and annual training and lectures.“It really set a challenge for the rest of the country, so we worked with SuperValu to see how we could roll this out elsewhere,” he said.Towns were invited to express an interest in following Clonakilty’s lead, with proof of infrastructure and support, involvement of people with autism in leadership roles, and partnerships with local organisations such as Tidy Towns committees or the GAA.Successful townsThe successful towns, announced on Saturday at the fourth annual National Autism Conference in Malahide, Co Dublin, are: Skerries and Lucan in Co Dublin Castlebar in Co Mayo Slane, Co Meath Mallow, Co Cork Greystones and Bray in Co Wicklow Tralee and Listowel, Co Kerry and New Ross, Co Wexford.Committees in each town will be supported in their efforts to transition towards autism-friendly communities.“These partnerships are really important because there is not enough partnership happening,” said Mr Harris.“Too often, autistic people and their families are excluded from discussions about autism and the design of services. We particularly see this at the moment in relation to the shortage of school places for autistic children around the country. Families have really been left out and not included in discussions about this.“So, this is about sending a message to the public that being autism-friendly is about more than donating €5 or €10, it is actually about changing our behaviour.“This will have a significant impact on the wellbeing of autistic people, growing up in a community that from the outset says ‘There is no stigma, we support you, we want to help you every step of the way, whether it is going to school or to buy an ice cream’.“Hopefully this leads to autistic people living, working and playing more in communities right across the country.”AsIAm estimates there are about 75,000 people with autism in Ireland, based on findings that one in 65 schoolchildren have been diagnosed with the condition. There is a spectrum of severity, with some who can live independently and others who need a large degree of support.Also revealed at the conference were the results of a survey two weeks ago by AsIAm of 240 people either with autism or who have a loved one with autism.It found 97 per cent of respondents believe the general public do not understand enough about the condition 82 per cent believe that most businesses or organisations in their community are not adequately equipped to help them, and 88 per cent would visit the businesses and organisations more often if they were.“The vast majority of people with autism experience a lack of understanding in their day-to-day lives,” said Mr Harris.“It is really important that we de-medicalise autism, so it is not just for the psychologist or teacher or doctor, but something for everyone to play their part in terms of ersity in society.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4025330.1569011017!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"miriam lord s week paschal gets a birthday surprise from javid","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tMinister for Finance Paschal Donohoe and UK chancellor of the exchequer Sajid Javid at Farmleigh House. Photograph: Julien Behal PhotographyNews outlets were advised by the Department of Finance that the meeting between Paschal Donohoe and his UK counterpart, Sajid Javid, on Thursday would be a photo opportunity only. No provision for media questions.This did not deter the reporters, who trooped along anyway in the hope of getting a few Brexit-related lines from the two money men.Paschal was first to arrive because he had to perform the big welcome under the portico. There were no security restrictions in place, apart from a roped-off area for photographers in front of Farmleigh House. On such a lovely day, visitors were enjoying the grounds around the estate, including a seven-strong group of women on a day trip from Thurles. When they noticed the media activity, they went for a closer look and saw the Minister for Finance, dimples dancing in the sunlight.With a few minutes to spare, the politician in Paschal found it impossible to resist this pleasant group of ladies waving and calling his name. He ambled over.An adviser let slip that it was his birthday. He’s 45. There were photographs taken and then the Thurles contingent serenaded the beaming Minister with a very harmonious warbling of Happy Birthday.“Thank you very much!”This touching interlude gave the scheming hacks an idea. They knew that unless they could grab the attention of one of the Ministers, any shouted questions would be smilingly ignored.Javid landed and the handshakes commenced. In time-honoured tradition, the politicians studiously ignored the journalists. Suddenly a voice bellowed, Downing Street-style, from the rabble.“Chancellor, do you know it’s the Minister’s birthday?”The chancellor instinctively pivoted, a manoeuvre more usually associated with his boss and the truth.Looking momentarily terrified by this briefing oversight, the UK visitor quickly regained his composure. In the rocky world of British-Irish relations in these Brexit-strained times, Paschal and Sajid have had three meetings in recent weeks. That almost makes them best pals.“Yes. I bought him a present but I can’t tell you what it is,” he told Virgin Media’s Gavan Reilly. Contact established, the men were drawn into a reluctant exchange.Might the present involve the unwrapping of some common ground on Brexit? And what did both sides think of a speech made by UK Brexit secretary Steve Barclay in Madrid earlier in the day?So the finance ministers were forced into saying nothing of import, but on the record, about the special relationship between Ireland and the UK while simultaneously avoiding any public comment on Barclay’s robust remarks.A belated happy birthday to the deputy for Dublin Central and we hope he gets to enjoy a nice meal and a few pints this weekend. Young Paschal (45) spent the night of his birthday in a meeting on Brexit with Minister for Agriculture Michael Creed.From Labour to lobbyistFormer Labour senator and general election candidate Lorraine Higgins will be appointed Honorary Consul to the Slovak Republic at a reception in the embassy in Merrion Square on Thursday. She left active political life a number of years ago but is still a leading light – not to mention a rare female presence – in the Oireachtas Golf Society.Her sister Clodagh is now a councillor in Galway, although her party of preference is Fine Gael.Lorraine became chief executive of the trade group Retail Excellence after failing to win a Dáil seat in 2016. She has since moved on to corporate communications agency MKC, where she is director of strategy and public policy – a fancy name for political lobbyist. She filled the gap left by the departure of former Fine Gael media director and ministerial adviser Ciarán Conlon, who left for Microsoft.Speaking of fierce big jobs, former taoiseach Enda Kenny’s chief of staff, Mark Kennelly, landed what many would call a dream gig this week when he was appointed the first chief executive of Golf Ireland. The Kerry man is a member of Killarney Golf and Fishing Club.With all the work he has to do, not least with the Ryder Cup in Adare on the horizon, Mark will hardly have time to swing a club.Knock, Knock, Leo’s thereLeo Varadkar has settled into the routine once faithfully followed by general election specialist Bertie Ahern, travelling around the country on available Fridays to get maximum exposure in the local mediaThis week Leo went to Mayo, starting in Knock airport before taking in Castlebar, Ballina and Shrule near the Galway border.He cut the ribbon on Knock airport’s refurbished runway. Just as well the runway is the third-largest in the country because a lot of tarmac was needed to accommodate the amount of dignitaries gathered for the ceremony.Leo retold the story of how townie politicians dismissed Msgr James Horan’s grand vision for an airport and how a Fine Gael minister (it was the late Jim Mitchell) famously described the site in 1984 as “far distant from any sizeable town, high on a foggy, boggy hill”.More than 30 years on, Ireland West Airport is proof “that white elephants can fly”. A comforting thought, perhaps, for a Taoiseach constantly battling criticism of government infrastructure projects.The parish priest of Knock, Fr Richard Gibbons, thought Leo might need some ine intervention on the Brexit situation.“Taoiseach, I know you’re going to New York next week and meeting Boris Johnson,” he smiled, before handing him a tiny bottle. “A small little bit of added protection for you.”To applause and much guffawing, Leo held up the holy water. “Do I throw it over him or what?”“Oh, you can, you can!” laughed Fr Gibbons.Apparently the good father’s harmless joke has now gone viral, outraged Brexiteers are losing the plot on social media and the permanently indignant are having a field day over the Catholic Church’s stance on homosexuality.Ploughing off courseWe bumped into Mattie McGrath at the National Ploughing Championships on Thursday afternoon. He seemed in a rush and somewhat hot and bothered.The independent TD for Tipperary and member of the Dáil’s Rural Independents Group explained that he had only just arrived. He had hoped to get in much earlier but there had been a bit of a mix-up and they got lost in the car on the way to Fenagh. Which is why we found him barrelling up the steel walkway at speed, wearing his full suit in the sweltering conditions.“I hadn’t time to change,” he said.It seems Mattie took a lift with his Fianna Fáil colleague and TD for Cork East, Kevin O’Keeffe. Kevin put on the GPS and off they went, following the satnav directions to the letter.When the two boys reached their “destination” they knew they had veered substantially off course.According to Mattie, when Kevin keyed in “National Ploughing Association”, the satnav took them to the gates of Anna May McHugh’s farmhouse in Laois. The indomitable Anna May is the power behind the Ploughing.McGrath wasn’t overly concerned about arriving late but O’Keeffe was anxious to link up with the Fianna Fáil contingent and show his face before his leader Micheál Martin left the scene.Ross has a lot on his plateWhen Minister for Justice Charlie Flanagan waylaid Shane Ross after the first Cabinet meeting of the new season and presented him with a commemorative plate featuring Shankill Garda station, the Minister for Transport looked most gratified.But it was all a little strange. Had it been specially commissioned? Why would Charlie Flanagan do this when Ross has been the bane of his life with his crusade over reopening Shankill Garda station along with his determination to push the Judicial Appointments Bill through the Oireachtas, no matter how long Flanagan has endured the Seanad filibuster against it.It wasn’t a special piece. The Minister for Justice spotted it while browsing through bric-a-brac in an antiques shop while on holidays in Connemara. The plate was part of a series featuring scenes from south Co Dublin. Charlie wasn’t keen on buying the complete set so he stuck a deal with the owner and came away with the one he wanted.While it clearly wasn’t too expensive, the Minister is refusing to say how much he paid.Charlie and Shane are both beaming broadly as the gift is handed over in Government Buildings. That was nearly three weeks ago, before the Minister for Transport knew Stepaside Garda station would not be open to the public on a 24-hour basis, despite his assurances to the contrary.Only one of them is smiling now. And it isn’t Ross, but at least he has a new china plate to hang on the wall.Big in JapanThe sense of drift in the nation will be reversed on Tuesday, September 24th, when Seanad Éireann finally gets back to business after the summer break.All Senators are expected to muster for duty, including the four from Fine Gael who flew to Japan for two weeks for the Parliamentary World Cup rugby tournament. The Dáil and Seanad XV made it to the semi-finals, winning the Plate match against Japan. New Zealand took the honours.No TDs went on the trip, with the Fine Gael four the only elected representatives on a team drawn in the main from Leinster House staff.The Senators have been quick to point out they travelled when the Upper House was in recess and everyone paid their own way – flights, accommodation, insurance and specially made deckchair-striped Alickadoo jackets.Neale Richmond, sporting the remains of a black eye, took a break from his sporting holiday to brief business leaders on EU Brexit developments at a conference in Japan’s Keizai Koho Forum. He also met government trade representatives in Tokyo. The other Senators on the trip were Catherine Noone from Dublin, Maria Byrne from Limerick and Tony Lawlor\u0026nbspfrom Kildare.While the politicians may have paid their own way, it hasn’t stopped a few Fine Gael eyebrows rising in their absence. Three of them – Richmond (Dublin-Rathdown), Noone (Dublin Bay North) and Lawlor\u0026nbsp(Kildare South) – are running in the general election, and some party colleagues are wondering about the wisdom of taking off for Japan with talk in the air of a snap election in eight weeks’ time.The travelling party seems to have had a great time. A Japanese commuter posted a video on Twitter of the tired-looking team lustily singing The Black Velvet Band while on the Tokyo underground (Hanzomon Line). It is a sight to behold."},{"url":null,"title":"matt cartoons september 2019","story":"To continue reading this articleAccess all Premium articles then only £2 per weekRegister for freeRegister or subscribe to continue readingAlready a subscriber?Newsletters and daily briefings30 days free, then £2 per weekUnlimited access to Premium articlesExclusive subscriber events and rewardsThe daily newspaper on your smartphone or tabletAlready a subscriber?Sign up for our exclusive, subscriber-only Matt newsletter - and get an unseen Matt  each week. www.telegraph matt-nlOrder The Best of Matt 2018 by visiting books.telegraph or call 0844 871 1514.  ​To order a fine art print, signed or unsigned of this, or any Matt cartoon, go to telegraphmattprints or call 0191 603 0178.Thomas Cook customers and staff bracing themselves for dire company futureDonald Trump accuses Democrats of launching \u0026#39Ukraine Witch Hunt\u0026#39Row after revelation Jeremy Corbyn signed document accusing Israel of genocideBalloons and lanterns causing \u0026#39sky-tipping\u0026#39 in Anglesey, putting wildlife at riskThe ancient Aztec ballgame saving Mexicans from life of crime and drugsDeaths of five women with eating disorders linked by coroner amid growing anorexia crisis in UKIsraeli opposition demands Netanyahu steps aside for centrist PM candidateItaly, France and Germany will look to strike migrant EU resettlment dealWho will win Strictly Come Dancing 2019?

Granted, it wasn’t so hard to fall for the charms of its marketing campaign. Released in the grim haze left behind by Batman v Superman (more on that later), Suicide Squad looked us in the eye and promised us an antidote to what had come before. It told us it would be the neon-splattered, anarchist baby brother of the DCEU. All that arrived was the adolescent part. Too much of Suicide Squad is spent on its over-edited character introductions: each arrives on screen with a classic rock track blaring and some meaningless onscreen text (what’s the point of Captain Boomerang’s “unicorn fetish”, again?). All ultimately wasted once the (anti-)heroes are tasked with defeating the DCEU’s most half-baked villain, The Enchantress (Cara Delevingne). She’s a character so devoid of interest, the worst crime she’s guilty of is piss-poor archeology skills.27 6. Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice (2016)Although more cohesive in its vision than Suicide Squad, Batman v Superman suffers because that vision is almost entirely delusional. What is presented to us as a philosophical epic – a treatise on morality and personal responsibility – is instantly undone by a series of ludicrous decisions on the part of the film’s director, Zack Snyder. Chief among them, the now-infamous reason that Batman (Ben Affleck) and Superman (Henry Cavill) finally stop pummelling each other and decide to become super friends: their mothers were both called Martha. And why again did Lex Luthor (Jesse Eisenberg) have any interest in making these two titans fight? The film’s plot is wildly incoherent, but it only becomes a true chore after the realisation that even Gal Gadot’s introduction as Diana PrinceWonder Woman isn’t enough to lighten the film’s funereal tone.Justice League contains, at its heart, a story that was only half-realised. Zack Snyder stepped down from his duties as director, following the tragic death of his daughter, Autumn. They were intensely difficult circumstances that didn’t necessarily come with easy answers for the future of Justice League. Warner Bros, however, made an odd choice in inviting Joss Whedon to complete the film. The quip-heavy, energetic style he brought to Marvel’s Avengers and Avengers: Age of Ultron clashed abrasively with the weightiness of what Snyder had already shot. Yet, Justice League at least has the advantage of showcasing the characters that the DCEU has now bet their future on, with charismatic turns from Gal Gadot’s Wonder Woman, Jason Momoa’s Aquaman, and Ezra Miller’s The Flash.47 4. Man of Steel (2013)As the onscreen debut of Cavill’s Superman, Man of Steel at least benefits from a fairly straightforward, linear storyline that duly ticks off the various demands of an origin story. Elements of the film feel over laboured: the Jesus imagery is excessive for a character whose parallels with a religious saviour are already obvious, Jonathan Kent (Kevin Costner)’s death scene seems unnecessary, and the film concludes with a seemingly endless destruction fest. Yet, after Superman IV: Quest for Peace (1987) and Superman Returns (2006) turned the franchise into a joke, an approach as sombre as that of director Zack Snyder felt right for the character at the time, flaws aside. Whether he made the right choice in violating Superman’s usual no-kill policy, by having him snap General Zod (Michael Sheen)’s neck, is up for (usually lengthy) debate.Aquaman is far from perfect, but credit has to be given to director James Wan for taking such a huge risk with the film and standing by it, even in its most ludicrous excesses. This is a bombastic adventure. And it’s all anchored by its star Jason Momoa, who manages to turn a character who, for years, has been the butt of the joke, into DC’s new party jock hero. Momoa made the man-who-talks-to-fish cool. Unfortunately, it’s also an audience ider: either you buy into the giant crab warriors and the octopus playing drums, or you get distracted by the lazy plotting and the weak dialogue. Unfortunately, beneath all the fishy visuals, the film’s story gets swamped by exposition and an unconvincing central romance.Shazam! centres on a troubled 14-year-old orphan (Asher Angel) who has the power to transform into a Superman-type character (a visibly delighted Zachary Levi) by saying the film\u0027s title. Borrowing heavily from Tom Hanks\u0027s Big, the film breezes along, playfully skewering superhero tropes and concluding with a light-hearted, low-stakes climax. Sure, there are segments that drag, and the superhero fights are a little too long, but Shazam! finally gives the world a coherent and fun DCEU film. With this and Aquaman having been released back-to-back, the darkness of Snyder\u0027s Man of Steel and Batman vs Superman seems but a fever dream.When Patty Jenkins entered the ring to direct Wonder Woman’s first solo film since her inception in 1941, she brought something to the DCEU that arguably hadn’t been seen before. Wonder Woman has heart. It’s a film filled with characters you can believe in, root for, and idolise. Although it stumbles at times – its main villain is dull, its side villain is under-used, and its finale relies far too much on CGI – those weaknesses pale in comparison to how beautifully crafted Wonder Woman’s own personal journey is. We see what courage and sacrifice represents, and what it means to fight for the good of others. It’s a rare thing to see a superhero film place at its centre the true ideals of heroism – kindness, justice, and love – and have them all embodied in one character. And with Gal Gadot exuding both power and compassion in equal measure, it’s no wonder that so many uphold her as the bright spot of the DCEU.

Again, over half – 56 per cent – said they do not have enough information to start making decisions about their post-Brexit recruitment strategy, with just 27 per cent happy to make decisions based on existing information.Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Environmental activists rally during the UK Student Climate Network\u0027s Global Climate Strike protest in central London.

He helped drag his side from 122-8The institute also found that since the 2016 vote to leave the EU most employers have focused on retaining existing EU staff, rather than on planning for immigration restrictions.Very few employers are ready for the end of free movement and restrictions on immigration in just over a year. Worse still, many seem both daunted and alarmed by the range of restrictions planned and the costs they are likely to incur,” said Gerwyn Davies, senior labour market adviser for the CIPD.“It seems inevitable that the rate of inflow of EU citizens into the UK from 2021 will fall compared with recent years,” he added.The CIPD urged the government to bring in immigration restrictions gradually to give firms more time to adjust and to avoid harming UK competitiveness.It recommended introducing a two-year visa system for unskilled workers and making an exception for some jobs with labour shortages by lowering the proposed £30,000 salary requirement for foreign workers.One engineering firm in Scotland told the CIPD that the average salary of a skilled manufacturing worker is £28,000. “That’s a significant issue for us,” the employer said.The British Chambers of Commerce also highlighted lingering gaps in government guidance on the status of EU migrants despite the fast-approaching Brexit deadline of 31 October.“The implications of unclear government advice, and gaps in the system, could be costly for businesses that may feel they need to access professional help,” the group said on Friday.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Again, over half – 56 per cent – said they do not have enough information to start making decisions about their post-Brexit recruitment strategy, with just 27 per cent happy to make decisions based on existing information.Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Environmental activists rally during the UK Student Climate Network\u0027s Global Climate Strike protest in central London.

He helped drag his side from 122-8The institute also found that since the 2016 vote to leave the EU most employers have focused on retaining existing EU staff, rather than on planning for immigration restrictions.Very few employers are ready for the end of free movement and restrictions on immigration in just over a year. Worse still, many seem both daunted and alarmed by the range of restrictions planned and the costs they are likely to incur,” said Gerwyn Davies, senior labour market adviser for the CIPD.“It seems inevitable that the rate of inflow of EU citizens into the UK from 2021 will fall compared with recent years,” he added.The CIPD urged the government to bring in immigration restrictions gradually to give firms more time to adjust and to avoid harming UK competitiveness.It recommended introducing a two-year visa system for unskilled workers and making an exception for some jobs with labour shortages by lowering the proposed £30,000 salary requirement for foreign workers.One engineering firm in Scotland told the CIPD that the average salary of a skilled manufacturing worker is £28,000. “That’s a significant issue for us,” the employer said.The British Chambers of Commerce also highlighted lingering gaps in government guidance on the status of EU migrants despite the fast-approaching Brexit deadline of 31 October.“The implications of unclear government advice, and gaps in the system, could be costly for businesses that may feel they need to access professional help,” the group said on Friday.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Ms Rose will become the first chief executive of a major British high street bank when she replaces outgoing boss Ross McEwan on 31 October.\u0026nbspRBS will also be the only FTSE 100 company with women in its top two positions. Katie Murray is the lender\u0027s chief financial officer.\u0026nbspMs Rose, who is currently chief executive of RBS\u0027 commercial and private banking ision, as well as deputy CEO of NatWest,\u0026nbsphad been widely tipped for the top job.Thomas Cook in race to find £200m to stave off collapse\u0026nbspThomas Cook is\u0026nbspon the brink of administration after the tour operator\u0027s lenders demanded that it finds\u0026nbsp£200m in extra funding.\u0026nbspThe company said it was in talks with stakeholders to secure the required funds, including Chinese firm Fosun which injected £450m last month.\u0026nbspThe Independent\u0027s travel correspondent, Simon Calder, explains how people who have booked holidays with Thomas Cook might be affected:\u0026nbspThomas Cook: How will holidaymakers be affected if the travel company collapses?\u0026nbspDover is 100 per cent ready for no-deal Brexit, says port chief executive\u0026nbspThe Port of Dover is 100 per cent ready for a no-deal Brexit, according to the port\u0027s boss, Doug Bannister.\u0026nbspHowever, he\u0026nbsptold Bloomberg\u0026nbspthat he still has no clarity on the rules of the game such as what documents will be needed for freight consignments\u0026nbspMr Bannister also conceded that he was anticipating\u0026nbspdisruption: whether it’s a day, two days, a week, two weeks, a month, two months, nobody can really predict”.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspThree Mobile customers will continue to pay a loyalty penalty\u0026nbspCitizens Advice says Three Mobile customers will continue to pay a loyalty penalty that collectively amounts to as much as £2.7m a month after the company.\u0026nbspOther major networks have committed to end the practice of continuing to charge customers for their handset when their minimum contract period ends and they have paid it off.\u0026nbspBut Three has refused to follow suit, Citizens Advice said. This means loyal customers are being overcharged, the organisation said.\u0026nbspA Three spokesperson said: The current proposals are not in customers\u0027 best interests. Applying an arbitrary discount to tariffs will not effectively tackle what really matters - helping them to find a contract which is both best-suited to their needs and priced fairly.Offshore wind no longer needs subsidies after costs tumble\u0026nbspRenewable energy from new offshore wind farms will be cheaper to produce than the current market rate and no longer require any subsidy after cost tumbled 30 per cent in two years.\u0026nbspThe government revealed that 12 new energy projects, including offshore wind farms will receive between £39.65 and £41.61 per megawatt hour.\u0026nbspBoris Johnson said: The UK is leading the way in the fight against climate change, and it\u0027s great news that millions more homes will be powered by clean energy at record low prices.Seizing the opportunities of clean energy not only helps to protect our planet, but will also back businesses and boost jobs across the UK.Google makes \u0027biggest\u0026nbspcorporate purchase\u0027 of energy\u0026nbspGoogle boss Sundar Pichai said the tech giant plans to make the\u0026nbsp“the biggest corporate purchase of renewable energy in history.\u0026nbspIncluded in the investment will be more than $2bn (£1.6bn) in energy infrastructure and 1,600-megawatts of wind and solar agreements.\u0026nbsp“In all, our renewable energy fleet now stands at 52 projects, driving more than $7bn in new construction and thousands of related jobs,” Pichai said.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0027Truly extraordinary\u0027\u0026nbspThe record low prices secured for new renewable energy\u0026nbspprojects are truly extraordinary says\u0026nbspSimon Virley, UK head of energy and natural resources at KPMG.\u0026nbspThe government has secured almost 6GW of new renewables capacity, without spending any of the £65m budget allocated for this auction, due the record low clearing prices.\u0026nbsp“Giant offshore wind projects will now be built in the North Sea effectively ‘subsidy free’. \u0026nbspThis raises the prospect of offshore wind contributing even more than previously envisaged to achieving the UK’s Net Zero emissions target by 2050.”\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspWhat are the options for Thomas Cook as it struggles to stay afloat?\u0026nbspJoanna Ford, partner at law firm Cripps Pemberton Greenish, says the proposed rescue deal would come at a cost. Existing shareholders would lose much of the value of their investment and control would shift to Thomas Cook\u0027s\u0026nbspChinese investor, Fosun, says Ms Ford.\u0026nbspThis is a common and obvious option for companies that are struggling financially – turning to their existing stakeholders to put their hands in their pockets so their investments can hopefully be salvaged makes sound commercial sense.\u0026nbspShareholders will inevitably want something additional in return, though, and this is usually in the form of shares that then dilute the value of the stake held by those shareholders who chose not to invest.But if that doesn\u0027t work...\u0026nbspIf the rescue deal fails to materialise then the options for Thomas Cook could include administration, an insolvency process where professionals are appointed to manage the company’s affairs. \u0026nbsp\u0026nbspIn this scenario they would try to sell the whole, or parts of the business, leaving behind the company in administration, its shareholders and all the liabilities, which would then be paid (usually not in full) from the cash received from the sale. \u0026nbsp\u0026nbspOther options to businesses with cash flow difficulties include emergency borrowing, either from their own banks or specialist distressed lenders, but this is usually only a sticking plaster if the root cause of the difficulties are not addressed. \u0026nbsp\u0026nbspIf the problems continue, then the cash deficit simply increases and the lenders stand to shoulder greater losses should the business ultimately collapse.The banks are strong-arming Thomas Cook, says analyst\u0026nbspAlex Brignall, Travel and Leisure Analyst at City equities broker Redburn, comments:\u0026nbsp“It feels like a bit of strong-arming by the banks to see the Fosun deal get sorted quickly, or for the situation to be resolved in another way, likely through disposals. Triton has remained very keen to buy the Nordic business, so that should be able to be done if the other solutions do not come through on time.\u0026nbsp“The concerning thing is that September should be the best point of the year for the cash balance, so for banks to be demanding a cash top-up now suggests demand has taken a big hit from all the negative publicity and that the company is facing additional working capital stress.”\u0026nbspPound falls as Ireland pours cold water on Brexit deal hopes\u0026nbspThe pound has plunged more than a cent against the dollar from a high today of $1.258 to $1.245 after Ireland\u0027s foreign minister warned that a Brexit deal is not close.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspSimon Coveney told the BBC that everyone needs a dose of reality about the negotiations.\u0026nbsp“We need to be honest with people and say that we’re not close to that deal right now,” he said. Mr Coveney acknowledged that the mood music around Brexit talks had improved\u0026nbspbut said there was still a wide gap between what the UK has proposed and what the EU would accept.\u0026nbspThe comments reversed a rally sparked last night by optimistic remarks from European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker.\u0026nbspIn today\u0027s session, the pound is down 0.4 per cent against the dollar and 0.2 per cent against the euro at €1.131.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspRyanair pilots cancel strike action\u0026nbspRyanair says its UK-based pilots have cancelled five days of strikes planned for this month.\u0026nbspMembers of the Balpa union had set walkouts for September 21, 23,\u0026nbsp25, 27 and 29. They will not now go ahead.\u0026nbspThe low-cost airline called on pilots to resume talks next week to resolve disputes over a wide range of concerns, including pensions, loss of licence insurance and maternity benefits.\u0026nbspYesterday, Balpa accused Ryanair of being\u0026nbsp“hell bent on prolonging the dispute”.Rogue oil trader causes $320m loss at Mitsubishi\u0026nbspJapanese financial firm Mitsubishi\u0026nbspsaid a rogue oil trader at its Singapore unit lost $320m in unauthorised transactions disguised as legitimate hedges for customers.\u0026nbspThe employee, a Chinese national working at Petro-Diamond Singapore, has been fired and reported to police, Mitsubishi said in a statement, declining to name him.\u0026nbspThe trader, hired in November 2018 to handle oil business with China, “repeatedly” engaged in the unauthorised deals since January, disguising them to “look like hedge transactions,” the parent company said.\u0026nbspA person familiar with the matter identified the trader as Wang Xingchen, also known as Jack Wang. Calls to Wang’s mobile phone wouldn’t connect, while a person who answered the phone at Petro-Diamond’s Singapore office said he has left the company.

Applying an arbitrary discount to tariffs will not effectively tackle what really matters - helping them to find a contract which is both best-suited to their needs and priced fairly.Offshore wind no longer needs subsidies after costs tumble\u0026nbspRenewable energy from new offshore wind farms will be cheaper to produce than the current market rate and no longer require any subsidy after cost tumbled 30 per cent in two years.\u0026nbspThe government revealed that 12 new energy projects, including offshore wind farms will receive between £39.65 and £41.61 per megawatt hour.\u0026nbspBoris Johnson said: The UK is leading the way in the fight against climate change, and it\u0027s great news that millions more homes will be powered by clean energy at record low prices.Seizing the opportunities of clean energy not only helps to protect our planet, but will also back businesses and boost jobs across the UK.Google makes \u0027biggest\u0026nbspcorporate purchase\u0027 of energy\u0026nbspGoogle boss Sundar Pichai said the tech giant plans to make the\u0026nbsp“the biggest corporate purchase of renewable energy in history.\u0026nbspIncluded in the investment will be more than $2bn (£1.6bn) in energy infrastructure and 1,600-megawatts of wind and solar agreements.\u0026nbsp“In all, our renewable energy fleet now stands at 52 projects, driving more than $7bn in new construction and thousands of related jobs,” Pichai said.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0027Truly extraordinary\u0027\u0026nbspThe record low prices secured for new renewable energy\u0026nbspprojects are truly extraordinary says\u0026nbspSimon Virley, UK head of energy and natural resources at KPMG.\u0026nbspThe government has secured almost 6GW of new renewables capacity, without spending any of the £65m budget allocated for this auction, due the record low clearing prices.\u0026nbsp“Giant offshore wind projects will now be built in the North Sea effectively ‘subsidy free’. \u0026nbspThis raises the prospect of offshore wind contributing even more than previously envisaged to achieving the UK’s Net Zero emissions target by 2050.”\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspWhat are the options for Thomas Cook as it struggles to stay afloat?\u0026nbspJoanna Ford, partner at law firm Cripps Pemberton Greenish, says the proposed rescue deal would come at a cost. Existing shareholders would lose much of the value of their investment and control would shift to Thomas Cook\u0027s\u0026nbspChinese investor, Fosun, says Ms Ford.\u0026nbspThis is a common and obvious option for companies that are struggling financially – turning to their existing stakeholders to put their hands in their pockets so their investments can hopefully be salvaged makes sound commercial sense.\u0026nbspShareholders will inevitably want something additional in return, though, and this is usually in the form of shares that then dilute the value of the stake held by those shareholders who chose not to invest.But if that doesn\u0027t work...\u0026nbspIf the rescue deal fails to materialise then the options for Thomas Cook could include administration, an insolvency process where professionals are appointed to manage the company’s affairs. \u0026nbsp\u0026nbspIn this scenario they would try to sell the whole, or parts of the business, leaving behind the company in administration, its shareholders and all the liabilities, which would then be paid (usually not in full) from the cash received from the sale. \u0026nbsp\u0026nbspOther options to businesses with cash flow difficulties include emergency borrowing, either from their own banks or specialist distressed lenders, but this is usually only a sticking plaster if the root cause of the difficulties are not addressed. \u0026nbsp\u0026nbspIf the problems continue, then the cash deficit simply increases and the lenders stand to shoulder greater losses should the business ultimately collapse.The banks are strong-arming Thomas Cook, says analyst\u0026nbspAlex Brignall, Travel and Leisure Analyst at City equities broker Redburn, comments:\u0026nbsp“It feels like a bit of strong-arming by the banks to see the Fosun deal get sorted quickly, or for the situation to be resolved in another way, likely through disposals. Triton has remained very keen to buy the Nordic business, so that should be able to be done if the other solutions do not come through on time.\u0026nbsp“The concerning thing is that September should be the best point of the year for the cash balance, so for banks to be demanding a cash top-up now suggests demand has taken a big hit from all the negative publicity and that the company is facing additional working capital stress.”\u0026nbspPound falls as Ireland pours cold water on Brexit deal hopes\u0026nbspThe pound has plunged more than a cent against the dollar from a high today of $1.258 to $1.245 after Ireland\u0027s foreign minister warned that a Brexit deal is not close.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspSimon Coveney told the BBC that everyone needs a dose of reality about the negotiations.\u0026nbsp“We need to be honest with people and say that we’re not close to that deal right now,” he said. Mr Coveney acknowledged that the mood music around Brexit talks had improved\u0026nbspbut said there was still a wide gap between what the UK has proposed and what the EU would accept.\u0026nbspThe comments reversed a rally sparked last night by optimistic remarks from European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker.\u0026nbspIn today\u0027s session, the pound is down 0.4 per cent against the dollar and 0.2 per cent against the euro at €1.131.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspRyanair pilots cancel strike action\u0026nbspRyanair says its UK-based pilots have cancelled five days of strikes planned for this month.\u0026nbspMembers of the Balpa union had set walkouts for September 21, 23,\u0026nbsp25, 27 and 29. They will not now go ahead.\u0026nbspThe low-cost airline called on pilots to resume talks next week to resolve disputes over a wide range of concerns, including pensions, loss of licence insurance and maternity benefits.\u0026nbspYesterday, Balpa accused Ryanair of being\u0026nbsp“hell bent on prolonging the dispute”.Rogue oil trader causes $320m loss at Mitsubishi\u0026nbspJapanese financial firm Mitsubishi\u0026nbspsaid a rogue oil trader at its Singapore unit lost $320m in unauthorised transactions disguised as legitimate hedges for customers.\u0026nbspThe employee, a Chinese national working at Petro-Diamond Singapore, has been fired and reported to police, Mitsubishi said in a statement, declining to name him.\u0026nbspThe trader, hired in November 2018 to handle oil business with China, “repeatedly” engaged in the unauthorised deals since January, disguising them to “look like hedge transactions,” the parent company said.\u0026nbspA person familiar with the matter identified the trader as Wang Xingchen, also known as Jack Wang. Calls to Wang’s mobile phone wouldn’t connect, while a person who answered the phone at Petro-Diamond’s Singapore office said he has left the company.

He helped drag his side from 122-8Pupil premium rates have been frozen by the government since 2015 – which means the real value of the allocation to schools in England has fallen in recent years.The decline will have a “damaging” effect on the most disadvantaged children and will threaten any progress made in closing the attainment gap,\u0026nbspunions and MPs suggest.It comes after a report from the children’s commissioner revealed that the number of teenagers who have left education without basic qualifications has risen to nearly 100,000 – and a growth in pupils eligible for free school meals who failed to achieve these targets is said to be behind the rise.The research – which found that the attainment gap between disadvantaged children and their peers is widening – revealed that the number of FSM children who have left education at the age of 18 without the basic benchmark qualifications has risen from 28 per cent to 37 per cent since 2015.Julia Harnden, funding specialist at the Association of School and College Leaders (ASCL), told The Independent: “It is important the government addresses this damaging decline because the pupil premium provides invaluable support for our most vulnerable students.”The government should increase the pupil premium budget by £570m by 2022-23 in order to restore funding to its 2015 level, the headteachers’ union argues. \u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

But it did not mention uprating the pupil premium.Speaking from the Labour Party\u0026nbspconference, the shadow education secretary Angela Rayner said: “Boris Johnson has twice stood on an election pledge to protect the pupil premium, yet this research shows there is now a £200m\u0026nbspblack hole in real-terms funding.“The worst thing about this cut is that it hits hardest those children who most need extra help and the schools that serve them.”A Department for Education spokesperson said: “The pupil premium has not been cut. The amount spent on the pupil premium to help disadvantaged pupils has more than trebled from £705m to almost £2.4bn since 2011-12.“It’s entirely normal for allocations to schools each year to fluctuate as the number of eligible children changes.”The spokesperson\u0026nbspadded: “This government has also announced a £14bn investment in schools over three years – the biggest cash boost for a decade.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Independent Premium Comments can be posted by members of our membership scheme, Independent Premium.Try for freeWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

That includes new features like improved multi-tasking, a re-designed home screen and more.When the new iPhone update arrivesThis is the first year that Apple has split the operating systems for iPhone and iPad into separate releases, with the latter being referred to as iPadOS. That has presumably allowed the company to more easily stagger the different releases.And it will not be until 30 September that Apple TV gets its own software update, too. That update, named tvOS 13, will bring support for multiple users as well as the ability to use Xbox and PS4 controllers with Apple\u0027s set-top box.Apple presumably could not delay the release of iOS 13 for iPhones in the same way as the Apple TV and iPad because the iPhone 11 and iPhone 11 Pro will be released this week, and they needed a stable version of the new software to ship on them.The company did unveil a new iPad at its September event, when the new iPhones were shown off, but that device will not ship until 30 September.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Months ago, that was the date that a college student typed into a joke Facebook event, before writing the words that would go on to make it become a day of angst for the US military and residents who live near Area 51.Next to that date, a bored young man called Matty Roberts writes an event description that would propel the page to viral fame.“Storm Area 51, They Can’t Stop All of Us,” it read.Now that the day has arrived, the mission to “storm Area 51” looks very different than it did during that moment of excited viral fame. It went from an online joke, to something that prompted action from both the US military and Facebook, to a potential disaster for the people who are intending to turn up after all.The event began as a joke. That much was clear from the description, which referenced an anime character and suggested people would be able to outrun bullets.Created with Sketch.Best Nasa pictures of the month - August 2019 Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.When stars like the Sun grow advanced in age, they expand and glow red.

Rather than raiding Area 51, that woud be a festival devoted to the culture that surrounds it, attempting to harness people’s interest in the moment into something organised and profitable, rather than potentially lethal.There are now three different major events planned, with a number of others likely. It’s not clear how many people will be arriving in Nevada to take part in them.Two of the main ones are now called Alienstock, after some confusion and disagreement between the people organising them. One will happen in Las Vegas, and appears to be something like a more traditional EDM festival the other is taking place in the tiny town of Rachel, Nevada, in the heart of Area 51-country.It’s that event in particular that has led locals to “prepare for the worst”. Rachel is a tiny town, with a population of around 54, which is only about twice the number of musical acts advertised as performing at the event.Last month, the town’s official website posted a warning indicating that the event has a “high potential to get ugly”. The town and the harsh desert that surrounds it has few places for anyone to stay, is subject to wildly fluctuating temperatures, is home to dangerous animals and the local area has no internet,\u0026nbspphone signal or credit card facilities.Those warnings are still continuing as the weekend begins. This week, local Joerg Arnu said that people did not know what they were getting themselves in for.“Those that know what to expect camping in the desert are going to have a good time,” Arnu said. “Those who are looking for a big party are going to be disappointed.”He predicts people showing up in the desert in shorts and flip-flops.“That doesn’t protect you against critters, snakes and scorpions,” Arnu said. “It will get cold at night. They’re not going to find what they’re looking for, and they are going to get angry.”Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

agreed on Sunday, would avoid a decision until next year, until after a “sensible” withdrawal deal has been negotiated within three months of winning a general election.Only then would Labour decide its stance at a second referendum to be held within a further three months – possibly next May, if Boris Johnson holds a snap election in November.But pro-EU MPs and activists protested that the move was a clear attempt to stop them forcing Mr Corbyn, at the conference getting underway in Brighton,\u0026nbspto abandon his plans to stay\u0026nbspneutral\u0026nbspwhen the referendum comes.They had vowed to force an immediate showdown, armed with the 90 per cent of local party motions on Brexit which oppose the leader’s hopes of sitting on the fence.Bid to oust Watson as Labour deputy leader

We would have to consider it seriously,” Ms Thornberry said.She also criticised Mr Corbyn’s intention to stay neutral\u0026nbspin a fresh referendum, saying: “I think it wouldn’t be right for Labour to have no opinion on such a big decision.”The leadership’s blueprint would see a one-day special conference decide – eventually – Labour’s campaigning position, putting it in the hands of the unions and grassroots.If it wins an election, the party would seek a deal including a customs union, a “close relationship with the single market”, guarantees of workers’ rights and environmental protections, and membership of joint bodies on climate change, counterterrorism and medicines.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Independent Premium Comments can be posted by members of our membership scheme, Independent Premium.Try for freeWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

And people may not be overjoyed about paying taxes but they know what it goes for – public services – and some people are proud of the contribution that they make.Corbyn ‘stitch-up’ to stop Labour backing Remain in Brexit referendum“Why should the super-rich get away with it on a spurious scam like this?”The non-dom system was introduced more than 200 years ago and allows people with the status to avoid paying tax on income or capitals gains made outside the UK.Tory chancellor George Osborne tightened rules on non-doms but Mr McDonnell said there were still “a large number of people out there ... not paying taxes that everyone else pays”.Former Labour leader Ed Miliband vowed to abolish non-dom status in 2015 but the pledge was not included in the party’s 2017 manifesto.As Labour’s annual conference gets underway in Brighton, Mr McDonnell also promised that a government led by Jeremy Corbyn would give 2.5 million people interest-free government loans to buy electric cars.Under the plans, 500,000 loans would be available each year for five years.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.Protesters take to streets after Boris Johnson suspends parliament  Show all 11Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Anti Brexit protesters march on WhitehallMany of the protesters carried placardsThe protesters also marched to Trafalgar Square, where they blocked trafficJohn McDonnell addressed crowds in Whitehall.A small group of Brexit supporters attempted to stage a counter protest in central London.Three people were arrested in London, including a woman who sat on the road near Trafalgar Square.In Oxford, locals and students gathered outside Balliol College, Boris Johnson\u0027s alma mater, to protest.Thousands of people gather in central Glasgow to protest against the prime minister.Jeremy Corbyn spoke to protesters in central Glasgow.Anti Brexit protesters march on WhitehallMany of the protesters carried placardsThe protesters also marched to Trafalgar Square, where they blocked trafficJohn McDonnell addressed crowds in Whitehall.A small group of Brexit supporters attempted to stage a counter protest in central London.Three people were arrested in London, including a woman who sat on the road near Trafalgar Square.In Oxford, locals and students gathered outside Balliol College, Boris Johnson\u0027s alma mater, to protest.Thousands of people gather in central Glasgow to protest against the prime minister.Jeremy Corbyn spoke to protesters in central Glasgow.The maximum loan would be £33,000 in the first year, although this would drop as the cost of electric vehicles decreases.

1,500 people had gathered at the festival sites and said more than 150 people also made the rugged trip several additional miles on bone-rattling dirt roads to get within selfie distance of the gates.Another group of about 40 people gathered at a different gate in the\u0026nbspAmargosa Valley.The military had issued stern warnings that lethal force could be used if people entered the Nevada

One person starts something and it infects everybody with positivity. Anything can happen if you give people a place to be.The entertainment kicked off weekend events that also feature a gathering Friday and Saturday at the Alien Research Centre souvenir store in Hiko.Owner George Harris said it would focus on music, movies and talks about extraterrestrial lore.Authorities reported no serious incidents related to the festivals, which were\u0026nbspscheduled to last until Sunday.Hiko and Rachel are about a 45-minute drive apart on a state road dubbed the Extraterrestrial Highway, and a two-hour drive from Las Vegas.Michael Ian Borer, a University of Nevada, Las Vegas, sociologist who researches pop culture and paranormal activity, called the festivities sparked by the internet joke a perfect blend of interest in aliens and the supernatural, government conspiracies, and the desire to know what we don\u0027t know.YouTuber sentenced to jail after attempting to film Area 51People desire to be part of something, to be ahead of the curve, he said. Area 51 is a place where normal, ordinary citizens can\u0027t go. When you tell people they can\u0027t do something, they just want to do it more.Eric Holt, the Lincoln County emergency manager, said he believed authorities could handle 30,000 visitors at the two events. Still, neighbours braced for trouble after more than two million people responded to the Storm Area 51 Facebook post weeks ago.Those that know what to expect camping in the desert are going to have a good time, said Joerg Arnu, a Rachel resident who can see the festival grounds from his home.Those who show up in shorts and flip-flops will find no protection against critters, snakes and scorpions, he warned.It will get cold at night. They\u0027re not going to find what they\u0027re looking for, and they are going to get angry, he added.The Federal Aviation Administration closed nearby airspace, although Air Force jets could be heard in the sun-drenched skies, along with an occasional sonic boom.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Independent Premium Comments can be posted by members of our membership scheme, Independent Premium.Try for freeWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

However only a few hundred made it to the gates to the facility, according to officials.Hundreds of people gather at Area 51 to ‘see them aliens’Five people were arrested, including two men who were found in the mountains inside the perimeter of base and a woman in her 60s who trespassed at one of the gates.

One man even performed a naruto run in the background of a live TV report from the Area 51 event.“There’s a great sense of community among everyone here,” said John\u0026nbspDerryberry, who drove with his girlfriend, Sarah Shore, from Nashville, Tennessee.\u0026nbspOfficials confirmed there had been no reports of alien sightings or abductions so far.Additional reporting by Associated PressShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Independent Premium Comments can be posted by members of our membership scheme, Independent Premium.Try for freeWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

Andrew Buncombe reports from AustinTexas’s imposing state capitol, with its Goddess of Liberty statue reaching more than 300ft into the sky – higher even, than\u0026nbspthe one in Washington DC – has seen plenty of history.\u0026nbspIn recent years, none has been more memorable than a day in the summer of 2013 when a Democratic legislator, Wendy Davis, rose to her feet to try and block proposed restrictions on access to abortion. Her feet clad in pink running shoes, Davis spoke without pause for 11 hours. People gathered to watch as the afternoon slipped into evening, and as the cut-off deadline of midnight approached. A buzz grew in the marbled chamber, and reached across the nation.Eventually, Republicans would pass the new restrictions, but that hot June night belonged to Davis and her filibustering on behalf of women’s rights. Barack Obama tweeted from the White House: “Something special is happening in Austin tonight. #StandwithWendy.”Six years later, Davis, 56, is back in the fight, one of a huge number of Democratic women candidates looking to turn Texas blue in 2020. Of a minimum of 1,600 so-called “political elections” the party is contesting,\u0026nbspmore than half feature women.“Texas is the biggest battleground state,” says Brittany Switzer, senior brand manager with the Texas Democratic Party. “The majority of Texans are women, the majority of donors and volunteers are women. We’ve seen that in the last couple of years, women are running for office.”Texas would be a massive prize. The second largest state both in terms of geography and population, it also carries the second highest largest number of\u0026nbsppresidential electoral college votes – 38.For a century, Texas was a Democratic stronghold. But for the past four decades it has been solidly red Republican turf. The last Democrat to hold a statewide office was in the 1990s, and the party’s last presidential candidate to win here was Jimmy Carter in 1976.Democrats believe change is under way, and point to various clues. The 2018 midterms saw Democrats pick up a handful of seats in the House of Representatives, and Beto O’Rourke’s long-shot challenge to Ted Cruz in the Senate race stunned both parties. In the end, Cruz held on 51-48, but Republicans were forced to spend millions on a race they assumed they would hold with ease.This year, at least six Republicans from the House have announced they are standing down,\u0026nbspthe so-called “Texodus”. Among them is Will Hurd, the only African American Republican congressman.\u0026nbsp“There are two things happening,” said Matt Angle, a Democratic strategist and founder of the Lone Star Project, a political action committee (PAC) that funds Texas candidates. “One is the demographic changes, especially in the suburbs of places like Houston. The other is what the Republican Party has done it has pursued isive policies to hold onto power by sidelining African Americans and Latinos, rather than trying to win some of these voters.”The women running in Texas, with its mythologised swagger and self-confidence, are doing so up and down the ballot.\u0026nbspMJ Hegar, a 43-year-old air force veteran who served in Afghanistan and who last year narrowly failed in her bid to win a House seat, is trying to better O’Rourke and defeat Republican senator John Cornyn.“I’m not taking any money from corporate PACs (because I answer to Texans, not the special interests), so every goal we set really matters,” she said in a recent email to supporters.In Texas’s 26th congressional district, which includes Dallas-Fort Worth, 26-year-old immigration lawyer Jessica Cisneros has received the endorsement of Justice Democrats, the progressive group that in 2018 helped Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez became the youngest woman elected to congress. Amanda Edwards, a member of Houston’s city council, is also running for the Senate and will face off in a Democratic primary involving Hegar and at least three other candidates.“It’s time for women to have a seat at the table” she says, speaking from Houston. “We have to give women an opportunity to lead.”Edwards says she is basing her campaign not on finger-pointing or playing the blame game, but on showing she can build coalitions. She says voters she speaks to\u0026nbspwant their representatives to “get to work”, even while their inidual priorities may differ.“They have seen politics played, and politics played out. They want people to get focused,” she says. “What is constant\u0026nbspis the disdain and lack of satisfaction with the status quo. I have no doubt this is a change election.”While Texas has vast concentrations of wealth, it also has massive levels of poverty.\u0026nbspUp to one in six Texans have no health insurance, the highest level in the nation. Around one in five Texan children live in poverty. A black or Hiic youngster is three times as likely to live in poverty as a white child.Gina Ortiz Jones, 38, a military veteran who served in Iraq, is running for the vast\u0026nbsp23rd\u0026nbspcongressional district, the one being vacated by Will\u0026nbspHurd, and which stretches hundreds of miles along the border with Mexico, from San Antonio to El Paso. She says it is larger than 30 US states.“Wherever I am, the number one issue is healthcare. The issue might be a little bit different, but the overarching issue is healthcare. Whether it’s the cost of prescription drugs, or you can imagine – if you’re living in one of our rural communities – it’s the challenge of just getting to a healthcare facility and them hopefully having the ability to provide the care you need.”She adds: “It’s a district where were we absolutely need to invest in infrastructure like broadband to be able to realise things like telemedicine and\u0026nbsptelepsychiatry, practices and technologies that exist but for which we lack the infrastructure.”Jennie Lou Leeder, a seventh-generation Texan whose grandfather purchased the family farm in Kerr County in 1882, is running for one of the most closely watched races, the 21st congressional district, which includes parts of Austin and is currently held by Chip Roy, an outspoken Republican. To take him on, she will first have to win the Democratic primary, which will also include Davis.In a bookshop on the edge of Austin, Leeder says she has received much support for an agenda that stresses diplomacy over border walls, and LGBT+ rights.“I have travelled through the 10 counties that make up my district. What I am hearing from people, is what I believe too,” she says. “Everyone has the right to affordable healthcare. Everyone should be able to turn on the tap and have safe, clean drinking water. Our air should be safe to breathe. Our food should\u0026nbspbe safe to eat. Everyone should be able to drive on good, safe bridges.”One of the most important races\u0026nbspwill be for the state legislature, which has long rested in Republican hands. It is crucial for a number of reasons, not least its role in drawing up new state and federal voting districts following the 2020 census. Democrats say these have long been gerrymandered in favour of Republicans. The party needs to flip nine seats to take the lower chamber.Donna Howard, a state representative from Austin, says women are stepping forward in Texas “because they are fed up with the agenda” being set for them. If there were more women elected to office, she says, more attention would be focused on issues such as healthcare and education.\u0026nbsp“After the election of Donald Trump, we saw lots of people coming out and saying ‘I have to do something’. Some of these were suburban women,” she adds. “It was galvanising for the so-called soccer moms who are offended by Trump.”Reports suggest Republican leaders in Texas have already sounded the alarm, aware of how the Democrats were in 2018 able to take back control of the House of Representatives with the votes of educated, suburban women once again being targeted by their rivals.Earlier this year, Politico said the party had massively increased fundraising goals in an attempt to hang on to seats following\u0026nbspO’Rourke’s run. The GOP’s fortunes are not helped, the party admits, by a scandal hanging over the statehouse, amid allegations the Republican speaker sought to have some of his own colleagues defeated. The accusations have been denied, but senior Republican Dan Patrick, Texas’s lieutenant governor, told a radio interviewer: “2020 is going to be a tough year, politically.”Robert Solera, a spokesman for the National Republican Congressional Committee (NRCC), says Democrats may be overly optimistic.People warned to stay indoors as storm Imelda brings ‘extreme’ floods Texas governor refuses to recall legislature to confront gun violenceThanks to Trump, Democrats are taking over in TexasPete Buttigieg was brave to call climate change a religious crisis“In 2018, Democrats had their best election in a generation,” he says.“But they were still not able to win any statewide seats. They were able to pick up a few House seats, and they narrowed the margins in some statewide races, but they did not win any.”He adds: “Texas is one of the fastest growing states in the country. People are moving there because have seen the benefits of Republican leadership.”Roy’s office said he was unavailable for an interview and failed to respond to written questions.Harvey Kronberg, an expert on Texas politics and founder of the bipartisan Quorum Report, says six or seven House seats currently held by Republicans are vulnerable, as is the state legislature. With the right candidate, he says, and if the party was prepared to invest big time in advertising, those 38 electoral college votes might also be up for grabs.“This election is going to be a referendum on Trump. Trump underperforms in the polls here, except among activist folks,” he says. “I don’t think he’s helped himself\u0026nbspvery much. Agriculture is hurting. Oil and gas prices are down.”He adds: “Depending on who they nominate, Texas is in play.”After Davis captured the eye of Obama when she delivered that 2013 filibuster, she used the momentum to run for governor in\u0026nbsp2014, but lost by 20 points to\u0026nbspGreg Abbott.

They’re getting more or less the vote that the left got at the previous election,” he said.“Plus, because the campaign hasn’t polarised to become a referendum on the government, and because opinion polls are showing the left bloc polling well above the threshold, people don’t think it’s a wasted vote.”Left-of-centre parties have not always been marginalised from Poland’s politics: as recently as 2001 the Democratic Left Alliance, the largest party in today’s Lewica coalition, dominated the Sejm and led the country’s government. But a series of corruption scandals and the appeal of right-wing populist parties gutted their vote and has left them marginalised.Today the party relies largely on the “residual” votes people associated with the former communist regime – campaigning on issues like protecting the pensions of former officials – a significant voting bloc.“The biggest problem the left has really got in Poland is that its coalition is squeezed: the less well-off, economically leftist Poles vote for right-wing parties like Law and Justice because they deliver leftist economic policies and social conservatism,” Professor Szczerbiak said.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Lewica is on 14 per cent, while the agrarian Polish People’s Party and its allies are on 10 per cent.\u0026nbspIf PiS cannot win a majority, the likelihood of opposition parties joining together to oust them is relatively high, Professor Szczerbiak\u0026nbspsaid.“The outcome of the election looks pretty clear-cut, in the sense that Law and Justice, the right-wing ruling party, will almost certainly get the largest share of the vote,” he said.Created with Sketch.World news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Thousands of school students and protesters gather in The Domain ahead of a climate strike rally in Sydney.

There is a huge lobbying operation to try to persuade us all to go cashless and use only electronic forms of payments.Already, some fashionable bars and restaurants advertise themselves as cashless.Sainsbury’s recently opened a store where the only way to pay was via a smartphone app — though it was rapidly forced to change its policy when confused shoppers jammed the helpdesk.Little known to most people, David Cameron nearly announced in his  Conservative Party conference speech that Britain would become the world’s first entirely cashless society by .He only pulled back when advisers warned that the public was not ready for such a move.Too right we are not ready to have cash snatched from our wallets and be forced to pay for everything with cards or smartphones. And I hope we never will be.I have nothing against electronic forms of payment, when we choose to use them.I do plenty of shopping online and often choose to pay by card in shops, too.But the right to use cash is a vital freedomwe are to avoid being exploited.I am sick of being told that going cashless is for my convenience. No, it isn’t.It is for the enrichment of some very powerful financial interests who have been furiously lobbying governments to abolish cash.In , investors worldwide put billioninto the financial technology — or fintech — industry.Why  In the expectation of huge rewards.According to the Boston Consulting Group, the industry currently earns trilliona year in revenue — such as fees when we use our credit card or download a payment app on to our phone.By , it expects that to DOUBLE.No prizes for guessing where that extra trillion is going to be coming from — you and me.It might be free for consumers to use a debit card now, but you can be sure it won’t bethe option of paying by cash is abolished.Another reason the industry wants to force us to go cashless is to sell data on our shopping habits.When we buy things with cash, we are anonymous. But when we spend on our cards, our spending can be tracked.Visa, Mastercard and ­American Express have already set up subsidiaries to monetise this data and flog it for marketing purposes.While some stand to make fortunes, the victims of an increasingly cashless economy are the poor and elderly, who find their lives made ever more dficult.Hard though it may be for some of us to believe, when a cashless London transport system was being discussed it emerged that ten per cent of the passengers do not have a bank account.It is not easy to open an accountyou do not have a fixed address and cannot produce things such as utility bills. How are such people supposed to cope in a cashless society There are some things — such as parking in certain towns — which can now only be done by smartphone app.That might make sense to young, educated policymakers in Whitehall and council officials who have grown up with the devices and find that using them is second nature.Yet surprising though it may seem to some, . per cent of the population has never used the internet.Four in five over-s do not own a smartphone, and with good reason.Even without arthritis or serious problems with my vision, I find the devices extremely fiddly to use.I struggle to read what is on the screen and I often find my phone battery has run down by the end of the day.I wouldn’t want to be without a phone, but even less would I want to be reliant on it as my electronic wallet.When the Cameron government was seriously considering turning Britain cashless, one of the reasons mentioned was that it would help tackle crime on the grounds it is supposedly harder for criminals to handle electronic money, as it can be traced.But try telling that to the many victims of online scams who lost a collective £.billion last year in Britain.Just because electronic transfers are theoretically traceable doesn’t mean anyone is actually doing the tracing.Online fraud simply isn’t being taken seriously enough by the police or any other authority.Until or unless it is, going cashless will expose more people to fraud as they are forced to open online accounts.What is wrong with having a iety of ways to pay and letting us choose Cash, cards and cheques have happily co-existed for decades and there is no reason why cash cannot continue to exist alongside payment apps and the like.Far from sneakily trying to abolish cash, the Government should be standing up for our right to use it — ensuring, for one thing, that there are enough free cashpoints for all of us to access our money.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

His new stance is even more laughable than last week’s, when he pledged to negotiate a “better” EU deal but campaign against it.Now he would put his deal to a second referendum but express no preference between that and remaining in the EU.He hasn’t a clue. He couldn’t say. It’s too hard. The Leader of the Opposition’s mind is a blank — not for the first time.He would merely “carry out whatever the people decide” . . . er, exactly as Boris Johnson would be doing NOWLabour wasn’t blocking him.Why does Corbyn, having failed to respect the first vote, imagine anyone trusts him to enact the result of a second The only certainty is that he WILL sell Leavers down the river, as The Sun predicted.Corbyn’s “Leave” deal would keep us in the EU’s customs union, handing it control of our economy while surrendering all our political influence.That’s the worst possible option. It’s not “leaving” at all. It’s Remain by another name. Corbyn is too dim to see it.His second referendum would thus be “Remain minus” vs Remain — a farce, absurdly biased and totally illegitimate.This coward, ditherer and fool could yet run the country, God help us.REMEMBER how our “broken” economy only works “for the few” Inflation is now just . per cent as pay leaps by . per cent, its fastest in  years.Everyone’s standard of living is rising.Remember Project Fear’s scares about the immediate catastrophe of voting Leave  A pack of lies.Unemployment is at a -year low, employment at an all-time high, thanks to new full-time jobs.Remember how the City would become a jobless wasteland  It is still easily the biggest global foreign exchange hub and pulling even further away from the competition.If this is how Britain shrugs off political mayhem, imagine what we will do once Brexit is done and uncertainty lts.VANESSA George’s crimes were wicked beyond belief.Some of the children she violated still suffer. So do their parents. So do others who still don’t even know whether their kids were abused because she refuses to say.This evil paedophile should not have been freed, even after ten years.

Not unless we want to be ruled by unelected judges and unelected millionaire litigants, on top of unelected peers and unaccountable Speakers.Andthese judges do now demand Parliament’s recall, what will Remainer MPs do with all their new sitting time They have already passed their law to “prevent No Deal”. And they are too ­terried of voters’ rage to topple the Government and face an election.What  is there  Unless they intend to go for broke and deploy their own Bercow-backed pseudo-Government to revoke Brexit entirely.This case has been an act of stupid, reckless constitutional vandalism — undermining the PM just as progress towards a new deal IS being made, as even Jean-Claude Juncker concedes.As for the spurious arguments against Boris, we recoil at the hypocrisy of John Major claiming that letting a PM suspend Parliament could enable future ones to axe elections or scrap the Army.Such scaremongering fantasies didn’t trouble him in  when HE did it — and swerved scrutiny over a bribery scandal engulfing his MPs.“This case is not about Brexit,” claims Supreme Court president Lady Hale.Pull the other one.THE Sun is proud to have taken a stand for disabled kids and their families, hit hard by Government cuts.And we’re honoured that the public interest journalism of our Give It Back ­campaign won the Media of the Year award from the charity Sense. The real prize, though, is that the ­Government IS listening. It must now reinstate the £million taken from respite care and vital equipment.Then we will truly celebrate.AFTER  years of negotiation, the EU’s huge trade deal with South America is vetoed by a single Austrian sub-committee.Proving two things: That an organisation so unwieldy is virtually incapable of making trade deals and Britain will be infinitely more nimble outside it.And that it is, sadly, delusional now to believe we could strike one with Brussels before the hated backstop kicked in.That’s why it must be killed off.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

His strategy is to offer a second referendum then fight a general election on classic Left Right lines.The problem with this plan is that British politics is so dominated by Brexit that you HAVE to have an answer on that before you can talk about anything .Is Jeremy Corbyn really intending to spend the entire election campaign refusing to say how he would vote in the referendum he is calling for Corbyn’s equivocation is a particular problem, given the clarity in the other parties’ positions.The Lib Dem conference agreed this week thatthe party won a majority in a general election — stop sniggering at the back — they would simply revoke Article .This clear policy is helping them scoop up more and more Remainer votes. One poll this week had them overtaking Labour and pulling in support from more than  per cent of those who backed Remain in .If the Lib Dems get anywhere near this level of support in a general election, then Labour will lose seats to BOTH the Lib Dems and the Tories.As one gleeful Cabinet minister points out, the Lib Dem position “shines a spot-light on Labour’s ambiguity”.Many in the Shadow Cabinet are worried about Corbyn’s refusal to say where he stands. Many of them want Labour to state clearly that it is the party of Remain.Expect an effort at next week’s Labour conference to change the party’s position to make it clear that as a party Labour WILL IN ALL CIRCUMSTANCES campaign for Remain in a second referendum.The other problem with Corbyn’s position is that it means this whole debate will just drag on. Another negotiation with Brussels followed by another referendum would take at least six months, and maybe more.This isn’t going to be popular with an electorate that wants this issue resolved so the country can move on and start addressing the domestic issues voters care about most.At the last election, Corbyn managed to skilfully straddle the Brexit ide.He hoovered up the votes of Remainers but with a manesto that promised to respect the referendum result, held on to heavily Leave-supporting seats too.It will be far harder,not impossible, for Corbyn to pull off that trick again. The danger for him is that his fence-sitting ends up alienating both groups.AT his book launch, David Cameron told the assembled guests that he had tried to avoid writing too much about scandals in the memoir.But he did remember when a Tory peer got caught up in an SM sting early in his leadership.It was put to him that he should remove the whip, to which Cameron replied: “Shouldn’t we take the handcuffs off too ”“WHAT was he thinking ’ one loyal, long-time supporter of David Cameron declared to me after the former PM revealed how he had worked behind the scenes to get the Queen to make an intervention in the Scottish independence referendum.The Palace is understandably cross about the revelation, which undermines the Queen’s political neutrality.One Whitehall source tells me the Palace are “apoplectic” about it and can’t understand why a former Prime Minister would break such an important confidence in such a pre-meditated way.Belatedly, Cameron seems to have realised the trouble he’s caused – refusing to answer further questions on it for TV.But as someone who has worked for three Tory leaders tells me: “It is one of the weirdest unforced errors I have ever seen.”As part of efforts to deal with this problem, Operation Anson has been launched. This week, the team involved arrested  people on suspicion of involvement in this activity after targeting  marinas and harbours.The test of this surge in enforcement activity will be whether it stamps out this vile trade before more people perish in the Channel.  Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It is what it is fam. The dirty ****.Other messages between Rowe and Coleman included advice for Wood to be flirty in messages to the footballer, to keep him enticed and draw him in.Rowe suggested that Wood, of Cleethorpes, should play it smooth - make him want this now.She sent the player a number of provocative messages ahead of their meeting, Simon Jones, prosecuting, said.He told the jury: The picture that is really building here is how carefully managed all of this is - it is all a sting.In one message, Wood told Tyrone Coleman: Something Im hella nervous about. What other girl would be willing to do this for you  As well as it benefits all of us I know.Coleman sent a screenshot of messages between Wood and the player - discussing football training and the cost of their hotel room - to Rowe.The player previously told how he and Wood had exchanged general chit chat on social media before meeting at a hotel.He would transfer money to Wood, who would pay for the hotel room and check in before he arrived - sending him the room number in a message.On the final occasion, the player said Wood seemed nervous and was using her mobile phone, which was odd as they were only going there for one thing.All of a sudden, two guys just walked into the room, he told jurors.One of the guys said something like: Is this what you are doing . It happened so quickly. It seemed so staged.I managed to get out of the window without without thinking how high up it was.The footballer took hold of a fire escape and was able to run down to a car park before fleeing into a nearby restaurant, where he took shelter until police arrived.His designer tracksuit and Rolex watch, which he had taken off in the room, were missing when officers went to it.Rowe was found to be wearing the tracksuit when he was arrested days later, awaiting a flight to Dubai.The watch was on the wrist of Ras Robinson, , who was charged with handling stolen goods.After leaving the hotel, the footballer received a message from Woods phone, stating that he had been in the wrong place at the wrong time and telling him to contact a number.I dont really want to expose you to the media butyou dont respond within  hours then you leave me no choice, it said.When asked about the message, the footballer told jurors: Obviously it is blackmail.Thats what they wanted to do - to get footage of me and take it to the papers.Wood, who has admitted conspiracy to blackmail, said she took part in the plot after discovering that the footballer had a partner.She said: I had previously asked himhe did have a partner and he would always shrug it off and say why was I askinghe was single, she said.I wanted his girlfriend to know that he had been cheating because it is not fair, its not right.She claimed the plan was for the footballer to be filmed in bed with her, then confronted by Rowe and Coleman, who would ask him for money.He was kissing me, he started to take his boxers down, Wood told the court.The key in the door went and Prince and Nathan came in the room.She said it did not go to plan as the footballer jumped out of the window before Rowe and Coleman could speak to him.Nathan Coleman, of Sussex, denies conspiracy to blackmail and two counts of thefts relating to the Rolex watch and designer tracksuit.His brother Tyrone Coleman, of Birmingham, denies conspiracy to blackmail.Prince Rowe, of Birmingham, denies conspiracy to blackmail and two counts of theft.Ras Robinson denies a charge of handling stolen goods relating to the watch.The trial will continue on Monday."},{"url":null,"title":"dawn butler tells labour get","story":"NewsDawn Butler tells Labour get s**t together! as she likens PMs backers to KKKThe Shadow Equalities Secretary gave a hard-hitting speech where she also branded the PM a \"cheater\", branded him \"Johnson by nature\", vowed a review of the far-right and urged more reparations over slaveryShareByDan BloomOnline Political Editor:,  SEP Updated:,  SEP NewsDawn Butler told Labour to get our s**t together\"Get the biggest politics stories by emailSubscribe We will use your email address only for the purpose of sending you newsletters.

The Shadow Women and Equalities Secretary announced Labour will commission an independent review of the far rightit gets into government. And after referring to Boris Johnson, and his supporters Donald Trump and far-right extremist Tommy Robinson, she told delegates: They may not wear pointy white hats anymore but they are still amongst us. The white supremacist Ku Klux Klan - a former senior member of whom backed Trump - infamously wore white pointed hats. Labour sources later claimed Ms Butler was talking about Boris Johnsonaposs supporters, including Robinson and Trump, but not the PM himself. Elsewhere, Ms Butler also said there must be further reparations paid from slavery after Glasgow University agreed to make available £million. She said: Other banks and businesses must follow. Labour will begin with consultation hubs in Liverpool, Bristol, Glasgow and London.    Ms Butler gave her speech after Labour kicked off its conference with a civil war, with left-wingers launching an aborted bid to boot out deputy leader Tom Watson. The equalities chief opened her speech by warning: The only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is that good people do nothing. She mocked the PM as Johnson by name, Johnson by nature and added: If we donapost get our s**t together, Boris Johnson is going to win. Boris Johnson, Donald Trump - these are just some of the bad racist men who are combining, and we are the good people who need to associate.    She added: For the first time in our country’s history, we have a Prime Minister who the far-right regard as their leader. Stephen Yaxley-Lennon - you may know him better by his stage name Tommy Robinson - he proclaimed aposWe Back Borisapos. And Boris’s close friend Donald Trump ’s campaign was supported by the Ku Klux Klan and its former Wizard. They may not wear pointy white hats anymore but they are still amongst us. She added: This is such a dark time in our history. Andwe donapost stand up to them now, it will get worse.  All you have to do is open the paper and look at social media and you can see the abuse. MPs and politicians are subjected to vile threats every single day. The person that threatened to kill me is in jail. People are being attacked in the streets, there is a huge rise in hate crime, people have been raped and beaten up just because they have a dferent point of view, or skin colour, or religion or just because of who they love.

Jeremy Corbyn asked the partyaposs ruling NEC to back a statement which committed a Labour government to get Brexit sorted one way or another within six months of coming to power.This would include thrashing out a new deal with the EU in three months and putting it back to the people in a referendum with an option to remain within six. The party would then decide how to campaign in that referendum in a one-day special conference.It says Labour will deliver whichever decision is made by the people of Britain.Sources said the statement was put to a meeting of Labour’s ruling NEC but not yet agreed.    There was not time for a vote by the NEC today because there was too much disagreement, sources said. Instead NEC members will now submit amendments to the statement for further consideration on Sunday or Monday. Pro-EU factions will now attempt to push the leader into an explicit pro-Remain stance, rather than waiting until after an election. “It’s not a done deal - it’s still being discussed,” a source said. A source said the statement was submitted by Jeremy Corbyn himself.  “It’s Jeremy trying to develop a position that is essentially a Remain position and keeps Leave supporters and voters on board,” they said. Labour MP Lloyd Russell Moyle who backs Jeremy Corbyn but opposes Brexit criticised the proposal.He said on Twitter : Why would the NEC call for a special conference on Brexit when we have the actual confence this week.We can not support kicking the can down the road longer, we are at the clf edge.

And Ms Formby - who revealed her diagnosis  months ago - thanked the army of NHS staff from nurses and doctors to cleaners and porters, saying: They saved my le.The powerful Jeremy Corbyn ally opened Labouraposs five-day conference in Brighton today in her first public appearance since her treatment earlier this year.Receiving a standing ovation and flowers from Mr Corbyn, she said: I also want to say a heart-felt thank you to all the incredible nurses and doctors, health care assistants, support workers, theatre staff, lab techs, porters, cleaners, and every other NHS worker who has given me such outstanding care, as they do for so many people every day.    They saved my le. But we all know our NHS is under existential threat. The predators are circling and the privatisation we’ve already seen is nothing in comparison to the threat posed by a Johnson-Trump trade deal. In America, my cancer treatment would cost upwards of , – and that’s without reconstruction. For far too many people who just canapost afford healthcare, a cancer or other health diagnosis can be a death sentence.But Labour won’t let that happen.Not only are we determined to stop what would be a disastrous No Deal Brexit , we’ve promised that the next Labour government will reverse the privatisation of our NHS andour health service into expert public control.She added: I’m not quite there yet but the love and solidarity that I’ve experienced from across our party and our movement has been incredible and I can’t tell you how much it’s been appreciated by me and my family. It comes two months after Ms Formby was embroiled in a huge public row over her treatment with deputy leader Tom Watson - who survived a bid to purge him today. In a letter to the general secretary in July, Mr Watson slammed the partyaposs response to a BBC Panorama film on anti-Semitism - claiming former staff had axes to grind - as breaching all common standards of decency.But in a searing reply obtained by the media, she said: Traducing my reputation and publicly attacking me, when you know I am undergoing chemotherapy and am unable to respond in the media, is another example of the inappropriate way in which you choose to discuss this issue. Panorama made claims that Ms Formby deleted e-mails relating to anti-Semitism cases.  Today the general secretary admitted there was more to do but insisted Labour had done more to modernise and streamline our disciplinary processes. She added: I know thereaposs more to do but we have made things better and will continue to. Weaposve strengthened our systems. We’ve launched our members’ booklet and webpage, ‘No Place for Antisemitism’ dealing with this vitally important issue. And we’re working on developing further educational materials to help our members to understand and challenge racism in all its forms wherever it raises its ugly head. She suggested critics of Labouraposs response - widely branded inadequate by Jewish groups - should focus on the Tories.  She said: Weaposve got the shame of an openly and unrepentant racist Prime Minister, presiding over a Tory party with many proven racists and Islamophobes amongst them, steadfastly refusing to take any action. But that doesn’t let us off the hook. We’re Labour and we’re better than that. We always have been and we won’t tolerate discrimination of any kind in our party. Ms Formby spoke as Labour was gripped by two rows - over a failed ditching of Tom Watson as deputy, and over Labouraposs Brexit policy. Today the general secretary blasted both Mr Watson for criticising the leadership - and those who tried to remove him. She said: It’s so important that every one of us, whether members or elected members, focuses % on defeating the Tories and their vicious policies that are causing so much damage. As conference opened, Labour treasurer Diana Holland triumphantly denied claims that Labour had asked for a loan to cover its finances. But an annual report confirmed the party has lost around , members, down to , in December . And Labour International delegate Kate Laycock slammed conference event organisers for taking unacceptable sponsorship money from firms including BP and Heathrow and Gatwick Airports. She fumed: You wouldnapost have events on lung cancer sponsored by Benson and Hedges. Why have events on the climate crisis sponsored by the climate killers  Meanwhile a row raged at the highest levels of Labour over Brexit as members pushed for the party to back Remain. Jeremy Corbyn submitted a statement to the ruling NEC this morning that would have given Labour three months after winning an election to reach a Brexit deal. There would then be a referendum. But Labouraposs stance in that referendum would only be settled in a special conference after more than three months.

Katherine says the school insists being clean shaven is in the guidelines and unorm policy which Tollbar Multi-Academy Trust, which runs Somercotes, has confirmed. But she also says she has been told that being unshaven is “scruffy” and clean shaven is “smart”.  She said: “I absolutely disagree. I don’t believe that teachers should be going around schools targeting and approaching students to tell them they need to go home and start shaving. “It is a very personal choice and a very inidual characteristic, purely governed by how late or early any child reaches puberty.

He said: “I was surprised, it was pretty weird that they were telling me to shave. Some of my friends shave and they have sore faces and it looks horrible.”  In the unorm and appearance rules parents and pupils are given a list of what is “NOT allowed at all in an academy”. One is: “Beards of moustaches, or sideburns below the earlobes”. A spokesperson for the school said it has a “very clear dress and appearance policy” and exceptions were only made on religious grounds. The Trust said it was entitled to set its own standards and they were not breaking any rules or breaching pupils’ human rights. It also said all parents signed an agreement to comply with the school’s policies.  Speaking to BBC Look North, Katherine said: “Oliver was asked to go home and shave what they class as a beard, he has a beard. Initially they wanted to isolate him at any break or lunchtime and he wasn’t allowed to represent the school. “We’ve pushed forward and he’s allowed to attend freely at school, just like any other pupil, until we can resolve the issue. “He’s still a child.

I remember saying to the consultant: ‘I can’t have cancer, my le with my fiancé is just beginning.’  I wanted answers to all these questions but didn’t want to hear them. I felt so overwhelmed with dferent emotions. I also kept flitting between feeling physically sick with worry - to relief that I finally had a concrete answer.” After the diagnosis, Rebecca underwent  and a half hours of surgery at the Queenaposs Medical Cente in Nottingham. Surgeons removed the right side of her tongue and then took the skin and an artery from her left arm to build her a new tongue. The team of doctors also removed the right lymph nodes in her neck and two back teeth so the tongue would fit. Rebecca added: “I woke to find my arm bandaged, two drains coming out of my neck, a tracheostomy and a feeding tube.    Whilst recovering in hospital, I went through a lot of ups and downs. I couldn’t speak for a week and could only communicate through writing everything down. My trachea would leak, and I would end up with crusty secretions around my neck, my arm was like a dead weight and I had very restricted movement in my neck. I couldn’t do anything independently and relied on the nurses to wash, dress and move me. I felt trapped inside my own body. My self-esteem was at an all-time low.” Rebecca said she struggled to get back to normal when she was discharged from hospital. She said: “Meal times were hard because I had to eat pureed food, I was breathless, I couldn’t shower easily because of my scars and I needed help to go to the toilet. I wanted to feel like ‘me’ again.” Rebecca is speaking out about coming to terms with le post surgery saying: The cancer ing was always at the forefront of my mind - it was my biggest fear.

Then she had drinks tipped over her at break time. Since then, sheaposs been shoved up the wall and kicked in the stomach. The bullies have followed her on the way home and even tried to push her under a car.    “One time she said she was kicked in the toilets and went straight to her teacher but was told she didn’t have time to deal with it. “Then the bullies told her to slit her wrists otherwise they were going to do it for her. She came home and got a piece of glass and took it to her bedroom. When I went to her there were marks on her wrists.” The mum, from Nechells, Birmingham, added the abuse has continued online via her phone too who says it is making it dficult for her to escape her bullies. She went on: “She’s suffered online bullying too where they’ve been telling her to go and kill herself. “It’s mostly three girls her own age who do the bullying.  The heartbroken mum says she has had more than  meetings with the school and, in despair, decided to take her daughter out of classes at the start of July. She was due to begin Year  in September - a crucial time for preparing for her GCSEs. “I decided to take her out of school because she wasn’t safe,” the mum said. “I’m trying to transfer her to another school now. She’s really changed as a result of the bullying. When she started in Year , she was fine. “Now, she’s a loner who is scared to leave the house. Her anxiety levels are so high. Sometimes I have to force her to go out. She has no friends, she just keeps herself to herself in the bedroom most of the time. She never used to be like this.” Feeling she was not getting any answers from the school, the mum has set up a petition where she’s trying to get the children responsible excluded from the school.  “I want to get these bullies out of the school and put somewhere that can deal with their behaviour,” she said. “The school staff say they have spoken to their parents but it seems the school cannot deal with them. I think they should have been excluded a while ago. “It’s not fair, why are they there enjoying themselves whilst my daughter is having to stay at home missing out on her education  She added: I’ve been trying to give the school chances to make this right. I’ve had meetings with the governors and I demanded her files but there was nothing in there about her bullying complaints being dealt with. “It’s horrible for my other children to see what’s happening to their sister. As a mum, you just want your children to be happy. No mother wants to see this happening to her child. You hear things on news about kids committing suicide due to bullying – I don’t want this to be my child which is why I’ve set up this petition.

Today the independent prep school in Battersea, south London, is known nationally and internationally as the aposroyal schoolapos. The family-owned establishment was picked to educate six-year-old Prince George and his four-year-old sister Princess Charlotte. They are on the schoolaposs roll as George and Charlotte Cambridge. So what happens inside the school thataposs responsible for educating the countryaposs future king and what are the parents of its other pupils like   The Thomasaposs group is run by brothers Ben and Tobyn Thomas, who are the sons of Joanna Thomas, a former actress who established the schools in . Thomasaposs also has three other schools in London located in Clapham, Fulham and Kensington.  According to The Times , parents who send their children to Thomasaposs are financially comfortable andyou are a teacher there, you could receive an exciting invitation to join a pupilaposs family on holiday -  in exchange for some tutoring in the sun.  But first of all you have to aposwinapos your child a place at Thomasaposs as all children are tested at the age of three using aposplay-basedapos and aposage appropriateapos guidlines. Thomasaposs has a reputation for academic success but the school also teaches other aposle skillsapos including communicative tricks. Employers often tell us they find it dficult to recruit people with the skills they need, Ben said. People who can look you in the eye, collaborate and communicate , show creativity and critical thinking, and have reslilence.  Once your child wins a place there are a host of extra activities on offer, including one-to-one music lessons costing £ per term - with parents having to commit that their child will practice their instrument daily. For those parents who dread the school run, or fancy a lie-in, Thomasaposs offers a aposchaufferingapos service where your child is collected from your front door by a school bus and ed home at the end of the day. The cost is £ a term or you can pay £ for either morning or afternoon pick ups. Ben Thomas has strongly refuted speculation that the school prohibits its pupils from having aposbest friendsapos.  He said: I would never seek to legislate on childrenaposs friendships. The schoolaposs website has sample menus for meals offered to its pupils with offerings including pan friend turky escalope in honey, lemon and garlic, seasoned salmon fillet on wilted spinach or macaroni organic cheese topped with cherry tomatoes - all dishes are freshly prepared. There are also vegan, vegetarian, fish, gluten-free and dairy options . The school has a three-week menu cycle which changes with the season so children are given lighter meals in the summer and more filling choices when the weather turns cold.  There are fears that the school will lose its aposnormalnessapos because of its royal connections, but the year before Prince George enrolled demand was increasing so much that it stopped taking registrations for  months. A influx of keen parents desperate for their children to join the school resulting in their system sensationally crashing. Parents will be able to register online again from next year but a new rule has come into play - your child must be at least a year old. Ben Thomas said: I decided we had to change things after a heavily pregnant woman had an argument with our office, pleading to get her unborn child an early place on the list.

The two took the average £ flight with their three children Charlotte, George and Louis to spend the late August bank holiday with the Queen at her summer residence.

Not only were they planning their dream honeymoon, they had also just found out they were pregnant with their first child. But their dream le turned into a nightmare following their first baby scan when Katie was given the heartbreaking news she had bladder cancer. The -year-old from Huddersfield, West Yorkshire, was delighted to find out she was pregnant in February last year. But after she suffered some bleeding early on in her pregnancy she was sent for an early scan.    Nothing could have prepared her and husband, Tom, for what was to follow. Katie, who owns her own cake business, said: It was very surreal. We were told they could hear a heartbeat, so we knew everything was OK with the pregnancy, which was a massive relief and we were really excited. But then we were called into another room and a senior consultant said there was something amiss with my bladder and that it was probably cancer. My mind just went blank at the beginning, I was just in shock as it was so unexpected. But then practicality just kicked in and we knew we had to get on with things.    The next step was a cystoscopy, which looks inside the bladder, and Katie and Tomaposs fears were confirmed - she did have cancer. The coupleaposs dreams of a sunshine honeymoon in Crete were over and their trip was cancelled. When she was just  weeks pregnant, Katie had to undergo surgery to remove as much of the tumour as possible. To make it as safe as possible for her unborn baby, doctors used a special machine that meant she was awake throughout the hour-long operation. Thankfully, doctors managed to remove a chunk of the tumour and the baby was unharmed.    Katie said: When they told us the pregnany was fine, that was an amazing feeling. When they pulled the curtains around my bed, every nurse on the ward had stopped what they were doing to check everything was OK with the baby. Usually, treatment would have started straight away but because of Katieaposs pregnancy that wasnapost an option. So, two months before she was due, the mum-to-be had another cystoscopy, which heartbreakingly revealed there was still some tumour on her bladder. Baby Oscar was induced a week early and was a healthy, bouncing boy.    But for Katie, the battle was far from over. Just days after she and Tom ed home with their baby boy she had to go back into hospital for more surgery and to start her cancer treatment. In January this year, new mum Katie began a six week course of chemotherapy, which was pumped directly into her bladder to reduce the side effects. But she admits, that with a newborn at home, the gruelling treatment was tiring. Katie said: It was tiring and I just wanted to be with Oscar and at home but I was having to go to hospital once a week for treatment.

Stomach-churning photos show the grim reality of le inside the property in Runcorn, Cheshire. A cleaning team lted the lid on how such are cleared and described it as one of the worst cases they had ever seen. Neighbours living next door reported seeing rats jumping in the window and couldnapost even sit out in their garden out of fears over the vermin infestation, the Liverpool Echo reported Grandparents Stephen Dowd, , and Colette Dowd, , have lived next to this rat-infested home for years and say it has taken a toll on their everyday lives.  Business owners Stephen and Colette said they couldnapost let their grandchildren play outside because they feared rats were on the childrenaposs toys. They added they could not believe the scale of clutter shown to them after they saw the interior of the crumbling home. Our reporter was invited in to see the true scale of the problem by Merseyside House Clearing, who are tasked with cleaning out the mountains of rubbish found inside. The companyaposs owner,  George Mensah , said he has been tasked with gutting properties that are packed to the brim with clutter and described this example as one of the worst cases he had seen in  years.    The first thing noticed was the overwhelming smell of damp, dust and dead vermin. A number of toasters, kettles and electrical items were piled up among the sea of items, as well as decade-old magazines. A thick grime was visible on the walls, fridge and windows as the lace, white curtains had turned black on the windows. Georgeaposs first-hand footage revealed how far the stacked items stretched. A dead rat was also visible on top of the discarded fireplace.  Stephen, who has lived next to the home for  years, said he and his we had previously tried to help the owners. They have made the brave decision to buy the property in the hopes of helping to restore the home to what it used to be. The tenants have since been moved into a temporary house and are on the road to getting another home. Stephen said: “It’s been unbelievable really, we had no idea what we were living next to. We came home off holiday and saw rats running round our garden, then we got in touch with environmental health who came and left rat poison, and then we realised it must have been coming from next door.” Colette, a former member of the armed forces, added: “We didn’t know the extent of it, there was no way of knowing they were living like that. We just kept saying there’s something not right here.    “We’ve been saying you can’t believe that someone could live like that. We’re still in shock, every day you’re finding something more shocking.” During the summer’s heatwave, Stephen said the couple were unable to leave any windows or doors open, for fear of rats and flies, and had to invest in air conditioning supplies. George’s company routinely clean hoarder’s properties, but said it is “rare” you hear form neighbours and communities whose lives are affected. He said: “We are very passionate about our work and are non-judgmental towards the inidual in question. “A lot of clients and their families are embarrassed over the situation, we do a lot of work with mental health organisations, the majority of hoarders tend to be the elderly who live on their own.  “Saying that, hoarding has no preference, no conscience.” He added: “We’ve helped people who collect cigarette butts, people who collect dead cats in shoe boxes. One of the worst ones we found was someone who had a sex dungeon hidden. “You name it, we’ve seen it, everyone has a secret. George said: “Each job you take on, it’s like the person becomes part of you, you grow to love it. It’s like becoming a carer and a whole lot of people who you help you end up becoming friends with.” Stephen and Colette said they “felt sorry” for their neighbours and have called for more help to be given to hoarders. Colette said: “I think there needs to be a special helpline like they [have] for Childline, because people are desperate and they need help.

Bobbie Dixon, from Hull, claims to have killed seven of the vermin since the beginning of summer by using traps and poison.The widow told Hull Live the rats run around the gardens at the back of the houses and she has stepped in multiple times to remove rats other residents are scared to touch.She said: “I’ll be sitting outside and rats will just run across the garden – it’s unnerving for people.  “There was one dead on the grass yesterday and everyone  is scared of them so I just picked it up. I’m sure it’s not just here. I bet the whole country is bloody covered with them but it is a problem. At first Ms Dixon caught the rats in traps but she said she was told to stop putting them out by Environmental Health after residents complained about the vermin. She said: “I caught the first four in traps that I laid down. But I was told by Environmental Health that I shouldn’t be using traps and I should put poison down instead. “They said other animals could get caught in the traps. I only ever put them in safe places but I started putting poison down instead.”  She has since caught another three rats with the poison she buys from the shops but she said the root of the problem is the overflowing bins near her home. They’re just overflowing with food, she said. “It’s a disgrace. You end up standing in it walking past. People in wheelchairs are having to go over that and little bains in prams, and it’s just not right. “It’s not the residents’ fault, the landlords haven’t given them big enough bins so there is just food everywhere rats can get at.” "},{"url":null,"title":"princess dianas clever trick journalists","story":"NewsPrincess Dianas clever trick to get journalists on her side - and it worked a treatIngrid Seward, editor-in-chief of Majesty magazine, says Princess Diana was \"one of the most media savvy women in the world\"ShareCommentsByZoe ForseyLestyle Editor:,  SEP Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news video journalist-ingrid-seward-interviewed-princess-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror UK News , options :,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,irisTvEnabled:true,imaVersion:,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,displayPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,mvtTests:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true,hidePreviewImage:,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror UK News , options :,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,irisTvEnabled:true,imaVersion:,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,displayPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,mvtTests:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true,hidePreviewImage:\"\"Get the biggest Royal Family stories by emailSubscribe We will use your email address only for the purpose of sending you newsletters.

Rather than getting her press office to call them and tell them off, she had a much more direct approach - and it worked a treat. If she ever read a story she believed was unfair or incorrect, she would reach out to the person who wrote it and invite them over to Kensington Palace for a cup of tea. Ingrid Seward, editor-in-chief of Majesty magazine, was one of the journalists to receive the invitation shortly before the princessapos tragic death in . She went to her apartment and the two women enjoyed a girly chat Speaking to the Sun, she said: Her way of dealing with “the enemy” was to invite them into her home, flatter them and make them your supporter.    Diana was one of the most media savvy women in the world and she knew no one would be able to resist one of her invitations. She knew we would feel obliged to put her opinion acrosswe had spent some time with her. It always worked. We were all charmed by Diana and her disarming way of putting her point across. Ingrid was just one of a number of high profile journalists to receive an invite, with Piers Morgan and Jeremy Paxman having the same honour.    Ingrid believes Prince Harry should follow his motheraposs example when it comes to dealing with the media. She believes the way he has handled the privacy of his son Archie, including banning photos from the christening and not releasing the names of the godparents, is pushing the press away. Diana had a number of other clever tricks when it came to dealing with the press, and one which always worked very well when it came to getting rid of photographers. Her personal trainer Jenni Rivett told Yahooaposs The Royal Box about a fashion tactic she used when attending their gym sessions. She said: Every single session all the media were outside camped with their stepladders, and cameras and lenses and everything.  For her she just found it so incredibly, aposwhy are they so interested in me when there is more important things to worry about in the worldapos. It wasnapost her that asked for all this. I remember one of her strategies was that she was going to wear the same Virgin Active sweatshirt every single session. This meant the photos were all the same and looked dated, so were less valuable to photographers.  I thought that was very clever of her. The famous Virgin Atlantic sweatshirt, which Diana would wear three times a week to her fitness classes, last year sold for £,. The jumper fetched more than ten times its reserve when it went up for auction on Wednesday night.

Clouds will increase across much of the British Isles with outbreaks of rain in the west. The southwest of England and Wales, however, are those set to be hit by the heaviest rain.

Motorists have been advised to avoid travelling in heavy downpours and where possible, to choose main roads where the risk of fallen branches, debris and flooding are reduced.

The ­polished oak floors that wounded ­British soldiers were laid out on. The lawn outside where troops dug trenches to fend off the Nazis and the rose garden at the back, where  corpses were hastily buried in unmarked graves. The horse chestnut tree in the front garden, which saved the le of one British soldier by taking the force of a mortar bomb blast – and still bears the scars. And the cellar where her mother hid her five small children from the horrors of war playing out just metres away – but from where Sophie could hear the injured soldiers’ groans and feel the force of artillery blasts as the Germans edged closer. The Old Vicarage, next to a church in the picturesque village of Oosterbeek, Holland, had been an idyllic family home.But then war broke out and the house was at the centre of one of the biggestdisasters of the Allied fightback – in which Sophie’s mother, Kate, emerged as a hero known as the Angel of Arnhem.This week, exactly  years on, veterans have been ing, welcomed with as much warmth as they were all those years ago. Sophie still remembers the events of that week vividly. Now , she still lives in the Old Vicarage. She says: “I cherish this house and feel privileged to live here. It’s where British men gave their lives to free Europe. I’ve lived with their memories all my le. I think of them all the time.” Of the , men from the st Airborne Division who took part in Operation Market Garden in September , just , would make it out again after a vicious nine-day battle. The rest were killed or taken prisoner.  The plan was for the troops to drop into the town of Arnhem and seize a key bridge on the Rhine, then cling on until an armoured column could arrive and reinforce them. But German resistance was greater than expected and the Battle of Arnhem was the most devastating clash of the war, as portrayed in Richard Attenborough’s epic  film A Bridge Too Far. As they ran out of food and ammo, and ground reinforcements failed to arrive, the remnants of the force found themselves hemmed in on the outskirts of Oosterbeek. Housewe Kate opened her house – just  metres from the front line – as a makesht first aid station. Within days it was packed with  men and she spent her days and nights offering motherly love, plus words of comfort and strength, to the injured and dying British troops who filled every room, even the attic. Sophie recalls feeling at first exhilaration at seeing British paratroopers marching down their street following four years of Nazi occupation.  She says: “We went out and took a long time hugging the soldiers. We all kissed and embraced, and we were so happy, because we were free. “My father, a resistance leader, climbed the church tower and raised a Dutch flag. We thought the war had come to an end. “That was my first memory, that collective feeling of happiness at that moment.” But the mood soon changed... Sophie says: “Mother put us in the cellar, with a nanny. She would come and go. We heard the noise and tremors of the grenades and mortars. We didn’t know what mother was having to deal with. She transmitted a sense of safety, so I never felt fear. She later told me the house was so full of injured soldiers there wasn’t space to walk. And all the time it was being bombarded.  We saw the British just once, when she brought in a shell-shocked soldier named Lionel, as she thought it might help him being with us. He sat with us on the steps. I remember the feel of his jacket and that he gave me a piece of his chocolate.” Kate, meanwhile, was earning her name as an angel, tending to the injured, often frightened, soldiers. One paratrooper is reported to have told her “You’re lovely, just like my mum” moments before he died. General Frank King, cared for by Kate after being shot in the leg, wrote: “I noticed how the whole room brightened up at her arrival and how the soldiers hung on to her every word.” As men died, they were buried in Kate’s garden. Under relentless sniper fire, the young Army doctor in charge was twice wounded. Orderlies were killed moving stretchers and some of the wounded were shot dead as they lay inside the house.  On the ninth day, the British got orders to withdraw and , escaped across the Rhine. Furious at how Oosterbeek had helped the British, the Germans ordered everyone to leave the village. Sophie remembers: “Mother took us out and put a blanket over our heads so we didn’t see the bodies of British soldiers. But a little further down the road the blanket fell off and I saw the bodies of four Germans. It affected me greatly. I pass that spot every day and every day for the rest of my le I’ve thought of them.”  After the war, Kate refused to accept she was a hero. When soldiers clubbed together for a plaque to honour her, she insisted her name be taken off. But in ,  years before her death, she accepted an honorary MBE. Sophie’s younger brother Michiel, , says: “She thought anyone would have done what she did. She would say the real angels were the ones who fell from heaven, the brave men of the Airborne Division.” After Kate, husband Jan and their children ed to the Old Vicarage in , veterans and their relatives began to turn up, to thank her. Tragedy struck in , when her oldest son Pieter was killed by a leftover anti-tank mine by the Rhine. It did not stop Kate honouring the Brits who gave their lives to liberate Holland, making the house and its beautul gardens a living monument to them. In the shade of a cedar tree at the bottom of her garden, she put a statue of Pegasus, the symbol of the British airborne forces.  Kate died in , aged , after a car hit her and Jan outside the Old Vicarage. She was thrown into her garden, dying in the same place as so many soldiers she had cared for. Jan, who broke both knees, was nursed back to health by the same doctor, named Martin, who ran the first aid post during the battle. He flew over from England as soon as he heard of the accident. Since her mother’s death, Sophie has continued to receive British veterans, some of whom have become lelong friends. They include the family of Colonel Freddie Kemp OBE, a survey officer from the st Airlanding Light Regiment who led the troops holed up around the Old Vicarage. His grandson, also named Freddie, , often stays with Sophie at her house.  Freddie said: “Grandpa got to know Kate because he ended up having to bury most of his men in her garden. He told me the house was sniped at all the time. In the end, they had one gun they used to protect the house and keep the Germans away to evacuate. “He swam across the Rhine three times, carrying injured. He became a vicar but never forgot Kate, even naming my mum after her. Our families have been close ever since.” Another visitor was Lionel, the shell-shocked soldier. Sophie says: “In  he arrived in my garden. His grandson had literally dragged him. He said he had nightmares about that cellar and refused to come back.  “I remembered his name, even though I was only five at the time. At that, he burst into tears and fell into my arms. We both cried and I took him to see the cellar again. Later, I received a letter from him. He said that from that moment on his nightmares had stopped. He thanked me for finally giving him peace.” And the gratitude of Oosterbeek has not waned. Airborne Forces flags and Union Jacks hang from houses and shops. Fashion boutiques display clothes and bags with the Pegasus symbol, while a sweet shop sells boxes of Airborne chocolates.

It wasnapost zero to  in one day, she explained. It was introduced piecemeal, along with constant emotional, financial reinforcement that this was the path, the only path. Epstein also preyed on her insecurities and made her reliant on him, she claimed. She added: For me, I was involved in that kind of lestyle growing up and so I thought I could cope. And I thought I could handle it.    She told of how Epsteinaposs cronies would turn a blind eye to his behaviour. Ms De Georgiou said: In every location there was this microcosm of acceptance, of yes people, who acted like this was normal. If youaposre a young person walking into a mansion or someoneaposs island and all the people who are present are acting as though this is OK and youaposre the only one who thinks itaposs weird, itaposs hard to say something. She claimed Epstein molested her at his mansion in New York as well as at his huge property in the Caribbean dubbed aposOrgy Islandapos by locals. But she felt powerless to help the other girls being abused by the tycoon.  After seeing a girl younger than herself, she said:  I wanted to say something. I was in the ocean and she was on a paddleboard or something...and I wanted to say, aposYou have to leave.apos But I didnapost. After escaping Epsteinaposs clutches, she went on to land a role in the Jude Law film “Alfie” in , before moving to Los Angeles to pursue her Hollywood dream. She said she has found solace in speaking with fellow victims. The former model now works at The Kintsugi Foundation - which runs a refuge for women battling trauma or addiction.

There were no survivors. An inquest into the hikersapos deaths noted oneaposs tongue was missing, anotheraposs clothes were aposradioactiveapos and one man had bitten off his own finger. Tents were slashed from the inside and most of the bodies were found partially naked. In  years, nobody has been prosecuted and theories have ranged from yetis, missile testing, territorial indigenous tribes, storms and mass hysteria. The coroner, under the guidance of the Soviet Union, eventually attributed the mysterious deaths to aposhypothermiaapos. But now, with advances in forensic technology and compelling new insights, could this mysterious old case finally be solved for good  Together with journalists from Ruptly, a leading forensic expert, and local guides,invites you to review this ground-breaking video investigation. Decide for yourself - was it hypothermia or something far more sinister  The crime scene and the victims  Igor Dyatlov was expected to send a telegram to his sports club from the Urals no later than February  about the groups progress but no such message was received. After families became concerned for the groupaposs welfare, a rescue mission was launched with army and militsiya forces searching the area by plane and helicopter. On February  , searchers stumbled upon badly damaged tents, which had been torn down the middle from the inside. Footprints were found at the scene, though bizarrely not in complete sets. Some could have been made with bare feet.  The bodies of Krivonischenko and Doroshenko were soon found. They were shoeless and dressed only in underwear. Branches on a nearby tree were broken, suggesting one member of the group had climbed up to look out for something. Searchers later found three more bodies: Dyatlov, Kolmogorova and Slobodin. Finding the remaining members took more than two months. Three of the four were discovered more dressed than others. Dubinina was wearing Krivonishenkoaposs burned, torn trousers and her left foot and shin were wrapped in a torn jacket. New forensic findings show aposdefensive woundsapos  One expert delved deeper into some of the injuries found on the bodies of the hikers to establishthey could have been inflicted by a person. This video retraces the steps of the group. First it shows a number of dummies designed to aid coroners and forensic experts by demonstrating how wounds are inflicted - particularly how a certain movement could result in a certain type of injury. Eduard Tumanov, Doctor of forensics at Pirogov Russian National Research Medical University, said: “The injuries described in the Dyatlov forensic medical report are identical to the ones represented here on these dummies, which gives use reason to assume that these injuries could be received in self defence.”  “Dyatlov. He has small grazes on his face, the protruding parts of his face, which allows us to suppose that they could have been caused by him falling face first in the snow. “These abrasions happened because his legs were tied together with something. They were either handcuffed or shackled, or bound with some sort of rope, because, in the cold, rope freezes up and becomes fairly solid. “There is a very interesting note in the forensic medical report: there are red-brown coloured grazes and indentations around the front, side and rear surfaces of both ankles. “It’s interesting that he has abrasions on his metacarpophalangeal joints, which are here. What does this mean  He hit his hands against something or someone. Judging by everything, there was a fight.”  aposThere was no explosion or avalancheapos Doctor Eduard Tumanov says: So they light a fire and take their clothes off to dry them, at which point something or someone terries them and they start to climb up the cedar tree, because they have injuries consistent with climbing up a tree trunk. Straight away we can rule out death by avalanche, explosion, we can rule out chemical weapons, nuclear weapons, electromagnetic weapons, etc. The theory that animals attacked, bears, wolverines, etc...there are no injuries consistent with an animal attack. Judging by the chaotic nature of the injuries, iety, would suggest that there was not one single object that would have caused these injuries to everyone. In summary, one could assert that someone attacked them, someone without a firearm, or at least they didn’t use it, without a kne, or they didn’t use it, all the injuries were caused exclusively by hard, blunt objects. They were probably inflicted by a human hand. Unpacking one skieraposs chilling aposmessageapos  Former Editor-in-Chief of Russiaaposs Pravda, formerly the communist party of the Soviet Union paper, has also expressed doubt of any kind of aposmissile testingapos but he does believe the incident was apospre-plannedapos. Vladimir Sungorkin said: When one of the most mysterious characters, the most mysterious person in the group called Zolotarev got on the train, he was accompanied by a big group of students and he said ‘We are going on such an unusual hike that we’ll be renowned afterwards.’ We have no explanation for this, it’s absurd. Why would you become famous just going hiking  One could theorise that they were conducting some sort of experiments with drugs, adaptogens, performance enhancing drugs. Maybe for the military, the KGB, or cosmonauts. Maybe, having taken this medicine, unknown to us, they could lose their minds and kill each other in all these dferent ways. While this theory is speculative, it could help to make sense of the radio activity at the scene and why nothing known to medical experts showed up on the toxicology report. When askedhe thought they had been testing missiles, he said: So a rocket went off course, whataposs next  They say that there was a missile testing range here. This is absurd. What is a testing range  It is a specially-equipped site.  He continued: There are devices there, there is surveillance. Everything is cordoned off. And these mountains were climbed by five groups of tourists. It is a popular place, because the mountains are bare and beautul, and the taiga is also beautul. There were five groups of tourists there. And they all went through Ushma. On visiting the pass sixty years on he noticed some key unusual points. They climbed up the cedar. They’re all scratched up. One of them has a piece of finger they’ve bitten off in their mouth. It remained in his mouth, he bit his finger off. So he died, it’s clear he bit his finger off because he was in agony, otherwise, why  would you bite your own finger off  He died there as a result of this pain. When they analysed burns on his leg, they once thought that he fell and was burnt, but the burn did not show this. The person was either hung above the fire or they took a log from the fire and burned him on the cedar from below. Can you imagine this  It’s unusual to say the least. The missing clothing and ruling out a Mansi killing   As theories fly, there is one worth mentioning. As all of the hikers were found in barely any clothing, it is possible they could have simply succumbed to hypothermia. One symptom of this is known as aposparadoxical undressingapos, when a person is in the final stages of hypothermia they believe they are boiling and undress despite the freezing conditions. What this does not explain is why the hikers ran from their tents, down the mountain and into the trees. One theory that has haunted local people is that aposthe Mansiapos - a local indigenous tribe - could have been behind the killing. But speaking to Ruptlyaposs Russian correspondent, one Mansi guide said it couldnapost have been his people behind the shocking deaths. He said: They [the Mansi] only come here in the summer, at the end of May to hunt deer. When the snow falls, they go to the forest. Since the death of the hikers, the Mansi have nicknamed Dyatlov passaposKholat Syakhlapos or aposthe Deadly Mountainapos.

Our design drawings, which are DMRBcompliant, clearly demonstrate this.“This option makes the best economic, environmental and common sense and we call on the Transport Secretary to ensure that this option is back on the table.”Vice-chairman Mark Robertson made a presentation to those in attendance, where he described the option.He said: “Neither of the two routes use existing infrastructure, they’re entirely new roads.“Our option is only km inand it uses a large amount of existing infrastructure.“Our estimates are that there would be hundreds of acres of land taken and lost to this construction.“Not just the road, but all the surrounding working area.“We estimate that  farms would be fragmented – around  fields cut in half. In some cases that would impact the viability of the farm.“There are three equestrian centres that would be affected, and might have to close, which would result in job losses and half a million pounds to the economy.”A Transport Scotland spokesman said: “The design work for the challenging east of Huntly to Aberdeen scheme is well under way.“Having let local residents see and comment on the initial options last October, we held further engagement events in May for the remaining options being taken forward to the next stage of design and over , people took the opportunity to come along and view the material with approximately  written responses received.“All feedback received is vital, including that from the A Action Group, and will be taken into consideration as we look to identy a preferred option for the scheme”"},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/09/2.44307150-240x180.jpg srcset=https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/09/2.44307150-496x372.jpg 620w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/09/2.44307150-752x564.jpg 940w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/09/2.44307150-240x180.jpg 300w ","title":"caravans proposal at north east farm","story":"Plans have been lodged to build a caravan site for seasonal workers at a north-east farm.The owners of Haughhead Farm near Laurencekirk want to install  caravans to provide temporary homes for staff preparing daffodils.The production of the flowers and their bulbs is one of the business’s main operations and it can produce one to two million bunches every year.Documents submitted alongside the blueprints said it was important to offer staff “suitable on-site accommodation”.It said the proposed site is “inconspicuous” and it would be surrounded by screening made up of beech hedgerows, large trees, bunds, natural topography and farm buildings.It said: “It is proposed that the caravans will be occupied on a seasonal basis, predominately between the months of April to September, and will remain on site all year round.”"},{"url":null,"title":"live blog aberdeen and inverness oor wullie statues go under the hammer1","story":"The Oor Wullie#s BIG Bucket Train auctions continue tonight with the Aberdeen and Inverness statues set to go under the hammer.The sculptures, which were on display in the north-east and Inverness, are set to raise thousands for the Archie Foundation.Aberdeen and Inverness’s Oor Wullie#s BIG Bucket Trail LIVE Auction!Posted by The Archie Foundation Grampian on Tuesday,  September Last night an amazing £, was raised for The Archie Foundation Tayside at an event at Dundee Rep.Tonight#s auction takes place at the Thainstone Centre and gets under way at .pm, you can follow all the action live below."},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/09/2.44881494-2-240x180.jpg srcset=https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/09/2.44881494-2-496x372.jpg 620w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/09/2.44881494-2-752x564.jpg 940w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/09/2.44881494-2-240x180.jpg 300w ","title":"north east charity to host rock n roll bingo","story":"A north-east charity is holding a unique bingo event to celebrate its birthday.Clan Cancer Support, which has bases across the north-east, is inviting people to its first ever Rock ’n’ Roll bingo event on its th birthday.The event will take place on September  at Clan House in Aberdeen.Unlike traditional bingo, players will be listening out for a mix of tunes rather than numbers to win prizes throughout the night.Community fundraising manager Neil Martin said: “Rock ’n’ Roll bingo is a really fun game for every generation.

We do at the moment have a dentist and fully qualied staff and are happy with their work.Rumour has it that the aforementioned dentist and staff will be taking on patients from Mid Argyll Hospital, which I presume they tend to already.But the practice is to lose its local NHS patients, so they will deal solely with patients who require dental treatment from the hospital. I think this situation leaves the NHS patients in limbo.I am sure we would rather that the current dentist and all of her staff be given a chance to voice their opinions on this matter as much and as well as the local populace.Yes, it will be brilliant to have both dentists in the town. There is the possibility that those on the local list who are currently treated well by the dental department at the hospital maybe still seen by the dentist and her staff, but I would like this to be confirmed by the local NHS trust.Brian MacDonald, CrinanSir,Hundreds of people across Scotland have been helped through their exam results by a local group of Skills Development Scotlandcareers advisers.Based across the north of Scotland, the advisers were part of a team taking calls at the SDS Exam Results Helpline from am on results day.The helpline is a vital service, supporting young people and their families at what can be one of the most stressful times of their lives.Expert advice and guidance is available all year round, not just on results day.Our professionally qualied careers advisers are working in every state secondary school in Scotland and from our network of high street centres across the country.In schools, careers services are delivered one-to-one, in classrooms and at school events across all year groups, supporting young people to develop the skills to make informed career decisions throughout their lives.

Now I am not saying this is the simplest or even healthiest of activities. All this crouching, hand staining, pricked fingers and even eye strain.Often when you reach for a large black juicy berry it seems to disappear. It’s like the behaviour of politicians. They offer so much but when you reach for it # it disappears. Do you remember the Scottish government passed a law guaranteeing one would be seen by an appropriate health specialist within a stated limited time  The SNP government daily breaks this law – be it on cancer, accident and emergencies, or mental health.Or what about the promises made to the people of Arran and the Outer Hebrides on improved ferry services. The Scottish government is responsible for Caledonian Maritime Assets, CMal, which own and manage ferries. MV Glen Sannox was intended to commence service to Arran in  but lies incomplete for all to see in the Ferguson Marine yard in Port Glasgow. Part of the delay is because of disagreement over the fixed-price design and build contract for the two vessels.The SNP seems obsessed with this type of contract which has adversely affected schools, colleges and community centres. Worse still, while the SNP ridiculed previous government public private partnerships they have introduced a system clearly no better. What about the £. million each month we the taxpayers have to pay for the unopened Edinburgh sick children’s hospital  Jeanne Freeman, the SNP Cabinet Secretary for Health and Social Care, stepped in so late that she does not know whether this much-needed hospital will ever open.The second part of the bramble experience is the delicious mouthwatering bramble crumble. A crumble which gives joy and stimulation. Not like the crumbling state of the SNP government which has a sour taste and clearly disappoints.Finlay Craig, CoveSir,Your readers may be interested to know that there are currently  people in need of a kidney transplant in Scotland whose diet will be restricted due to kidney disease.It is likely that they will be on fluid restrictions of around just ml of liquid a day # including liquid found in foods like sauces and ice cream. That is roughly the equivalent of only being able to have a small cup of tea and one can of soft drink per day. In addition, they may have to limit the potassium and phosphate in their diet which means missing out on enjoying foods like chocolate, bananas and tomatoes.We want to make the kidney diet about all the things patients can eat and bring enjoyment back into food # which is why we have launched the Kidney Kitchen.We hope that the Kidney Kitchen will mean everyone living with kidney disease in Scotland can enjoy healthy and delicious food with their family and friends.If you are, oryou know a kidney patient, check out www.kidneykitchen.orgEwen Maclean, advocacy officer Scotland, Kidney Care UKSir,The death of a pet cat can come as a shock, and many owners can find it dficult to come to terms with their loss.The death of a pet is not always seen as a signicant loss, leading some people to hide their feelings which can cause them to feel very alone.On Grief Awareness Day, August , Cats Protection is highlighting its free and confidential Paws to Listen support service, so people facing the loss of a cat do not have to feel alone.The service is available on   .

Last year, it rehomed over , domestic pets and successfully released , wild animals back to their natural environment. The society now also delivers industry-leading animal welfare educational programmes to people of all ages.In my short time with the society I know of hundreds of examples of our dedicated people going above and beyond to do all they can for the animals and humans they come across. So, I can only imagine how many fantastic stories must be out there about the people who’ve worn our unorm since we were formed.As well as those who have had a positive experience with us in the recent past, we are hoping to uncover some long lost tales from descendants of those we’ve touched in decades gone by.The society wants anyone with any interesting anecdotes or memorabilia to get in touch via the website or by emailing .years@scottishspca.org.Kirsteen Campbell, chief executive, Scottish SPCASir,The likelihood of the UK exiting the EU has now shted from ‘possible’ to ‘probable’.That gives greater focus to our efforts to prepare and proof our farming industry from the impacts of no deal.Whilst it always has been  the position of NFU Scotland that the UK must secure a favourable deal on the terms of exit with the EU, we must also support our industry through any change in the operating environment.Many NFU Scotland members might think that their businesses won’t be impacted, but the reality is that there will be implications for all of us. Some will be direct and immediate, and others more indirect and emerging through time – but the one certainty is that these will be felt by all of us involved in the agri-food chain.There are a few things that would make a big dferenceapplied right across the board in the UK.First, the UK Government’s proposed import tarf schedule desperately requires revision. It would expose some produce # specically cereals, oilseeds, potatoes, eggs and horticultural produce # to a tarf going into the EU, but would allow that same product to come into the UK with no tarf.This is farcical.To apply asymmetrical tarfs on any products between us and the EU is to completely misunderstand the nature of food security in the UK and fails to recognise that trade is vital to both the UK and the EU.One thing that can be done, regardless of Brexit, is for our own governments to prioritise using our own products when it comes to public procurement.All our politicians like to talk about how good our agricultural industry is in comparison to others across the world in terms of standards and environmental benefits, but we don’t see near enough in the way of Scottish or British products being prioritised for use in schools, hospitals and other public services.Yes, it may add one or two pence to a meal – but I would challenge governments and public procurement buyers what the real cost is of bringing products in from other parts of the world.These products certainly don’t meet our standards – not to mention the impact on climate change with food miles taken into consideration.It’s only a couple of years since the kids in our schools were getting their chicken from Thailand. Things are improving, but it’s still not Scottish chicken.This is within the gt of both Holyrood and Westminster, but it might just be the catalyst for governments to work with local authorities to do the right thing when it comes to feeding those who use our public services.Martin Kennedy, vice president, NFU ScotlandSir,I read with interest the letter from Doctor Strain in the August  edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser.Might I suggest that to produce a meaningful logo for the GP practices the following criteria are applied:The logo will need to show:May I suggest there are better ways to provide a service to treat patients, without resorting to gimmicks.Name and address supplied.Sir,I was intrigued to read Finlay Craig’s ramblings in last week#s Argyllshire Advertiser.Would he be willing to share the location of his magical bramble bush for it appears the fruits of this bountul bush, when mixed into a pie, contain mystical properties that can transport the diner to another world May I suggest he tries a cold slice of reality pie now and again which would snap him out of his biased reverie and bring him back to the reality of the UK parliament being suspended and the Scottish representative of the party responsible for that outrageous manoeuvre vacating her post in protest In contrast, the Scottish government is working, along with others, to stop Scotland being dragged out of Europe against its wishes. Or perhaps the suspension of democracy is okay in his dream world If Mr Craig or any of his friends eat too much of his prodigious pie, I am sure they will not hesitate to avail themselves of a free prescription for their malaise and, should they need it, free bus travel to the chemist to pick it up, all supplied by the Scottish Government. If they live on one of our beautul islands, they can soon jump on one of the new ferries being completed as I write, again thanks to the Scottish Government.All this aside, when he rejoins us on planet earth, Mr Craig might think of entering his mysterious pie in the baking section of next year#s Mid Argyll Show, though I think by that time we may all be in need of something a little stronger from Scotland’s political larder to extract us from the bitter reality of Brexit Britain.Charles Ambrose, Lochgilphead.Sir,The National Autistic Society wants to find exceptional people, schools and services making a huge dference to autistic children and adults and their families.

It keeps its money as close to home as possible so that, amid historically drastic cuts, the amount spent locally has gone up as featured inon January ,  which notes #where other authorities privatise, Preston grows its own businesses#.Preston ensures that its resources prioritise local providers and businesses wherever possible. Argyll and Bute Council#s Procurement Strategy   falls some way short of this. Its stated aims commendably include:There is no particular emphasis, however, on using its resources to grow Argyll and Bute businesses, to reduce carbon emissions and food transport miles or to foster healthy eating strategies that would benefit our local farmers through #joining up the dots# of local supply and demand.The climate emergency demands a bolder and more innovative respond, and demands it now.Mary MacCallum Sullivan, ArdrishaigSir,I wish to comment on Mr Henderson#s  open letter to Brendan O#Hara in the September  edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser.The expression #crash out# of Europe is used by Conservative members of parliament, the BBC and the press. While emotive, this is what many people directly affected by Brexit feel is happening.For example, on the matter of Germans buying our fish without a trade agreement the tarf will be  per cent on our fish exports to the EU. The Germans will no longer buy our fish.We can all read about other examples of the harm being done in the press every day. The cost of implementing a no deal exit will be borne by all of us, through further austerity , increased taxes , increased national debt or a combination of all three. To my mind, such measures will indeed cause serious economic and social harm.While Brendan O#Hara received a minority of the votes in Argyll, the present government was elected  by less than  per cent of the  electorate.David Inglis, Ardrishaig.Sir,During this, National Air Ambulance Week , may I draw readers# attention to the amazing work of the country#s only charity-funded air ambulance service # Scotland#s Charity Air Ambulance .Since  this le-saving service has been flying help and hope to communities all across Scotland in response to serious illness and injury.From our base at Perth Airport, we have responded to more than , time-critical emergencies and impacted on the lives of thousands # and the need goes on.The recently-established Scottish Trauma Network has seen four key major trauma centres created at hospitals in Glasgow, Edinburgh, Aberdeen and Dundee. The aim is to transfer all serious patients to one of these centres following pre-hospital emergency care within  minutes.The value of a helicopter air ambulance is therefore obvious.Working alongside the Scottish Ambulance Service#s air fleet, SCAA relies entirely on public donations to keep this vital resource flying.Please consider supporting SCAA in it#s le-saving work during a week when the country focuses on the crucial work of air ambulances everywhere.For further information please visit www.scaa.org.ukDavid Craig, chief executive, Scotland#s Charity Air Ambulance , Perth AirportSir,I get a magazine called #Clean Slate#.In it this month is an article where a -year-old girl, Greta Thunberg, along with  other youth activists, have issued this invitation to adults around the world: #Starting on Friday September  we are going to kick-start a week of climate action, with a world-wide strike for the climate.

This occurs when cats come in contact with chemicals such as fuels, lubricants and some solvents.Usually, self-grooming causes the cat to ingest the toxin, or in some cases they inhale it which can cause a severe pneumonia.The toxin can cause problems throughout the body and on the skin too.When Jonny had examined Tikka, he immediately sent her to our Tranent surgery for blood tests and intravenous fluids as she was dehydrated.Fortunately, Tikkarsquos blood tests were normal so she did not have kidney damage.She tolerated her fluid therapy well and was soon looking much happier however several areas of her skin had become red and she was losing hair especially on her front legs.Tikka did not want to eat or drink. She was given analgesics, antibiotics and soothing cream was applied to her skin.Our nursing staff ensured she was as comfortable as possible and as she was not eating by herself, they fed her via a feeding tube several times a day.Her skin became red and thickened and some areas sloughed off.She had to have cream applied frequently to the damaged skin, just asshe had suffered burns.Tikka was finally well enough to go home where Mrs Taylor continued to treat her skin. Tikka started eating well again and is improving daily. Her fur is regrowing and soon she will have her beautul coat again.Now Mrs Taylor was very vigilant and realised she had to do something to help Tikka immediately.If you suspect your cat may have had contact with petroleum-based substances, please contact your vet as soon as possible.Often the first sign you may have is your pet smells of petrol or diesel.There may be vomiting or diarrhoea. They may actually be dizzy or confused or showing other neurological problems such as staggering and trembling. There may be respiratory signs such as coughing or wheezingthey have inhaled the chemical.Do not try to make your pet vomit as this can exacerbate the toxicity.The first thing you should do is try to remove the chemical from the fur.In many cases, it is best to bring your pet straight to your vets as soon as possible. The nursing staff at veterinary practices are well trained in dealing with intoxication emergencies.With petroleum products there are three main areas where the body can be affected: l The internal organs especially the kidneys, so your vet will want to blood sample your pet to check for any damage to the kidneys or other organsl The respiratory system can be affected especiallythe toxin is inhaled. This often happensthe patient vomits then inhales some resulting in a very severe pneumonia. Your vet may wish to take x-rays to check for this.l The animalrsquos skin can also be affected. The petroleum products sit on the fur then soaks through to the skin where they are held in contact by the fur. This causes them to act as a caustic substance, damaging the skin and hair follicles. Often the first sign before the skin damage is seen is hair loss due to the follicle damage.The treatment for these causes is supportive at all times. There are no specic antidotes. Intravenous fluids are administered, this helps overcome dehydration and helps eliminate toxins from the body.Analgesics are given to help keep pain from damaged skin and internal organs to a minimum.Antibiotics are given, as damaged skin is very prone to secondary infection and they are always givenpneumonia is present. Skin treatment has to be intense to keep infection to a minimum and encourage damaged skin to recover.Thankfully Tikka has made an excellent recovery, thanks to Mrs Taylorrsquos quick thinking and the intense nursing care given by the nursing team at Dunedin Vets."},{"url":null,"title":"tim-39-s-tales-magic-real-39-s-around-us","story":"Of course, in stories magic is very real a frog or beast can transform into a prince, dragons and witches can fly, animals can talk, wishes can be granted by faeries and spells cast by wizards.

Itrsquos just that we have stopped noticing the magic that is real.In our world, a frog may not turn into a prince with a kiss, but a caterpillar turns into a butterfly, a tadpole into a frog.And such magic is all around us. Leaves change colour with the seasons, magic transformation is everywhere. Animals do talk, any dog lover will tell us that.Have you ever seen a hare and made eye contact and felt the connection or watched a squirrel hide nuts, and then come up to you asking for more Walk in a wood, or by a riverbank, or just sit in your garden or a park and the magic is all around you. We watched wood pigeons nest in a small elder tree outside our front window over the summer. Two eggs hatched and we watched as they were fed and finally flew the nest. It was, truly, magic.The magic all around us is still vast, and we could all make our own list the sound of birdsong, watching a butterfly flutter, a spiderrsquos web decorated with dew, the glimpse of a deer in a wood, the mist wrapped mountains, a red sparkling cloud during sunset, a wee beastie under a rock as it scampers for cover, the whisper of an ancient tree and the sweet smell of a wood.But I believe that sadly too many of us donrsquot notice real magic anymore.And when we donrsquot notice something we donrsquot feel connected to it, so we donrsquot care about it. And when we donrsquot care about it we donrsquot protect or value it.And when we donrsquot value it, we canrsquot feel the wonder and sense of awe it creates. And so we trash it, ignore and neglect it, exploit it. And we forget we are part of this magic that we are sons and daughters of nature too. And so we disconnect ourselves from what can truly make us feel happy, and instead drug ourselves with the articial magic of our own technology which makes us feel all powerful.But the truth is we are not.Ultimately we rely on the natural environment for our physical and emotional well-being, as much as the creatures we are making extinct.We need nature, it doesnrsquot need us, and eventually it is in control. Asto make this point huge waves hit the rocks of Prestonpans in a storm not so long ago, drenching the nearby houses in a display of naturersquos power. It was scary but also spectacular.In  such a storm was believed to have been the result of magic conjured by the ldquoNorth Berwick Witches.That storm, like the recent one, was indeed magic, conjured by nature, which can whip up a whirlwind more effectively than any wizard or witch.Magic is real.

Similar ventures are in operation at other senior football clubs in Scotland. These rough arenas offered respite from a grimy and perilous working week and the echoes of precious hours spent in them can defer the thickening mists of dementia.The football players and the clubs whose colours they wore carried the pride of entire working class communities: no one owned them on these terraces and the princes and magicians they came to watch were neighbours or the sons of neighbours.Few of these grounds now exist in their original state and even fewer that are as old as Cltonhill. Albion Rovers have existed since , the last  of this stretch in this place. A collection of black and white photographs taken of Cltonhill and the supporters who bring it to le every two weeks forms the centrepiece of an exhibition at Coatbridgersquos splendid Summerlee Museum of Scottish Industrial Le to mark Albion Roversrsquo residency at the stadium.A Game of Two Halves features the mesmeric and evocative work of the award-winning photographer, Iain McLean who was reared on the streets that surround this little park and who re-discovered his childhood love for the club while making them. McLean uses the shting light of grey skies to capture the simple act of attending a football match and to make them seem timeless. Some of these images could have been taken  or  years ago and capture the enduring simplicity of footballrsquos appeal. His pictures are accompanied by a short film by the documentary-maker Wilma Smith, who spent an afternoon recording the ebb and flow of a game through the terracing shouts of the supporters.Albion Rovers is a club whose name suggests inclusivity and where all that is tribal must depart. Other clubs across the UK have lsquoAlbionrsquo or lsquoRoversrsquo attached to their place-names but none have both together. Nor is there any such thing as a lsquoWanderers Unitedrsquo and so Albion Rovers is something unique in British senior football: its name is not narrowed by geographical boundary or city limits, yet few other clubs are embedded in the community that formed them more than this one.Every picture in McLeanrsquos Cltonhill portfolio tells a story that built this year towards something unforeseen and operatic. Towards the end of season   Albion Roversrsquo faced the biggest existential threat of its -year existence as it performed a danse macabre for its tormented supporters with the spectre of relegation from League Two. It escaped this fate with the assistance of a benign intervention as the careless whish of an administratorrsquos pen and the improper registration of an opposition player bequeathed the club three unlikely points and an advantage that was to prove priceless.Ronnie Boyd who, until recently, was Albion Rovers chairman recalls this uncertainty with a chill. ldquoItrsquos vital for Coatbridge that Albion Rovers retains its senior status. If we had dropped down into the leagues below it wouldnrsquot have been the end of us but it would have dealt a serious blow to our confidence and to the sense of pride that the community retains for this club.Rovers attract a mere  or so supporters at home games and keeping the lights on and the wolves from the door is a week-to-week challenge. ldquoThe club is run on a firm financial footing, says Boyd ldquobut nor are we carrying any padding. We are never more than something like a floodlight failure away from a financial crisis and must rely on the services of a team of volunteers who donate several hours each week to the cause of keeping this club afloat and among Scotlandrsquos senior leagues. Them and our sponsors who also go above and beyond.ldquoMany people in Coatbridge refer to us as their lsquosecond clubrsquo which causes some angst amongst the board. The eternal challenge, I suppose, is to persuade some of them to make us their lsquofirstrsquo club. I donrsquot really resent this. There are many competing attractions and lots of other small clubs find themselves in our position. Yet, the task the club faces in this is much more daunting than most other small, community clubs which strive for the right to co-exist with giants. Four Scottish Premier League clubs lie within a dozen miles of Coatbridge, including the two biggest of all: Celtic and Rangers. Celtic Park lies less than nine miles away and each week coachloads of its supporters leave the town which is still steeped in its Irish Catholic heritage.Occasionally, when a sparsely-populated terrace is captured on camera a wise-cracking, metropolitan commentator will smirk about naming the crowd as well as the teams. There are  season-ticket holders at Cltonhill and Ronnie Boyd reckons he could probably name them all. Part of this is also due to the fact that Coatbridge possesses family roots that run through several generations and that this is one of those neighbourhoods where no one can remain a stranger for long. But itrsquos also due to this being one of the few senior football grounds where the chairman and his board are often to be seen personally greeting supporters at the entrance and thanking them for their continued support at a time when the directors of other clubs are obsequiously dispensing sauvignon to small tycoons.Along the M, meanwhile, Rangers, who were put into liquidation in  for over-reaching itself faced criticism from its own supporters for charging stf prices for their games in the Europa League. Celtic, the richest sporting organisation in Scotland, couldnrsquot bring itself to pay its lowest-paid workers the National Living Wage and when it was shamed into doing so the directors first removed the annual staff bonuses. Yet here is Albion Rovers, their poorest and most humble cousins treating its own few supporters like royalty. This seems to be appreciated and theythe love with interest. One of Iain MacLeanrsquos most vivid images is of volunteers fighting a losing battle trying to sweep mounds of snow from Cltonhillrsquos playing surface for a Scottish Cup tie against St Johnstone in January last year.McLean said: ldquoWhen the St Johnstone fans turned up and realised there was a risk to the game they got on the pitch with the rest of us to clear the snow. The spirit of this place is infectious and gets under your finger-nails. In my recent experience any who turn up here for the first time are captivated and form a deep attachment to Albion Rovers and to Cltonhill.Another is taken during a particularly dispiriting - home defeat to Peterhead last year. On the condensation of a Perspex home dugout a supporter has written in perfect mirror text ldquoSCORE PLEASE, a polite request which where might have been a profane demand.At the start of this season Bury FC, twice winners of Englandrsquos FA Cup and a founder member of the English football league shut its doors after  years of existence. The faces of three generations of its supporters were crumpled in grief as they began to realise that the pride of their northern, working class community was being thrown out of a league they had helped form. Not far away from Bury is Bolton Wanderers, the club of mighty Nat Lofthouse, the Lion of Vienna and which remains locked in a mortal struggle for its own existence. Financial analysts have predicted that several other English Football clubs are just one more breached overdraft away from perdition. These clubs are also hemmed in by an assortment of the richest football teams in Europe but not a scrap from the tables of these most egregiously capitalist enterprises is permitted to nourish its distressed old neighbours. Albion Rovers meanwhile is kept alive by the endeavours by a small volunteer corps of fans and directors who provide graft and services for free. The stadium sponsor is local firm Reigart Demolition and a flotilla of other sponsors gathers each season to ensure that the bills are paid and the part-time players and coaching staff receive some form of remuneration.Albion Rovers may now be eking out a twilight existence but without dreams football is reduced and this old club still retains some of its own. In  they reached the Scottish Cup final before being defeated by Kilmarnock in a - classic in front of , spectators at Hampden. Cltonhillrsquos record attendance of , against Rangers in  will stand for all time.This was where Jock Stein, the greatest club manager in Britain, played for a few years in the early s. In the last few years the club has established a Hall of Fame that now has seven members, including Tony Green who left Coatbridge in  to join Blackpool for pound,. Green also adorns Blackpoolrsquos Hall of Fame as well as Newcastle Unitedrsquos.More recently, in the mid-s Bernie Slaven left to join Middlesbrough where he too became a household name. Despite scoring more than  goals for Albion Rovers all the top Scottish clubs disdained him for his humble surroundings and were subsequently made to look foolish.Turning up occasional pearls such as these and selling them on to larger Scottish and English outfits traditionally provided sustenance to prudently-run smaller clubs. Now, the big clubs have lsquoacademiesrsquo which they use like footballrsquos equivalent of a scallop dredger, trawling the old feeding grounds and sparking dreams in hundreds of working class households before tossing the overwhelming majority overboard in the years to come in the worldrsquos most ruthless pruning exercise. By then, many are ruined by the brief excess of their associations with the big clubs, a time during which they could have developed better habits at clubs like Albion Rovers.Ronnie Boyd says the current board of directors are determined to ensure that they never again risk being demoted to the lower leagues and is hoping that the exhibition at the Summerlee Museum will renew local interest. Next weekend, between September  and September , the museum will host a Celebrate Albion Rovers weekend to commemorate  years of the club at Cltonhill. This stadium was also the home of speedway and greyhound racing, those other two great pastimes of the British working man and these will be celebrated with classic films and an exhibition of memorabilia from those blue remembered days.The silence of an empty football stadium at repose, even one as gnarly as Cltonhill, is like a cathedral. For a football-mad supporter like me, who would have given everything to have played just one half of a game at this level, these places are mesmerising.Ronnie Boyd still has the keys to Cltonhill and, sensing my expectation, invites me for a guided tour of the old ground. After unlocking the front gates he leads me up into the dressing-rooms and through the warren of rooms and passages that lead out to the main stand and the pitch below. The hospitality area is all tombola-stall decent and the wooden seats in the stand are still shiny in the new seasonrsquos red, yellow and black paint. Only one terrace is in use but the club has resisted the urge to pull down the other two which have long since been rendered obsolete by health and safety regulations.

Wood denounced the councilrsquos decision to block the parades as ldquostupid. This seems harsh, although the immediate backlash does show this cautionary step backfired. As Wood commented in a newspaper article, outright bans simply allow resentment to fester and violence to erupt where.Explosions of sectarian aggression and abuse are an obvious outrage, but even entirely peaceful religious marches through Glasgow are a blot on the cityrsquos reputation. Whenever a Grand Orange Lodge goes past, banging drums, playing flutes and waving banners, I feel I have stepped back three centuries. In theory, Orange marches are harmless and legitimate expressions of faith and historical commemoration. In practice, in the west of the country at least, they are the unlit end of a fuse that doesnrsquot take much to ignite. Everyone knows these are potentially inflammatory occasions, and a marching season that passes without incident is the very definition of a miracle.As is all too evident, sectarian prejudice is alive and well. Those who say it is nearly extinct are either optimists or judge todayrsquos level of confrontation against a much bloodier and more ignorant past. By that measure, certainly, things are considerably better than they were even as recently as when I joined this newspaper when on my first day a new colleague commented on the arrival of yet another Protestant. Anti-discrimination laws have helped promote more enlightened attitudes, but even without this statutory inducement to scrupulous fairness, the majority of us these days make no distinction between Catholic and Protestant,indeed we even notice it at all.:Faith no more  Have catholic schools had their day, asks Kevin McKennaThe country has come a long way since the Church of Scotlandrsquos disgraceful and virulent anti-Catholicism in the s, and the barefaced discrimination and hurtful jibes Catholics of all ranks endured. No wonder separate schools were considered necessary. Yet while levels of abuse and discrimination are dramatically lower than before, in some quarters hoary old grievances and antediluvian attitudes continue to smoulder.You could argue that the answer is education: an ongoing challenging of closed minds that will eventually lead to a state where nobody cares what religion other people follow. It is Tom Woodrsquos contention, however, that in order to eradicate sectarianism we need to abolish Catholic schools. These, he believes, are the root of the problem.With some reluctance, I have to agree their time is up. This, despite knowing that endorsing this view would appear to be rejecting the liberal values that I consider essential for a fair and well-run country. If parents wish to send their children to a school whose principles are guided by the Catholic faith ndash or any other for that matter ndash surely they should be allowed that choice  By all accounts, the education students receive in Catholic schools is impressive, and in some cases so enviable that lapsed members of the church appear to have a Damascene reawakening in order to get their offspring into the classroom.Yet the existence of this archaic system of schooling is tangible evidence of a problem that refuses to wither. From early childhood, separate schools reinforce the idea of dference, segregation and distinction. Whatever side of that school fence you walk, you are made aware from Primary One onwards of the concept of Them and Us.Therersquos another distasteful aspect of segregated schools too. Richard Dawkinsrsquos new book, Outgrowing God, which is aimed at young readers, tries to help ldquobreak the cycle of indoctrination. That word will be offensive to those who think they are doing their best by their children in instructing them in their own religious beliefs and culture, be they Catholic, Protestant, Muslim or Jew. But, even when done with the best intentions, sending a child to a school affiliated to a church is a form of intellectual and emotional programming. It represents the opposite of liberal values.:Catholic schools are rated higher by inspectorsFor as long as it is possible to put a child through a denominational education, society is tacitly acknowledging the power of religion to define who people are. In an age when the state is increasingly non-religious in its decision-making, in order to maintain strict neutrality and equality, it makes no sense. When single-sex institutions are frowned upon as out-dated, when discrimination based on ethnicity, background or sexual orientation is considered abhorrent, it seems odd that this particular expression of dference is allowed to continue. Onlysectarianism were unheard of, rather than a persistent blight, would it ndash just about ndash be acceptable.Back in the real world, the existence of educational pigeon-holes like these means there is little hope of religious bigotry being eradicated. Those on either side of the school gates live in an environment that allows this shameful stain on our country to persist, and even flourish. Initiatives to raise awareness or to banish deep-rooted prejudices can never be wholly successful so long as the public statement of religious identity is allowed such a state-sanctioned .This is not to attack faith itself. What iniduals choose to believe, and the ways in which they introduce children to their religion or creed at home, is their business. Nor should schools cease to teach pupils about world religions, or to help them understand the huge cultural influence that Christianity, both Catholic and Protestant, has exerted on countless aspects of our lives, for good and ill.Complete integration, however, should be the goal. The building blocks of society must mirror the kind of world we want future generations to inherit. No matter how you look at it, denominational schools have become an anomaly. If sectarianism is to become a thing of the past, then so should they."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/10438314.jpg?type=article-full","title":"full-list-climate-strikes-taking-place-across-scotland","story":"It is part of a global movement, inspired by teenage activist Greta Thunbergrsquos school strikes outside the Swedish parliament, calling on politicians and business leaders to take urgent action to curb greenhouse gas emissions.:Demand for post-Brexit environment protection laws as Scots show support in pollThe latest strikes come ahead of a climate action summit in New York convened by UN secretary-general Antonio Guterres to urge countries to up their climate efforts.Fridays front page of The Herald#tomorrowspaperstoday#scotpapers pic jmDmEZMNfThe UK Student Climate Networksays more than  events are taking place across the UK, with ndash for the first time ndash adults being encouraged to join the youngsters as they strike.Global Climate Strike -th of September: events in  countries on all continents.And counting...Everyone is welcome.Everyone is needed.Find your closest strike or register your own at https:t.co ikOafwrNSkSpread the word!#FridaysForFuture #ClimateStrike pic ekrmeUxUKSCN is calling on politicians to bring in a ldquoGreen New Deal to cut the UKrsquos emissions to zero and improve lives, changes to education to equip youngsters to deal with the climate crisis and votes at  to give them a voice.These are the climate strikes that we are aware of so far.ABERDEEENam Marischal CollegeABOYNEam Aboyne GreenAVIEMORE:am The HubCRIEFFam James SquareDUNDEEam City SquareEDINBURGHam Middle Meadow WalkELGINam Council OfficeFORRESam Tolbooth  St Leonards Church, High StFORT WILLIAM.am Cameron SquareGLASGOWam Kelvingrove Park BridgeGLASGOWChildrenrsquos Assemblypm ndash pm Glasgow City ChambersINVERNESS:am Falcon SquareIONAam Baile Mor Village CentreKIRKCUDBRIGHT:am Harbour SquareLIVINGSTONam Civic SquareLOCHGILPHEADam Front GreenNAIRNam Highland Council officesOBAN:am Station SquarePERTH:am Bike StationSHETLANDpm Market Cross, LerwickSKELMORIEam Toward ViewST ANDREWSam St Salvatorrsquos QuadSTIRLINGam Pitt TerraceULLAPOOL:am Ullapool Primary School"},{"url":null,"title":"John Humphrys calls it a day after 32 years on Today programme","story":"Two past prime ministers, Dame Edna Everage, plus colleagues old and new from Jim Naughtie to Martha Kearney were in attendance ndash not a bad draw.The BBC Radio  show is not the big beast in the broadcast jungle it once was, having lost a few teeth and a million listeners in the past few years.But it is still a large enough feature in the media landscape to make the news as well as report it.For many, Humphrys is the Today programme, and his departure after  years and , shows is one for the diary.: Alison Rowat: Tories  And you thought the mafia had trouble resolving conflictTrue to form, the interviewer nicknamed the ldquorottweiler for his tenacious style, departed with a snarl and a few barks, before finally submitting to having his tummy tickled by admirers.The snarl was reserved for politicians who snub political interviews in favour of social media.

Ana Botin was formerly in charge of Santander UK, while Dame Jayne-Anne Gadhia was chief executive of Virgin Money before it was sold to CYBG last year.However, Ms Rose is the only woman so far to lead one of the UKs four biggest banks, which are RBS, Lloyds Banking Group, Barclays and HSBC.Ms Rose does acknowledge the seismic change that will be sent out after becoming the first female head of a major high street bank in the UK.For her, it sends out the best possible message to the , extra women she wants to help set up their own business by .Currently, just one in three entrepreneurs is female, while in some other European countries the rate is more than  per cent.It is a situation that she is desperate to change and hopes her report will lead to a dramatic increase in female businesswomen.She said: ldquoThe scale of the ambition is considerable and in my view we now have our North Star to aim for, a % increase in female entrepreneurs.ldquoThat will act as a guide to joined up action across public and private sector.Women make up more than half the population in Britain, but just one in five businesses is female-run, a figure recently described as ldquoshocking by Robert Jenrick, exchequer secretary to the Treasury.With Ms Rosersquos encouragement, RBS has created a network of  NatWest Entrepreneur Accelerator hubs around the country.These are where would-be entrepreneurs can get help with the nuts and bolts of finding start-up funds and writing business plans from a team of women advisers.She said: ldquoItrsquos a big responsibility but itrsquos something I feel passionately about ldquoThe most important thing to remember is that itrsquos never perfect.ldquoEven when yoursquove got support and yoursquore very organised, things always go wrong. It is a juggling, balancing and complicated act.She joined National Westminster Bank as a trainee in  after graduating from Durham University.By the time RBS took over NatWest in , Ms Rose was working her way through a series of jobs in the investment banking ision, which ultimately put her in charge of leveraged finance in the UK and Europe.She helped restructure the balance sheet in the aftermath of the financial implosion and in  took over commercial and private banking, which now accounts for nearly half of assets at the group.She refuses to be drawn on the bankrsquos major challenges in the coming months, particularly with Brexit.The bank has already relocated some jobs to Amsterdam in case of a no-deal exit.Ms Rose admits that while RBS has restored some of its badly tarnished reputation there is still some way to go.She said: ldquoItrsquos been a very dficult time but we are working hard to restore it by trying to improve things for customers. I believe we have made a lot of progress in improving things, but we are not complacent.And it seems she sees it as her responsibility to inspire others too.One major area that needs to be addressed, according to Ms Rose, is getting girls exposed to female entrepreneurs and get them interested in Stem subjects which offer the highest growth for businesses.Ms Rose said: ldquoThere are not enough women in high-growth fields and that is also holding many back.ldquoBy going into schools then we can provide young girls with a role model they need to aspire too.

Itrsquos not for politicians to decide the limits that they place on democracy. Itrsquos up to people to decide the future they want.ldquoBut no country, to my knowledge, that has become independent from the UK... and I think since the end of the Second World War I think there have been several countries that have become independent from the UK, none of them have decided to change their minds and go back the way, and I donrsquot think that it is likely that Scotland would do that either.Scottish LibDem leader Willie Rennie said: ldquoSNP supporters will go bananas to hear the First Minister is lining up Indyref as well as Indyref.

No matter what might befall Scotland and how it might be governed in future the basic human rights of its citizens, respecting their faith, sexual orientation, race and political beliefs were now deemed to be sacred. In future there might still be greed and corruption and malfeasance at the heart of public le and in the grand offices of state but the people had now been empowered by something greater than them all.The beauty of the ECHR lies not merely in the clarity and nobility of its language but in the way that no detail pertinent to the peace and happiness of the inidual is overlooked. Article  in the substantive protocols to the ECHR has this to say about education. ldquoNo person shall be denied the right to education. In the exercise of any s which it assumes in relation to education and to teaching, the State shall respect the right of parents to ensure such education and teaching is in conformity with their own religious and philosophical convictions.This protocol seemed to reinforce another great legislative testament to Scottish enlightened and progressive thinking, the  Education Act. This guaranteed the right of Scotlandrsquos Catholic population to have their children educated by the state according to the norms and mores of their faith. The Act wasnrsquot an endorsement of religious indoctrination it didnrsquot grant a licence for sectarianism. It was simply an acknowledgment of the important role that faith plays in the lives of many of its citizens. Following the harrowing experiences of the Great War it was also an acknowledgement by the state that Catholic children, ravaged by high levels of malnutrition and the effects of multi-deprivation, might be needed to fight any future existential threat to our freedoms and democracy.For more than a century now Scotlandrsquos Catholic schools have flourished and are regularly found to have excelled, under strict inspection, beyond the boundaries of their initial remit. Over several decades when the influx of Irish-Catholic refugees fleeing the Great Famine risked inflaming tensions with the indigenous Protestant working classes the existence of these schools has helped in the process of peaceful integration. They act as bridges where the old and cherished beliefs of a religious minority can meet and converse with the greater Scotland beyond. In disadvantaged neighbourhoods they continue to perform heroically and offer children in these places hope and a slender chance of a rewarding le. Scotland should be proud of them. And we Scots of Irish-Catholic stock should be proud too that we live in a country which cherishes dference and ersity and values our communityrsquos distinctive contribution to its public le.Nicola Sturgeon recognised this last year at a celebration to mark  years of Scotlandrsquos Catholic schools. She said: ldquo is the centenary of the legislation that brought Roman Catholic schools into Scotlandrsquos state education system. In that time, Catholic schools have made a tremendous contribution to Scottish education, and this is something we want to see continue. We value the contribution that Catholic schools make to modern Scotland. We want that contribution to continue in the years ahead.One year on from the First Ministerrsquos eloquent endorsement attacks on Catholic schools remain predictably depressing. The most recent follow skirmishes in Glasgow earlier this month when an Irish republican parade was confronted by protesters. Predictably, this was portrayed as another outbreak of religious sectarianism. Yet, it probably owed more to the current heightened tensions surrounding the prospect of a hard Brexit, the Irish border and inflamed British nationalism. In a remarkably ignorant and badly-written article a former deputy chief constable in Police Scotland used this isolated and rare occurrence to justy shutting Catholic schools. ldquoWe also need to look at the roots of the problem and question what ides us, he wrote. ldquoAndwe do that then we simply cannot escape questioning our system of religiously segregated education. His words were a sinister reminder of why large sections of the Irish-Catholic community traditionally beheld Scotlandrsquos police forces with deep mistrust.The independent Advisory Committee on Tackling Sectarianism set up by the Scottish Government has produced several wide-ranging and exhaustive reports. These specically and unequivocally stated that Catholic schools were not even remotely a cause of sectarianism in Scotland. It also pointed out that, in any case, sectarianism was largely in retreat in modern Scotland.So, in the absence of any evidence that Catholic schools contribute to sectarianism and in spite of counter-data that they actually foster multi-culturalism and tolerance what lies at the root of these attacks  Letrsquos speak frankly here. The people who are most vocerous in their hostility towards Catholic schools also purport to cherish ersity and equality. Yet they want these only within the bounds of a narrow and illiberal agenda. It is group-think that relies on old and discredited tropes that were once used to alienate and target minorities. These people simply donrsquot like the idea of Catholic schools but have nothing to justy their hostility. Each year they are reduced to scanning Scotlandrsquos cultural horizon looking for any little wrinkles that can be swollen into  outrage.Professor Sir Tom Devine, Scotlandrsquos foremost historian, said of this: ldquoIf there was one action certain to inflame sectarian tensions in Scotland it would be any suggestion from the Scottish lrmGovernment of an intention to abolish Catholic schools.

This is because four fths of Scotland’s carbon footprint is generated through the heat and energy required to grow, make, process, transport and provide materials that are often tossed aside at the end of their le.Only by considering how to make products with less reliance on raw materials, and by remaking items at the end of their original le into goods that can be used time and again, will businesses be able to signicantly reduce global emissions.Iain Gulland, chief executive of Zero Waste Scotland, who launched the organisation’s corporate plan before an auduence of business leaders last week, said: “We must radically change the way we think about and consume our goods and materials, and we must do that now.” “Too many businesses assume that reducing the cost to the planet means increasing costs for them. “But as we have and will continue to make clear, the opportunities are plentul, with massive savings to be made. “The current way of working cannot continue in the years ahead and successfully adopting a circular economy approach is the only long-term option.”Everything has value and in a circular economy nothing should be wasted. In simple terms, it can be explained as ‘make, use, remake’ as opposed to ‘make, use, dispose’. The ultimate goal is to maintain and improve our quality of le, while simultaneously reducing our material consumption and, by extension, our impact on the planet.Mr Gulland added: “Many Scottish firms are already leading the way, with our help, changing how they design and trade goods to keep materials in use for as long as possible to maximise their value. “Successful circular economy enterprises range from refurbishing computers and upcycling furniture to producing sustainable animal feed using waste generated by our world-famous whisky industry.”data-src\"https:images-e.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.kincardineshireobserver webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Felicitasis just one of the many children supported by Marys Meals.\"   is just one of the many children supported by Marys Meals.\"  Throw a Porridge Party for Mary’s MealsviewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\" data-src\"https:images-e.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.kincardineshireobserver webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Left to right - Fiona Cooper, treasurer, Katrina Suer, chair, and Catherine Houston, vice-chair\"  Scouts plea for hut renovation support viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"KINC | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"KINC | Article Teaser\"Zero Waste Scotland estimates that the circular economy would save Scottish businesses collectively at least £ billion every year through benefits including the creation of longer-lasting relationships with customers, as firms switch from a model centred on simply selling products to providing products as services.

If buildings are usually charging an entrance fee they can take part by offering to open for free,The event benefits the organisations or venues by attracting more visitors. It helps them by becoming more involved in the community, as a volunteer or a visitor, and enhancing appreciation of local architecture and local heritage.The seven venues taking part in Orkney all have free entry.

Successful generators still sell the electricity they produce on the wholesale market but receive a #top-up# payment over the course of the -year contract.Changes made to rules which had forbidden all onshore wind projects from competing in the electricity market in  meant projects in the Western Isles, Shetland and Orkney were able to compete.Prime Minister Boris Johnson said: “The UK is leading the way in the fight against climate change, and it’s great news that millions more homes will be powered by clean energy at record low prices.“Seizing the opportunities of clean energy not only helps to protect our planet, but will also back businesses and boost jobs across the UK.”Though they may have won favour with the government, Hoolan#s two Orkney projects have previously been met with protest from the public and rejection by councillors. More than  protestors took to School Place, last September, when the projects appeared before the OIC planning committee. Though there were no statutory objections to either project, there were  letters of objection and  of support for the Costa project. The Hesta Project, meanwhile, received a total of  objections and nine letters of support.Though councillors elected to reject the wind farms, this decision was later overturned by the Scottish Government. This sparked criticism from former planning chairman, Councillor Owen Tierney, who accused the government of #lacking faith# in the local planning system.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

I look forward to the project progressing.”Led by ZeroAvia, developers of hydrogen fuel cell powertrain solutions, HyFlyer will demonstrate a phased approach from battery power to hydrogen power, integrating the new technology aboard a Piper M-class six-seater aircraft which will perform test flights out of Cranfield and Orkney.Project partners Intelligent Energy will optimise its high power fuel cell technology for application in aviation while EMEC Hydrogen, producers of green hydrogen from renewable energy, will supply the hydrogen required for flight tests and develop a mobile refuelling  compatible with the plane.The HyFlyer project will see conventional piston engines in propeller aircraft replaced by electric motors, hydrogen fuel cells and gas storage.If all goes well, ZeroAvia, based in Calornia, are aiming to supply the technology to commercial manufacturers by .Following this demonstration, the next goal then is to power an aircraft, carrying up to  passengers, to travel  miles.According to the Air Transport Action Group, aviation is responsible for  per cent of CO emissions from all transport sources and is one of the fastest growing sources of global emissions.Val Mtakhov, founder and CEO of ZeroAvia, said: “The substantial backing provided by the UK Government underlines the potential that hydrogen holds as a fuel source for commercial aviation and provides signicant validation of ZeroAvia’s approach to zero emission flight.“Our project goal of  NM is equivalent to the distance from London to Edinburgh and will prove that zero emission aviation, powered by hydrogen, can play a key role within the UK and other countries’ transport strategies — enabling net zero targets to be met and improving productivity and regional prosperity.”Richard Ainsworth, Hydrogen Project Specialist at EMEC Hydrogen, said: “HyFlyer is another key step in Orkney’s aim to decarbonise leline transport services for islanded communities.#Hydrogen has the potential to help meet our emission commitments where electrons and batteries can’t.#This project sees us one step closer to meeting our fuel and energy needs from abundant local renewable energy resources using green hydrogen.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

And so surely it is both appropriate and welcome that it seeks to make its expertise and experience available to those trying to save lives in other countries, and supports those efforts where they can “Much of the work the RNLI is doing overseas appears to be targeted at young people and children – helping making the water safer for them # and that is something I would fully support.“As someone who has, from a very early age, helped raise funds for the RNLI, I am proud of its work home and abroad, and I thank every crew member, volunteer, fundraiser and supporter for all their efforts.#copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

All energy consumers pay for the cost of investment in new network capacity so the regulator ensures that it obtains the best deal possible for them.Ofgem launched a consultation in December last year on proposed changes to SSEN’s plan in an effort to ensure value for money for consumers.Following consideration of consultation responses and further analysis, the regulator has decided to approve the plan subject to the conditions set out in its decision.Approval is conditional on a total of at least MW of new wind farm projects on Orkney either being awarded a Contract for Dferenceor being judged likely to be developed by December .Ofgem would expect to be satisfied that new wind farm projects are likely to be developed despite not being awarded a CfDan independent audit states that the project is financially viable, has signed a relevant grid connection agreement and has been granted planning permission.However, SSEN has stated disappointment that the regulator is maintaining its position that the MW of new renewable electricity generation needs to secure planning permission and demonstrate financial viability prior to granting approval for the construction of the link.Ofgem has extended the date in which developers need to meet these conditions from December  to December . SSEN has said this means, in turn, that the construction of the transmission link may be delayed for at least a two-year period,the full time is required to secure the MW target, or shorterthe need is met at an earlier stage.SSEN’s Transmission and Distribution businesses now intend to consult with Orkney developers and other stakeholders to help establish the optimal #whole system# solution in an effort to make the most of Orkney’s renewable potential.Talking about Ofgem#s decision, Rob McDonald, managing director for transmission with SSEN, said: “Whilst we are clearly disappointed with today’s decision, our commitment to work with Orkney developers and other stakeholders to unlock Orkney’s vast renewable potential has not changed.“With both the UK and Scottish Government committed to net zero emissions, we firmly believe Orkney and Scotland’s other two major island groups will have a key role to play in the fight to prevent the worst effects of climate change.“We now look forward to working with developers and other stakeholders on Orkney to collectively explore the best way forward to unlock Orkney’s renewable potential.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Should they be abolished in a major reform of working practices that gives us more time off, wonders Stephen Jardine.The queue at the bus stop was longer than usual. And a bit grumpier. That was because the buses were on a Saturday service even though it was a Monday.If you are following this so far, well done. It is about to get really complicated. On the third Monday in September, Edinburgh has a Public Holiday. Not a Bank Holiday. In the rest of Scotland, the holiday is next Monday. Except the Borders, who take the second Monday in October. Oh, and Fe which waits until the third Monday in October.The labyrinthian web of our public and bank holidays is hard enough for mere locals to decipher. What chance have you gotyou are an overseas business trying to work out why no one answers the phones or emails in parts of Scotland on certain peculiar days These odd throwbacks to the past date from the days when mandatory closures were the only way to give rest and respite to the mass of the workers. If the banks and great institutions of Government were closed then no work could be done and nothing could happen. It really was that simple.: Four-day week: Read this and you’ll be convinced it makes sense – Angela CrawleyFor unlimited access to Scotland’s best news, sport and expert analysis, SUBSCRIBE to The Scotsman website hereNowadays nobody actually notices anymore. Online banking has made Bank Holidays obsolete and unless you physically need to visit a local authority office on a specic day, the closed sign will probably pass you by.School closures are the one manestation most likely to impact the general public but families will just put it down to the ongoing drama that is being a working parent when your child is going through education.And as for those who don’t work for central or local government, well it is just another working day. With economic growth forecasts downgraded under the shadow of Brexit, an enforced shutdown is the last thing most businesses need or can afford.So who benefits  On every bank and public holiday we all try to do the same things. If it is sunny, Portobello Beach is packed and the main roads are jammed with people trying to get out of town. If it is wet, we are stuck inside trying to fix wonky shelves and catch up on Game of Thrones.In the joined-up, technologically advanced society of  with business and communication happening around the world rather than just with someone down the road, is this really the best way to deliver leisure time The answer isn’t less holidays. It’s a well-known fact that we work the longest hours in Europe but still lag behind the continent when it comes to productivity. Could part of the answer be our rigid adherence to set date holidays Increasingly we are seeing companies finding creative ways to be modern employers. Last week it was reported some firms are now allowing staff to set their own wages in consultation with colleagues. Others are switching to a four-day week or nine-day fortnight in a bid to deliver the elusive work-le balance.Surely the way forward for us all is a statutory increase in the amount of holidays for every person in this land but for us to use them as and when we want. As society changes, our approach to holidays also has to alter, otherwise the past risks holding back our future.©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"scottish mnd campaigner lucy lintott reveals she is expecting baby boy","story":"Scotlands youngest MND sufferer has announced she is expecting a baby boy.Lucy Lintott, , the countrys youngest person to battle motor neurone disease is believed to be the first to fall pregnant post-diagnosis.window.twttr She made the incredible announcement on Friday afternoon on her social media accounts, sharing a picture of her and fiance Tommy Smith cradling her bump.Writing on Twitter, Ms Lintott said: “We’re delighted to announce that early next year we’ll be bringing our baby boy into the world.”Lucy was diagnosed in  with MND, aged just .Doctors told her she might have just four years to live, and she feared she might never be a we.The inspirational campaigner threw herself into fundraising for charity MND Scotland, so far raising more £, to help find a cure for the debilitating disease.It is understood that the baby is due in February, with the couple expected to exchange vows in a ceremony next year.Speaking to the Evening Times, Lucy said: “They told us there are no known cases anywhere of someone with MND becoming pregnant.\"But my womb is unaffected by MND so in theory I should have a normal pregnancy and be able to have a natural birth.\"She added: \"I see a consultant and get scanned once a month, and the doctors have said they will just have to play things by ear - just like any other mum-to-be.“If there are complications then we will deal with them - just like anyone .\"©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"joanna cherry vows to pull out all the stops on parliament suspension legal case","story":"The Scottish MP at the heart of the court challenge against Boris Johnson#s suspension of Parliament has said political leadersmust #pull out the stops# to get the Commons sittingthe government loses.Joanna Cherry spoke out amid claims that the UK government could effectively continue with the suspension of Parliament eventhe Supreme Court finds prorogation to have been unconstitutional in its judgement next week.The Edinburgh South West MP said “From a political perspective I do think it’s very important thatthe Supreme Court finds in our favour that all politicians pull out the stops to make sure that Parliament gets back to work as soon as possible.”The Law Society of Scotland yesterday defended the independence of the courts amid claims the case has resulted in judges effectively being dragged into the political process.“The Court of Session, High Court and Supreme Court judgments have demonstrated that the judiciary and legal profession act independently and consider cases before them in light of their legal competence, regardless of political or public opinion,” Law Society president John Mulholland and Dean of the Faculty of Advocates Gordon Jackson QC said.©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"ryanair pilots call off planned strike action","story":"A series of strikes planned by Ryanair pilots have been called off.Members of the British Airline Pilots Associationwere due to walk out on Saturday and then on September , ,  and .The union is embroiled in a long-running row over a series of issues including pay and conditions which has already led to industrial action.Balpa said it had called off the strikes even though the relationship between Ryanair and its pilots in the UK and where remains \"acrimonious\".: Easyjet slammed for new Edinburgh to Birmingham route A statement said: \"Instead of engaging in negotiations Ryanair has reverted to type, electing to punish pilots by withdrawing their travel benefits.\"Despite this, UK pilot representatives consulted striking members yesterday and agreed to suspend any further strikes in order to pave the way for meaningful negotiations under the auspices of the UK conciliation service, Acas.\"Despite a strong turnout for strike action and a high level of commitment among pilots in Ryanair, the pilot representatives took the decision to allow a breathing space in the hope that constructive negotiations could get under way.\"Balpa retains the ability to set new strike dates should it be necessary.\"©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"first look at the jarls squad ","story":"Plenty of onlookers were already on the streets as the squad made its first procession of the day from Islesburgh Community Centre, past the galley shed on St Sunniva Street and on to the Toll Clock Shopping Centre.In the gloom, the ranks of the Jarl#s Squad looked the part wearing emerald green kirtles with dragon mots underneath simple brown leather breastplates embossed with the same mot.

But the Peatbogs, like more recent successors such as Niteworks, are a reminder that a grounding in traditional music is no barrier to a letime of instrumental experimentation.Le for the Peatbog Faeries began with a gig in Edinbane Lodge in the spring of . Peter Morrison and bass player Innes Hutton from Braes # the two constants in the line-up # were joined by Davie Tait, Ali Pentland and Alan Edmunds.Pubs and village hall dances became their early staple, but gradually more adventurous elements crept into their set and the audiences lapped it up.Morrison recalled: #We#d bring in a blues or a reggae sound, and we found it was these things that started to go down best with audiences.#We moved to more of a world music sound around about , but we never expected much to come of it. We were just out to play at pubs and parties and have a bit of fun#.Their first tape # the #Great Ceilidh Swindle# # sold well locally and paid for a demo in Edinburgh, which in turn caught the ear of Greentrax Records, the specialist label in Scottish traditional music.With bands like Shooglenty and Martyn Bennett also arriving on the scene it proved a perfect time to be breaking new ground and the Peatbog Faeries# debut album #Mellowsity# would stay in Greentrax#s top ten for the next decade-and-a-half.Morrison remembers: #Because of our size and sound, bands like us and Shooglenty cost a lot more to record than other folk bands at the time. So there was a worry at the start.#But as soon as we signed to Greentrax, we quite quickly got an agent and we got sought-after slots at Glastonbury, Nomad and Celtic Connections.#We didn#t really notice what was happening, in a way # it felt like one day we were playing in the pub, the next day playing in front of thousands.#There weren#t that many precedents for bands like ours. Most folk bands just played in pubs. There were some accordion bands that were full-time or groups like #Silly Wizard#, but for us coming out of Skye we never thought it would turn into a full-time occupation.#We just went with the flow and luckily for us it proved a lot more popular than we thought it would be.#The band#s line-up has changed several times, and in turn, each addition helped explore new sounds # the most dramatic sht coming when Rick Taylor and Nigel Hitchcock arrived on Skye in the s to add a three-piece brass section.Taylor # who passed away earlier this year # was a revered musician who had toured with Elton John, while in recent years the Peatbog#s fiddler Peter Tickell left the group to take to the road with Sting.The current scaled-back line-up has seen Morrison and Hutton joined by Edinburgh-based Tom Salter on guitar keyboard player Graeme Stafford from Ardnamurchan drummer Stu Haikney and Shetlander Ross Couper on fiddle.For Peter Morrison, the global tours, the record deals and the Glastonbury stage all owe their origins to the chance he got to learn the chanter in the long-since closed Vatten Bridge primary school.He explains: #Every year Norman MacLeod # the teacher#s husband # and John Laing used to pipe us all in to the Christmas Party, so that was where I first heard the pipes.#Every pupil got the chance of learning the chanter at school, and I think nine of us started playing. It was either that or an hour of maths.#I think I was the only one who carried on into secondary school, but I got the bug. I didn#t like the competing part, but I enjoyed listening to the pipes and learning to play them.#My pal Donnie MacAskill from Roag also played the accordion, so I learned to play drums along with him and from about the age of  I was always in bands.#Morrison#s early piping tutor was Cameron MacFadyen, and he received additional help from Nicol Campbell # another well-known local piper and character from Dunvegan, whose memory has been honoured across the globe.Morrison added: #When he passed away Nicol left me his kilt, which has since been worn on stages in Japan, Africa and America.#A joiner to trade, who also worked for aperiod as a hotelier in Dunvegan, Peter Morrison has seen attitudes to traditional music change over the years, and with it opportunities flourish.He still lives in Roag with we Johan and grown-up kids Jenny and Calum, and it#s no surprise to hear him promote the virtues of free access to music tuition in local schools.He continues to be #amazed# at some of the local talent learning traditional instruments, some of whom he can be heard playing alongside at regular music sessions laid on in the Edinbane Inn and the Old Inn in Carbost.#It#s changed a lot since when I was a youngster whenyou wanted to learn music the only real opportunity was the pipes,# he recalled.#Things like the fis movement have been really helpful in creating opportunities. There now seems to be a constant stream of really good young musicians coming out of Skye.#When I started you would never have thought of making a career out of it, but now with some of these youngsters, it seems to be the only thing they think about. #A lot of these kids are now at a standard that in previous years only a handful of people in Scotland were achieving.#In Skye you have the likes of Daimh, Niteworks, Bridghe Campbell # the list goes on and on. #At these regular sessions there are some great young local players going along like Anna Scott, Dugald McKiggan, Archie and Isobel Maclean and Malin Lewis.#Morrison continued: #Recently over in LorientI saw a great act. It was a Sikh beatboxer, accompanied by step-dancer Sophie Stevenson along with Catherine Tinney from Portree singing puirt-a-beul.#This was another Skye person on the international stage, singing to an incredible standard, but she was someone I#d never heard sing before. #In the past, going somewhere like Lorient,there was a person from Skye on stage you would know exactly who it was # they would be an established name. Now you can go somewhere like that and get a surprise.#It shows the strength in depth there is now.#Some of that west-coast musical talent will be showcased at Skye Live this weekend among a ied line-up that will also include some of the country#s top nightclub DJs.Morrison urged the local community to rally behind the festival weekend, which this year starts with a Thursday-night concert to the Waterboys.He added: #We played at the very first Skye Live five years ago and are looking forward to getting on stage at the Lump in Portree again.#It#s an iconic setting, but organisers have kept the festival to a level that is comfortable for the place.#A capacity of , people is about a fth of the population of Skye and is manageable. When you start to go into the tens of thousands it brings pressures, and it#s a risk to go too big without the infrastructure to support it.#Whenever anyone organises a festival there will always be people who might want to pick holes in it or knock it in some way.#But people need to remember that these guys are putting on a  for so many types of music.#It#s something people of all ages can go to and hear some of the best music in Scotland in Portree. I would hope local people can support it in any way they can.#The Skye Live festival runs from Thursday th until Saturday th September. Acts on the bill include Niteworks, Elephant Sessions, Lau, Tide Lines and Peat and Diesel as well as DJs Erol Alkan, Optimoand Leon Vynehall.."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/barra-hospital.jpg","title":"consultation events for barra","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineComhairle nan Eilean Siar are to visit Barra next weekfor two consultation events that will help inform a feasibility study into thecreation of a combined school and hospital facility in Castlebay.The proposal caused confusion and anger earlier thisyear, when it was first publicised, as both the comhairle and NHS Western Isleshad already progressed a plan for a new hospital to replace St Brendan’s.

Launched officially on July , it was a case of getting straight down to business! The volunteers cover quite a large area, including Broughshane, Kells, Ballymena and the surrounding rural local areas.The group has  volunteers, however by August it had responded to  purple and red incidents in support of the Northern Ireland Ambulance Service.This translates into  inidual responses. The group prefers to send more than one responder to each patient in case their needs are beyond the capacity of a single person. Cardiac arrest is a case in point and while only three of patients have been in this specic condition, many more have been suffering from chest pain.Responders grow in experience and expertise, with the group aiming to have an experienced person at each incident to support them. The four committee members have ided this task between them.The more active members are learning fast, particularly through their exposure to NIAS crews and rapid response paramedics, who have been patient and helpful with them.The group held their second monthly members meeting and training event at the end of August and used this to reflect on their experiences, share what they had learned and build vital patient care competence.More members are needed and they are asking people to get in touchthey want to volunteer. Working with the Northern Ireland Ambulance Service and Dalriada Urgent Care, there is a planning and training programme organised for January soyou are interested check the group out on Facebook.The group posted recently: “One thing has become clear in the course of our first month’s activity -we need to recruit and train more responders. “We are working with NIAS on dates for another training course and this will determine our recruitment timetable.”A spokesperson added: “We owe huge thanks to those who made our new service possible.“The people and organisations who contributed so generously to help us meet our funding needs.“The NIAS Community Resuscitation Development Team, who guided us through the complexities of setting up the scheme, trained our members for us and continue to support us.“The Governance team at Dalriada Urgent Care, who supported us in our recruitment efforts and other vital matters such as insurance.“The front line staff of NIAS who have supported and guided us on scene.“And, last but certainly not least, our volunteers, who continue to give the community their time and newly-acquired expertise and to meet their new challenges with great resilience and good humour.“Its a privilege to work with you.”Follow the Braid Valley Community First Responders on Facebook to keep up to date with all their news and to see how you can become involved.

Lea explained to Phil and Holly how she had been spurred on by Gareth’s kindness to carry on the good gesture: “I know it wasn’t absolutely the same circumstances, but I just thought I wanted to do a good gesture for somebody  so I paid off the same amount that he’d paid off our cake onto someone ’s. It carries on the story as well.”Gareth and his we Kirsty, who live between Loughbrickland and Rathfriland on the outskirts of Banbridge, were then introduced.Lea Ni Bhriain on This MorningTheir daughter Hannah Stella Bronte was born prematurely on September ,  weighing just two pounds, five and half ounces.

Bangladesh finally won its freedom from East Pakistan in  after a bloody, -month war of independence which left up to three million dead.Of late the developing country has been in the headlines for providing shelter to , Rohingya who have fled persecution in neighbouring Myanmar.“Coláiste Feirste was honoured to welcome the Bangladeshi delegation,” said Seán Mistéil. “Minister Chowdhuryexplained the importance of mother languages to nation building and economic well-being. That resonated powerfully with our students.”Minister Chowdhury toured the site of the Gaeltacht Quarter’s next development project: a triangle of disused land which represents one of the last building sites fronting the Falls Road.“We have bold plans to transform this triangle of land into a Gaeltacht housing and tourism project,” added the Coláiste Feirste Chairman. “This vibrant and visionary social development initiative will promote the collective economic capacity of the wider Spórtlann na hÉireann and Coláiste Feirste site. We believe that maximising this hub of interdependent and unique elements is best achieved through a one site vision that connects all of its parts. We have this coordinating vision in place and it has enterprise and exchange at its heart. It is infused with environmental and economic promise and includes a wealth of cultural, sporting and human potential.”The visit of the Bangladeshi delegation was hosted by London-based Study Circle and facilitated by the growing Bangladeshi population of Belfast."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"bone man at key palestine hearing","story":"A BONE man is in the Hague this week as an international observer at a historic hearing on the Palestine-Israeli conflict.Eddie Whyte, who has lived in Norway for over thirty years, is also a member of the Palestine Justice Campaign.Eddie attended the International Criminal Court in the Netherlands as the case got underway yesterday .The case has been brought by Dutch citizen Ismail Ziada against the former Chief of General Staff of the Israeli Defence Force , Benny Gantz, and former Commander of the IDF Air Force, Amir Eshel, over the bombing of the Ziada family home in Gaza.The attack in July  killed six family members from three generations of the Ziada family, including Ismail’s -year-old mother, three brothers, his sister-in-law, a -year-old nephew and a visiting friend. Mr Ziada, who is of Palestinian origin, contends that the attack on the family home was a violation of international humanitarian law and constituted a gross violation of internationally recognised human rights principles.Mr Gantz and Mr Eshel claim immunity from the Dutch court and contend that Mr Ziada should have presented his claim in an Israeli court. Mr Gantz is running for office against Benjamin Netanyahu in the Israeli national elections this week.Speaking to the North Belfast News, Eddie said: “The case is historical in that it is the first time a Palestinian has been able to make use of civil litigation on the basis of universal jurisdiction to gain access to justice for war crimes.“The pursuance of the case has been made possible by an online crowdfunder which received widespread support in Ireland from iniduals, trade unions and human rights organisations and prominent people like Senator Frances Black, award-winning filmmaker Seán Murray and musician Mick Blake.

Two of the sculptures from the popular Julia Donaldson-penned Gruffalo tale were completely destroyed after they were set ablaze while others were defaced. Colin Glen Forest Park is home to the unique Trail and has visitors and families from across the city visit daily to see the attraction. Mother-of-two Nicola Marley said that it is “upsetting” for her children when their “favourite character or activity is signicantly damaged or missing” along the Trail.“I participated in a project with the Princes Trust to create a small memorial garden for victims who have lost their lives as a result of mental health issues,” she said. “A lot of hard work and time went into it, many close friends and family of the victims use the garden as a peaceful space to sit and reflect. It is sad that this has now been destroyed too. The park would be a nicer and safer placethe constant vandalism stopped.”Another parent, Janine Belton, spoke of how the Gruffalo Trail “gives the children a wonderful experience and provides them with some learning within nature.” “However, the animal statues have been destroyed, leaving the children confused and sad as they believe that the animals were being ‘hurt’,” she said. Bernadette Devlin, from Colin Sure Start said that vandalism on the Gruffalo Trail was impacting the learning and development of children in the area.“We use that facility a few times a year to bring parents and our children from nought to four age range,” she said.“It promotes the kids’ speech and language, it promotes their social interaction, it helps them learn about their environment and, most of all, it allows them to have fun. It’s local and it’s free of charge, but they are unable to enjoy it as much because of the vandalism of the statues on the Gruffalo Trail. It’s a health and safety issue too because the children like to get their photos taken with the statues, but obviously they can’t do that now. There is one near the entrance and you wouldn’t even be able to identy what it is now.“We just want to make people aware of the impact it’s having on the families who are living in the community.“It’s resource that we’ve had many an enjoyable outing to, and we would like to continue to do that. It has so many benefits for community, butthis vandalism continues we’ll no be able to use it. The safety of the children is paramount to us. We would be very wary of bringing families there because of the vandalism.”Sinn Féin Councillor Séanna Walsh described those behind the destruction as “a handful of disgruntled vandals who are attacking their own community”.“Colin Glen Forest Park is a major asset for this area, the community, council and departments are investing heavily into it and we are looking at a £ million investment package for it,” he said. “The Glider has really opened up the opportunity for people and families to access the park and we have a handful of youngsters who are turning up to try and vandalise it.“The park is set to launch its latest attraction, the toboggan, soon and planning applications are in for zip lines and mountain bike trails. There are big projects planned for the park. We would ask those who behind this vandalism to stay out of it.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"it could pay to back the boks in japan","story":"World rankings are a funny thing. Apparently, Belgium are the top-rated team in world football, ahead of Brazil and the actual world champions France writes our rugby tipster Paddy Tierney.In golf, Englishman Justin Rose moved to world number one ahead of the US Masters despite his one and only major victory coming at the  US Open. With the Rugby World Cup taking centre stage over the coming weeks, it is worth pointing out that Ireland are back to being the top-rated team in the world. That’s Ireland, who are rated as   shots to lt the Webb Ellis Trophy.That’s Ireland who were obliterated - in last month’s warm-up game at Twickenham.It seems back-to-back wins over Wales at Cardf and then Dublin were enough to promote Joe Schmidt’s side back to number one. Yet, Ireland have a painful history at the Rugby World Cup and have failed to make it past the quarter-final stage in eight previous attempts. In , they topped Pool D, but were humbled - by a ravenous Argentina side in the quarters. Their pain was only lessened by the fact that hosts England failed to make it out of Pool A behind Australia and Wales. However, the  winners look a dferent proposition four years on and Eddie Jones’ side are a real threat. They are   to top a Pool C group containing France and Argentina and look set to take on either Wales or Australia, who should finish first and second in Pool D, in the quarters. Pool B looks a shoot-out between world champions New Zealand and South Africa, while Ireland’s opening game against Scotland on Sunday could well determine who tops Pool A. Hosts Japan might have something to say about that and neither side will take them for granted after they caused one of the biggest upsets in the history of the competition by beating South Africa in their opening game of the  World Cup when managed by the aforementioned Jones. Either way, Ireland will face an almighty challenge to better their horrendous World Cup record as they will face either New Zealand or South Africa in the last eight.I think both Ireland and the All Blacks will top their group meaning it will be Scotland versus New Zealand and Ireland against South Africa. While Ireland have proven that they can beat any team in the world on their day, I can’t help but feel like the World Cup arrives  months too late for Schmidt’s men, who seem to thrive when they are written off. The decision to leave Devin Toner at home has ided opinion, while captain Rory Best is now  and will retire after the World Cup. Fitness doubts continue to linger about Johnny Sextonand Keith Earls, while Robbie Henshaw has been ruled out of the Scotland game with a hamstring injury and Ireland look destined for another quarter-final exit with most firms going   on that outcome. Elsewhere, I like the look of Wales at   to top Pool D and I think they’ll end up playing France in the quarter-final. If my predictions are correct, that would leave Warren Gatland’s side taking on South Africa in the last four. Wales are one of the few teams who should match the brute force of the Springboks and I wouldn’t be surprised to see them reaching the decider.That being said, almost every betting preview I’ve read has tipped South Africa as the winner and as much as I hate hopping on the bandwagon, they looked to have assembled one hell of a squad. The other semi-final could be the game of the tournament with world champions New Zealand looking like they are on a collision course with England.

Back in , the same countries contested the decider in France with South Africa winning - in a cagey affair at the Stade De France and I fancy a repeat of that result at the ,-capacity International Stadium in Yokohama.A certain Bryan Habana was the star of the World Cup  years ago, scoring eight tries and Cheslin Kolbe could be worth a wager in the top-tryscorer market at  .

Two of the leaders at the time Orla Nic Shíomóin and Orla Nig Fhearraigh thought I could sing and had a lovely voice. They approached my dad and askedit was okay for me to sing in the Scór na nÓg. I’ve been singing every year since.”Méabh spoke of how the club’s Cultural Officer, Ronan McHugh “asked me to come back last year to teach the kids how to sing the anthem”. “That is the thing about our club, the kids that attend the summer schemes, and there are now three running, end up coaching younger kids coming through which is fantastic,especially the U- girls.”“I then started singing the national anthem at club events such as juvenile and senior dinners. “Antrim Cultural Officer Bronagh Lennon asked my dadI could sing at some championship games and then onto County Antrim league games. Bronagh has been a great influence and mentor, not only to me but to other kids in the county with her encouragement.”Méabh’s extremely proud dad Joe said all the family will be travelling down to Dublin to support her on Sunday.“There is a big festival on at the club on Sunday and the game will be on in the club after that.

Following her momentous pitch debut at the Jones’ Road stadium on Sunday, Méabh will be straight into rehearsals for her school’s production of Beauty and the Beast of which she will perform the role of Belle. “I sang the national anthem in front of the Artane Band at Clones, that was a huge honour and an amazing day so imagine what it was like when my dad broke the news to me that I had been invited to sing our national anthem in Croke Park in front of an estimated , people. I’m just so excited.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"one womans journey of discovery on lyric stage","story":"HOUSE lights dim, stage lights up and our scene is set.

He attended Holy Cross Boys Primary School in the district and is also a past pupil of the old St Gabriel’s school.Leaving school at , Thomas admits that the academic world was not for him and he left home soon after to work in England.“School just wasn’t for me,” he explained.“I wasn’t academic but always fascinated by art and photos in newspapers and magazines such as The Observer and Sunday Times magazines.“I left home at  and went to England. There wasn’t much work here at the time and I just wanted to get away from Belfast with all the conflict going on.“I saw so much trouble and bloodshed on the streets. My community was under siege.“You couldn’t get in or out of Ardoyne without getting checked by British Army or RUC.“I was away for a year and worked in construction on building sites in London. I decided to come back because to be honest, I missed the place.“I didn’t really like London at all. It was far too quiet compared to back home.”Thomas ed to Belfast and turned his attention back to one of his hobbies and interests he had from a young age – photography.“I wanted to pursue a career in photography,” he added.“I went to night school where I learnt the basics but I wanted a job so I could work for the community using photography.“I managed to get an interview with the founder of Andersonstown News in West Belfast, Basil McLaughlin and Máirtín Ó Muilleoir who told me they were starting a new newspaper for North Belfast.“I was familiar with the Andersonstown News and liked the fact that they provided a voice for the community in West Belfast during the Troubles.“My interview was  years ago and I haven’t looked back since.”In  years, Thomas has established himself as a well-known and talented photographer and there wouldn’t be many in North Belfast who haven’t recognised him out and about doing the job he loves.Still, much has changed over the years in North Belfast and in photography.“North Belfast has changed in some ways but many issues remain today like housing and the unfair points system.“Community relations have improved with integrated education but even today, there are still sectarian attacks and peace walls remain up iding communities.“There are still people out there fighting for peace.“As for photography, I started off developing my own black and white images before it moved on to the digital age which takes up a lot less time and I can produce more photos.”Thomas has enjoyed many successes over the years and in , showcased  years of his work in the local media at an exhibition for Féile an Phobail.Back in May of this year, he scooped four awards at the Northern Ireland Press Photographers Awards, including first place in the Inidual Study and Sports Action categories along with a Provincial Merit Award.

It ought to be a resignation issue but wont, given the proximity of a general election in late Autumn or early .Amid the noise, bluster and faux outrage, there will be a sizeable number of Labour MPs privately anxious to avoid a resumption of Parliament. Why would they want to be dragged from the fun of a party conference by the Brighton seaside to hear parliamentary arguments played on a repeat loop for the last year  While it is unlikely that the Supreme Court, should it find against the Government, will determine the date Parliament should resume, the pressure for an immediate restoration would be huge. That could take a wrecking ball to the Conservatives gathering in Manchester at the end of this month.In truth, Parliament prorogued is probably as effective as Parliament sitting. MPs wasted the last year voting against all options. The Liberal Democrats have now decided that all options are off now, anyway. They will simply cancel Brexit. This from a party that supported a referendum.Any chance of a deal will owe precious little to Westminster, where posturing and pantomime had long displaced any serious consideration of the issues at stage. Instead, progress will be a product of often fractious but, of late, somewhat more measured exchanges involving the UK and Irish governments, the EU and the DUP.Arlene Fosters party made a signicant concession in accepting all-Ireland - in effect, EU - alignment in agriculture and food, butthat is the limit to the DUPs movement, there is still huge distance to travel. More than % of cross-border trade is in other sectors and the demand for the backstop remains for those aspects.There is a reasonable chance that the backstop is re-labelled as it is politically toxic - but a renaming is not a dispelling. Resolving the issues will require much more moderation and considerable fudging.Assurances might be given to the DUP that any checking of goods travelling from Great Britain to Northern Ireland will be subject to, at most, token checks. A revival of Stormont could be talked up as part of a triple-lock on any EU expansion of regulations covering all-Ireland trade, involving the Westminster and Dublin parliaments and the Northern Ireland Assembly. Some concessions to the technocratic approach to customs and regulations checks offered by the Alternative Arrangements Commission might be forthcoming. The sum of modest parts might be sufficient to claim victory in modying the Withdrawal Agreementor upholding all its principles .The DUP needs a win to take to its own party conference at the end of October, which, like Sinn Feins Ard Fheis three weeks later, might take on the appearance of a pre-election rally. Given the DUPs long-standing opposition to the backstop, the party needs to show how it made a substantial contribution to its modication. Bilateral discussions between Arlene Foster and the Taoiseach indicate that neither party wants to be responsible for a no-deal failure. Leo Varadkar has got most of his electorate onside in the blame game. It might be harder for Arlene Foster at an election, even allowing that the DUPs support has held up perfectly well in the three years since the EU referendum.The endgame will probably not become clear until the European Council meeting in mid-October. It may be autumn but it is neither mellow nor fruitful. Just very misty, with little sign of the fog clearing.Jon Tonge is Professor of Politics at the University of Liverpool.

However DUP councillor David Graham branded the decision as \"politically contrived\" and claimed it would disproportionately impact Protestant, Unionist and Loyalistcommunities. \"No one wants to see flags flying in tatters,\" he said.\"We opposed this consultation because it has been politically contrived. \"There has been clear legal advice to the council that the PUL community would be unfairly impacted due to the cultural and historical traditions within that community.\"The move, which follows months of tensions heightened by the appearance of Soldier F emblems in loyalist areas, was supported by Sinn Fein, the SDLP and the Alliance Party.Exact details of the planned poll will be discussed at a future committee meeting and will need to be ratied by full council when it meets in October.Mr Graham said Belfast City Council\"does not have the legal remit to legislate on flags\" in the absence of a ing Assembly. \"Therefore, regardless of the outcome, BCC will not be able to implement any proposals,\" he added.\"This is another outworking of a mess created by Sinn Fein. \"They originally started by proposing a motion on banners, with the assistance of Alliance, now it has turned into a public consultation.\"The DUP has been consistently opposed to the flying of any paramilitary flags.\"The Balmoral representative was referring to a Sinn Fein motion passed in July which forced the council to take legal action against the Department for Infrastructure.The move compelled the council to remove paramilitary flags from its property including UVF banners from lamp-posts in the mixed housing development in Cantrell Close. No action was ultimately taken after the department cited fears over simmering tensions and staff safety.After seeking legal advice the council backed down and the thorny issue was back on its agenda. Alliance councillor Emmet McDonough-Brown, who proposed the latest motion, said it is not the local authoritys role to decide how communities express themselves.\"Flags are often displayed as symbols of marking territory in the community, intimidating residents and visitors, and can even impact businesses ability to trade,\" he said.\"However, a shared future does not mean a neutral, nondescript future.\" The Botanic representative said legal emblems and flags can be a safe, respectful and legitimate way to express culture which means the public must be consulted.\"It is not good enough for the council to attempt to take action on an ad hoc basis as flags go up,\" he added. Another unionist councillor who was at yesterdays meeting accused those who supported the action of engaging in a dangerous game of \"chest beating\".\"It simply wont work,\" they said. \"Self regulation is starting to produce results as it has done with bonfires and this decision only serves to undermine that progress. \"Its just another way for the council to wash its hands of the problem. \"No one wants to see paramilitary flags on our streets but this is just going to create more tension.\" The consultation is expected to take place in December or January."},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article38513717.ece/ALTERNATES/h342/_108859437_charlie.jpg","title":"farmer who appeared in dup campaign regrets brexit vote","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsRugby World CupNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

He lost his seat on the last count and Mr Manton wasnt elected.It is understood that the legal action centres on an alleged verbal agreement between the UUP veteran and his party over the conduct of the campaign.Earlier this week, Belfast High Court heard that Mr McGimpsey is to pay £, for ly referring to Derry-born Republic of Ireland player James McClean as a \"super-Provo\". His legal action against the UUP pre-dates that settlement.Mr McGimpsey has been a UUP member for  years and retains membership of the Knock and Ballyhackamore branch.He had been a councillor for almost two decades representing Court and Castlereagh Central before being elected in Lisnasharragh in .Both Mr McGimpsey and the UUP yesterday declined to comment. The veteran politician is also suing Mr Manton for libel. Mr McGimpsey alleges that his running mate defamed him on social media.Mr Manton had tweeted in response to an interview Mr McGimpsey had given prior to the count in which the councillor said he didnt know Mr Manton. \"He was in the Conservative Party and he joined us I think about a year ago so I dont really know the guy. Ive spoken to him once I think,\" Mr McGimpsey said.Mr Manton then tweeted that he wanted to \"clary\" that he had been a member of the UUP \"since January \" and he went on to make other remarks Mr McGimpsey alleges were defamatory.Mr McGimpsey is one of his partys most left-wing and liberal members.

Tragically, Dessie was killed in a car crash in .“Dessie was the best of us. Him and Brendan were the two runners. Dessie was a great runner at school and then at Sparta where he was captain. He was a very popular fella.“As well as being a great runner he was a great captain. He looked after his charges very well.“Brendan and his we both ran for Northern Ireland and were both very good athletes. Dessie ran shorter distances whereas Brendan ran anything from km right through to the marathon.”Harry was somewhat of a late starter when it came to running, his brothers talked him into it at a time he was overweight in the early s. About a year later he competed in his first marathon in Dublin.He was one of the founding members of Foyle Valley Athletics Club in . At the time they were told it wouldn’t survive six months, but  years later it now has approximately  members.It is an “all ability club” with dferent groups meeting weekly at Templemore Sports Complex and in the Waterside. “Anybody who wants to run will get the opportunity butyou don’t want to compete you can join to keep fit. We like people to compete but don’t put anyone under pressure to do so.”“I, to be perfectly frank, wasn’t brought in for my athletic expertise, I’m not saying I was useless but would’ve been average, but that fits into the ethos of the club.”Personal bestDespite his modesty, Harry has run impressive times over the years, recording a sub--hour marathon in Belfast. That is no mean feat, it requires dedicated training, and, on the day you have to run an average of around : per mile across the . mile course.Harry recalled his brother Dessie spurring him on as he neared the finish line that day, sadly, it would be the last time he saw him alive.“It was the st of May  and Dessie was killed ten days later on the th. I hadn’t enough long runs coming into it and at the latter stages I was absolutely out of it, really struggling.“Dessie was there at the  mile mark and, in Belfast I don’t know anybody, but I heard this voice shouting ‘Harry, get your head up out of your chest! You’ve come through  mile in : you can break  hours but you’re going to have to work for it’.“It just gave me enough encouragement to keep going. He came round to see me at the finish line. “He had just moved to Belfast and wanted me to see his new house but I had come with a crowd of boys on a train and said I’d be up in a couple of weeks to spend the weekend, to do a bit of running and play some snooker.“But he was killed ten days later.”Marty Gallaghergoogletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refreshTwenty years later, Marty Gallagher, a young prodigy of Harry’s, was killed in similarly tragic circumstances.Next month fty members of Foyle Valley will take part in this year’s Dublin marathon in memory of Marty who died after being hit by a car on the Racecourse Road while ing home on Halloween night.Martin was -years-old and it will be his th anniversary this year.Reflecting, Harry said: “Marty Gallagher was a lovely young fella, very modest, unassuming, and comes from such a nice family.“He was a member of the club and would’ve been one of my prodigies when he first came into running, I would’ve nurtured him, but then he got to the stage where he was too quick for me and I couldn’t stay with him. I’d have needed a bike to keep up with him.”Harry has been fortunate to avoid serious injury over the years aside from breaking his ankle in . Doctors warned that without an operation he would have chronic arthritis and would never run again.“You learn to live with the fact that on the long runs you’re going to be in pain. I was lucky to get away with running the Derry marathon this year.”After a more recent x-ray, a doctor warned thathe continued at his present rate he would need a new ankle.“I wear an ankle support and patella support, but you’re not going to let stuff like that stop you,” he added.CamaraderieSpecial club memories include a time when members competed in the All Ireland Marathon Championship in Mallow Co. Cork, in . They won the senior marathon and veteran’s championships.As winners they had the honour of hosting the competition in Derry the following year. It was a very successful event which stands out as one of the clubs highlights.Harry finished second in the veterans team and his brother Brendan competed well in the senior team.Looking back at other fond memories, Harry cited the Walled City Marathon in , which was the first marathon to be held in Derry for many years.“I thoroughly enjoyed it, along with the London marathon, I’ve done four of them, and the Great North Run, which I’ve done twice.“But the club itself, the camaraderie is just unbelievable. It’s a social outlet more than anything . In terms of the people, not just at Foyle Valley but running in general, there are very few people I’ve met through running that I could say I didn’t like, they’re all good hearted, good natured people, and help you in any way they can. They’re gracious in defeat and generous in victory.“Foyle Valley has a great family atmosphere,someone is training for a marathon they will always train with you and help you through. That’s part of the ethos of the club.”Fitness has become an essential component of many people’s lives as experts regularly expound on the benefits to both physical and mental health.Therefore, the emergence of new clubs, and the introduction of couch to k runs, has been “one of the best” things to happen in the city in Harry’s view. “The people behind these clubs love their running and are so friendly. They got people out who never would’ve necessarily been interested in running, and now they’re doing half marathons and marathons - that’s fabulous.”"},{"url":null,"title":"department weighing medical school options","story":"The Department of Health is assessing the cost-effectiveness of locating a Medical School in Derry and said any final decision will require ministerial sign off.The Medical School forms part of Derry’s City Deal proposals and as such the local council is engaging with the UK government to see “ this project would be eligible for UKG funding under the City Deals programme or the Integrated Education Fund.”The Ulster University has been for some time considering the development of a Graduate Entry Medical Schoolto be located in Derry and this project proposal features heavily in the Derry City  Strabane District Council’s economic regeneration plans for the region.With the support of the Local Council the University partners have been engaging with a number of NI Departments in an effort to progress this proposal.A spokesperson for UU confirmed that as part of its latest business case it aims to have its first academic year of enrolments for the GEMS in  .The Northern Ireland Department of Healthis acutely aware of the pressures on the medical workforce across Health and Social Careand its key role in leading the transformation of services set out in Delivering Together.Accordingly, DoH commissioned a Medical School Places Review, led by Professor Keith Gardiner, to determine the optimum number of medical school places that Northern Ireland requires per year.

Given the cross-cutting nature and potential for signicant associated costs with the Medical School business case, the DoH Permanent Secretary has advised that any decision on this or other long-term options, must be considered by Northern Ireland Executive Ministers.”It added: “The provision of HE places in NI or the establishment of a medical school in Derry is a devolved matter, however, the Derry  Strabane City District Council is presently engaging with UKG to considerthis project would be eligible for UKG funding under the City Deals programme or the Integrated Education Fund.“The medical school is one part of a wider package of proposals currently under consideration with other draft proposals included that could complement existing specialties at the Magee Campus.“The development of the Council’s final bids for a City Deal from the Inclusive Future Fund is still ongoing and as of August , there has been no official final bid submitted for either funding stream to UKG, including no formal bid to provide funding to a Derry medical school.”googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refreshPhoto: projected image of what Magee will look likeexpanded with Graduate Entry Medical School by the riverfront."},{"url":null,"title":"derry homeowners left shaken burglary waterside area city","story":"Detectives are appealing for witnesses and information following the report of a burglary at a house in the Grovemount Court area of Altnagelvin, Derry, on Thursday  September.Detective Sergeant Boyd said: “It was reported that entry was gained to the property between am and pm on Thursday.

Alongside that are centres of innovation and excellence in data analyticsand robotics and automationand a Personalised Medicine Centre of Excellence .Julian Smiths report says the proposals to expand Magee had signicant funding consequences from a capital infrastructure perspective, approximately £m, and from a resource funding perspective.The proposal would require Higher Education in NI to be placed on a sustainable footing, comparable with England, from which expansion would take place.According to the report, there would also be, as with any requested expansion or increase to student numbers, resource grant consequences of funding the proposed additional places at UU and NWRC, and associated student support costs, circa £m.\"The £m capital cost was highly indicative and based on an assumed cost per square metre per student.\"The Department for the Economyundertook initial work to determine how it would look at the case,there was an agreement on how the sector as a whole could be sustainably funded, as any expansion in student numbers would not make sense without this in place,\" it said.In February , DfE wrote to, and is awaiting a response from, UU requesting that an update be made to the case, according to the report.DfE asked for a more accurate assessment of capital need, which was \"very theoretical\" in the original proposal and created a signicant cost requirement. It wants a review of the number and subject level mix of additional students required to ensure an underpinning alignment with graduate postgraduate economic need in subject areas proposed.Furthermore, the department requested information around phasing of the project to assessthere are \"more suitable break points\" in the proposal and a potential to scale any expansion both in terms of student numbers and capital development.And sought the \"rationale\" for locating additional higher education places in the Magee Campus, as opposed to other geographical locations with further and more detailed explanation in relation to sub-regional economic benefits.This information will be critical to enabling a strategic approach to HE provision and in feeding into any final business case that might be put forward for this proposal, it concluded.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refresh"},{"url":null,"title":"magherafelt based actor blown away role movie linked jurassic world franchise","story":"By Cathal McGuiganA Magherafelt-based actor has said he was “blown away” when he learned he had been cast in Battle at Big Rock, a short film thats part of the Jurassic World franchise.Chris Finlaysonplays American biker Greg in the film and aims to build on this role and some experience as an extra to land more acting roles.Battle at Big Rock was posted to Youtube on Sunday and had been viewed more than three million times by Thursday evening. Starring alongside Chris in the film were André Hollandand Natalie Martinez .Scottish-born Chrismoved to Magherafelt in , where he worked as a personal trainer. He said that his acting career really began when the opportunity arose to work as an extra on Game of Thrones.As well as appearing as a member of the Nights Watch in three seasons of the show, hes also featured in Superman drama Krypton and filmed sword-fighting scenes for the film Viking Destiny, which is available on Netflix.He first heard about the Jurassic World role when a friend tagged him on Facebook in a post from Louise Kiely Casting, which gave away very few details about the role.“They were looking for a biker with a flawless American accent. I just thought Id go for it and see what happens,” he said.Chris said that when it came to the day of the audition in Dublin he was “sweating bullets” and almost didnt go through with it.“Just as I was walking up to the door, I sort of freaked out. I went past it and I said to myself I cant do this just because of the nerves, because I wanted it so badly,” he said.“Then I was thinking to myself, youve come this far, you need to do this. I genuinely thought I didnt stand a chance as I knew Id be up against actors with more experience.”“I went and got myself two pints of Guinness, settled my nerves and went back. I was happy when I came out and thought Id done well but I thought it would just be good experience and that I wasnt going to get it.”A few weeks later the casting agent emailed Chris to let him know that the role was his, but he still didnt know exactly what he had been cast in.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refresh“I thought it was probably some low-budget thing, but I was happy to get the experience and a few lines. To me, that would be a start at least.”Chris found a few clues about the production by looking up Jurassic World  director Colin Trevorrow on IMDB, but it was only at a costume fitting that he fully realised how big an opportunity he had been given.“They werent even allowed to say it but it was so secret,” he said.“One of the girls said to me that all they tell could me was that it rhymes with schminosaurs and I just knew. I was just blown away because Ive always loved Jurassic Park.”The eight-minute film was filmed in January in Co Wicklow, which means that Chris is happy to finally be able to talk about the role hes had to keep under wraps for months.“The weirdest thing is just seeing my name in the credits. Thats one of the most surreal things,” he said.Chris said that he hopes to find an agent in the near future to help him land more roles. He believes that a talent for accents hes developed from a young age can help him secure some great parts.“Accents have always been something that comes naturally to me. Even when I was only about four or five years old, I would talk to myself in the mirror and try out lots of dferent accents.”This skill came in handy when Chris played redneck biker Greg with an American accent so accurate that the production crew assumed it was his regular speaking voice.“Most of the crew on the set thought I was an American actor,” Chris said.“It wasnt until Id done my first scene and I asked someone what time it was, that they realised I wasnt an American. They couldnt believe it when I said Id just came down from Magherafelt.”"},{"url":null,"title":"ulster university responds questions regarding city deal funds medical school","story":"The Derry News posed a number of questions to Ulster Universityover the continued uncertainty on the establishment of a Medical School at Magee College.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refreshFirstly, we asked does UU have any update or response regarding the medical school and concerns raised by David Sterling around the need for ongoing funding which UU is not prepared to invest   A spokesperson for Ulster University commented: \"Following cross-party political and health and social care support in  for Ulster University’s Graduate Entry Medical School, the University has continued to proactively develop the project, working closely with the Department and other relevant partners. Our responses to any remaining clarications within the Graduate Entry Medical School business case were submitted to the Department of Health at the start of July, following prompt and close engagement with the Department and other relevant partners. Our proposed first academic year of projected enrolments outlined within the updated business case is  .“As the Department of Health has previously confirmed that any decision on funding can only be made by Ministers, the University is not actively recruiting medical students as yet for  entry until that decision on funding can be reached.· If funding was confirmed, all other elements of the proposal for our medical undergraduate degree programme have been firmly on track including continued progress with the GMC, clinical placement opportunities and the development of a curriculum to meet the needs of healthcare locally.“We value the continued support of all those who share our vision for medical education and we continue to work with the General Medical Council, St George’s University of London and local clinicians and partners building on our existing leadership in medical and healthcare provision to take forward graduate entry medical education for Northern Ireland.\"What does UU say in response to local councillors representatives who have claimed that UU has neglected the Magee campus for decades and should not be given money as part of the City Deal but should instead invest its own money in Derry   A spokesperson for Ulster University commented: \"Ulster University continues to invest in the Magee campus, most recently with the state-of-the-art £m teaching block which signals our ambition for higher education in the city, already enhancing campus le and paving the way for enhanced future capacity at Magee.    This and other investment priorities for students have resulted in a very strong performance for the Magee campus across all elements of the  National Student Survey, reflecting the very positive reaction from our students to these recent investments in University le at Magee.  With all four faculties of the University represented on the Magee campus – across health sciences, arts and humanities, business and computing and engineering, we are pushing boundaries and breaking new ground in emerging sectors as a progressive university, shortlisted for the prestigious Times Higher Education University of the Year Award, .“Our contribution to the City Deal opportunity is a signicant step forward in our collective opportunity to realise the full ambitions of this vibrant university city.  Our City Deals proposal will see us apply our expertise to help maximize the city’s potential in this unparalleled opportunity to boost economic growth and prosperity.  In our continued collaboration with industry partners, we look forward to driving innovation in personalised medicine, cognitive analytics, robotics and automation, leading to both new research posts and learning opportunities for additional students.  The proposed riverfront innovation hub will build upon the expertise of our first data analytics Institute, opened in  and headquartered at Magee campus, and which cemented our reputation as a global leader in this field. Also integral to the City Deal remains our commitment to establishing a Graduate Entry Medical School in a bid to address the challenges of a healthcare system at breaking point.   City Deal recognises the crucial role our University can play as an economic engine in the North West and is a major boost to the collective ambitions of the city and region.  We look forward to the development of our projects in partnership with industry, civic and educational partners.\"How much money will be needed in total to fund the projects put forward as part of the City Deal A spokesperson for Ulster University commented: \"The funding contributions by project across City Deal and the Inclusive Futures Funds are indicative at this stage, based on the allocations provided by Council, and subject to adjustment as we go forward.  Our contribution of % University funding to the Magee projects within City Deal reflects our belief in the impact they will make, and our commitment to playing our part in the collective ambitions of City Deal.“City Deal enables us to build further on our academic strengths that are signicant for the region’s growth, and to make sure that this expertise across world class research and progressive student learning works hard for the benefit of all in the city region. The City Deal bid has education, innovation, job creation and skills development at its core and each of these priorities are also central to our work across both teaching and research.  We are therefore a natural fit and a committed partner in this ambitious bid.  A continued collaborative approach is essential as we prepare to take forward the projects through planning and design and development of the business cases.”"},{"url":null,"title":"montgomery couple aiming high charity head top mt kilimanjaro","story":"Stuart and Kate Richards from Montgomery will follow in Ed Ballsrsquo footstepltspan classtruncategtltspan classtruncate-previewgts by climbing Mt Killtspan classtruncate-full-screengtimanjaro in Tanzania for charity.lt spangtlt spangtlt spangt\" Montgomery couple head for the top of Mt Kilimanjaro for charityKate and Stuart on Toubcal in Morocco earlier this year.\" Skip to next photo Show caption  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\" href\" my account emailthispage \""},{"url":"http://www.countytimes.co.uk/ource srcset=/resources/images/10444665.jpg?htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"uknewsnational","story":"Get involved with the news in your community Send your stories and photos now  d  document.getElementsByClassName.style.display  blockLoading...Most popular         ,Promoted stories       Loading...Most popular Contact UsNewslettersNewsquest PrintingAdvertiseArchiveSite MapAnnouncementsLeapExchange and MartTerms  ConditionsPrivacy PolicyCookie PolicyManage ConsentTerms of AdvertisingContributor TermsDiversity StatementIpsoregulatedThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

The upgrading of the pitch is certainly sustainable financially, given the amount of usage it would get.ldquoWe have lost  teams to other leagues in the past few years and they have all cited poor facilities as their main reason for moving to play in the the Lisburn or South Belfast Leagues, he added.Mr Torney said it was essential that proper facilities were put in place to enable the league to avoid weekly postponements of games.ldquoWe are left every year with a fixture congestion because of postponements and in order to arrest the haemorrhaging of clubs from the league we must address this issue immediately.The league are being supported by South Down MP Chris Hazzard, who has called on Newry, Mourne and Down Council to ldquofinally deliver fit for purpose pitches for the local community in Downpatrick.He continued: ldquoThe current provision of sports pitches at Dunleath Park is nothing short of a disgrace.ldquoDunleath Park is used extensively by the Downpatrick Youth Football League with hundreds of young footballers playing each weekend, but yet againthis week, parts of the pitches have been closed to the public as raw sewage has come to the surface.ldquoIt is an absolute shame that in the shadow of our fantastic new leisure centre here in Downpatrick our local young people are expected to make do with substandard pitches that not only flood for most of the winter months, but are regularly polluted with raw sewage.Mr Hazzard believes that Downpatrick deserves much better treatment.ldquoAs the county town, Downpatrick deserves to have the very best in local sports provision, and that simply isnrsquot the case at the moment.ldquoIt is deeply disappointing that so many of our young footballers are left to travel to Lisburn and Belfast each weekend to play football. That must not be allowed to continue.Mr Hazzard added: ldquoWhilst there is no getting away from the fact that Dunleath Park is in a flood plain area, I would have sympathy with local sports clubs that feel that this is too easily put up as a hurdle to any investment, and that the council should actively consider a range of solutions in order to deliver suitable facilities.ldquoI want to thank those local sports clubs and Downpatrick Youth League representatives who continue to work tirelessly in order to provide local sporting opportunities for our young people and I will now be making representation to senior council management in order to make all their voices heard..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/18th September 2019 Castlewellan.jpg","title":"Castlewellan forest cycle in the park family event in aid of Knockevin Special School  ","story":"ALL roads lead to Castlewellan Forest Park this Sunday for a special event to raise money for Knockevin Special School in Downpatrick and celebrate the benefits of cycling for everyone.The lsquocycle in the parkrsquo event is being organised by the schoolrsquos Parent Staff Association to raise funds to help purchase new bikes for pupils to help them experience nature and the great outdoors.Sundayrsquos all ability event mdash which runs from am until pm ndash is being billed as a celebration of cycling and will have something for families and special needs adventurers, hard core mountain bikers, club riders, children and young people.The event is being hosted by the Kilmegan Velo Cycling Club with its chairman, Sean Warnock, inviting all cyclists to make their way to the forest park for the event.He said: ldquoThe aim is to get families and friends to experience cycling in a safe setting but full of adventure and we have events for all abilities.ldquoThere will be family trail quests, agility skills for kids, a full time-trial on the red trails, special needs bikes and a Sunday club fuel stop.

Title deeds, usually the easiest of documents to trace, have become impossible to track down.Three people are laying claim to the pier alone and a legal row is pending about whether a contract was broken over the sale of pier some time ago.Against this backcloth, Down council official have been trying to bring the harbour into public ownership since the publication of the Governmentrsquos cash-help promise in July . Before then they had already spent four years attempting to trace owners.This week councillors decided to end their six-year search and apply for vesting mdash a statutory power which enables a Government department to buy land compulsorily, despite the wishes of the owner.But they were warned by council administrative officer, Mr Owen OrsquoConnor, that it would be a dficult vesting order and he could not guarantee that the whole of the inner bay of Killough would be acquired before December.The last-ditch attempt to beat the deadline was sparked off by Downpatrick councillor, Mr John Ritchie, who has been trying to push the council into buying the harbour since .

A corporate body has almost been directed to include a political representative on its deputation. This will create tensions which this council and district can do without.Mr Sean Quinnthought it was ldquorather arrogant of the minister to make the suggestion and he believed that Mr Powell was like previous South Down MPs, who, he said, had not satisfactorily served the constituency.Official Unionist councillor, Mrs Ethel Smyth, said she would resent it as much as anybodyshe felt the councilrsquos powers were being usurped, but on this occasion she thought it was only natural that Mr Powell should join the deputation.She told councillors: ldquoMr Powell has worked consistently very hard for all sections of the community and nobody could accuse him of working for one party or another. He is one of the best constituency MPs at Westminster.A motion by Mrs Smyth to invite Mr Powell on the deputation was defeated by nine votes to seven mdash a defeat which did not go down well with Official Unionist, Mr William Finlay, who told the SDLP members: ldquoThat was just a political vote.

Some pedestrians have also been struck by vehicles.The provision of new puffin crossings will result in traffic lights being provided either side of the roundabout, with the move welcomed by Mournes councillor, Willie Clarke.He described the provision of the new crossings as a ldquolong overdue priority for pedestrian safety in Newcastle explaining that they will help reduce pedestrian collisions and near misses at a particularly busy part of the resort.ldquoAlong with other elected representatives, community and residentsrsquo groups, the local Policing and Community Safety Partnership and the public I have campaigned for the replacement of the zebra crossing with a controlled lights crossing, said Cllr Clarke.ldquoI have campaigned for this road safety measure for over a decade and am delighted work has started this week. I would also urge motorists to be patient and allow more time for their journeys over the next five weeks as the work progresses.Describing the new road safety measure as a lsquolong overdue priority, Cllr Clarke said the new crossings will be warmly welcomed.He said that also as part of the scheme, a new footpath will be created at the Castlewellan Road side of the roundabout linking the new puffin crossing at the Dundrum Road side.Cllr Clarke added: ldquoThe ongoing work will provide safe, controlled crossing facilities and will assist with reducing personal injury collisions recorded at the roundabout.News of work starting on the new crossings comes weeks after roads officials scrapped another proposal to address road safety and congestion issues at the roundabout.The Department of Infrastructure was planning to create a new dedicated filter lane at the Dundrum Road side of the roundabout, designed to enable drivers entering the resort from this direction, wishing to access the Castlewellan Road, to do so without causing major tailbacks.The scheme mdash which had not been fully costed mdash would have left two existing lanes for the exclusive use of traffic heading into the centre of Newcastle.Roads engineers were confident that the proposal would have signicantly reduced congestion, but it was recently confirmed at a special meeting of Newry, Mourne and Down Council that the plug had been pulled on the scheme.Local politicians were told that the project was not viable given the number of underground utilities at this part of the resort. However, roads officials confirmed that they are in the process of drawing up an alternative scheme, the detail of which they hope to unveil shortly..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/18th September 2019 Smyth.jpg","title":"Smyth first home at Finnebrogue Woods  ","story":"OVER  athletes took part in inaugural M B McGrady  Co Chartered Accountants Beer and Bubbles charity run at Finnebrogue Woods last Thursday night.Sunny weather made for perfect running conditions for the race that took place in Finnebrogue Woods, on the outskirts of Downpatrick.Prizes were awarded to fastest male, David Smyth and fastest female, Carissa McLister, who completed her first ever km race.

Lea explained to Phil and Holly how she had been spurred on by Gareth’s kindness to carry on the good gesture: “I know it wasn’t absolutely the same circumstances, but I just thought I wanted to do a good gesture for somebody  so I paid off the same amount that he’d paid off our cake onto someone ’s. It carries on the story as well.”Gareth and his we Kirsty, who live between Loughbrickland and Rathfriland on the outskirts of Banbridge, were then introduced.Lea Ni Bhriain on This MorningTheir daughter Hannah Stella Bronte was born prematurely on September ,  weighing just two pounds, five and half ounces.

That was something we had planned.“I’d said to Kirsty I wanted to do something dferent, maybe a little random act of kindness to share a little joy.

And to make it worse, only the least self-aware of their number is expecting any public understanding of their situation, and certainly not any sympathy.Former Green Party leader in Northern Ireland Steven Agnew has left the AssemblyWith the exception of a -minute session where MLAs signed the roll after the last election, it is now  days since the Assembly last sat.Depending on one’s political perspective, it is either Sinn Féin or the DUP’s fault that Stormont is not operating – although, regardless of whether Sinn Féin’s reasons for toppling Stormont were valid, the DUP can point to the fact that it never walked away from the institution..ev-modals .modal.in .modal-dialog .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget .photo-article-notier-default .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p @media.photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p #jp .main-content .ev-widget#sticky-footer .sticky-footer-banner .photo-article-sticky-footer-banner .photo-article-sticky-footer-banner p @media@media#sticky-footer .desktop-sticky-footer_text,#sticky-footer .desktop-sticky-footer_button #sticky-footer .fluid-container #sticky-footer .mobile-sticky-footer_button But what is incontrovertible is that there is virtually nothing which the other parties – the UUP, SDLP, Alliance, Greens, TUV, PBP and independent Claire Sugden – can do to restore devolution.The system instigated by the Belfast Agreement gives each of the DUP and Sinn Féin, as the largest parties, a veto over whether devolution can .That means that  of the Assembly’s  MLAs are powerless to resolve the impasse. Yet many of the public – understandably unaware of the finer points of the Northern Ireland Act  as amended by the Northern IrelandAct  – simply view all MLAs as feckless workshy scoundrels. Aware of how deeply unpopular our politicians now are, you are unlikely to hear MLAs – even from the smaller parties – complaining too vocerously about this in interviews.Privately, some MLAs speak about their situation with a depressive frustration. Although they are still able to continue with constituency business, and that is a signicant element of any politician’s role, they were elected not to be gloried councillors but as legislators who would scrutinise legislation, set budgets and hold both civil servants and each other to account.Quite logically, the government belatedly cut their pay from £, to £, – a compromise between the fact that they continue to do some work, but are not doing their full jobs, and also the reality thatall salaries are stopped then MLAs will have to find other work.Having done so, there is the potential that much of the political class would simply leave politics, never to .Some observers believe that would be good, sweeping out the deadwood and bringing in new people unshackled to the past.But while new voices can inject energy, there is also a loss of institutional memory – not just of how politics operates in the basics such as scrutinising the work of departments, but in being aware of past mistakes. Solutions which on the outside can seem easy can crumple under the wisdom of someone who remembers what happened the last time that approach was tried. outside of the High Court in Belfast on Friday September  , where he welcomed a ruling by the Court of Appeal in Belfast that  internees, known as the Hooded Men, had a legitimate expectation of a PSNI investigation into their treatment.

But over recent months, there has been a stream of MLAs either leaving the Assembly or leaving politics entirely. There are rumours of other MLAs – at least one of whom is very senior – considering doing likewise.Last week the former Green Party leader Steven Agnew announced that he was leaving politics to become head of the Northern Ireland Renewables Industry Group. Mr Agnew was not only one of the most popular MLAs at Stormont, but also a capable exponent of left-wing political views, someone who was arguably the most consistently left wing voice in the chamber until the arrival of People Before Profit.In June the DUP’s Simon Hamilton – a former finance minister, health minister and economy minister – walked away from politics to become chief executive of Belfast Chamber of Commerce.Although he had admitted to the RHI Inquiry that he had a role in leaking emails naming some of his civil servants, something which dented his reputation, the former accountant was a major a moderating presence at the top of the DUP.The party had already lost Alastair Ross, an unusually free-thinking DUP member with libertarian views who impressed senior police officers and others during his chairmanship of the Justice Committee and was likely to have been a future minister, when he walked away from politics even before the  Assembly election. Paul Girvan also left the Assembly when elected as an MP in June .And behind the scenes, the party lost its key strategic thinker, special adviser Richard Bullick, as a direct result of Stormont’s collapse.Of the  MLAs who have quit since the last election, the majority – six – have been in Sinn Féin, even though the party’s wage policy means that none of its MLAs have actually lost a penny as a result of the governance vacuum.Many of the MLAs it has lost – Ian Milne, Barry McElduff, Elisha McCallion and Michaela Boyle were not in its top tier of talent – which as the perceptive republican commentator Chris Donnelly has for years highlighted is signicantly beneath what should be at the disposal of a party of Sinn Féin’s size, in contrast to its team in the Dáil.However, the party has also lost two signicant and capable figures – Michelle Gildernew, who had to leave Stormont after being elected to Westminster in June  – and Chris Hazzard, who left for the same reason.In Alliance, leader Naomi Long, one of Stormont’s most capable figures, has left the Assembly after deciding to stand in the European election and winning a seat – something unlikely to have been contemplated had devolution been ing.Her predecessor as leader, the former justice minister David Ford, had already retired from politics last June, a year and a half into the Stormont impasse.The SDLP’s Daniel McCrossan, one of the new generation of politicians with signicant potential, is still an MLA but has ed to university to start a postgraduate business degree.Although any profession will always have a certain churn, there is a clear trend both in the numbers of those leaving Stormont and the fact that so many of them are above the Stormont average in terms of their ability and seniority.That is not to denigrate the MLAs who are taking their place. But evenperson for person each of them is of the same calibre, starting off from scratch in a new job immediately involves a signicant loss of experience.Cumulatively, the departures suggest a signicant problem, and that is likely to be exacerbated unless there is a sudden breakthrough in talks which no longer even seem to be happening.If Stormont does , another factor will deter some of those who could contribute the most to improving the standard of government.Northern Ireland politics has descended to the level of a tribal bear pit. That is unattractive to many capable people, just as it was during the Troubles.If devolution can be restored and is to work better than it did when last ing, the structures which contributed to inertia and worse will need to be amended.But that will only be part of the equation – there will need to be capable people to work those structures.try catch  TrendingN.I. heartbreak as promising

Ms Parker and Mr Glover met several years ago when he trained her at their local gym. They then ended up unexpectedly working together later in le when Mr Glover changed jobs.Mr Glover said: ldquoIt was very tough for Julie before the transplant as she suffered with a genetic lung disease and her lungs slowly stopped working over a few years.\"It got to the point where she required an oxygen tank to be strapped to her back so that she could breathe. She never gave up and still worked and tried to do as much as she could and always kept a smile on her face.Ms Parker has a rare condition called Alpha--antitrypsin deficiency which means she lacks a protective enzyme inhibitor which makes her more vulnerable to smoke, dust and other toxic materials and increases the risk of lung disease. Because of the deficiency, Ms Parker was required to have a double lung transplant. Shortly after the transplant Ms Parker went to lunch with Mr Glover and he was amazed at how well she looked.He said: ldquoBecause I was seeing her every day, I knew her health was declining as a result of the lung disease. But I donrsquot think I was so aware of the extent until I saw her after the operation, and how healthy she looked.This isnrsquot the first challenge Mr Glover has taken on.In the past he has carried lbs up and down the highest mountain in Southern Britain, completed car dead lts and successfully performed  pull ups.The pair now plan to walk Pen-Y-Fan, the highest mountain in South Wales, together to raise money in the future once Ms Parker is well enough.Mr Glover set out to raise pound, and has now raised pound.Officially, Mr Glover had only  days to train for this challenge, enlisting friends to help him by sitting in the car and steering as he tows.ldquoI was getting up at :am to run around car parks towing the car with a harness before work,\" he said. \"I love setting myself challenges but donrsquot tend to do what everyone  does. So I will look for something a bit far out or invent my own and usually try and document them on video.All the proceeds from the day will go towards the charityrsquos Harefield Transplant Appeal, to raise funds for organ care systems to allow more patients to receive le-saving transplants.If yoursquod like to support Mr Glover in his marathon challenge his Justgiving page is: https:www.justgiving fundraising muscleworld article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Two-year-old Matilda Philpott who has Stickler Syndrome was joined by her two brothers, Oliva and Alfie, four-year-old Alice Haswell who has Goldenhar Syndrome camped out with her sister Scarlet, and -year-old Daisy Stacey who has Vacterl Association attended with her sister Molly.The weekend saw the families take part in a range of activities from archery, crafts and pop rockets to laser shooting, fire lighting, bush craft and raft making.The camp was the first time the referred children have been on a Scout Camp, something leaders have been hoping to achieve since the start of the group.Ruth Weltch, Group Scout Leader said: ldquoThe opportunity to regularly set up camp in the great outdoors is one of the main reasons young people enjoy Scouting so much and we wanted to give our children, who would not normally have the opportunity, the chance to take part in a weekend of outdoor activities and to sleep under canvas with their families.ldquoWe have been overwhelmed and humbled by the amount of help offered by leaders, not just from Cardf and Vale Scouts but from other scouting areas in Wales.This reflects the scope of the hospice itself which is open to all children with le limiting illnesses throughout Wales.ldquoWe have been able to give these children the opportunity to take part in activities not usually accessible to them and that we take for granted. It was an absolute joy to see them and their families take part in the weekendrsquos activities, seeing them smile and forget about their worries for a while was heart-warming.Lynne Phelps, from Ty Hafan, said: ldquoThe hard work, time and effort put in by the Scout Group since its inception has been truly amazing. The group has brought so much happiness to the hospice and given the children referred to us an opportunity to take part in activities with their families that they wouldnrsquot have had access toit wasnrsquot for Scouts.ldquoThe group has had a really positive impact not just on the children in our care, but also their families and our staff. We really canrsquot thank the Ty Hafan Scout Group enough.The Ty Hafan Scout Group was set up on the Scouting Centenary in  for any child referred to the hospice along with their siblings, parents and family, to spend time together having fun and making memories.A growing need for sibling involvement was soon recognised and so the group began to run regular sibling camps.The sibling camps have given the young people who have brothers and sisters in the care of the hospice the opportunity to attend events such as Scarefest and the Jurassic International Jamboree, as well as the chance to spend quality family time with their loved ones.ScoutsCymru gives over , young people in Wales the opportunity to enjoy fun and adventure while developing the skills they need to succeed, now and in the future.Open to all young people in Wales regardless of faith, gender, sexual orientation, race or social background, the movement encourages its members to do more, learn more and be more. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

We want to turn them into respectful iniduals with good values and an understanding of issues across the whole spectrum le has to offer.The school encourages pupils to voice their ideas, and shape their own education to a degree. They are asked what additions and activities they would like around the school, push for pupil engagement with a range of le experiences, and emphasis the development of their social skills to help them interact with others in dferent settings.The idea works well in practice. The students are friendly, confident, and respectful to the teachers. They smile, wave and say hello to the teachers in the corridors.ldquoThis is my eleventh year here, said Ms Lewis. ldquoI feel privileged to work in Fairfield. Itrsquos a school with a wonderful ethos and atmosphere, and skilled staff who know the children well, ensuring theyrsquore getting the best possible.ldquoThe children really exude enjoyment and enthusiasm for their learning.One classroom was filled with children learning their times-tables by singing and dancing, grins from ear to ear. In the schoolrsquos on-site nursery, youngsters concentrate on their basic arithmetic, rolling modelling clay into a single sunflower, or a pair of bananas.The nursery is the most recent addition to the school, having been opened in January of last year. Itrsquos the sort of place you can hear long before you see, as smiling toddlers enjoyed their break time.The nurseryrsquos addition to the school site would allow for an improved transition for pupils from nursery to reception.ldquoChildren benefit from being challenged with their learning at an earlier stage, explained Ms Lewis. ldquoWe want to make them feel safe and comfortable at the school, and make it as easy as possible to move up to reception.ldquoWe also give our older pupils a chance to experience both Stanwell and St Cyres secondaries around here to give them a smooth move into secondary education.Therersquos plenty on offer at the school, as well.Opportunities for extracurricular activities is vast, with local community groups using the hall throughout the week, for gym, dance fitness, karate, football and music tech.The introduction of a lsquoMid-week Muddle-Uprsquo allows pupils to work across age groups on half-termly projects, which use staff expertise in particular areas for a project that they collectively work on such as working on the environment in their own conservation area, or lsquoPizza Mathsrsquo combining elements of maths and fractions with cookery.Pupil groups cover School Council, Sports Council, Creative Committee, Sgwad Cymraeg, Eco-Committee, Team Captains, Digital Leaders, while other groups focus on global issues and the impact of their actions internationally.Jake Kidby, Ahmed Maher and Georgia Tomalin-Reeves are on the school council.Though each had a dferent focus for their enjoyment of the school site, they all agreed they were very happy at Fairfield.Jake said: ldquoI absolutely love my football and therersquos loads of chances to play that here. The new gym trail outside is great too.Ahmed said: ldquoI prefer maths and challenges. We thought school council would be a fun responsibility to look after the school, help people and share ideas.Georgia said: ldquo As part of school council we decided to build a lsquorelaxation stationrsquo for anyone who feels down. They can bring paper and pens and books. Itrsquos just a wooden den. But wersquore putting in shelves, posters. And therersquos lot of free space to run around front and back.The school has been lauded for its environmental efforts, securing a Bronze Welsh Charter Award last term, and earning a Platinum Flag for their approach to ecological and sustainability issues.Pupils Isaac Eley and Sophie Wilford were at the schoolrsquos conservation area.They explained to me that the area was first started around  years ago, but they had begun pushing for more lessons to be held outdoors.They hope to add tables, chairs and more outdoor classroom equipment, so they can take lessons in the open air.ldquoThe staff go above and beyond here, said Ms Lewis. ldquoWith increased pressure on funding for schools staff, governors and parents have to really put  per cent effort in.ldquoThe PTA has raised an incredible amount for us over the years and have done wonders for our IT departments.ldquoParents have helped out in raising money for the new gym trail.ldquoOne father built our relaxation station shed by himself, and the stage on the playground for singing and dancing was also built with parentrsquos help.ldquoThey ensure we can continue and we can be excellent for all the childrenrsquos learning.ldquoAttainment is high and all pupils make good progress specic to them, and this achievement is something of which we are extremely proud.Therersquos an underlying feeling of positivity in Fairfield, off the beaten path but quietly proud and it seems thoroughly well-earned. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Yet, too many people across the UK ndash and here in Wales ndash are going hungry.It is shameful that in the sixth richest country on the planet people are struggling to put food on the table.A recent report by the South Wales Food Alliance has shown that  per cent of  to -year-olds ran out of food in the past year and , children in Wales are living in households for whom a healthy diet is increasingly unaffordable.In addition, the Trussell Trust has reported record numbers of people accessing its services. Last year, it provided over , emergency food parcels to people in crisis in Wales, , of them to children. A No Deal Brexit will be catastrophic for the countryrsquos most vulnerable households and would be an act of economic self-harm impacting many generations to come. This is why I am supporting the campaign for Food Justice.There can be no doubt that the causes of rising hunger are rooted in a decade of austerity, tax and welfare changes, and an economy that no longer provides a fair dayrsquos pay for a fair days work for too many.The food crisis that the UK is living through is likely to be signicantly worsenedwe leave the EU without a deal. The recently published government documents on Operation Yellow Hammer predict shortages of some fresh foods and an increase in the price of food by up to  per cent, as a likely scenario.The papers make for grim reading for the many hard pressed families who are already struggling to put food on the table.In Wales we are committed to eradicating food poverty but we need UK-wide action.The Co-operative campaign is calling on the UK Government to commit to zero-hunger by  and incorporate it into UK law.While many of the solutions to food poverty are the responsibility of the UK Government there is local action that we can take that can make a real dference.The campaign is encouraging councils across Wales to commit to playing their part by designating a lead member for food poverty, to draw up a food action plan, and to take inspiration from emerging community responses to food poverty.The good news is that there is a huge amount of work already going on in our communities by councils, churches, charities and food banks.For more information or to get involved in the campaign please visit www.party.coop campaign food-justice article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work.

Their free dog welfare workshops, delivered as part of the Charity’s ‘Be Dog Smart’ campaign, enhance the National Curriculum and seek to provide children between the ages of seven and  years with the knowledge and understanding they need to act responsibly and safely around dogs in their homes and those they may see out and about.Each workshop benefits pupils by involving a pretend dog as its focus, with the aim of developing compassion and consideration for all living beings.Not only do children - whether dog owners or not - learn how to behave safely around dogs, they also learn all about the commitment involved in owning a dog through a creative and interactive learning experience.Last year, Cathy Clyde, Dogs Trust’s NI Education and Community Officer delivered workshops to , children. This year they are on track to improve on this number yet again. With the growing success of the ‘Be Dog Smart’ campaign, Dogs Trust now employs  education and community officers across the UK to provide workshops in their designated regions.Cathy said: “Through debate and discussion, our responsible dog ownership workshops encourage learners to embody important values around dog ownership such choosing the right breed or type of dog for your le style, as well as understanding that dogs are a lelong commitment and not a disposable commodity. I would welcome the opportunity to work with schools in the area and encourage them to get in touch, as pupils really do get a lot out of the workshops as do their dogs.”For more information about ‘Be Dog Smart’ visit www.bedogsmart.org.ukFor more information or to book a ‘Be Dog Smart’ workshop, contact Cathy Clyde on    or email cathy.clyde@dogstrust.org.ukFuneral details for Francis McCarville

A signicant number of our employees at Hays have been with us for , ,  and even  years, and we pride ourselves on growing our own talent and promoting from within. Although there are times when employees leave due to circumstances employers can’t control, organisations can create the right conditions to retain their staff for as long as possible. We believe there are three key areas. A sense of purpose Across ages, cultures and sectors, professionals need to get up in the morning knowing that they can make a dference. No matter how big or small, recognising a clear and meaningful purpose in your role is a huge driver for staff. Communication is key for employers. By prioritising employee progression, offering regular feedback and communicating the wider objectives of the business, employers can ensure their staff come to work each day with a strong purpose. Variety each day While not every task can be exciting, and some parts of a job will inevitably be more stimulating than others,the mundane becomes the usual, employees will think about moving on. Injecting iety into each week and staying interested at work partly falls on employees themselves, who can proactively seize opportunities. But a good employer should also push their staff and encourage them to work outside of their comfort zones. This ensures professionals can keep growing and developing within an organisation rather than move where. A strong network The people we work with have a huge bearing on our happiness levels at work. You simply can’t stay in a role long-termyou don’t enjoy working with those around you, so the importance and impact of these relationships are not to be underrated. Employers can help their staff develop a network of inspiring and admirable colleagues from their first day by making sure they receive proper introductions and support contacts. Workers who have these strong bonds feel a greater sense of belonging which keeps them wanting to work in their organisation. With these three points in mind, it’s important to consider how someone’s organisation and role makes them feel, rather than just how impactful their salary or bonus might be. After all, this is what can’t easily be replicated across organisations and can keep an employee with an organisation throughout their career.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":null,"title":"new  bedroom boutique hotel planned for belfast","story":"Posted on Wednesday September  by John Mulgrew A listed Belfast building could become a new hotel and restaurant as part of wider plans for a £m revamp of the city centre. Tribeca Belfast, formerly Royal Exchange, will see UK developer Castlebrooke redevelop much of the north side of the city centre. It’s made a number of amendments and changes to the development, most notably revising back from a formerly retail-led scheme to one with fewer shops. As part of the revised plans it wants to turn the listed former Assembly Rooms building at the corner of North Street and Waring Street into a new -bedroom hotel, with a restaurant and bars. That would involve knocking down part of the newer extension to the building, including the rear part of the former Northern Bank and the adjacent - North Street to “accommodate the new extension to form the proposed boutique hotel”. “The proposals for the existing building are similar in scope to that which was included as part of the extant approval. It is proposed to conservatively repair the existing historic fabric of the former Northern Bank,” a design statement says. “A key feature of the proposed extension is that the interface with the rearelevation of the existing listed bank building will be improved by setting back the footprint of the proposed extension so that the north west corner of the original building is readable.” The scheme includes the re-use and adaptation of the existing building as well as an extension on the footprint of the existing s extension on North Street. The extension will be set over five floors, with a rooftop bar, while upper floors are set back with metal cladding to the facades to “reduce the overall massing of the building and reflect the roofing materials or upper story treatment of surrounding buildings”. Tribeca Belfast includes development around Royal Avenue, Donegall Street, North Street, Garfield Street and High Street. Castlebrooke Investments says it is now committed to bringing North Street Arcade back into use in a new format, with space designed for independent retailers. This summer the developer ran a fresh public consultation amid revised plans for the scheme, which included signicantly reducing a huge -storey building to around , retaining additional facades and dropping plans for an underground car park.

Before starting as a trainee solicitor in a City of London firm, I initially worked as a paralegal for three months in a law firm in Perth, enjoying the lestyle and dferent culture of le in Australia, and then spent a further three months travelling in Australia, New Zealand and Asia. After ing to London, I qualied as a solicitor and then spent eight years working in the real estate department of a London law firm. With two young children, we decided to move back to Northern Ireland in  when I joined Cleaver Fulton Rankin as an assistant solicitor. I have been here ever since and was made a director in . What have you found the most challenging during your years of business, so far  As we will all be aware, the real estate market can be a bit of a rollercoaster. Having been involved in some fantastic deals here in Northern Ireland, largely courtesy of the peace idend, this all came crashing to a halt in . For real estate lawyers in particular, this presented a fresh challenge in terms of expanding client base and ensuring that our teams were kept busy. For a number of years I spent more time advising clients on restructuring, acting for administrators or receivers in selling off assets and working on refinancing transactions. This proved to be a huge contrast to the positive and very visible growth in the economy seen in the previous years. Thankfully, the real estate sector again currently seems to be enjoying good growth with high rates offor investors. However, it has to be said that the lack of political leadership here does still give cause for concern. How would you describe your management style  The most important resource that we have is our young people, so I hopefully lead by example and seek to encourage them. In my view the carrot is always better than the stick. What would you changeyou could go back and do it all again  I have spent over  years now practising law, butI could go back to university again, rather than doing a law degree, I would have studied history. It would have meant an extra year spent in training, but I think it may have kept my interest slightly more than lectures on tort and equity. Have you done it all on your own  No, absolutely not. One of the main reasons for coming back to Northern Ireland was, with a young family, we had the benefit here of family support. My parents in particular, played a key role in helping with child care at a time when I was trying to establish my career. I never underestimate the dficulties facing working parents with young children who deserve all the credit and support that they can get. A strong support network is also very important in the office and I am lucky to have the benefit of some great lawyers around me to whom I can turn to for help when needed. How would you like your business to be remembered  As a leading commercial law firm in Northern Ireland that is independent and innovative provides high quality legal advice to its clients conducts business in a socially responsible and ethical matter has a strong commercial awareness and specialist legal professionals. What piece of advice would you give to a -year-old you  Believe in yourself, be flexible and above all when opportunities present themselves to you, grab them.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/da1.jpg","title":"clarity telecom building telecoms from the ground up","story":"Posted on Monday September  by Ulster Business Clarity Telecom helps businesses of all shapes and sizes develop their communications needs from the ground up, and is now rolling out its fast-growing cloud software across the UK and Ireland. Founder and managing director David Whelan speaks to Ulster Business about a business which boasts the right tools for the job David Whelan’s vision and mantra for what is now one of the leading telecoms businesses is clear – telecommunications services are only as good as the foundations on which they are built, with engineering front and centre. He’s the entrepreneur behind Clarity Telecom – a successful Belfast-based full-service telecommunications solutions company with almost  years under its belt, helping develop top-end connectivity – including lines, calls, mobile, broadband and cloud software – for businesses across Ireland and the UK. And for David, telecoms is all about engineering at the core of finding the best comprehensive solution to its customers, having the right tools for the job, and having world class people. For Clarity Telecom, it’s about developing a bespoke system for companies, focusing on engineering from day one. Since its inception in , Clarity Telecom has grown to have a greater engineering capability than any other independent telecommunications company in Northern Ireland, and is now rolling out its leading byphone VoIPsystem throughout the UK and Ireland. David also says through Clarity Telecom and its burgeoning byphone technology, the company could double revenues in the next three years as well as growing its workforce. “The phone network stops at a plug in the wall and from that point on, you have to provide the infrastructure and management,” David says. “What we do is focus on the engineering. It’s all about how well it works and adapts to your business. “By focusing on that we are looking at the way things are being built, and we can then get insights on how we can change and improve things.” Led by engineering, the Clarity team is driving change within the telecoms industry ensuring client infrastructure is fit for purpose and for the future. That starts with assessing a business’s needs, making sure the network is suitable, reviewing the workforce needs and bandwidth requirements. From there, Clarity Telecom can develop a bespoke solution – from cabling, to switching, cloud services, routing and phone systems. Clarity Telecom now has a team of  staff – a third of whom work directly within the engineering side of the business. But that number could grow further still, as the company expands its business across Northern Ireland, and develops its byphone technology. The company developed its subsidiary, Voxbit, in  – specically to design engineering solutions. And through that has come one of its most successful products, byphone. A simple to use VoIP , byphone is a drag and drop system that allows users to configure their own phone set up suited to the exact needs of the organisation and enables a range of analysis tools that can help business owners drive up efficiencies. “In  as VoIP started coming along, I realised that was a signicant opportunity,” David says. “Where the communications industry is going is into the cloud. It’s going from traditional storage within buildings, into something in the cloud. The traditional telephone systems are evolving. “We started making a series of innovations surrounding cloud technology. We realised you can make it simpler – we were asking ourselves, can you make it work without a manual, for example. “If you can, in the same way as Apple’s iPhone made things easier for users, people will start using the services. It’s about making everyone’s le easier. “The end user wants to be able to use the system easily, from managing their telephone number, to having access to voicemail. It’s about the ‘power of simple’. “We now have around  resellers for the byphone system in the UK, and we are looking at trebling or quadrupling those sales,” he said. One of Clarity Telecom’s customers is Mid  East Antrim Borough Council. The firm was tasked with bringing together the complex communication needs of the new ‘super council’ following the amalgamation in . “With bringing three councils together, one of the main problems was having a single phone number that people could call. If you have numerous sites, spread across three council areas, that would involve a lot of rip and replace,” David says. “But we gave them one telephone number and then managed the routing to all those bits of equipment across the council areas.” Hotel giant Andras House – which operates seven hotels and , rooms in Belfast including the Crowne Plaza at Shaw’s Bridge and the new Hampton Hilton – is also another major customer. “Businesses trust us to be able to provide the engineering solutions in order for them to run their companies,” David says. So, why should a business consider Clarity Telecom for its crucial and comprehensive connectivity needs  David says Clarity is all about improving how companies interact with their customers – making it easier, and thus, improving revenue and sales. “As you manage your telephone connections you become better at dealing with your customers – you become more efficient at dealing with them, and they will have a better experience. It’s about improving customer contact. “As a business you are able to do a lot more, such as listening to call recordings, access to statistics and using data which will help manage that contact, as well as saving on costs and making your business more efficient. “What solution depends on your business. That is where we come along. We never put a system in without doing a full engineering visit.” Some of the connectivity includes the ability to connect landline with mobile phones, call forwarding and being able to access voicemails as digital recordings, by phone or computer. “When companies deal with us, they can come along and say ‘this is what we are trying to do’, and we are able to work the engineering and infrastructure, before then providing the services,” David says. “It’s also about fighting against the view that it’s all about price. Yes, you have to be competitive, but you need the right infrastructure. For example,a shop loses connectivity for two days, then they lose two days of sales, simply because they don’t have the back-up for the credit card payment system. “It’s about getting businesses to think about the infrastructure and all of the issues. It’s not just about how cheap you can make a call. It’s about how customers can engage with your business – and we are at the heart of making that happen.” For further information, contact Clarity Telecom on    or visit www.clarityteleView all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/glyn_121.jpg","title":"ni business leaders to outline major job creation plan at downing street and westminster","story":"Posted on Tuesday  September  by John Mulgrew Northern Ireland industry leaders will outline their plans to create tens of thousands of new jobs to Downing Street, hundreds of MPs and company leaders today as part of a major business delegation visiting London. Trade NI – the new alliance between Hospitality Ulster, Manufacturing NI and Retail NI – is unveiling a -year plan called ‘Vision ’ at a Westminster reception on Wednesday afternoon, as the UK’s political system enters its most volatile period in a generation. With just weeks before the UK is expected to leave the EU, more than  guests are confirmed to attend the event that will be addressed by the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Julian Smith MP and the shadow Secretary of State, Tony Lloyd MP. Business leaders are also due to attend a later event at Downing Street, and a lunch at the Irish Embassy. Trade NI’s “transformative economic plan” will set out key policy priorities that have the potential to create , jobs and to make Northern Ireland a high growth economy. In a joint statement, Trade NIs Colin Neill , Stephen Kellyand Glyn Roberts , said: “Northern Ireland is facing a huge challenge as it struggles politically and economically with a growth forecast of around % or below. This is simply not good enough and we can’t sit idly by and let events overtake us. We must break the cycle of limited economic growth.” “Our three organisations represent most of the businesses that make up private sector jobs in Northern Ireland. Therefore, a louder voice needs to be heard on their behalf so that they don’t suffer in the wake of the local political issues.
