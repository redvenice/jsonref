Only today, she’s launched a fresh attack, spewing away about her ‘right’ to trash talk Meghan.  On the left we have the drunken, violent, drug-addled, estranged half-brother Thomas Jr., who wrote a letter to Harry demanding he dump his ‘narcissistic, shallow, selfish’ sister.  On the right is the bitter, twisted and equally estranged half-sister Samantha spitting cruel bile. Only today, she’s launched a fresh attack, spewing away about her ‘right’ to trash talk MeghanMeghan Markle\u0027s nephew says family still hope her father can...\u0027She\u0027s NOT going to tell me I can\u0027t speak about my life\u0027:...A jet-lagged tea with the Queen? Meghan Markle\u0027s mother...Meghan\u0027s best friend touches down in London: Fashion queen...Share this articleAnd now we’ve had the father of the bride caught with his greedy snout in the paparazzi trough, cashing in on his daughter’s wedding with staged photos that were sold around the world.As best-selling romantic novelist Lisa Kleypas said: ‘Weddings are never about the bride and groom, weddings are public platforms for dysfunctional families.’I just never thought the day would come when a family marrying INTO the royal family would be more dysfunctional than the royal family itself.But here we are.Unlike many seem to, I have little sympathy for Thomas Markle.There’s absolutely no excuse for what he did in taking money from a paparazzo to stage those photos.Not least because in doing so, he made Kensington Palace look utterly ridiculous.          The father of the bride has been caught cashing in on his daughter’s wedding with staged photos that were sold around the world.  Unlike many seem to, I have little sympathy for Thomas Markle, who doubled down on his idiocyPrince Harry’s own communications director sent out stern warnings to the media ordering them to back off Thomas Markle after seeing the photos and wrongly assuming he’d been the victim of a cruel invasion of privacy.In fact, Mr Markle was invading his own privacy – for a big fat cheque.Now, you might think he’d have learned his lesson, kept his head down and tried to rescue the last remnants of his dignity – if only for the sake of his poor daughter.And you would be wrong…Instead, Mr Markle’s doubled down on his idiocy.Since the Mail on Sunday exposed his cringe-making sham, he’s been sharing his thoughts on an almost hourly basis with TMZ – a fine showbiz website, but not previously noted for their expertise on the inner workings of British royalty. First, he told them he was mortified by the embarrassment of the story.Then he claimed he’d had a heart attack last week, so wouldn’t be attending the wedding.Yesterday, Mr Markle was back with more exclusives he’d changed his mind and wanted to be at the ‘historic’ wedding.Then, last night, he told TMZ he now needed urgent heart surgery, so wouldn’t be able to go after all.TMZ, perfectly understandably, has splashed these juicy revelations across its site and generated huge clicks and attention for itself in the process.          Now Mr Markle has been sharing his thoughts with TMZ. They have understandably splashed these juicy revelations across the site and generated huge clicks and attention. Kudos to TMZ. But why is Thomas Markle continuing to collude with tabloid reporters - and what the hell is Kensington Palace playing at in letting him?As a former tabloid editor, I commend their brilliant news-breaking journalism. They’ve got the whole world waiting with bated breath for details of their next conversation with Meghan’s dad.But also as a former tabloid editor, I am utterly incredulous as to why Thomas Markle is continuing to collude with tabloid reporters?And I’m even more incredulous as to what the hell Kensington Palace is playing at in letting him?The Palace staff has completely and shamefully lost control of the narrative of this wedding.From the moment it was announced, they should have taken immediate steps to ensure Meghan’s family were protected from the inevitable massive media attention heading their way.It doesn’t take a genius to work out that when a handsome British Prince marries a beautiful American actress, global press interest is going to be off the charts.Yet Thomas Markle, currently the world’s most famous father-of-the-bride, has been left to fend for himself 8000 miles away.So he’s made his own decisions as to how to handle the media, aided and abetted by his ghastly daughter Samantha, and they have turned out disastrously.Why on earth didn’t Kensington Palace either send people to Mexico to advise him, or fly Mr Markle to London? It’s not as if Harry and Meghan can’t afford to put him up for a few weeks – they’re both rich and live in a giant palace full of spare rooms and servants.(Harry hasn’t even bothered to meet his future-in-law – how weird is that? And now won’t be able to at all before he makes the poor man’s daughter his wife.)          Why didn’t Kensington Palace send people to Mexico to advise him or fly Mr Markle to London? Harry hasn’t even bothered to meet his future-in-law – how weird is that?The result of this farcical incompetence is that Meghan’s had to spend the most stressful week of her life with a hundred times more stress than she could have ever imagined.I imagine she’s been utterly distraught at her father’s conduct.There have been reports of her tearfully begging him on the phone to change his mind and walk her down the aisle.What a terrible situation for any bride to find herself in.I also imagine that Harry’s been utterly furious.For someone who hates the paparazzi and tabloids to see his soon-to-be father-in-law in cahoots with the paparazzi and tabloids will have enraged the headstrong young Prince beyond belief.On the other hand he might reflect that if he and his big brother hadn’t been so controlling and privacy obsessed, constantly warning the press not to ‘intrude’ on Meghan’s family then Mr Markle’s collusion with said press would never have been so embarrassing. This will be his, and the Palace’s worst nightmare: a major player in the biggest day of his life going rogue.Perhaps things will sort themselves out by Saturday but I doubt it.From the sound of things, the only member of Meghan’s entire family who will be there is her mother, who is also the one that’s so far kept her mouth shut and behaved with decorum.          The only member of Meghan’s entire family who will be there is her mother, who is also the one that’s so far kept her mouth shut and behaved with decorum. She\u0027s seen here leaving for the airport, alone That fact alone would fill me with deep concern if I were the royals. Who ARE these Markles?What further mayhem are they going to wreak, especially now they’ve all been snubbed from the wedding?Hell, as we’ve already seen, hath no fury like an estranged relative scorned.I don’t think Harry and Meghan can escape some blame here.By excluding from their 600-strong guest-list all of Meghan’s family – many of whom have only said nice things about her and the wedding - and some of her oldest friends, they’re surely creating an even bigger problem down the road?Sometimes, a wedding is a good chance to settle old grievances, rather than cement them.They’re now going to have a lot more disgruntled Markles bristling with anger at being snubbed, especially when they see celebrities like the Beckhams sitting in ‘their’ seats in the church.So the Markle reality show will roll un-edifyingly on, and the Palace appears worryingly impotent and incompetent in its efforts to control the tidal wave of tacky titillation cascading from their lips.As for how all this washes up, my heart hopes Harry and Meghan will brush off the wedding chaos and live the fairy-tale happily ever after. My head, though, views with mounting concern the wildly erratic behaviour of the Markles, and I find myself murmuring: ‘There may be trouble ahead….’ "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/16/14/4C505A5C00000578-5736037-image-m-2_1526478895759.jpg","title":"TV star Ben Fogle conquers Mount Everest","story":"    \u0027At 7.30am on the 16th April, after more than five weeks of acclimatising and training on Mount Everest, I finally realised a childhood dream when I successfully summited the 8848m mountain,\u0027 Ben Fogle wrote as he shared this photo of him atop Mount EverestFogle and his wife Marina, who already have two children, Luca, eight and Iona, six, were left heartbroken after their younger son was delivered stillborn at 32 weeks in 2014. The star, 44,  said the death made him \u0027re-evaluate life\u0027 and ensure he was living \u0027for the now.\u0027Posting on Instagram, he said: \u0027There is one person in particular for whom this journey is dedicated.

Never. There is a spirituality but I can also feel the support and the love here on Instagram. There have been so many lovely messages.           Fogle offered to cancel his own ascent in solidarity but Pendelton insisted he continue to the summit with the others\u0027I am sorry that I haven\u0027t been able to reply to you all but I promise you I read your messages and once this adventure is over I will endeavour to reply to you all.\u0027Cradling little Willem to say goodbye, I made a promise to him to live my life brightly. To embrace everyday. To always smile. To be positive and to inspire. In some ways I am now living my life for two. \u0027Willem is always there. I think he is my guardian angel here. There is one particular star that shines brighter. It draws my attention. It reflects off the snow and ice. I feel so lucky. I will never take life for granted but above all I\u0027ll never be alone.\u0027          Pendleton, from Stotfold in Bedfordshire, admitted in December that she was taking part in the challenge because she was \u0027probably having a midlife crisis\u0027 Ben Fogle on Instagram: “A thank you to YOU ALL from the summit of the world @britishredcross @anythingispossible.world @unenvironment”"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/17/09/4C52A63100000578-5736861-image-m-19_1526546864808.jpg","title":"The CAT FUR waistcoats available Chinese market alongside tiger claws","story":"Feline friends turned into fur coats: Shocking images from remote Hohhot, the capital of Inner Mongolia, in China, purportedly shows how domesticated cats are being killed and turned into jackets          Tabby, tortoiseshell or ginger? Fur from an array of cat breeds appears to be laid out for sale  A label next to the coats reportedly says: ‘Real cat fur, don\u0027t touch them if you don\u0027t want to buy.’There are very few foreign tourists in Inner Mongolia, so for the ‘local price’ of £25 a cat waistcoat can be purchased openly - even at the airport if you want to buy a last minute gift.Elisa Allen, Director of People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) UK, told MailOnline: \u0027Every year in China, countless cats – some still wearing collars – are abducted to be hanged, bled to death, or strangled with wire nooses so that their fur can be used for trim and trinkets, some of which are certainly exported to other countries.\u0027 Lawmakers in Beijing this year enforced a total ivory ban which has seen promising results, but the country continues to spark outrage with its wildlife trade traditions. And Inner Mongolia is still a law unto itself when it comes to what is sold on its street markets, including pelts of fox, marmot, deer, tiger claws, and even bear heads.          Tiger claws for sale: Despite signing an international agreement banning the sale of tiger body parts, markets in China are still selling them for use in Traditional Chinese Medicine          Cruelty: Tigers are an endangered species but China is still, by far, the largest consumer of their body parts   Market produce: Stacks of wolf and fox pelts (left) were found for sale as well as ancient Chinese culinary traditions such as sheep head (right)The same stalls are packed with brightly coloured traditional Mongolian children’s costumes and Fake Ugg boots, the footage filmed last month shows.Close to the market stalls are \u0027pet shops\u0027 with their wares spilling out onto the pavement displaying agitated puppies in tiny cages, sometimes six at a time, standing on top of each other and barking for the attention of potential buyers to escape from their plight.Some are forced to be paraded on metal grills which, unstable on their paws, they fall through as faeces collect in a tray below. The stench is overpowering.  Dogs are also killed for their fur and leather in China, the world\u0027s largest fur exporter.Responding to the footage of the cat fur gilets for sale, Ms Allen said:  \u0027PETA Asia uncovered a similarly grisly dog-leather market in China, where dogs are bludgeoned to death with sticks and their skin is turned into gloves, which are purposely mislabelled and shipped to Europe and the US.\u0027PETA advises anyone who is distressed by these photos – or by the thought of wearing the skin of a dog or cat – to leave all fur and leather items on the rack.

Meghan\u0027s father (pictured with her) may be in Windsor wearing a morning suit (if someone can buy him one) on Saturday or he may be in an operating theatre having heart surgery - who knows?The cast of characters in the Markle chamber of horrors includes a cannabis farmer, a Domino\u0027s Manager, a recovering alcoholic and the spiteful half-sister she no longer appears to speak to.Not forgetting the \u0027intensely private\u0027 bankrupt dad who changes his story from day to day.The former lighting director may be in Windsor wearing a morning suit (if someone can buy him one) on Saturday or he may be in an operating theatre having heart surgery - who knows?For once, the characters and their stories outperform anything soaps could dream up - this is beyond satire.Meghan has my sympathy, because every one of us has ghastly relatives, family members we\u0027ve airbrushed out of our lives, people we would never choose as friends, let alone family members.She has the misfortune to be lumbered with a whole coachload.          With ghastly relatives like hers, Meghan will find life as a new member of our dysfunctional Royal family is pretty dullWeddings always ide as many people in a family as they unite - it\u0027s a chance to settle scores (with restricted guest lists) and create a two-tiered system where some lucky people get gold passes to every part of the day, some are granted silver membership to a few drinks and a sausage roll if they\u0027re lucky, or the common plebs who have to make do with a fleeting glimpse from the roadside in dubious weather with no refreshments.The father of any bride is in a difficult position - he will be proud his gorgeous daughter is marrying someone she adores, but fearful he might mess up his pivotal role in the proceedings.At my first wedding, Dad insisted on driving me to Chelsea Register Office. We\u0027d not been speaking for nine months because I\u0027d cancelled my previous engagement.When my parents found out my new husband-to-be was posh - and I would have a double-barreled name, things improved slightly.Like Meghan\u0027s father, my dad blew hot and cold, but in the end he drove me to the ceremony.I was wearing a beautiful dress, but as I stepped out of the car, he was so nervous he slammed the door on my leg and we had a furious row in the street.At lunch in a fashionable restaurant afterwards, my mother tried to steal the flowers.The manager had to present her with them and I have a picture of her in the car park hoisting her trophies aloft. I died with embarrassment.Meghan has wisely not invited the motley crew of Markles, and why should she?I didn\u0027t invite any of my cousins and only one aunt and uncle.Meghan\u0027s lot could hardly be equipped for small talk with Princess Anne or Prince Edward - I can\u0027t imagine they know anything about equine blood lines or musical theatre, although her nephew TJ Dooley junior (married to husband Ronnie) has been photographed in drag, clutching his fake breasts.His brother Tyler (a cannabis farmer) is producing a new strain to celebrate the occasion- Markle Sparkle, retailing at over $200 an ounce.Their dad - Meghan\u0027s half brother - a glass fitter also called Thomas, has not flown to the UK, but posted offensive remarks about Meghan when he discovered he was not on the Windsor guest list.Meghan\u0027s half sister Samantha Grant has been blabbing to anyone who contacts her (for cash of course), claiming that it was her idea to set up their confused and well meaning father with a paparazzi photographer, although she couldn\u0027t be sure exactly how much he got paid.Samantha and Meghan allegedly haven\u0027t spoken for over ten years, so her insights on the new member of the Royal family will be a little sketchy.Samantha is publishing a book entitled The Diary of Princess Pushy\u0027s sister.When I appeared on I\u0027m a Celebrity, my sister flogged pictures from our family album to a gossip magazine.Someone else sold my Brownie pictures.My sister revealed I had tried to kill her when we were 8 and 10.My fourth ex-husband sold his story twice to different tabloids, claiming I was \u0027a beast in bed\u0027.That\u0027s why I have sympathy for Meghan. With ghastly relatives like these, she\u0027ll find life as a new member of our dysfunctional Royal family is pretty dull. "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/16/23/4C561AA000000578-0-image-a-20_1526509297296.jpg","title":"Meghans lookalike best friend transformed TV star Princess flew Britain","story":"    Mulroney and Meghan Markle pictured together in Toronto. The pair met in the city not long after Meghan arrived to film SuitsShe is also credited by many as the brains behind Meghan’s transformation from television actress to polished princess in waiting. It is largely thanks to their flourishing friendship that American-born Meghan, who relocated to Canada while filming the television series Suits, found herself moving through the kind of high-powered social circles that ultimately led her to Harry’s side.Meghan and Jessica are now so close that it is sometimes hard to tell them apart. Dark-haired elegant — and extremely well-married — Jessica could indeed pass as Meghan Mark II.Not for nothing is Mulroney known as the ‘Gwyneth Paltrow of Toronto’. Born into Canada’s wealthy Browns shoes dynasty, a family empire worth a reported £50 million, the privately educated heiress is married to Ben Mulroney, son of the former Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney — and firm friends with the wife of the current one.      She apparently enjoys the kind of glamorous lifestyle that could have come straight out of the pages of a glossy magazine, and is regarded as the closest thing to royalty in that country.Every facet of her enviable life is shared on the social media sharing site Instagram — from her three beautiful children, to her impressive exercise routine and elegant social life. And, of course, her friendship with Meghan.Certainly, it is hard to see how Harry’s fiancee would have made it into the Canadian A-list without this female powerhouse.They met in 2011, not long after Meghan arrived in Toronto where Suits was filmed.The Mail understands that Meghan initially employed Mulroney as a fashion stylist after she shot to fame as ambitious paralegal Rachel Zane. The pair bonded over their love of yoga, dogs, expensive red wine, healthy eating, work-outs and charity work. What began as a professional relationship swiftly turned to a deep and lasting friendship.And before long, Meghan had adopted Mulroney’s sophisticated socialite style.It was under her guidance that, after meeting Prince Harry, Meghan swiftly ditched the racier ensembles she once delighted in wearing and embraced a sophisticated, pared-down chic.Out went the leather skirts and plunging necklines. In came elegant, to-the-knee shift dresses and crisp white shirts.Before too long, it was noted, the two women were wearing their long dark tresses in the same style and were often photographed sporting very similar outfits.When Meghan moved to the UK in the run-up to her engagement to Harry, it was Mulroney who helped her put together a wardrobe of clothes fit for royalty.          Mulroney is an Instagram addict, which she uses to chronicle every facet of her enviable lifeShe was also behind the white wrap coat, green shift dress and nude heels that Meghan wore when she and Prince Harry announced their engagement in the gardens of Kensington Palace last autumn.It goes without saying, too, that the dress Meghan wears on Saturday has had the Mulroney seal of approval at every stage of its creation.She is thought to have flown to the UK from Canada at least three times in recent months to oversee key fittings. But, while Jessica is believed to have advised Meghan on everything from the dress to the flowers to the wedding lunch, her family’s invitation to Saturday’s Royal Wedding is about so much more than professional gratitude.The fact that her children, seven-year-old twins Brian and John and five-year-old daughter Ivy, will be among the ten page boys and flower girls who will follow Meghan as she walks up the aisle at St George’s Chapel in Windsor at the weekend is testament to just how close the women have become.At a time when members of her own family, especially her embarrassingly loquacious half-sister Samantha Markle, have let Meghan down over and again, it is Mulroney who has stuck faithfully by her side.Donald and Melania Trump will honor Harry and Meghan with a...Feuding palace courtiers are whispering about the Markle...Share this articleMeghan — ‘Aunty Meg’ to her friend’s three children — has described the Mulroney’s house in Toronto as her ‘home away from home’. It was here that the earliest whispers about her burgeoning romance with Harry were shared.Here too, that the Prince and Meghan were able to spend time together away from the glare of publicity that would have undoubtedly blazed down upon them in the UK.But the two women could not have come from more different backgrounds. Meghan’s humble roots lie in Los Angeles where her father Thomas, a former lighting director, was declared bankrupt in 2016.Her mother Doria, who used to work for an airline, is now a yoga teacher and social worker. Her mother’s great-great-grandfather was a freed slave named Wisdom.Jessica, meanwhile, was privately educated at an exclusive girls’ school before going to McGill University where she studied industrial relations and economics.          Meghan Markle and Jessica Mulroney on holiday in Italy in 2016. Meghan captioned the images she posted ‘La dolce vita’ and the trip even had its own special hashtag on Instagram, ‘MJxItaly’, so fans could follow every moment of their glamorous getawayIn 2007, she married television presenter Benedict Mulroney, whose father Brian was Canada’s Prime Minister from 1984 to 1993.Much of Jessica and Meghan’s friendship has been played out on social media.The early days of their friendship were recorded with plentiful snaps of a holiday in Italy they shared in the summer of 2016.It was clear to anyone who saw the Instagram photographs of the women sunbathing in their bikinis on the deck of a boat, or sipping Negroni cocktails by the pool, that they were inseparable.Meghan captioned the images she posted ‘La dolce vita’ and the trip even had its own special hashtag on Instagram, ‘MJxItaly’, so fans could follow every moment of their glamorous getaway.But, crucially, it was also largely thanks to this friendship that Meghan began to rub shoulders with Canadian society’s big movers and shakers, among them 42-year-old Sophie Gregoire Trudeau, a flamboyant former TV presenter, who is now better known as the wife of Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.Other friends of Mulroney’s who helped pave the road to Harry’s door include Markus Anderson, the suave party-loving business brains behind the opening of the Toronto branch of the ultra-fashionable private members club Soho House — of which Harry is also a member.If ever a sign was needed that Meghan had ‘made it’ in Canadian high society, it was surely the sight of her at the club’s pretty rooftop bar with Sophie Trudeau and Mulroney on a girls’ night out together in 2016.She and Harry are said to have been set up on a blind date by a mutual friend — whose identity they won’t reveal.Before news of the royal romance broke, Jessica and husband Ben, 41, had Meghan and Harry over for several cosy, discreet dinners where they could spend precious time together away from prying eyes. At the closing ceremony of Prince Harry’s Invictus Games last October, where he was seen kissing Meghan in public for the first time, Jessica was one of just two friends selected to join the actress in her private box.          It is largely thanks to this friendship that Meghan began to rub shoulders with Canadian society’s big movers and shakers, putting her on the road to meeting Prince Harry Once Meghan had been catapulted into the social stratosphere, Mulroney happily slipped into the role of Girl Friday, quietly advising and supporting her — but always remaining tight-lipped.The two women enjoyed a foretaste of royal bridal dress planning when Meghan turned to Mulroney for help choosing a wedding gown for her Suits character Rachel Zane — who was stood up at the altar by her on-screen fiance, Mike Ross.On that occasion, Meghan chose an Anne Barge Versailles dress from the Canadian bridal boutique which Mulroney represents as a PR.Mulroney posted a photograph of her friend wearing the dress with the the social media hashtag ‘princess goals’.Meghan, meanwhile, apparently returned the favour by name-dropping her friend during an interview about her on-screen wedding.‘I went through all the options with my dear friend Jessica Mulroney of Kleinfeld Hudson’s Bay in Canada,’ Meghan said.‘I put this one on and it just screamed “Rachel”. It is classic and fairytale and the culmination of everything she’s been waiting for.’As a bridal expert, of course, Mulroney’s closeness to Meghan and the royals will do her no professional harm.Jessica has, since 2013, done PR for the aforementioned Kleinfeld Bridal, an upmarket Toronto boutique, which as well as selling dreamy designer dresses worth thousands of pounds, also offers £200 lacy lingerie and £300 crystal-embellished headbands.In February this year, she set up an Instagram account devoted to ‘all things bridal and style’, on which she showcases her ideas for wedding day fashion, food and exotic honeymoons. She also posts photographs of grateful brides she’s rehearsed and styled for their big day.          Jessica Mulroney and her children. Meghan is ‘Aunty Meg’ to the children and has described the Mulroney’s house in Toronto as her ‘home away from home’She’s also guest editor of Wedding Vacations magazine and makes regular appearances as a bridal expert on Canadian daytime TV.Given the attention Meghan’s clothing choices already get, a friend like Mulroney is valuable indeed. She rode to Meghan’s rescue when she was agonising over what to wear to Pippa Middleton’s wedding a year ago.Palace insiders say she wore a simple black dress for the evening do, which Jessica — demonstrating a keen awareness of royal protocol — recommended only after finding out the details of Kate’s outfit, thereby avoiding a clash with her future sister-in-law.‘Jessica is smart enough to know that, as well as making sure Meghan looks her best, they also need to be mindful about what Kate is wearing,’ a source said at the time.Yesterday afternoon, Jessica was spotted hand in hand with her five-year-old daughter Ivy, doing some last-minute shopping in Marks \u0026amp Spencer close to Kensington Palace where the family are thought to be staying.So how will you spot her among the congregation on Saturday? Easy. Look out for a woman with Meghan’s shiny dark hair, dewy skin and impeccable dress sense. That’ll be her."},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/17/00/4C4FEA2900000578-5738297-The_volcano_now_has_20_open_fissures_and_is_firing_out_lava_bomb-a-8_1526512121324.jpg","title":"Golfers appear nonplussed play round nearby erupting Kilauea volcano","story":"    A group of golfers were seen playing a round nearby Hawaii\u0027s Kilauea volcano, which has been erupting for 11 days, as an ash cloud forms behind them          The volcano now has 20 open fissures, and is firing out lava bombs the size of microwave ovensGermaine Greer: \u0027Royal\u0027s didn\u0027t want Meghan\u0027s dad at wedding\u0027Man exonerated after spending 17-years in prison for murderPiers Morgan calls Samantha Markle a \u0027media vulture\u0027 on GMBRoyal wedding: Meghan Markle\u0027s mother lands at Heathrow airportRoyal family fans set up in Windsor for Harry and Meghan\u0027s weddingBoris Johnson ignores questions about the customs union.Samantha Markle says her father Thomas suffered \u0027heart attack\u0027The Dean of Windsor says Harry and Meghan are \u0027serious\u0027CCTV of Liam Hunt\u0027s killers show them laughing after killingCrowds gather in Windsor to get view of royal wedding rehearsalHorses take to the streets of Windsor for royal wedding rehearsal    Pictured: Ballistic blocks shot hundreds of yards from the Kilauea volcano and found on Wednesday morning\u0027These reflect the most energetic explosions yet observed and could reflect the onset of steam-driven explosive activity... additional such explosions are expected and could be more powerful.\u0027 On Tuesday, the USGS said a recent lowering of the lava lake at the crater had \u0027raised the potential for explosive eruptions\u0027.Beware of the lava bombs!

Nobody spoke up in the elevator, but four hours later a woman I didn\u0027t know, a professor of women\u0027s and gender studies at a small college in New England, lodged a formal complaint.Professor Simona Sharoni told the ISA\u0027s executive director that, \u0027as a survivor of sexual harassment in the academy\u0027, she was \u0027quite shaken by this incident\u0027.Women’s rights campaigner, 25, is enraged by ‘misogynist’...Mark Lawrenson is branded a \u0027dinosaur sexist\u0027 by furious...Share this articleWhen I was informed, I was incredulous. And when I read the language of the complaint, my concern deepened.The voice that asked \u0027people at the back\u0027 for floor requests was a man\u0027s. But Sharoni had claimed she made the announcement, and my response had been aimed directly at her.The complaint stated that I\u0027d said \u0027Women\u0027s lingerie\u0027, and I did it with a smirk on my face. If she can\u0027t remember the wording of my joke — I said \u0027Ladies\u0027 lingerie\u0027 not \u0027Women\u0027s\u0027 — she can\u0027t have been very offended. And as I was at the back of this packed lift and she says she was at the front, how could she have seen my face?\u0027All his buddies laughed,\u0027 she added. \u0027I am still trying to come to terms with the fact that we froze and didn\u0027t confront him.\u0027          Professor Lebow joked that he wanted to be let out of the lift at the ladies\u0027 lingerie department - a joke that would be considered tame on Are You Being Served? (pictured, a still from the show)None of my \u0027buddies\u0027 were there. But she\u0027s right about one thing: nobody complained at the time.I was concerned to think she might feel upset, however. How my comment could be thought to have sexist or sexual overtones, I could not see — but if this woman was genuinely dismayed, I wanted to reassure her.I wrote a polite and conciliatory email, assuring her \u0027I certainly had no desire to insult women or to make you feel uncomfortable\u0027.I said I worried that frivolous complaints about trivial or non-existent offences could undermine efforts to challenge real sexual abuse. \u0027Like you,\u0027 I said, \u0027I am strongly opposed to the exploitation, coercion or humiliation of women.\u0027Sharoni complained about my email, too. Here\u0027s where the whole business goes beyond farce: the ISA\u0027s disciplinary committee declared that my joke in the lift was \u0027offensive and inappropriate\u0027, and called my reaching out to her \u0027an even more serious violation\u0027. I was told to make an \u0027unequivocal apology\u0027.I will not, because what is really being demanded is not an apology, but a confession of guilt and recognition that anyone who feels offended by anything has the right to demand redress.In fact, the ISA has a protocol for this sort of thing and I was following it by emailing Sharoni. Its code of conduct emphasises informal resolution of disputes, without immediately involving the ethics committee. But Sharoni went straight to the ISA\u0027s executive director, Mark Boyer.I am in a privileged position. I can stand up against this pressure, because of my personal and professional reputation. I\u0027m immune to whatever punishment the association levels against me the more they try to browbeat me, the more they will make people question their judgment.The ISA has two sanctions: they can prevent me from attending annual meetings and they can expel me. I am not anxious to see either of these outcomes, but I certainly will not give in to threats. That would be bowing to censorship and accepting the rule of fear.The disturbing truth is that we now live in a world where censorship is making steady inroads in many areas. In university life, students demand to be shielded in \u0027safe spaces\u0027 from comments that might offend them. Jokes like the one I made in the lift are no longer allowed in case they upset someone. Speakers who want to argue their often controversial points of view are denied platforms for fear that someone might find their opinions distasteful.          Professor Tim Hunt (above), a Nobel prize-winning biochemist, was forced to resign as a professor at University College London over one ill-advised jokeA well-publicised case in point is Nigel Biggar, professor of theology at Christ Church, Oxford, who argued society should take a more balanced view of the British Empire rather than remembering it only with shame. For expressing his view, he has been trolled and hectored on the internet.Meanwhile, lecturers on the Left who have shown support for a boycott of Israel are similarly ostracised.I don\u0027t support either position but I still defend their right to express it — even if it causes offence.There is nothing wrong with taking offence. It is how you react to being offended that is crucial.Too many in society today — and often those in positions of influence — demand censorship. And this is an infringement on free speech.I know many in my profession are more vulnerable to threats and bullying than I am — at 76 I am near the end of my career. But students and young dons will feel an even greater need to censor their thoughts in a world where people who take offence can muzzle others.And it is not only young people at risk. You might remember the case of Professor Tim Hunt, a Nobel prize-winning biochemist who made an ill-judged joke to a conference in 2015 about his problems when working with \u0027girls\u0027 in the lab — either he fell in love with them, they fell in love with him, or he made them cry.I certainly wouldn\u0027t endorse this clunky attempt at humour, but the way the academic world turned on him was frightening.He was forced to resign as a professor at University College London — a Nobel winner\u0027s reputation in tatters over one ill-advised joke.I\u0027ve spent my life speaking out for people who are bullied and oppressed. In the Sixties when I was at university, I worked in Illinois to end segregation.I was a \u0027freedom rider\u0027 — one of the volunteers, black and white, who took bus rides in the Deep South to protest against racial segregation still imposed there by law.

Supporters of Noura Hussein Hammad flocked to the Criminal Court in Omdurman, Sudan\u0027s second-largest city, in protest during the trialAmnesty International, contacted by AFP, confirmed the woman\u0027s conviction and flogging, saying it would follow up the case.A women\u0027s rights activist said she witnessed the flogging.\u0027I was holding her baby in my hands as the ordeal unfolded in front of me,\u0027 said Tahani Abbas, a member of Don\u0027t Oppress Women, a Sudanese NGO.\u0027This was the most painful sight, especially for a women\u0027s rights activist,\u0027 she told AFP.Last Thursday, another court sentenced to death Noura Hussein Hammad for killing a man she had been forced to marry at the age of 16.According to Amnesty, Hammad, now 19, stabbed her husband in self-defence after he raped her.

We’re safe and sound!\u0027The images were met with a warm response from Tyler\u0027s Facebook friends, with many urging him to \u0027have a blast\u0027, while others reminded Meghan\u0027s nephew to \u0027take pics\u0027.Tyler, 25,  runs a legal cannabis farm and has created a royal wedding strain called Markle’s Sparkle.Preparations for the wedding have been thrown into chaos after Meghan\u0027s father repeatedly changed his mind about attending the event until his ill health made the trip the UK impossible.Prince Harry\u0027s bride-to-be, 36, has still only shared texts with Thomas Markle but has told him she loves him and forgives him for the scandal he caused on the eve of the biggest day of her life.Her father is said to be \u0027alone and upset\u0027 in hospital after having three stents put in his heart.       Meghan, pictured with her retired father Thomas Markle, 73,  in around 2000, says she still cares for her father despite the chaos he has caused ahead of her wedding day            Meghan Markle has described her sadness after revealing her father will not attend her wedding to Prince Harry            Thousands have lined the streets of Windsor today to see the armed forces including the Household Cavalry (pictured) marched through the Berkshire town during a dress rehearsal for the royal wedding            Charles and Camilla have been pictured leaving Kensington Palace by helicopter today where they are likely to have met Meghan\u0027s mother Doria mother for the first timeMr Markle said his doctors needed to \u0027go in and clear blockage, repair damage, and put a stent where it is needed\u0027 during the operation. His daughter Samantha, who has a poor relationship with Meghan, claims her father is \u0027upset and alone\u0027 following his surgery. But there is some confusion over his care as sources close to the Markle family told the Mail yesterday that Mr Markle had already been diagnosed with a heart condition and was due to undergo planned surgery to fit a stent, the same operation Prince Philip underwent in 2011, early next week – on his return from London.    Miss Markle\u0027s nephew, Tyler Dooley, has said he hopes his grandfather will travel but said: \u0027We\u0027ll just have to wait and see.\u0027 Meghan\u0027s mother Doria Ragland flew into Heathrow on an overnight flight from Los Angeles and she is expected to give her daughter away.Dressed casually in a T-shirt, linen trousers and canvas pumps, and carrying a suit bag containing what is believed to be her Burberry wedding outfit, she was picked up from the steps of the aircraft by a royal fleet Jaguar.    On the go: Meghan\u0027s mother Doria was picked up at her California home as she made her way to LAX on Tuesday and has since landed in the UK where she is expected to give her daughter awayShe was driven to Heathrow\u0027s VIP Windsor suite, where Harry\u0027s assistant private secretary Amy Pickerill was waiting with an immigration officer. A member of staff from the private office carried her bags.Miss Ragland, described as a \u0027free spirit\u0027 by her daughter and \u0027amazing\u0027 by Harry, was taken to Kensington Palace where she will stay until Friday.She will not have long to shake off any effects of jet lag. It is thought she will meet the Queen, Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall, as well as the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, in the next 24 hours.On the night before the wedding she and her daughter will move with the bridal party to historic Cliveden, a 25-minute drive from Windsor Castle.It is widely thought that should her former husband, with whom she is said to be \u0027barely on speaking terms\u0027, fail to show, it will be Miss Ragland who has the task of walking her daughter down the aisle. Some royal insiders have also questioned whether Prince Charles might step in to do the honours.  How Meghan Markle\u0027s estranged family have turned the wedding into a VERY colourful affair Tracey Dooley, 52The recovering alcoholic, who sells advertising was once married to Meghan\u0027s half brother, Thomas Markle Jr.She was pictured arriving at Heathrow with her sons Tyler and Thomas, and are in the UK to conduct a round of interviews - even though she hasn\u0027t seen Meghan for around 20 years. She is documenting her stay in London on a Facebook page \u0027Royal Wedding with the Dooley Markles\u0027 where she has uploaded a selection of pictures of famous landmarks.

Meghan\u0027s father (pictured with her) may be in Windsor wearing a morning suit (if someone can buy him one) on Saturday or he may be in an operating theatre having heart surgery - who knows?The cast of characters in the Markle chamber of horrors includes a cannabis farmer, a Domino\u0027s Manager, a recovering alcoholic and the spiteful half-sister she no longer appears to speak to.Not forgetting the \u0027intensely private\u0027 bankrupt dad who changes his story from day to day.The former lighting director may be in Windsor wearing a morning suit (if someone can buy him one) on Saturday or he may be in an operating theatre having heart surgery - who knows?For once, the characters and their stories outperform anything soaps could dream up - this is beyond satire.Meghan has my sympathy, because every one of us has ghastly relatives, family members we\u0027ve airbrushed out of our lives, people we would never choose as friends, let alone family members.She has the misfortune to be lumbered with a whole coachload.          With ghastly relatives like hers, Meghan will find life as a new member of our dysfunctional Royal family is pretty dullWeddings always ide as many people in a family as they unite - it\u0027s a chance to settle scores (with restricted guest lists) and create a two-tiered system where some lucky people get gold passes to every part of the day, some are granted silver membership to a few drinks and a sausage roll if they\u0027re lucky, or the common plebs who have to make do with a fleeting glimpse from the roadside in dubious weather with no refreshments.The father of any bride is in a difficult position - he will be proud his gorgeous daughter is marrying someone she adores, but fearful he might mess up his pivotal role in the proceedings.At my first wedding, Dad insisted on driving me to Chelsea Register Office. We\u0027d not been speaking for nine months because I\u0027d cancelled my previous engagement.When my parents found out my new husband-to-be was posh - and I would have a double-barreled name, things improved slightly.Like Meghan\u0027s father, my dad blew hot and cold, but in the end he drove me to the ceremony.I was wearing a beautiful dress, but as I stepped out of the car, he was so nervous he slammed the door on my leg and we had a furious row in the street.At lunch in a fashionable restaurant afterwards, my mother tried to steal the flowers.The manager had to present her with them and I have a picture of her in the car park hoisting her trophies aloft. I died with embarrassment.Meghan has wisely not invited the motley crew of Markles, and why should she?I didn\u0027t invite any of my cousins and only one aunt and uncle.Meghan\u0027s lot could hardly be equipped for small talk with Princess Anne or Prince Edward - I can\u0027t imagine they know anything about equine blood lines or musical theatre, although her nephew TJ Dooley junior (married to husband Ronnie) has been photographed in drag, clutching his fake breasts.His brother Tyler (a cannabis farmer) is producing a new strain to celebrate the occasion- Markle Sparkle, retailing at over $200 an ounce.Their dad - Meghan\u0027s half brother - a glass fitter also called Thomas, has not flown to the UK, but posted offensive remarks about Meghan when he discovered he was not on the Windsor guest list.Meghan\u0027s half sister Samantha Grant has been blabbing to anyone who contacts her (for cash of course), claiming that it was her idea to set up their confused and well meaning father with a paparazzi photographer, although she couldn\u0027t be sure exactly how much he got paid.Samantha and Meghan allegedly haven\u0027t spoken for over ten years, so her insights on the new member of the Royal family will be a little sketchy.Samantha is publishing a book entitled The Diary of Princess Pushy\u0027s sister.When I appeared on I\u0027m a Celebrity, my sister flogged pictures from our family album to a gossip magazine.Someone else sold my Brownie pictures.My sister revealed I had tried to kill her when we were 8 and 10.My fourth ex-husband sold his story twice to different tabloids, claiming I was \u0027a beast in bed\u0027.That\u0027s why I have sympathy for Meghan.

The pair met in the city not long after Meghan arrived to film SuitsShe is also credited by many as the brains behind Meghan’s transformation from television actress to polished princess in waiting. It is largely thanks to their flourishing friendship that American-born Meghan, who relocated to Canada while filming the television series Suits, found herself moving through the kind of high-powered social circles that ultimately led her to Harry’s side.Meghan and Jessica are now so close that it is sometimes hard to tell them apart. Dark-haired elegant — and extremely well-married — Jessica could indeed pass as Meghan Mark II.Not for nothing is Mulroney known as the ‘Gwyneth Paltrow of Toronto’. Born into Canada’s wealthy Browns shoes dynasty, a family empire worth a reported £50 million, the privately educated heiress is married to Ben Mulroney, son of the former Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney — and firm friends with the wife of the current one.      She apparently enjoys the kind of glamorous lifestyle that could have come straight out of the pages of a glossy magazine, and is regarded as the closest thing to royalty in that country.Every facet of her enviable life is shared on the social media sharing site Instagram — from her three beautiful children, to her impressive exercise routine and elegant social life. And, of course, her friendship with Meghan.Certainly, it is hard to see how Harry’s fiancee would have made it into the Canadian A-list without this female powerhouse.They met in 2011, not long after Meghan arrived in Toronto where Suits was filmed.The Mail understands that Meghan initially employed Mulroney as a fashion stylist after she shot to fame as ambitious paralegal Rachel Zane. The pair bonded over their love of yoga, dogs, expensive red wine, healthy eating, work-outs and charity work. What began as a professional relationship swiftly turned to a deep and lasting friendship.And before long, Meghan had adopted Mulroney’s sophisticated socialite style.It was under her guidance that, after meeting Prince Harry, Meghan swiftly ditched the racier ensembles she once delighted in wearing and embraced a sophisticated, pared-down chic.Out went the leather skirts and plunging necklines. In came elegant, to-the-knee shift dresses and crisp white shirts.Before too long, it was noted, the two women were wearing their long dark tresses in the same style and were often photographed sporting very similar outfits.When Meghan moved to the UK in the run-up to her engagement to Harry, it was Mulroney who helped her put together a wardrobe of clothes fit for royalty.          Mulroney is an Instagram addict, which she uses to chronicle every facet of her enviable lifeShe was also behind the white wrap coat, green shift dress and nude heels that Meghan wore when she and Prince Harry announced their engagement in the gardens of Kensington Palace last autumn.It goes without saying, too, that the dress Meghan wears on Saturday has had the Mulroney seal of approval at every stage of its creation.She is thought to have flown to the UK from Canada at least three times in recent months to oversee key fittings. But, while Jessica is believed to have advised Meghan on everything from the dress to the flowers to the wedding lunch, her family’s invitation to Saturday’s Royal Wedding is about so much more than professional gratitude.The fact that her children, seven-year-old twins Brian and John and five-year-old daughter Ivy, will be among the ten page boys and flower girls who will follow Meghan as she walks up the aisle at St George’s Chapel in Windsor at the weekend is testament to just how close the women have become.At a time when members of her own family, especially her embarrassingly loquacious half-sister Samantha Markle, have let Meghan down over and again, it is Mulroney who has stuck faithfully by her side.Donald and Melania Trump will honor Harry and Meghan with a...Feuding palace courtiers are whispering about the Markle...Share this articleMeghan — ‘Aunty Meg’ to her friend’s three children — has described the Mulroney’s house in Toronto as her ‘home away from home’. It was here that the earliest whispers about her burgeoning romance with Harry were shared.Here too, that the Prince and Meghan were able to spend time together away from the glare of publicity that would have undoubtedly blazed down upon them in the UK.But the two women could not have come from more different backgrounds. Meghan’s humble roots lie in Los Angeles where her father Thomas, a former lighting director, was declared bankrupt in 2016.Her mother Doria, who used to work for an airline, is now a yoga teacher and social worker. Her mother’s great-great-grandfather was a freed slave named Wisdom.Jessica, meanwhile, was privately educated at an exclusive girls’ school before going to McGill University where she studied industrial relations and economics.          Meghan Markle and Jessica Mulroney on holiday in Italy in 2016. Meghan captioned the images she posted ‘La dolce vita’ and the trip even had its own special hashtag on Instagram, ‘MJxItaly’, so fans could follow every moment of their glamorous getawayIn 2007, she married television presenter Benedict Mulroney, whose father Brian was Canada’s Prime Minister from 1984 to 1993.Much of Jessica and Meghan’s friendship has been played out on social media.The early days of their friendship were recorded with plentiful snaps of a holiday in Italy they shared in the summer of 2016.It was clear to anyone who saw the Instagram photographs of the women sunbathing in their bikinis on the deck of a boat, or sipping Negroni cocktails by the pool, that they were inseparable.Meghan captioned the images she posted ‘La dolce vita’ and the trip even had its own special hashtag on Instagram, ‘MJxItaly’, so fans could follow every moment of their glamorous getaway.But, crucially, it was also largely thanks to this friendship that Meghan began to rub shoulders with Canadian society’s big movers and shakers, among them 42-year-old Sophie Gregoire Trudeau, a flamboyant former TV presenter, who is now better known as the wife of Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.Other friends of Mulroney’s who helped pave the road to Harry’s door include Markus Anderson, the suave party-loving business brains behind the opening of the Toronto branch of the ultra-fashionable private members club Soho House — of which Harry is also a member.If ever a sign was needed that Meghan had ‘made it’ in Canadian high society, it was surely the sight of her at the club’s pretty rooftop bar with Sophie Trudeau and Mulroney on a girls’ night out together in 2016.She and Harry are said to have been set up on a blind date by a mutual friend — whose identity they won’t reveal.Before news of the royal romance broke, Jessica and husband Ben, 41, had Meghan and Harry over for several cosy, discreet dinners where they could spend precious time together away from prying eyes. At the closing ceremony of Prince Harry’s Invictus Games last October, where he was seen kissing Meghan in public for the first time, Jessica was one of just two friends selected to join the actress in her private box.          It is largely thanks to this friendship that Meghan began to rub shoulders with Canadian society’s big movers and shakers, putting her on the road to meeting Prince Harry Once Meghan had been catapulted into the social stratosphere, Mulroney happily slipped into the role of Girl Friday, quietly advising and supporting her — but always remaining tight-lipped.The two women enjoyed a foretaste of royal bridal dress planning when Meghan turned to Mulroney for help choosing a wedding gown for her Suits character Rachel Zane — who was stood up at the altar by her on-screen fiance, Mike Ross.On that occasion, Meghan chose an Anne Barge Versailles dress from the Canadian bridal boutique which Mulroney represents as a PR.Mulroney posted a photograph of her friend wearing the dress with the the social media hashtag ‘princess goals’.Meghan, meanwhile, apparently returned the favour by name-dropping her friend during an interview about her on-screen wedding.‘I went through all the options with my dear friend Jessica Mulroney of Kleinfeld Hudson’s Bay in Canada,’ Meghan said.‘I put this one on and it just screamed “Rachel”. It is classic and fairytale and the culmination of everything she’s been waiting for.’As a bridal expert, of course, Mulroney’s closeness to Meghan and the royals will do her no professional harm.Jessica has, since 2013, done PR for the aforementioned Kleinfeld Bridal, an upmarket Toronto boutique, which as well as selling dreamy designer dresses worth thousands of pounds, also offers £200 lacy lingerie and £300 crystal-embellished headbands.In February this year, she set up an Instagram account devoted to ‘all things bridal and style’, on which she showcases her ideas for wedding day fashion, food and exotic honeymoons. She also posts photographs of grateful brides she’s rehearsed and styled for their big day.          Jessica Mulroney and her children. Meghan is ‘Aunty Meg’ to the children and has described the Mulroney’s house in Toronto as her ‘home away from home’She’s also guest editor of Wedding Vacations magazine and makes regular appearances as a bridal expert on Canadian daytime TV.Given the attention Meghan’s clothing choices already get, a friend like Mulroney is valuable indeed. She rode to Meghan’s rescue when she was agonising over what to wear to Pippa Middleton’s wedding a year ago.Palace insiders say she wore a simple black dress for the evening do, which Jessica — demonstrating a keen awareness of royal protocol — recommended only after finding out the details of Kate’s outfit, thereby avoiding a clash with her future sister-in-law.‘Jessica is smart enough to know that, as well as making sure Meghan looks her best, they also need to be mindful about what Kate is wearing,’ a source said at the time.Yesterday afternoon, Jessica was spotted hand in hand with her five-year-old daughter Ivy, doing some last-minute shopping in Marks \u0026amp Spencer close to Kensington Palace where the family are thought to be staying.So how will you spot her among the congregation on Saturday? Easy. Look out for a woman with Meghan’s shiny dark hair, dewy skin and impeccable dress sense. That’ll be her."},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/17/00/4C4FEA2900000578-5738297-The_volcano_now_has_20_open_fissures_and_is_firing_out_lava_bomb-a-8_1526512121324.jpg","title":"Golfers appear nonplussed play round nearby erupting Kilauea volcano","story":"    A group of golfers were seen playing a round nearby Hawaii\u0027s Kilauea volcano, which has been erupting for 11 days, as an ash cloud forms behind them          The volcano now has 20 open fissures, and is firing out lava bombs the size of microwave ovensGermaine Greer: \u0027Royal\u0027s didn\u0027t want Meghan\u0027s dad at wedding\u0027Man exonerated after spending 17-years in prison for murderPiers Morgan calls Samantha Markle a \u0027media vulture\u0027 on GMBRoyal wedding: Meghan Markle\u0027s mother lands at Heathrow airportRoyal family fans set up in Windsor for Harry and Meghan\u0027s weddingBoris Johnson ignores questions about the customs union.Samantha Markle says her father Thomas suffered \u0027heart attack\u0027The Dean of Windsor says Harry and Meghan are \u0027serious\u0027CCTV of Liam Hunt\u0027s killers show them laughing after killingCrowds gather in Windsor to get view of royal wedding rehearsalHorses take to the streets of Windsor for royal wedding rehearsal    Pictured: Ballistic blocks shot hundreds of yards from the Kilauea volcano and found on Wednesday morning\u0027These reflect the most energetic explosions yet observed and could reflect the onset of steam-driven explosive activity... additional such explosions are expected and could be more powerful.\u0027 On Tuesday, the USGS said a recent lowering of the lava lake at the crater had \u0027raised the potential for explosive eruptions\u0027.Beware of the lava bombs!

But here was one that had travelled the other way’I came across this ship in 2014, a few months into a long, slow journey I was making from Nigeria to Italy. It was a Japanese fishing trawler, and it had washed up on the shores of Nouakchott, on the west coast of Africa, having developed engine trouble.It was almost sunset – the cinematic hour. The sky was warm and the scene was just so inviting. But I knew this golden moment was transitory, as I had been coming to the wreck again and again at different times, noticing how the light changed with each visit, and how many other people were visiting it. It took me a while to figure out what I wanted to do with it. The shot became part of my project, called The Act of Recovery. I was looking at the complex narrative of migration, across Africa and Europe. We are used to seeing shipwrecks on the shores of Europe, as overcrowded vessels transporting African migrants north get washed up like carcasses. But this shot seemed to invert that notion. Here was an outlier, one that had travelled the other way, heading south. It wasn’t yet another displaced African body. That made it feel powerful.There are ship graveyards not far from this spot. I had seen photographs of them by the Tunisian artist Zineb Sedira. When I first encountered this ship, I thought about her shots, which are all about the repurposing of western waste. But unlike Sedira’s graveyard ships, this vessel had not been stripped and looted. It was still functional. All its elements, including the radar, were still in place. I used a documentary style but, as with all the images in the project, it did involve a certain amount of staging. I had seen children climbing on the ship for a better look, while adults stood back, observing from a distance. I didn’t want to dictate the scene too heavily, so I just turned up with a group of people who hadn’t been told what to wear and let them approach the ship. Their clothes reflect all the colours you tend to see at that time of day. My friend Mohammed – on the far left – wore a blue fabric that seems to extend the sea.I spent the first part of my project travelling through the continent with 10 African artists, film-makers and photographers, all crammed into a Ford Econoline van. Travelling by road across Africa is quite difficult. Some countries are more easily reached from outside the continent, as opposed to within. This journey was much more than a traditional road trip, though. We did public presentations and ran workshops wherever we stopped. I got to know local film-makers and would screen their work alongside my own at outdoor cinemas for anyone to see.As we travelled further north, I thought a lot about the Mediterranean Sea. It ought to be a means of exchange, but for many it has become an impenetrable boundary.

Times, and books, have changedThis year, the Bollinger Everyman Wodehouse judges have decided not to award a prize for best comic novel “in the spirit of of PG Wodehouse”, which might lead some to believe that comic writing is in decline. “There were a lot of witty submissions, bloody good novels,” said judge David Campbell, “but they weren’t comic novels”.But a dearth of great comic novels doesn’t mean that novelists are no longer funny. There has been some great comic writing published in the last 12 months. The problem is – though this should only be a problem for judges searching for “comic novels” – that it’s often found in books with the darkest, unhappiest subject matter. Take Roddy Doyle’s Smile, which contains laugh-out-loud set pieces and consistently amusing dialogue – but is a novel about child abuse in Irish Catholic schools. Likewise, Lisa Halliday’s Asymmetry has some of the most controlled comic writing I have read in recent years – and half of it charts the imbalanced (if tender) relationship between a young woman and an older, famous, male author. (The other half is about an Iraqi-American being detained at Heathrow – not laugh-a-minute territory.) Meena Kandasamy’s harrowing When I Hit You, about domestic abuse in India, displays Kandasamy’s knack for dark comedy, which makes the events depicted all the more horrifying.To give these books a comedy prize would undermine the gravity of their themes and intentions. And they certainly aren’t in the “spirit of Wodehouse”. Surrounded by the rise of fascism and two world wars, PG Wodehouse wrote of a carefree England, providing escapist laughter in dark times. Living in France when it fell to the Germans in 1940, he was captured and interned at a series of prisons, then used by the Nazi propaganda ision to make radio broadcasts in English. These have come to be known as his Berlin Broadcasts, and detailed his supposedly fair treatment in captivity in an ambiguously ironic tone. MI5 files released in 2011 showed how, after initial duress, Wodehouse took the Nazi pay cheque and lived luxuriously in Berlin and Paris hotels. The writer of innocuous country house comedy, who had always avoided the political pressures of the day (apart from the odd fascist neighbour or dinner guest), was accused of treachery. During his internment and after, Wodehouse’s output remained remained full of viscounts, butlers and misplaced fortunes. There is definitely a novel to be written about the author himself trying to write escapist fiction to atone for his strange pact with the Nazis – but it wouldn’t be an all-out comedy. Wodehouse never returned to the England he wrote about but then, writing brought him closer to that England than being there could have. That place no longer existed, either because two wars had destroyed it, or because it was always to some extent imaginary. That is why he wrote: to approach that place of unchallenging glamour. It’s why generations of readers have followed him, then and since. It’s why people today watch the Kardashians. I’m not saying there shouldn’t be a prize for the straight-up comic romps, satires and farce or for uncomplicated laughter in complicated times. The decision to withhold the 2018 Wodehouse prize, however, signals something more complex. Perhaps today’s comic talent feel they can’t turn away from the world they’re writing in, but channel humour through ambiguity and discomfort, rather than erting from it. In 2016, Paul Beatty’s Booker-winner The Sellout, a very funny novel about a very unfunny topic – the almost accidental reintroduction of slavery – was shortlisted for the Wodehouse prize during the rise of the #blacklivesmatter movement. Beatty didn’t win Hannah Rothschild and Paul Murray did. The most funny writing and the most important funny writing were there shown to be, supposedly, quite separate things.The novels emerging in our era will by necessity be very different from what we might traditionally think of as a “comic novel”, the kind featuring hapless, Woosteresque men humiliating themselves in amusing ways. For better or worse, there seems to be less of an appetite for that at the moment. What comes next will have to operate outside those boundaries."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2e74d278d3c15a5e4781add6ec1d79ac5db28bd1/10_181_3481_2088/master/3481.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b061374f26b509ca776e9bba3543e2dd","title":"fast track fracking plan by uk government prompts criticism","story":"‘Exploratory drilling will be as easy as building a garden wall or conservatory’ – GreenpeaceFracking opponents have reacted with anger after ministers unveiled measures to help projects through the planning system, which campaigners said would make drilling a shale well as easy as building a conservatory.Shale gas explorers will be able to drill test sites without applying for planning permission and fracking sites could be classed as nationally significant infrastructure, meaning approval would come at a national rather than local level.Planning authorities will also be given £1.6m to speed up fracking applications over the next two years and a new shale environmental regulator will be created this summer, under government proposals published on Thursday.Caroline Lucas, the co-leader of the Green party, said the plans were shocking. “Britain’s fracking experiment was on life support and now the government is trying its best to shock it back into life.”Rebecca Long Bailey MP, shadow business secretary, said: “Fracking should be banned, not promoted.”Greenpeace said the government had turned a deaf ear to communities and councils, and would make “exploratory drilling as easy as building a garden wall or conservatory”.The progress of fracking in the UK has been glacial, with not a single well fracked since a ban was lifted in 2013.Companies including Ineos, Cuadrilla and Third Energy have been bogged down in planning battles with local authorities. In the first three months of the year, seven of eight shale drilling plans were rejected by councils.However, under plans outlined by the business secretary, Greg Clark, the drilling of shale wells in England will be considered permitted development, meaning no planning application is required. The actual process of fracking, which involves pumping water at high pressure underground to fracture rocks and release gas trapped within, would still need an application. Clark said the UK had a duty to look at fracking as North Sea gas production declined and the country became more reliant on imports. “We believe that it is right to utilise our domestic gas resources to the maximum extent and exploring further the potential for onshore gas production from shale rock formations in the UK, where it is economically efficient, and where environment impacts are robustly regulated,” he said. The business secretary said new measures were necessary because councils had been “disappointingly slow” to take decisions on shale applications.The package of actions to help fracking firms pass through the planning system is an admission that previous government efforts to help the industry have failed.In 2015, the government announced it would step in if councils failed to take decisions within 16 weeks. However, the industry said recently it was taking 18 months to get a planning decision from local authorities, up from around four months in 2014-15. The shale industry welcomed the government’s proposals. “Today’s announcement goes some way to ensuring that our energy security is protected and the benefits we have already seen flowing into communities become much more widespread,” said Ken Cronin, chief executive of Ukoog."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/363b18ec3105847d13eb4141def2f4d14b2fca13/0_92_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4776e0bbbd9dcdf16b64176bf85708b3","title":"us deal boosts ocados stock market value above 5bn","story":"Online supermarket brings logistics and tech to deal with US grocery giant KrogerTim Steiner, a founder and chief executive of the online grocer, said it was a “transformative” deal in which the two firms would build 20 automated warehouses across the US over the next three years.The value of Steiner’s personal stake in the company surged in value by more than £100m after the deal was announced. His shares are worth nearly £250m.At its current share price, Ocado would surge into the FTSE 100 index of Britain’s biggest companies, which will have its next quarterly reshuffle on 30 May. “Ocado’s unique, proprietary and industry-leading technology is set to transform the shopping experience of consumers around the world,” Steiner said.“As we work through the terms of the services agreement with Kroger in the coming months, we will be preparing the business for a transformative relationship which will reshape the food retailing industry in the US in the years to come.”Rodney McMullen, the chairman and chief executive of Kroger, said the partnership would allow it to “speed up our efforts to redefine the food and grocery customer experience”.Ocado is providing its technology to Kroger in the US on an exclusive basis and the deal is the latest foray into international markets for the UK group. It has struck partnerships with Groupe Casino in France, Sobeys in Canada and ICA Group in Sweden. Ocado also works in partnership with Morrisons in the UK.Laith Khalaf, a senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said that as one of the most shorted stocks in the UK – where investors bet that a firm’s share price will fall – Ocado’s deal with Kroger was a “poke in the eye” for the hedge funds who have bet against it. “Ocado is making great strides in the global grocery market and inflicting serious financial pain on those who have bet against it,” Khalaf said.“The company is known in the UK as an online supermarket but that’s just the tip of the iceberg as Ocado is primarily a technology and logistics firm with the potential to license out its services to grocers around the world.  “The short sellers were hoping Ocado wouldn’t deliver on its international expansion plans.

Prices are at levels that will eat into appetite for oil and forecasters have revised downwards their expectations for demand growth this year.Experts said the rises would pose a challenge for central banks already coping with high inflation. “The biggest test may come in countries that are already seeing target or above-target inflation like the UK,” Craig Erlam, the senior market analyst at Oanda trading group, said.Shares in the European oil majors BP, Shell, Tota and Eni were all up on Thursday. Barclays bank has increased its prediction for the year’s average price from $62 to $73 per barrel and some banks are predicting oil could hit $100 next year. Here’s what’s driving up the cost of crude:The Middle Eastern producer’s exports fell by around 1.2mbd when sanctions were last imposed in 2012. This time around will be different as the European Union has said it is determined to keep alive the deal and will not be forcing sanctions on Tehran. The International Energy Agency, the Paris-based energy watchdog, said: “It is too soon to say what will happen this time but we should examine whether other producers could step in to ensure an orderly flow of oil to the market and offset a disruption to Iranian exports.”Saudi Arabia, the world’s biggest oil exporter, has already said it will work to fill any gap left by Iran.Nearly 17 months of cuts by major oil-producing countries, led by Saudi Arabia and Russia, have made their mark. The curbs by the oil cartel Opec and partners have brought global oil supply and demand back into balance, to a degree that the IEA recently said it was “mission accomplished”. The Saudi and Russian energy ministers have forged a partnership that they say has them “united shoulder to shoulder” and “completely aligned”. Opec members are expected to meet in Vienna to discuss whether the cuts should continue beyond the end of 2018, when they are due to expire. However, that decision has been complicated by:The political and economic crises affecting the oil-rich South American country have resulted in its crude production going into freefall.The collapse has tightened oil markets much more quickly than anticipated, experts said. Output is down so much that Venezuela has cut production even more than Saudi Arabia, Opec’s biggest producer.The IEA paints a dire picture of an oil industry falling apart as conditions in the country worsen, with corruption issues, problems with payments and equipment breaking down. Iran and Venezuela are not the only sources of geopolitical instability causing oil prices to rise. “The ongoing escalation of tensions between Saudi Arabia and Iran, continuing conflicts in Iraq, Libya, Syria and Yemen have significantly taken their toll on the region,” Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group said. While a direct military confrontation between Iran and Saudi Arabia is seen as unlikely, any intensification of proxy conflicts in the region would undermine stability, the Japanese financial services group said.The IEA warned that recent geopolitical events had increased uncertainty over future global oil supplies.The watchdog this week revised down global oil demand growth slightly from 1.5mbd to 1.4mbd, to reflect the impact of higher oil prices. Demand is expected to average 99.2mbd this year.Another counterbalance to bullish prices is US shale oil production, which has boomed off the back of stronger oil prices. US production is at at record highs, up more than a quarter on levels only two years ago, and more than half where it stood a decade ago.However, Goldman Sachs said: “Shale cannot solve the current oil supply problems.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9d37d0c7a6caa29d0622522b99660f5cc39944f5/0_180_5366_3221/master/5366.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b303c88155b911ccf1d70dd76aa95785","title":"brent crude oil iran total ocado gambling business live","story":"All the day’s economic and financial news, as energy prices hit fresh three and a half-year highsIt took a while, but the FTSE finally become receptive to Brent Crude’s latest rise, lifting the UK index that bit closer to a fresh all-time high.....Though not much has changed with Brent Crude – it is still dancing about the $80 per barrel mark – comments from Total CEO Patrick Pouyanne that the black stuff could hit $100 in the coming months if oil companies aren’t given waivers by the US to work in Iran helped boost BP and Shell, in turn lifting the FTSE higher. My colleague Adam Vaughan has been looking at the reasons behind the surge in oil prices:Another voice adding to those suggesting oil has much further to climb. Following news that Total will quit Iran unless it gets a waiver from the US, the boss of the French energy giant has predicted crude at $100 a barrel:Worries about the trade talks between the US and China, along with President Trump’s withdrawal from the Iranian nuclear deal, continue to unsettle US equity investors.Back with Iran and the US sanctions which have driven up the oil price to above $80 a barrel, and Europe is prepared to defend its businesses from the fallout. Reuters reports:The European Union will stick to the Iran deal and the bloc’s leaders have mandated their Brussels-based executive to defend the interests of European companies dealing with Tehran from U.S. sanctions if needed, a top EU official said.“On the Iran nuclear deal, we agreed unanimously that the EU will stay in the agreement as long as Iran remains fully committed to it. Additionally the Commission was given a green light to be ready to act whenever European interests are affected,” the chairman of a two-day EU leaders’ summit in the Bulgarian capital, Donald Tusk, told a news conference.The head of the bloc’s executive European Commission, Jean-Claude Juncker, told the same conference that the EU was ready to start trade liberalisation talks with the United States in some areas if Washington gives permanent exemptions from aluminum and steel tariffs.Over in the US, weekly jobless claims have risen by more than expected.The number of Americans claiming unemployment benefit increased to 222,000 from 211,000 the previous week, higher than the forecast 215,000. But the four week average fell to 213,250 from 216,000, according to the Labor Department, the lowest level for this average since December 13, 1969 when it was 210,750. Elsewhere in the markets, shares in online supermarket retailer Ocado have shot through the roof after it finally landed a major international deal.Ocado has been promising a big overseas tie-up for literally years, and today it delivered thanks to an alliance with US grocer giant Kroger.Kroger will used Ocado’s technology to upgrade its warehouse operations, automation, logistics and delivery route planning in the US. This should strengthen its hand in the battle against Amazon, as grocers look to automate their systems and use robots to speed up processes and cut costs. It’s a disaster for the hedge funds who have been short-selling Ocado’s shares, betting that it would fail to achieve international expansion.As Neil Wilson of Markets explains, Ocado now seems to have real momentum.Peter Kiernan of the Economist Intelligence Unit say’s Total’s (likely) withdrawal from Iran shows that Donald Trump’s sanctions could have a serious impact on the Iranian economy.The announcement by Total that that it will leave South Pars 11, unless it is granted a waiver from US secondary sanctions, reflects the likelihood that European energy companies with exposure to the American market or financial system will be unwilling to risk US penalties by deciding to participate in Iran’s oil and gas sector.Iran will seek alternative sources of investment, such as Chinese companies, to get the funds it requires to develop its energy sector instead, but Iran’s likely inability to attract major European companies going forward will be a setback.The Total announcement also gives notice to the difficulties that European policymakers could face in the longer term as they try to keep Iran itself in the nuclear agreement. If investment in Iran does dry up and Iran’s oil exports are significantly cut, both due to US pressures, it will make Europe’s role in keeping the nuclear deal alive more problematic. China is poised to step in if France’s Total does indeed pull out of the Iranian South Pars 11 gas field project (as seems likely).Iran’s oil minister, Bijan Namdar Zanganeh, has revealed that state-owned Chinese oil firm CNPC is waiting in the wings, if needed.“Total has said that if it doesn’t get an exemption from the United States to continue its work, it will begin to pull out of the deal.If that happens, the Chinese firm CNPC will replace Total.” Given its strong rally over the last year, analysts are wondering how much higher oil could go.Morgan Stanley have predicted that Brent will trade at $90 per barrel in 2020, thanks to increased demand for diesel (due to new anti-pollution rules on shipping) and jet fuel.Bank of America Merrill Lynch is even more bullish. It estimates that oil could hit $100 per barrel next year, due to supply constrains from Iran (due to sanctions) and Venezuela (where political instability could hit supplies).Francisco Blanch, head of commodities research at BAML, says:“Looking into the next 18 months, we expect global oil supply and demand balances to tighten.”US crude oil has also hit its highest level since 2014.Rising oil prices are a boost to the world’s crude producers, but a blow to those countries who are net importers of energy.For them, $80 per barrel oil means higher inflation, and could be bad for growth if consumers have less disposable income to spend once they’ve covered their fuel and energy costs.Here’s some instant reaction:Newsflash: Brent crude has hit $80 per barrel for the first time since November 2014.The news that Total is planning to withdaw from its large Iran gas field deal has pushed prices steadily higher this morning.Norbert Ruecker, head of macro and commodity research at Julius Baer, says:“Supply concerns are top of mind after the U.S. left the Iran nuclear deal. The geopolitical noise and escalation fears are here to stay.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/556b01fc33fe66ffba689f541aa914b127b99271/0_755_4307_2584/master/4307.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2e34c0b4cbb9f765478f29e465573ae2","title":"struggling revision exams cramming experts","story":"From excessive highlighting to cramming, it’s easy to get into bad revision habits. Here, experts point a better way forwardIf you’re one to put hours into revising for an exam only to be disappointed with the results, then you may need to rethink your revision methods. You could be wasting time on inefficient techniques, says Bradley Busch, a registered psychologist and director of InnerDrive. “You get people putting in lots of effort, but not in a directed way,” he says. Here are some of the common ways students unwittingly waste study time, and what experts recommend you do instead.Re-reading and highlighting notes may feel like work, but it often won’t achieve much. The same goes for spending hours drawing up a revision timetable. Instead, psychologists recommend a technique called retrieval practice. This is anything that makes your brain work to come up with an answer. It can include doing quizzes, multiple choice tests, and past papers. “To really learn something, you’ve got to transfer information from working memory into long term memory, where you can store and later retrieve it,” says David Cox, a neuroscientist and journalist. “Committing something to long term memory isn’t easy, so it shouldn’t feel easy.”Beware of the planning fallacy, which is our tendency to underestimate how much time we really need to do something. It leads to sitting outside the exam hall with two hours to spare, desperately cramming. This is not an effective way to learn. “The information you gain quickly, you can lose quickly too,” says Busch.The opposite of cramming is spacing, which is the practice of spacing out your revision over time, doing little and often. So one hour a day for seven days is better than cramming seven hours into one day, for example. It’s also good to incorporate interleaving into your revision. This is a fancy way of saying you should mix up your subjects during a revision session. “It forces you to think about the problem and the strategy you come up with,” says Busch.Sifting through the recommended study playlists on Spotify, trying to work out which songs will help you to concentrate, is usually a waste of time. But while listening to music can help you relax, and some students may have “trained” themselves to concentrate with it on, it’s still better to study in silence, Cox says. “You’re never going to be as productive having music on in the background, because it’s preventing your brain from acting at maximum capacity.”We may check our phones as often as once every 12 minutes. Obviously, this is a major distraction. That’s not all: research has shown that just having your phone in sight when you revise is enough to negatively affect your concentration, even if you don’t use it. And it’s a common trap to fall into. “I usually have my phone on silent mode, but to be honest, if it’s there I always check it,” says Chiara Fiorillo, who studies at City, University of London. Ideally it’s best to banish your phone to another room altogether."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/efc9a3ae98f69d9410c1a6a720e2697f8e2d2103/0_0_2250_1350/master/2250.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=365b802c96b441f3ffa3e04c3f22af13","title":"swimming into the unknown mexicos unmapped underwater caves in pictures","story":"Photographer Klaus Thymann has been exploring the underwater cave system of the Yucatán peninsula, ing 1km underwater to where salt and freshwater meet.

By mapping areas that have been untouched by modern civilisation, he hopes to raise awareness of the natural and human heritage of this unique ecosystem that will hopefully result in greater protection. He talks to  Eric Hilaire about making his journey into a film, Flows, featuring music by Radiohead’s Thom YorkeI am about to climb down a 10-metre rope ladder into a manhole-sized gap in the floor of the Mexican jungle on the Yucatán peninsula, to e an underwater cave system, exploring paths where no one has ever been in modern history.You may be familiar with cenotes, or sink holes, the beautiful wells filled with tempting blue water, but this hole does not look like that. Why would anyone want to head down there is a good question but we are exploring places where no one has been since the Mayans. This place doesn’t exist on any maps. My objective is to explore places with the view to bringing about environmental awareness, hopefully resulting in protection.I am with fellow cave er and explorer Alex Reato, in his 4x4 pick-up loaded with equipment, and accompanied by our four porters. As we head into the jungle the vegetation around the road gets denser and denser. We get out, put on mosquito repellant and start walking into the jungle, carrying camera kit, e tanks and GPS sets. The GPS point is our only real reference in the jungle as the vegetation is all too similar to navigate by.Walking in the denser jungle, I notice structural outlines in the floor. Despite now being covered in soil and leaves it is fairly easy to see the rectangular shapes of what must had been the foundations of Mayan houses.The Mayans were one of the most advanced indigenous cultures of the ancient Americas. But at the end of the eighth century, something unknown happened. One by one, the cities were abandoned and Mayan civilisation collapsed. A prominent theory is that the Maya had exhausted the environment around them to the point that it could no longer sustain a very large population. If anything, we have not learned from history as we are now doing the same thing on a planetary scale.We attach a rope ladder to the base of a thick tree, put on our wetsuits and equipment and climb down the tight hole. It is deep and narrow, and gets darker and darker. I exit the shaft and enter a cave, the roof is about two metres above the surface of the water, the inside of the cave is about 40m in diameter and, given how small the shaft is, this feels even more impressive. The water we are standing in is the entrance to a vast underwater river system, there are thousands of kilometres of submerged caves on the Yucátan and cave exploration is a little bit like connecting the dots. Underwater cave exploration on the Yucátan only started in the 1980s with American cave ers who used small single-engine aircrafts to fly over the jungle trying to spot cenotes visible from the air, then throw toilet rolls down for marking the spot. Next they would walk into the jungle to find the cenote they had spotted and marked.The full extent of the rivers is still not clearly understood. The extensive sub-horizontal flooded cave network is a 8-12km-wide strip of the Caribbean coastline. Combined, these rivers form the aquifer of Yucatán and support about 11 different ecosystems. After we enter our hole, we try to squeeze through tight caves underwater and find a passage that connects to the other system. The cave is dark, but panning the lights around it looks very impressive, there are small bats flying round, there is an island with stalagmites and stalactites that must have formed during the little ice age when the water level was lower. I can also see roots of trees reaching the water.Being underground feels isolated but not at all detached. The rock that separates us is karst rock, a very porous limestone allowing water to seep through easily. The porters now hoist down our four tanks, two for each of us. We attach them to our harness in the water, getting ready to e. We start the exploration a little bit away from the cave entrance, Alex attaches a new guideline and starts swimming into the unknown. He is using his compass to try to find a connection to the known mapped caves. On land this would be simple, but in underwater caves it is not easy. Trying to find a passage in here and exploring it is all about flow: an indicator that water is moving and that the cave is part of the bigger underwater river system. The cave gets even more narrow and there is very little visibility as silt from our movements and bubbles cloud the water. In situations like this, cave ing is more a mental exercise than a physical one.I continue squeezing through this tight space and after about 10-12m of crawling we swim into an open cave with about 2m of vertical space, which feels luxurious. Some of these bigger spaces can be incredible beautiful, big rooms can open up with otherworldly limestone decorations. We continue exploring trying to find a connection, but the passages to the north are too tight and it is time to turn around as we have used up a third of our air.Heading back out there is zero visibility. I cannot see my hand, I can see my shoulder but not my elbow. Going in through the long tight passage we stirred up silt and that has not settled yet. Even as we now move incredibly carefully, the air bubble we exhaled set off a rain of dust coming off the cave ceiling so we are almost blind.If we just wanted to get out we could just follow the guidline, but we have a mission. On the way out measurements are taken. We follow the line back all the way to the big open underground cave where we entered. There is still plenty of air left in our tanks so we explore the perimeters of the cavern. I want to take another look at the rock pile and get a picture of it. Looking at this from the side it is apparent it must be man-made the top flat slaps are in a position that would be perfect for angling a wooden ladder to the small hole with access to the jungle. Alex is signalling with his e light - he has found a fully intact clay pot. We know we are the only two people to have been here for at least 500 years and finding this artefact makes the whole thing quite humbling. What is truly fascinating about the underwater rivers is that modern impact has so far not destroyed them the way most other ecosystems around the world are being ruined at the moment. I am trying to make sure they don’t get irreparably polluted or damaged. Exploring them puts them on the map. This in turn theoretically means they have some sort of protection from new development under Mexican law. Exiting the jungle with a plastic slate containing about 120 numbers written in pencil may seem like a naive way to try to solve such a big issue, but this is how the mapping is done. Back at home, Alex puts the numbers into software to process into a stick map. It can be viewed inidually, or together with all the other existing maps. Google Earth is used for placing the maps on top of the landscape, so the arteries of the jungle become visible. Looking at satellite images we also see the hotels and other development.My hope is that by bringing back stories, pictures and maps, we can help explain what a unique hidden world is right under our feet. Admittedly it can only really be accessed by cave ers, but the implications and importance are massive. There is a widespread impact as 10 million people visit this area every year, and about 2 million locals depend on the aquifer for drinking water. Tourism on the Yucatán is the second biggest contributor to Mexico’s GNP and the Mesoamerican reef is the world’s second largest reef. All the issues are interconnected.In my view it is not too much to say that the whole Yucatán depends on the aquifer for survival, yet there is immense pressure on the area to the point where it’s not sustainable. The tourism industry brings in millions of tourists every year but many hotels don’t treat the sewage water. Other contaminants include illicit drugs, pharmaceuticals, shampoo, toothpaste, pesticides, chemical run-off from highways and personal care products from domestic sewage. The many golf courses pollute with fertiliser run-off that flows through the systems, spurring algae growth on the reef, further stressing the corals.In addition, the submerged caves are essentially a huge archaeological site, partly unexplored. Most importantly we have a chance to preserve one of the few places on the planet we have not yet devastated."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1860117a36ceff01fa067d41e6f61b7ab39d1122/0_0_3420_5130/master/3420.jpg?w=660\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=518bba5fbd842ebfd5c91b3c32dbdbad 660w","title":"hip cleavage new summer trend ridiculous cleavage history","story":"The summer’s apparently hottest new trend is just the latest example in a series of nonsensical ‘cleavages’ The female body truly is remarkable: every few months it seems to sprout a new part. One day you’ve got a simple pair of breasts, for example, and the next day you’re being told you’ve got underboob, sideboobs and overboob.And it’s not just breasts you’ve got to worry about. Apparently our hips are at it too – and we all know hips don’t lie. Yes, I’m sorry to break it to you, but apparently “hip cleavage” is 2018’s hottest new trend. This is according to Page Six , which has figured out that coining a nonsensical new term gives them a great excuse for putting up a slideshow of half-naked women. They have also provided some highbrow analysis to accompany the high-waisted bikini shots, asking: “Are hipbones the new décolletage?”The simple answer to that is: no. However, to be fair, it’s a valid question. Cleavage is confusing. The media seem to announce a random body part is the new décolletage with alarming frequency. As a public service, then, let me get you all caught up with the various cleavages that have appeared (and disappeared) over the years. Back in 2000, the celebrated shoe designer Manolo Blahnik opined that “the secret of toe cleavage, a very important part of the sexuality of the shoe” is that “you must only show the first two cracks.” A decade later Blahnik decided he was “tired of the whole toe-cleavage thing. One should not even see the beginning of the toes these days.” So there you have it ladies, don’t show too much toe.  actually bears responsibility for leg cleavage, I’m afraid, which refers to dresses with an upturned V cut that shows off the inner thigh. Jess Cartner-Morley invented the term in jest, in a 2015 piece about a Victoria’s Secret show but lo and behold, it took on a life of its own. Glamour UK was one of a number of outlets around the world to swiftly declare leg cleavage a new trend. In 2016 Kylie Jenner was credited with being ahead of the trend on “butt cleavage”. What fresh cleavage hell is this, you may ask? Well, according to Cosmopolitan it’s “like underboob but underbutt”. I know, I know, I lost brain cells just typing that out. Let’s move swiftly on, shall we? However, for the purpose of correcting butt cleavage history, I should point out that Jenner wasn’t ahead of the trend in 2016, she was behind it. Indeed, way back in 2003 the Cincinnati Enquirer called popped-out posteriors “the new cleavage”.Men haven’t entirely been spared from dubious cleavage trends. 2017 was very much the year of male cleavage, with the likes of Harry Styles and Dwyane Wade parading plunging necklines. Nor were men exempted from a little casual body-shaming. The stylist Calyann Barnett told the New York Post that she doesn’t ever want to see dad bods and male cleavage. “Those two trends should never cross paths.”In its December 2016 issue Vogue declared that breast cleavage was over. A dearth of décolletage on the catwalks was a clear sign that “the cleavage – those magnificent mounds pushed together to display sexual empowerment … is over, or at least, taking a well-earned break.” Funnily enough, a lot of women were not very keen to hear they ought to put their “magnificent mounds” in storage until breasts were back in fashion, and there was quite the uproar.Back when breasts were fashionable there were various right and wrong ways to wear them. Between about 2010-2012 side cleavage, also known as “sideboob” was all the rage. Today, if you’re going to get all retro and get your breasts out, then it would seem underboob is the new sideboob. Honestly, it really is fun being a woman!

The drama stars Matt Dillon as a prolific serial killer who slaughters women and children and, in a flashback that has perhaps caused the most consternation, cuts the foot off a duckling. In an interview with Cineuropa, the Danish director said he was pleased by the reaction and it made him “very relaxed”.“It’s quite important not to be loved by everybody, because then you’ve failed. I’m not sure if they hated it enough, though. If it gets too popular, I’ll have a problem. But the reception seemed just about right, I think.”Asked about his research for the film, Von Trier said he had read a lot of Patricia Highsmith and that it was “a pleasure to write”. While his knowledge of serial killers was sketchy, he added, “I do know a bit about psychopaths. I’ve never killed anyone myself. If I do, it will probably be a journalist.”The premiere marked the return of the director to the festival that made him famous, having been declared “persona non grata” in 2011 after making a joke declaring kinship with Hitler in the press conference about his film Melancholia. Von Trier paid tribute to the festival director, Thierry Frémaux, whom he said had been “working very hard for me … for some reason, it was difficult to remove the persona non grata thing”. The out-of-competition slot for The House That Jack Built was, he believed, “a little piece of remaining punishment”.Reflecting on his time away from Cannes – 2014’s Nymphomaniac premiered at the Berlin film festival, where Von Trier did not attend the press conference – he said he had become “more humble” over the past seven years, in part because of his treatment for alcohol addiction. He added that the high anxiety of his return to the film festival meant that his temperance was on pause. “At Cannes it’s impossible not to drink, so I’m taking a little holiday from the programme at the moment. I don’t take Antabus, because if I get a really big anxiety attack the only thing that works is alcohol.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f201457a4d2decdfd6bdf539b98bc40b04d1d853/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=049c6f1b8e53c5d51d02b18f3c5c2626","title":"saddest movie scenes paddington toy story","story":"From Toy Story 2 to Under the Skin, writers pick the cinematic moments that made them cry and explain why. Spoilers aheadOn the face of it, Paddington is a fairly broad kids film franchise about the hijinks of a CGI bear, and so probably shouldn’t make a grown human cry hot, salty tears. But that description ignores the fact that Paddington is a really, really well-made kids film franchise about the hijinks of a CGI bear, one that completely gets the pathos of its central character, a little lost immigrant searching for something resembling a family. Both films ably tug at the heartstrings, but the second film got me sniffling as early as 15 minutes in when Paddington imagines giving his only living relative, Aunt Lucy, a tour around London, something that in reality is impossible as she’s stuck thousands of miles away in darkest Peru. When at the end of the film – spoiler alert – Aunt Lucy arrives on the Brown family’s doorstep and she and Paddington hug, I completely, unapologetically lost it. Lord knows what surprises Paddington 3 has planned for my tear ducts. GMJust before writing this, I put When She Loved Me from Toy Story 2 on YouTube once again, just to check. Yep. Just as always, I choke up, in the same abject, lip-wobbling, head-bowed way. It still has that terrible power.When She Loved Me is the song written by Randy Newman and sung by the devastated toy cowgirl Jessie – and in fact performed, beautifully, on the soundtrack by Canadian singer Sarah McLachlan. The song is Jessie’s way of telling Woody why she has grimly decided to submit to the airless world of the toy museum, because it is better than the inevitable heartbreak and delusion of loving a fickle human child. She reveals her anguish that her owner, Emily, has fallen out of love with her – outgrown her, in fact. As Emily entered the world of adolescence, pop music and boys, Jessie was left under the bed and finally dumped.When I first saw this scene – and misled by the size disparity between toy and owner – I thought it was a parable for a child’s anxiety over being abandoned by the parent. But now that I am a parent I can see the truth – which is completely the opposite way around. It is about the parent’s fear of being abandoned by the child: the terrible fear, actually the terrible certainty, that the kid one day won’t want to play with you. They will grow up and want something else. This song is utterly devastating. It is modern cinema’s equivalent of the Vesti La Giubba aria from Pagliacci – the tragic clown smiling on the outside but crying on the inside. I’m afraid to watch it too often. I don’t want to break down over and over again. But I also want to preserve its power over me. PBIn many respects, Fried Green Tomatoes is not a movie for the modern age. It is a story about racism in the deep south told largely by way of eliciting our sympathies for wealthy white characters it is a story about a lesbian relationship that had to slide its lesbian relationship in unnoticed, by presenting it as a very close friendship fulfilled by food fights, poker games and heads leaning meaningfully on shoulders. But I am deeply fond of this 1991 Sunday afternoon classic. I’ve seen it more times than is healthy, and so I know exactly what is coming and when, and yet am still unable to resist the inevitable guttural sobbing that comes with the death scene. There are plenty of teasers for it, too: Buddy on the train tracks, even Mrs Threadgoode talking about the death of her adult son. Nothing, however, can prepare the viewer for Ruth asking Idgie to tell her the old story about the frozen lake that’s now somewhere over in Georgia. It doesn’t so much pull on heartstrings as play a full symphony on them, and it’s devastating. As Sipsey puts it, a lady always knows when to leave. RNWhile I was repelled by the mere existence of the Eat Pray Love book, I found something strangely charming about its big-screen translation. It was a mixture of glossy food porn, glossy travel porn and glossy Julia Roberts emoting porn (she remains one of the best fake criers in Hollywood) all wrapped up in a rather unique tale of a woman trying to unshackle herself from the men in her life. But while that all provided mostly surface-level enjoyment, one scene cut deeper and the extent to which it cuts surprises me still.As is often with the case with movie tears, these were tied to a real-world experience that had happened not long before I sat down to watch. I was dumped by a long-term boyfriend without much of an explanation and without any sort of warning. I was heartbroken and seeking some form of closure that was kept cruelly out of reach. I didn’t understand why it had happened and it was the not knowing that felt harder than the break-up itself. In the film, Roberts’ character has left her flighty husband and remains haunted by the heartbreak she’s caused. On a rooftop in Delhi, a vision of him appears and they dance to Neil Young’s heart-grabbing Harvest Moon, the song that was supposed to accompany their first wedding dance. She reminds him that she did love him. He tells her he still loves and misses her. They cry and continue to dance. At the end, she tells him that “it won’t last forever, nothing does”. It’s a short scene but it hit me like a bus, it still does now. My tears are for the film but they’re also for something deeper: the sting of loving someone who stopped loving me and the ache of an ending I was never allowed in real life. BLAdam Sandler can make me cry harder than he’s ever made me laugh, the true test of a clown. Yes, even in the underappreciated comedy Click about a dad who finds a magical remote control in the Beyond section of Bed Bath \u0026amp Beyond. Sandler’s workaholic architect fast-forwards through the worst parts of his day – the dull weeknight frozen dinners with his family, the repetitive arguments, the gross times everyone gets knocked out by the flu – in order to get to his next promotion so he can buy his kids whatever they want. His plan doesn’t go well, of course. But what’s shocking is how gut-rippingly painful it is to see Sandler hit play on his life only to realize he’s skipped past everything that matters. His body’s been present, the bills have been paid, but his emotional engagement’s been staticky – a trade-off too many of us can understand.In the climax, old man Sandler sobs in a thunderstorm as he arrives at his daughter’s wedding only to learn she’d rather her stepdad walk her down the aisle, and his son has grown up to mimic his job-first, family-second example. I rarely cry at unavoidable tragedies where no one’s at fault. My weakness is characters regretting choices they can’t rewind. Click isn’t Ingmar Bergman – Sandler gets a happy ending – but I barely saw his relief through the rainstorm on my face. ANBy all accounts, Robert Benton’s film Kramer vs Kramer skews heavily toward Dustin Hoffman’s Ted, whose wife Joanna has left him and their six-year-old son Billy. Billy and Ted make french toast together, or argue about eating ice cream before dinner, or visit the nearby jungle gym. Were it not for Meryl Streep – and the trenchant, intuitive way she humanizes a woman who, in the 70s, would have otherwise been made to seem mawkish and unstable – Kramer vs Kramer might be just a schmaltzy panegyric on fatherhood.But leave it to our greatest living actor to turn a film on its head with a single scene. You know the one: Joanna, during the custody hearing, is subjected to a string of sexist questions about her “failure” as a wife and a mother. When asked why she’s seeking custody of Billy, she blinks three times, beginning the monologue Streep herself wrote in an effort to redeem her character, who she initially perceived to be “an ogre, a princess, an ass”.“Billy’s only seven years old. He needs me,” she says, reciting the word “need” with a whispery uptick as she glances at her ex. “I’m not saying he doesn’t need his father. But I really believe he needs me more.” After catching her breath, she becomes more emphatic: “I was his mommy for five and a half years.” Since I was about Billy’s age when my parents got orced, ergo, too young to understand or even care, I’ve always been astonished and, by proxy, moved by how compassionately Streep plumbs the depths of Joanna’s truth. JNLittle focuses the mind more effectively on human distress than the arrival of your own kids scenes in films which I might once have snoozed through now induce boggle-eyed terror – “OH MY GOD, DON’T LEAVE THAT BABY NEAR THAT COFFEE TABLE, IT HASN’T GOT A CORNER PROTECTOR!” But nothing has topped – at least, not yet – the scene in Under the Skin where Scarlett Johansson murders a swimmer and drags him off to eat him.It’s not the murder that’s so epically upsetting, though it’s gruesome enough: Johansson, playing an alien visitor permanently on the lookout for human nutrients, simply bangs him over the head with a large stone as he lies prone and exhausted on the beach. It’s what goes on in the background that is so awful. A woman goes into the water to try and rescue her drowning dog, and her male partner instinctively rushes in after her, leaving their toddler alone high on the shore. Johansson’s chum – the only other adult on this lonely Scottish beach – goes to help too. With the speed of falling dominoes, a nice little day out unravels: the mother and father are swept away to who knows where, and the alien takes her chance to acquire their would-be rescuer as a food source. Meanwhile, the suddenly abandoned kid is shrieking in terror as the night closes in. Another, less astute film-maker, might cap the scene with the alien scooping the kid up and adding him to her dinner menu, but what Glazer contrives is absolutely horrifying. Johansson-alien simply ignores it, and leaves it alone. The film moves on, this incident consigned to the past.I have to confess I was absolutely blindsided by the scene mostly, I think, because of the its sheer unexpectedness. I think I was gripped by a kind of internal hysteria: shock, hyperventilation, a feeling the back of my head might explode. (I can’t say I actually cried though – I may have, but in the confusion I can’t really remember.) I certainly had to hold on to the seat to stop myself bolting out of the cinema then and there. I am aware there’s a some degree of self-indulgence here: the fact that my daughter was about the same age as the kid in the film undoubtedly super-sensitised my reactions. But everyone has their weak spot this is very much mine. APCheaper by the Dozen 2, if you haven’t seen it – you probably haven’t, why would you have? – is the sequel to the remake of family comedy Cheaper by the Dozen, and I’m sure it was made because Steve Martin, the star of the franchise, needed to pay his mortgage. The main gist of the movie is that Martin and his wife, played by Bonnie Hunt, have 12 children who get into various japes. It’s asinine. But during a time in my life when I was making a lot of transatlantic flights, Cheaper By the Dozen 2 was always an option on the British Airways seatback televisions, and one day I found, because of the frequency of my flights, I had watched all of the other films.What choice did I have? At the climactic scene, where the oldest daughter, played by Piper Perabo, gives birth, and then names the baby after her father because he has shown her that “there is no way to be a perfect parent, but a million ways to be a really good one”, I cried so much the man sitting next to me regarded me with what appeared to be real concern. There may have not been enough cocktail napkins on the whole plane to dry my tears. Was it the recycled air? Was it the two miniature bottles of white wine? Or was it that a joyful childbirth scene can warm the cockles of even the coldest of hearts? JHEWe’ve got a real talent for repression back in Massachusetts. Kenneth Lonergan’s searing Manchester by the Sea plays out a 15-minute drive from my childhood home and, true to life, the characters all struggle to articulate the perfect storms of emotion raging within them.When Lee (Casey Affleck) has a chance encounter with his ex-wife Randi (Michelle Williams), the shared history between them is literally unspeakable. They sputter out fragments of sentences that act as a shorthand for vast reservoirs of guilt and self-loathing they can’t bear to express, and because they know one another so intimately, they can intuit all the meaning they have to. They’ve both shoved a lot deep down inside just so they can look at themselves in the mirror, and when in the presence of the only other person on the planet who understands what they’ve been through, some of it has to come out. Randi does most of the talking, inviting Lee to lunch so they can get some closure, and he ends the conversation by walking away. She’s ready to face her past and be fully present in the new life she’s built for herself. Lee, a North Shore boy born and bred, feels more comfortable starting a bar fight as his form of therapy. CBJoanna Hogg’s first film, Unrelated, has had something of a second life on account of being the debut of Tom Hiddleston, and set during a Tuscan summer, which means swimming pool, which means toplessness, and lots of it. It’s nice to imagine the Loki-lovers streaming this masterpiece of English upper-middle-class excruciation. As its ending shows, specificity is no barrier to emotional oomph.The story sees a woman in her early 40s, Anna (Kathryn Worth), holidaying with old friends and their teenage children. She finds she prefers the company of the kids, especially the charming Oakley (Hiddleston, then 26, playing eight years younger). The holiday implodes. Anna goes to stay at a grim airport hotel. Her friend visits, crossly wanting to know what’s behind her behaviour. Anna explains that, quite recently, she thought she was pregnant but no, in fact, it was an early menopause. She’ll never be able to have children. She sobs and bends double on the bed. It is shot in one take, from the middle distance, acted with a banal frankness which feels like eavesdropping. When I saw it a decade back, it floored me: a twist I hadn’t foreseen, a pain I could only imagine. A few years ago, I began consciously avoiding the film, fearful a similar fate awaited me. Now I can safely watch it again – or, I thought I could, but Hogg is much too superb and mysterious a film-maker for that. It isn’t simply the information which is terrible, it is the dreadful catharsis of its expression, coming after so much obfuscation. The stifle has gone instead there is the most awful sadness. Buttoning up is often the bravest way.

That is how big a deal winning the FA Cup used to be. When Stokoe died in 2004 there was never any doubt about the image that would be used to commemorate the club’s greatest post-war success. Opinion is ided over how accurately the sculptor captured the manager and the moment but the worst-dressed man at Wembley leaping off the bench at the final whistle to race to his goalkeeper Jimmy Montgomery was already part of FA Cup final lore.Things are a little different now. When Louis van Gaal won the FA Cup with Manchester United two years ago he barely had time to celebrate.His moment of glory – well, the undoubted highlight of a mostly lacklustre two years at Old Trafford – was cruelly compromised by the news already circulating around Wembley that José Mourinho had got his job. It was smart of Van Gaal to have his picture taken with Sir Alex Ferguson and the trophy, because a few days later he would not have had the chance.Manchester City were no better in 2013, with news of Roberto Mancini’s departure breaking on Cup final day. The open secret was arguably a factor in City’s shock defeat by Wigan, though what was perfectly clear was that Mancini could not have saved his job by winning that game. In the Premier LeagueChampions League era only Arsène Wenger has been able to use FA Cup finals to earn a stay of execution, and even then there were significant factions at Arsenal who felt the end of season party at Wembley was merely window-dressing to cover up a larger pattern of failure.Only twenty-eight years ago, near the start of Ferguson’s reign at United, an FA Cup win represented the first success in England for a manager beginning to feel the pressure after three trophyless years, and even though it took a replay to see off Crystal Place it was enough to convince the board they had the right man. “I needed a trophy to buy time,” Ferguson said a couple of years later, before everyone realised quite how much time in the job he was going to get.One has the distinct feeling that even a Chelsea win on Saturday is not going to buy Antonio Conte any more time at Stamford Bridge, indeed it is debatable whether the manager even wants to stick around for next season. He would doubtless like to finish the season on a high by adding the FA Cup to last season’s title win on an already impressive CV, and so would his players. Conte would then be able to point to two seasons in England and two major trophies, which is the sort of strike rate most Premier League teams and their supporters can only dream about, though the reality is the FA Cup alone no longer constitutes a successful season for a club in the Champions League bracket.The Uefa competition has managed to hijack most of the end-of-season knockout glory, which is why Jürgen Klopp could be in line for a statue, or at least a specially commissioned new banner on the Kop, should Liverpool win a sixth European Cup next week in Kiev. The Champions League final now performs the day-of-destiny function the FA Cup used to enjoy. Win it and you are practically immortal certainly you write your name into your club’s history.Liverpool have not won the league since 1990, the year Ferguson was fretting over Crystal Palace in the Cup final, but absolutely no one will be complaining if the season ends with a victory over Real Madrid. Younger readers might find it difficult to imagine but the FA Cup final used to be like that. In the public imagination, great deeds at Wembley would often transcend anything accomplished the same year in the league. Arsenal won the title on goal average in 1953, for example, but how many people remember that compared with the number who still revere the Stanley Matthews Cup final of the same year? Aston Villa fans will always remember 1981 as the last time they won the league (and subsequently the European Cup the following season), though the image that comes most readily to mind for most people is Ricky Villa’s goal for Tottenham at Wembley.The good news is that only clubs with Champions League aspirations tend to look down on the FA Cup. The bad news is that because of the imbalance created within the domestic league over the last couple of decades the Cup is usually fought out between top-six sides with Champions League aspirations. This weekend’s final is a case in point, last season’s final was another, and in the 18 years of the new millennium the same five clubs have been Cup winners on no fewer than 16 occasions. The only exceptions have been Portsmouth and Wigan, each with harrowing tales to tell of what happened afterwards. The magic of the FA Cup still exists, just about, but it takes a bit of finding.You need to be an underdog with a chance to make it work, someone able to regard a Cup-winning year as a proud entry in the club’s annals rather than just another hotel to book at the end of the season. Wigan fitted the bill almost perfectly, but for being relegated a matter of days later, yet the image of Ben Watson and his team-mates celebrating in the rain in 2013 is not quite the last example of Cup euphoria running over. Think of Alan Pardew and his touchline dad-dancing routine in 2016 when Palace took the lead with 12 minutes remaining.It was premature, of course, but just for a few moments there was a man who could feel the magic, see his shot at glory. Had Palace managed to hang on Pardew might have had his own statue by now, in a pose as excruciatingly inexplicable as Stokoe’s memorable combination of tracksuit, raincoat and trilby. There is unlikely to be anything as joyously daft from either manager during Saturday’s final, which is a great pity. Wembley on Cup final day is exactly the place where one ought to get carried away."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0450010e4fc6b31b7d1fc0a7a7b01077aa3fcc92/0_188_5150_3090/master/5150.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e6981564c338f3112bc98235bb832dfe","title":"gareth southgate england world cup 2018 squad hart alexander arnold","story":"Gareth Southgate has praised the “personality and ability” of Trent Alexander-Arnold after the uncapped full-back earned a place in his World Cup 2018 squad. The England manager, speaking at his first press conference since revealing his final 23 for Russia on Wednesday, also insisted Joe Hart still has an international future.Southgate picked a youthful squad, with only five survivors from the 2014 World Cup, and backed his decision to trust in relatively inexperienced players.“It’s being fearless in how we want to play, being brave enough to put people in and not think: ‘He’s the best player but he’s young, maybe we should pick a lesser player who’s a bit more experienced.’ You can make excuses at times for not putting young people in.”Hart will not travel to Russia after Southgate picked Jordan Pickford, Jack Butland and Nick Pope as his goalkeepers. “Of course it was a difficult call,” Southgate said.“He played in most of our qualifying matches, he’s been a big part of the England team the last few years and he’s a valued member of the squad. But in the end I’ve got to look at performances over the last 18 months with their clubs, and the three lads we picked were the three best goalkeepers in the league this year.”Asked about Hart’s future prospects, he replied: “I pick players on form and if he’s playing well for his club, why wouldn’t we select him? There’s no reason for this to be the end. He has an important career decision this summer and I hope he can be back at his very best.”Southgate also commented on the absence of Jack Wilshere from the squad. “Jack has of course been in our thoughts. We selected him in March but he hasn’t played a game for us. He has had a good spell but was maybe not as effective towards the end of the season.”The England manager did not announce who will be the team captain but said he will “think about that in a bit more detail” when the players are together. Jordan Henderson has captained Southgate’s side five times, with Harry Kane and Eric Dier also leading the team."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d4d8385aa83a8db4439b5aa4181118e01dc0995f/540_1130_4303_2582/master/4303.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=48d47ca24f107d904503e40313ae1775","title":"gianluigi buffon to leave juventus but is considering interesting proposals","story":"Juventus captain Gianluigi Buffon is leaving the Italian champions and considering playing elsewhere.Buffon, who is widely regarded as one of the best goalkeepers of all time, was expected to announce his retirement at a news conference with Juventus president Andrea Agnelli at Allianz Stadium on Thursday.Instead, while the 40-year-old Buffon says the Serie A match against Verona on Saturday will be his last for Juventus, he has received offers to play elsewhere which have changed his mind about retiring.Buffon, who made his debut with Parma in 1995, has been at Juventus since 2001 and he has ruled out moving to another Italian club or dropping down the isions. “I am not someone who thinks it is right to end my career in who knows what third or fourth level ision,” he added. “I am a competitive animal and I wouldn’t be able to live in that situation. I wouldn’t feel at ease.”Buffon retired from the national team in November when Italy lost a World Cup play-off to Sweden but recently returned for friendlies. He was an integral member of the Italy squad that won the 2006 World Cup. Buffon could bid the national team goodbye in a friendly on 4 June against the Netherlands.Buffon also used the press conference to apologise for offending English referee Michael Oliver with his behaviour during and after the dramatic Champions League quarter-final defeat to Real Madrid.The goalkeeper was sent off by Oliver after confronting the referee over a late penalty awarded to Real, and converted by Cristiano Ronaldo. Buffon is the subject of a Uefa misconduct charge for criticising Oliver following the tie, notably saying he had a “rubbish bin for a heart.” “It is obvious that I have transgressed and I am sorry,” Buffon said. “But it was a very special situation. I couldn’t do anything else but say those things and I am sorry to have offended the referee.” Uefa will deal with Buffon’s case on 31 May.

We’ve met exactly once, through Skype. Inside the package is a gift I’m really hoping they like. At the very least, I hope it doesn’t explode in transit. That sounds a hell of a lot scarier than it actually is – I just really want this parcel to make it to its destination. And there’s a decent chance it might not, because inside all the bubble wrap are two bottles of Hal’s New York Limited Edition Coffee Seltzer.For people like us, seltzer is way more than just a beverage.I am now the sort of person who knows about things like limited-edition coffee seltzer, because I have become a member of a somewhat-secret seltzer society called “Now Fizzing”. (My entry is granted after I track down members on Twitter and share my seltzer-loving truth.) It’s a closed Facebook group that’s been around since 21 November 2014, and it’s composed of more than 3,100 members from around the world. Within the group, its members offer and ask for tips on where to find sought-after flavors and brands (the Polar seltzer’s seasonal flavors are always a huge hit – right now, everyone is on the hunt for its Blood Orange Lemonade, Starfruit Lemonade and Strawberry Lemonade Seltzer’ade flavors), share selfies and videos of themselves trying new kinds of seltzer for the first time (called “seltzies” and “fizzeos”, respectively), and discuss other aspects of their lives through the lens of the drink that has brought them all together.There’s a two-year-old “star” of Now Fizzing, the daughter of a member who is being filmed doing a March Madness–style seltzer taste test. The group even has its own lexicon: seltzer is “fizz”, unflavored varieties are “ghosts” and other clear sweetened beverages that are simply masquerading as seltzer are called “snakes”.Now Fizzing was launched about a year before seltzer became the “it” drink that it is today. There has already been much ink spilled over the beverage’s meteoric rise, but to this day, even the makers of seltzer find themselves stunned and confused by the sudden trendiness of their product. Chris Taylor, senior vice-president of Boylan Bottling Co and a member of Now Fizzing, chalks up seltzer’s trendiness to all the innovation going on within the space, paired with the drink’s positioning as a healthy alternative to juice or soda. Say what you will about the seltzer craze that has swept the nation, tweet your vitriolic La Croix memes, or lambast the millennials for their obsession with something you see as (literally) devoid of substance, people love this drink. But few people love it as much as the Fizz Fam does.I was late to the seltzer bandwagon. I really only began drinking it this past summer, a love that developed out of an unexpected appreciation for the majorly refreshing and full-flavored La Croix Pamplemousse (grapefruit). Then, the Polar winter seasonals (particularly Lime Ginger Mule) and Trader Joe’s Starfruit Seltzer clinched my identity as a seltzer enthusiast, and my love for the fizzy drink has bubbled over since I decided to stop drinking alcohol for an indeterminate period back in February. And that’s no coincidence: a significant number of Fizzers don’t drink alcohol. Sometimes Fizzers post seltzies to celebrate sobriety anniversaries.I was first introduced to Now Fizzing nearly two years ago by a former roommate, who is an active member. The first time she mentioned it, I probably scoffed pretty hard, already a little annoyed with the accumulating boxes of Polar Seltzer’ades being stored in our communal space. And I didn’t fully get it – not just the seltzer obsession, but the idea of a selzter community – until I actually joined the group years later, using a new Facebook account created explicitly for that purpose.Having abandoned most social media platforms for their negative effect on my mental health about six months prior, wading into the supportive world of Now Fizzing was more refreshing than an ice-cold glass bottle of Topo Chico with a twist of fresh lime.When Solomon first created the group, he had no idea what would eventually come of it. Like many others, his own personal journey into the world of fizz began when he decided to give up soda (a major vice of his that resulted from managing a bar as a nondrinker). After a weekend trip with friends to a dry campground, where they guzzled seltzer nonstop, Solomon decided to create the group as a play on Now Spinning, a Facebook group for vinyl enthusiasts to share what they’re listening to.Since then, “it’s grown beyond whatever I could have imagined,” Solomon tells me. At first, the group was composed of just his friends, but it grew exponentially, perhaps aided by the seltzer craze that seems to have first struck around 2015, a year after the group was created. While Now Fizzing primarily exists online, its members have met up in Brooklyn, Philadelphia and Seattle. Besides these planned events, Fizzers occasionally recognize each other offline thanks to the distinguishing seltzer-shaped pin and Now Fizzing T-shirt created by members and advertised within the group. And this past December, a bunch of Fizzers banded together to ship Solomon six boxes of Polar’s Mango Limeade to ensure he’d be hydrated during his annual 25-hour radio show.To find out what made this group so joyful, I began asking around. In addition to being an active member of Now Fizzing, Amanda Brennan is an expert on online communities and fandoms. Understanding the way these networks function and thrive is literally part of her job as the senior content insights manager at Tumblr. And she says that, without question, Now Fizzing is particularly special.“In the climate of internet where there’s a lot of bad things going on, it’s so great to have this group that feels very pure and very positive just really about this thing that we all love,” Brennan tells me.Her sentiments are shared by the 15 other members I spoke with, all of whom were exceptionally enthusiastic in their love of both “fizz” and the group. Time and time again, the same adjectives came up: fun, supportive, wholesome, safe, pure, positive, friendly and earnest.Aria, a Boston-based member of Fizz Fam, tells me a story about a time when she called her mom, who was in the grocery store, to ask her to scope out the scene for new Polar Seltzer’ade flavors. Confused, her mom repeated her request out loud in the aisle, catching the attention of a man who was looking for the same thing. Unable to find it, her mom hung up – only to call back a minute later to tell Aria that the nice man had found it in another aisle and returned to share the good news.Fizzers, it appears, are the type of strangers for whom kindness comes naturally. “I’m not sure if all seltzer drinkers are good people,” a Fizzer named Randi explained in an email she wrote me while drinking Polar Orange Vanilla, “but these members are.”While scrolling through the group for new seltzer flavors, I became so intrigued by its dynamics that I decided to reach out to my former colleague Annemarie Dooling, now the audience development manager at Vox Media. She has more than 10 years of experience moderating communities and is an expert on digital human behavior.After patiently listening to me drone on about the group, Dooling tells me that there are a few logical reasons for Now Fizzing’s success. One of these is the group’s relatively small size. Another is the coincidental timing of seltzer becoming a cultural phenomenon. But mostly, she says, it’s simply the members who set the tone with such a laser-focused passion.“People who like certain things and are kind of fanatical about them always find each other,” Dooling tells me, stressing that communities of interest (rather than those of circumstance or geography) are inherently special in nature.“It’s not always easy to find people who are interested in your interests,” Dooling says. “There is always a group of people that are your tribe, and it’s about finding out who your tribe is. Sometimes that tribe is in front of you, sometimes it’s virtual.”Ian and Tracy, a married couple living in the Pacific north-west, tell me that Now Fizzing is very much their tribe. They’re exceptionally regular posters within the group. Last year, they scheduled their annual summer trip to New York City to coincide with a Prospect Park meet-up planned by Solomon. They tried new flavors, met the people they had bonded with online, and had such a blast that they ended up making extra room in their packed itinerary to hang out with the new friends they’d just made.Over Skype, the three of us compare our favorite brands and flavors and discuss the larger seltzer culture. I find they’re exceptionally easy to talk to, with deep, genuine laughs and cool art hanging in their home. They talk excitedly about how they look forward to reconnecting with their seltzer friends IRL the next time they come out east.Tracy laughs and shakes her head at the sheer absurdity of the statement. But I can tell we both agree with what Ian just said. Positivity, compassion and enthusiasm can be powerful forces, especially on the internet, and especially in these isive and often toxic times. I realize that they’re the reason people join groups like this in the first place.At the end of the call, I ask Ian and Tracy if there’s any type of seltzer on the east coast that they can’t get where they live. After a stop at my favorite cafe, which stocks five different seltzer brands, I head to the post office.Allee Manning is a freelance journalist writing here and there.

But it’s important to follow a few simple steps to achieve that crisp, buttery and Instagrammable end resultHasselback potatoes, named after the Stockholm restaurant said to have created them, are one of those dishes that tend to look better than they taste: painstakingly chiselled fans of gloriously golden carbohydrate perfect for the Instagram age, yet sadly soggy on the fork. As Ed Smith writes in On the Side, “disappointingly, some so-called hasselback potatoes turn out to be little more than roast new potatoes with a few cuts in them”, when they should be a showstopping cross between a roast potato and a fried one, both comfortingly fluffy and satisfyingly crunchy. They may be more work than a pan of mash and not, perhaps, the kind of thing you’d knock up on a Tuesday evening, but if you’re out to impress, hasselbacks are the perfect accompaniment to steak, roast chicken, meaty fish or just about anything else that might demand a helping of chips – and they’re considerably easier to execute, too. Plus, did I mention they look good on Instagram?Not everyone thinks that hasselbacks should be fluffy: Nigella Lawson writes that she loves them made with new potatoes, too, recommending charlotte or ratte, choices echoed by Smith, Stevie Parle and Trish Hilferty in her book Lobster and Chips, which calls for “medium-sized waxy potatoes”.Ranged against them are Martha Stewart (her yukon golds, like Julia Moskin’s russets, are hard to get hold of in this country, but seem to be classified as “fluffy” by the British Potato Council, so I substitute Roosters), and Alastair Little, who calls for baking potatoes, which also get an airing in Moskin’s recipe, mainly because I can find no other spuds weighing a pound each.Alhough I don’t think such huge potatoes are the best suited for the hasselback treatment, because the crisp exterior to fluffy interior ratio is all wrong, I do prefer their fluffy texture to the smoothness of the waxy kind, which, soaked in butter, are almost too rich for my taste – more like fondant potatoes. Like chips and roast potatoes, fluffy seems the way to go.I’m pleased to discover that peeling the potatoes is traditional, but not mandatory: Little and Hilferty are the only ones to bother. In theory, it should help the exterior crisp up, but in practice it doesn’t seem to make much difference, and leaving the skins on gives the dish a better flavour.It does pay, however, to spend time on the cutting of the potatoes. Many of the recipes dictate slicing them in 5mm intervals, but, in the hope of speeding up the cooking process, I’m going to copy Smith’s 2-3mm intervals, which also have the (possibly questionable) benefit of making the potatoes look like oversized woodlice. To help you slice down, but not through them, you could run a skewer through their length, as Hilferty and Little recommend, or cut them between two chopsticks, like Parle, but I find the simplest way is to put the potatoes in the bowl of a wooden spoon, as Molly Wizenberg suggests on her blog Orangette. As potatoes are not a uniform diameter along their entire length, slicing at a slight angle, à la Little, often makes life easier.Rinsing off some of the surface starch, a tip from Hilferty, does seem to help stop them sticking together Little’s cold water bath presumably serves the same purpose, but running water proves more effective.Moskin’s is the only recipe to pre-cook the spuds, boiling the monsters for 10 minutes, then allowing them to cool completely before baking. Athough this proves inconvenient, the idea isn’t a bad one: potatoes are dense things, and many of the recipes I try wildly underestimate the baking time, so it makes sense to give them a head start. However, I prefer Smith’s method of braising them in water in the oven itself: although the bottoms might not be quite as crunchy as those roasted just in butter, the tops still crisp up satisfactorily, and there are no questionable bits of semi-raw spud in the middle.The oven should be hot, but not too hot – Moskin’s 220C425Fgas 7 leaves the potatoes charred on top before they’ve had a chance to cook through – and it’s essential, as most recipes acknowledge, to keep basting them throughout the cook, “in order for the butter to penetrate”, as Parle puts it.Butter is the order of the day here – and lots of it. You could substitute olive oil, if you’d prefer to keep them vegan, or swap in duck or goose fat or even good beef dripping, but, for me, potatoes and butter are a match made in heaven. You don’t need anything else, but garlic goes well with butter, of course, and also has the benefit of helping to wedge the slices open. If you don’t like garlic, shallots or onions work just as well, or you could use bay leaves or sage, but be careful not to overdo it, because a little goes a long way with both.Smith also adds caraway seeds, and Moskin sweet and smoked paprika intended to replicate the smoky bacon she reckons the originals were wrapped in, but I find no mention of this elsewhere. It does indeed give her potatoes a “gorgeous ruddy colour”, however, and would be lovely with roast pork or barbecued meat or veg.8 medium floury potatoes, such as maris pipers or king edwards (about 800g-1kg)6 garlic cloves, peeled3 bay leaves (optional)50g butter2 tbsp dry breadcrumbs, tossed with a little olive oil (optional)Heat the oven to 200C390Fgas 6. Find an ovenproof frying pan or a heavy, hob-safe baking tin that’s just large enough to hold the potatoes in a single layer.Put each potato in the bowl of a wooden spoon and, at roughly 2mm intervals, cut carefully down, but not quite through, the potato, maintaining a slight angle towards the centre of the potato.Slice the garlic, and stuff several pieces into each potato, making sure you push them well down so they don’t burn. Tear the bay leaves, if using, into several pieces and do the same.Meanwhile, melt the butter in the pan or tin over a medium heat until sizzling. Put in the potatoes one by one, and carefully turn them in the butter to coat, then pour in enough cold water to come halfway up the sides of the potatoes.Bring to a boil, then roast for an hour and 30 minutes, basting every 15 minutes. Scatterwith the breadcrumbs, if using, for the final 15 minutes of cooking, at which point you can add any remaining garlic to the pan as well. Serve hot from the oven.• Hasselback potatoes: Scandi spud sorcery or more hassle than they’re worth?

A pause for a mischievous sneer. “Or so I’ve read.”Marr must never tire of reminding interviewers, every time his erstwhile colleague Morrissey opens his once-loving mouth, that it’s been 30 years since they were in a band together. But history binds the pair, though they are about as likely to do a reunion tour as Yanny and Laurel or Cain and Abel. Even today their careers are unintentionally symbiotic, with Moz using official online statements to promote far-right party For Britain on account of their accidental animal rights policies (being anti-Islam means being anti-halal, which is Morrissey catnip). Marr is now the guilt-free Smiths experience.He’d never acknowledge it, but he plays up to the billing with panache. Striding on stage at this low-key showcase for new album Call the Comet in a shiny bomber jacket and the perfectly imperfect bed-hair of Manchester rock royalty, within two songs he’s into Bigmouth Strikes Again as if out to rescue his heritage from the political plughole. His gruffer, but by no means unrefined, vocals lend fresh flavour to the Smiths tracks he drops intermittently into the set his fired-up Bigmouth, stabbed through with trademark arpeggios, seems designed to remind us that the Smiths were as much gobby post-punk rabble as they were foppish ego cult, while The Headmaster Ritual could be Daytripper-era Beatles with switchblades up their blazer sleeves.He doesn’t shy from the challenge either, tackling quintessentially Moz showstoppers such as Last Night I Dreamt That Somebody Loved Me Please, Please, Please Let Me Get What I Want and There Is a Light That Never Goes Out, alongside How Soon Is Now?, in which the guitar is decidedly the star. Unafraid to emulate Morrissey’s idiosyncratic vocal pirouettes, Marr contests custody of the songs magnificently, owning them every bit as much as his former frontman and proving that Stephen’s poet-next-door charisma was only ever a fraction of the Smiths’ formidable art.Such delightful fan fodder, plus a breezy run through Electronic’s Getting Away With It, sugars a set dominated by Call the Comet, showcased almost in full tonight. Moz-bait or no, it’s set in a near future in which a race of artificially intelligent aliens called the Tracers have arrived to save humanity from its populist folly, advanced technology correcting the ills of its mewling social media infant. Sonically, though, it’s lodged firmly in the past. Motorik and doom-laden mood pieces such as Actor Attractor and New Dominions recall Joy Division, Can and Depeche Mode, and even flirt with goth on occasion.It’s stirring stuff, but after decades as a guitar legend for hire in bands such as Modest Mouse and the Cribs, Marr seems to be floundering for a distinct solo sound. He fares best when letting his old one fly, indulging his virtuoso proto-indie guitar flourishes on Hi Hello, a song with all the springtime swing of There Is a Light, and a highlight of a night that finds Marr elevated to a symbol of alt-rock righteousness almost by proxy. One thing’s for sure though – if the Smiths ever do reform they’ll need David Dimbleby as tour manager."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6db1e3d4078ae27244ee987920c29fce72db14bd/0_150_1432_859/master/1432.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6f718558aefbae3737d96b1789c1e7b9","title":"the rolling stones every album ranked","story":"As the indestructible rock’n’rollers begin their No Filter tour, we rank each of their 23 albums, from their 1964 eponymous debut to 2o16’s Blue \u0026amp LonesomeThe best moments on Dirty Work come when the atmosphere of intra-band animosity in which it was recorded is channelled into the music: One Hit (to the Body) and Winning Ugly fizz with nasty energy. Elsewhere, it’s lifeless, and the period production on Back to Zero has dated abysmally. Mick Jagger attempts to gussy up the Rolling Stones’ sound with samples and loops courtesy of trip-hop producer Danny Saber, and an intransigent Keith Richards responds by throwing Saber out of the studio. Results are as uneven as you might expect. More stripped down and straightforward than its predecessor, Steel Wheels, this isn’t a bad album, exactly, but it sounds as if hard work was involved, the product of craft rather inspiration: tough coming from a band that, at their best, made it all seem effortless. Also, it feels as if it goes on for about six weeks.An hour-long album without an hour’s worth of decent songs, A Bigger Bang wings it on spirit alone. Jagger is in snarling, priapic form on opener Rough Justice, while Oh No, Not You Again and Look What the Cat Dragged In rage along with something of the screw-you spirit of Shattered. Sweet Neo Con, meanwhile, attempts to sock it to George W Bush. A comeback of sorts, this set the template for latterday Stones albums: solid rather than amazing, a few decent tracks, some obvious filler, the odd lunge for contemporaneity, the sense of feral menace that once powered them noticeable by its absence and the whole business clearly a secondary consideration to going out on tour to crank out the hits. Most post-70s Stones albums seem rooted in a power struggle between Richards’ traditionalism and Jagger’s desire to stay relevant. On Undercover, Jagger won: a lot of the then-cutting edge 80s production falls flat, but when it does work, as on the hip-hop-influenced opener Undercover of the Night and Too Much Blood, you can really hear what he was driving at. The sense that the Stones were losing interest in making albums was hard to avoid when confronted with Black and Blue. It’s essentially a collection of jams recorded while auditioning for a new guitarist. When they actually wrote songs – Fool to Cry, Memory Motel – they still sounded great. Neither the disaster it has been reviled as nor the masterpiece some revisionist critics have claimed, Satanic Majesties is a likable, undisciplined psychedelic mess – Sing This All Together’s subtitle, See What Happens, sums it up – flecked with moments of genuine greatness: not just 2000 Light Years From Home and She’s a Rainbow, but Citadel and the delicate 2000 Man. This is the moment when the Stones’ excesses began to catch up with them, albeit slowly. It’s Only Rock ‘N Roll offers sparks of inspiration – Fingerprint File, Dance Little Sister, the title track – amid stuff that sounds suspiciously like formula and filler: that said, compared to what was to come, it’s a masterpiece. A muddled attempt to fit with prevalent pop trends, home to the peculiar sound of the Stones trying to emulate the Kinks’ music hall-inspired songs, Between the Buttons’ best moments – Connection, Miss Amanda Jones, Back Street Girl – tellingly cleave closest to the band’s original blueprint.By now, the Stones were just slinging together old outtakes to give them an excuse to rake it in on tour, so Tattoo You has no right to be as good as it is: the punk inflections were becoming a bit preposterous (Neighbours), but Start Me Up was the last truly deathless Stones anthem and Goats Head Soup leftover Waiting on a Friend is fantastic.Or Some Girls Part 2, with more inspiration drawn from disco (Prince definitely paid attention to the fantastic title track) and more punky thrash – incredibly, the cor-blimeyisms of Where the Boys Go suggests someone had been listening to Sham 69. As is often the way with sequels, not quite the match of its predecessor. The early 60s blues scene was a purists’ movement, but their second album demonstrates how eclectic and boundary-blurring the early Stones were, boldly defining a space of their own somewhere between blues, rock’n’roll and soul, amping up the pace and the attitude of each to thrilling effect. At the point where even the most committed fan despaired of them ever making an unequivocally great album again, they did. You could ask why they didn’t return sooner to the blues songs that first inspired them, but the passing of time gives Blue \u0026amp Lonesome its power. With a lifetime of experience behind them, the Stones sounded as if they really knew of what they sung. Out of Our Heads is the culmination of what you might call the first era of The Rolling Stones. They are still reliant on tough rhythm and blues and soul covers – their version of Don Covay’s Mercy Mercy is great – but Jagger and Richards’ songwriting is blossoming: antagonistic on Heart of Stone, gleefully hymning the arrogance of youth on I’m Free. Greeted with disappointment on release, Goats Head Soup’s reputation has been burnished by time: Star Star is a grim entry into the pantheon of questionable Stones songs about women, but the stateliness of ballads Winter and Angie and the grimy funk of Dancing with Mr D and Doo Doo Doo Doo Doo (Heartbreaker) show a band still at the height of their powers.It’s easy to forget what a revolutionary album the Stones’ debut was. Still remarkably raw-sounding, it repositioned hardcore, aficionados-only Chicago blues – Muddy Waters, Jimmy Reed – as mainstream pop: everyone who has subsequently tried something similar, from Led Zeppelin to the White Stripes, effectively follows in its wake. Some Girls suddenly arrested the Stones’ mid-70s decline, inspired in part by Jagger’s observation of New York at its creative zenith – there is disco on Miss You, and punk on Shattered and Respectable – and in part by the druggy chaos of Richards’ personal life. Before They Make Me Run is snarling defiance, but Beast of Burden’s meditation on his collapsing relationship with Anita Pallenberg sounds affectingly heartbroken. The Rolling Stones saved their most audacious mid-60s pop experiments for singles – Paint It Black, Have You Seen Your Mother, Baby, Standing in the Shadow? – but Aftermath still cuts a ferocious swathe through Swinging London. Bracingly hostile from its opening line (“What a drag it is getting old”), its sneering, screw-you attitude is tempered by the dulcimer-led baroque pop of Lady Jane.Let It Bleed boasts perhaps the most powerful opening in rock history – the four and half minutes of apocalyptic dread that constitutes Gimme Shelter – but it scarcely lets up after that: the filthy strut of Live With Me, a beautiful, mandolin-infused reading of Robert Johnson’s Love in Vain, the title track’s saga of dissipation, sex and violence.Few bands sounded so relieved that psychedelia’s lysergic adventure was over. On Beggar’s Banquet, the Stones sparkle, reinvigorated by reconnecting with roots music on Jigsaw Puzzle and the wilfully nasty Stray Cat Blues. Street Fighting Man and Sympathy For the Devil seem buoyed by the turbulence of the era while Brian Jones provides his own epitaph with No Expectations’ desolate slide guitar. Does Sticky Fingers or its murky, sprawling successor represent the Stones’ zenith? It’s a photo finish: Sticky Fingers has more focus, Exile more breadth and a more primal, physical thrill, Jagger’s voice fighting for space amid the rush of sound. Appalling, diseased behaviour has never sounded as appealing as it does on Shine a Light or Torn and Frayed the Stones were never more convincing as a country band than on Sweet Virginia.The late 60s curdling from buttercup-sandwich optimism to grim bleakness could have finished the Rolling Stones: drug busts, deaths, murderous Hells Angels at Altamont. But in truth, it suited them. Virtually from the moment they started writing songs, Jagger and Richards were drawn to darkness: certainly, they were better at depicting decay and decadence than delivering pie-eyed hippy beatitudes. So, on their first post-Altamont album, the Stones sounded simultaneously shattered by recent events and utterly imperious: from Brown Sugar’s sleazy riff to the astonishing, weary, string-bedecked closer Moonlight Mile, their claim to be The Greatest Rock’n’Roll Band in the World has no more compelling evidence than the flawless 46 minutes of music here."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f805632b831d7f6a11a939d026fd1a3ff814f21f/0_2212_4480_2688/master/4480.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=709aca3d35bdbb8c9289e8b96db93c52","title":"champion boxer caught in britains immigration dragnet kelvin bilal fawaz operation nexus","story":"A little-known Home Office scheme designed to deport more ‘foreign criminals’ has left Kelvin Bilal Fawaz – and many others like him – living in an endless limbo. By  Daniel TrillingThe opening ceremony of the London Olympics, on 27 July 2012, should have been a moment of triumph for Kelvin Bilal Fawaz. The talented young boxer had recently been crowned the amateur light middleweight champion of England, and he was meant to be marching with the athletes of Team GB as they paraded into the Olympic Stadium.Fawaz was born in Nigeria, and trafficked to Britain as a child – where he was rescued by the state and raised in care. Now he was a champion, ready to represent his country, with a lucrative professional career ahead of him. But there was one problem: he wasn’t a British citizen. In fact, it wasn’t clear if he had permission to stay in the UK at all. As a child, he had been given temporary leave to remain until just before he turned 18 – but he had to apply to extend this as an adult, and by 2012, at the age of 24, he was still waiting for a response. Like the rest of us, he watched the Games on television.Since then, Fawaz has lost almost everything: his nascent career, his marriage, and ultimately, his liberty. Now 29, he has lived his entire adult life in the UK without valid immigration status, which means he has no right to work and is liable to be detained and deported at a moment’s notice. During the past decade, he has applied and appealed for extended leave to remain he has applied for a spousal visa he has even asked to be registered as stateless person. All these requests have been turned down by the Home Office, which considers his presence in the UK undesirable.The Windrush scandal has brought attention to the “hostile environment” policy introduced by Theresa May in 2012 to drive unwanted immigrants from the UK. But Fawaz has become ensnared in a lesser-known policy – another Home Office scheme designed to remove immigrants, purportedly by targeting the most dangerous foreign criminals.This is called Operation Nexus, a joint initiative between police forces and immigration enforcement. Launched in 2012, it has received little public scrutiny – official guidance notes describing it were only published last year. But it goes even further than previous schemes to deport “foreign criminals”, because it also targets people, such as Fawaz, who have never been to prison. In his late teens and early 20s, Fawaz received convictions for minor offences such as cannabis possession, driving without insurance and spraying graffiti he points out that he has never received a harsher sentence than community service, and argues that he is a reformed character. For the Home Office, none of this matters.In fact, the state has been trying to force Fawaz from the UK for several years – but he has nowhere to go. Although he was born in Nigeria, his mother came from Benin and his father from Lebanon. Nigeria won’t accept Fawaz as a citizen, and according to Fawaz, neither will his parents’ countries of birth. The Home Office doesn’t believe him, so it keeps trying. In the meantime, he survives on donations and trains at his local boxing gym. The gym is his life: he hoovers it, he cleans the toilets, he has even slept there when he’s had nowhere else to stay. Legally speaking, he has all but reached the end of the road. His best chance may well be to throw himself once more on the mercy of the Home Office and ask for the state to be sympathetic and make an exception.In this regard, Fawaz has more in his favour than others who find themselves in similar situations. His talent is undeniable, and making a contribution through sport is a well-worn path to acceptance for immigrants. Fawaz has represented England in international competition six times, including against Nigeria: as he puts it, he has literally bled for his adoptive country, in the ring. He has made something of his turbulent life, and passes his knowledge on to young people and children at the gym, so that they might avoid the mistakes he once made. But the Home Office disagrees: its press officers point out that Fawaz has 15 criminal convictions in total. “When someone has no leave to remain in the UK, we expect them to leave the country voluntarily,” is their rote reply to journalists. “Where they do not, we will seek to enforce their departure.”After years of living in uncertainty, Fawaz was suddenly arrested in November last year, placed in detention and told he would be imminently deported to Nigeria. His story became national news. A petition started by a member of the public demanding that the Home Office grant Fawaz British citizenship received more than 100,000 signatures. After several weeks in a detention centre, he was released on bail.Our reactions to these stories follow a familiar pattern. Attention focuses on the merits of the inidual: has this person worked hard, have they contributed, have they played by the rules? If they don’t deserve to be treated like this, then the implication is that other people do deserve it: “If only we could create an immigration system that caught the bad foreigners – the illegals and the criminals – and left the innocent alone.” As more details come to light about the damage caused by the government’s “hostile environment” for unwanted immigrants, this question is at the forefront of political debate. But Fawaz’s story shows how, in trying to make an increasingly severe distinction between the deserving and the undeserving, the UK casts many people into a bureaucratic limbo that effectively criminalises their existence in this country. What if, instead of finding “illegal immigrants”, our policies are creating them?In early February this year, I met Fawaz as he joined a group of campaigners from 38 Degrees to hand in his petition at the Home Office’s headquarters in Westminster. He arrived late, greeting each of us as if we were old friends. When he asked me to take a photo of him for his Instagram feed outside the Home Office entrance, he turned on the charm. “This is so good,” he exclaimed in a soft, London-inflected voice. He gave polite but firm instructions to the camera crew who were filming an interview with him: “Don’t just ask me how people can help. Ask me human questions.”For several years now, there has been a trickle of stories about bizarre or apparently cruel decisions in immigration cases, in which people who have spent many years – or even their whole lives – in the UK are ordered to leave the country. In recent months, thanks to dogged reporting on the subject, the fate of the Windrush generation has become a national scandal. Now, the focus is widening to other people caught up in the “hostile environment”, the harsh system of internal border controls that the prime minister made her flagship policy when she was home secretary.But our fractious national debate about immigration is based on three categories whose definitions are not fixed: “illegal”, “criminal” and “foreign”. In fact, it is easy to see how their meanings have shifted under the pressure of media outrage and government policy. During the last two decades, the shift has been in one direction: to broaden our idea of who is a foreign criminal and who is an illegal immigrant, which in turn justifies harsh new policies, and authoritarian structures.At the centre of this is the Home Office, the government department with perhaps the most direct impact on our daily lives. It is responsible for the police, fire services, MI5, immigration and border control – in short, many of the ways in which a state is supposed to keep its citizens safe. But because of this role, it often finds itself under pressure from within government and without. On the one hand, it is frequently attacked by rightwing media for perceived failures to prevent crime or control immigration, and by liberal critics for apparent heavy-handedness. On the other, it sometimes sees itself at odds with fellow government departments, looking out for the ordinary British citizen while officials elsewhere make decisions based solely on what’s best for economic growth and competitiveness. The result, as a group of academic researchers concluded in their recent book Go Home? The Politics of Immigration Controversies, is “an organisation that feels embattled and misunderstood”, which develops new policy “at an unusually high speed”, often in response to pressure from the media and with one eye on the news cycle.Although the policies introduced by May were some of the most hardline yet, they are part of a longer-term pattern of anti-immigrant rhetoric. One of the flashpoints in this process is how the state deals with foreign-national offenders: people who aren’t British citizens who commit crimes in the UK. This is one of the most sensitive parts of the immigration system: serious crimes committed by people with limited or no right to be in the country often generate furious press coverage, as do bureaucratic obstacles to their removal, such as human rights laws.It is often hard to tell what is the greater cause for outrage: the crime itself, or the foreignness of the offender. In this atmosphere, for more than a decade, successive governments have promised to deport ever-larger numbers of these people, but in doing so, they have followed a dangerous logic, whereby the nature of the threat we are supposed to be protected from has shifted – from particular crimes to a vague, expanding category of the “foreign criminal”.The first big media storm about foreign criminals erupted in the summer of 2006, after it emerged that 1,000 foreign prisoners had been released at the end of their sentences without being considered for deportation, as the rules required. Labour’s home secretary, Charles Clarke, was forced to resign his replacement, John Reid, declared the immigration directorate “not fit for purpose” and launched a series of reforms to restore public confidence in the system. UK borders were rebranded, with flags, insignia and uniformed staff, while a communications strategy focused on getting more immigration raids into the media. And in 2007, the UK Borders Act introduced the automatic deportation of “foreign criminals” convicted of serious crimes and imprisoned for more than 12 months.Since its landslide victory in 1997, the New Labour government had tried to outflank its critics on the right by taking a tough line on crime and immigration. Rather than challenging the claim that these two phenomena were inextricably linked, it reinforced the idea: as late as 2010, Labour’s election manifesto contained a section entitled Crime and Immigration. In the early days of New Labour, the focus was on asylum seekers, who were the target of exaggerated press claims about people trying to exploit Britain’s system of refugee protection. In the early 2000s, Labour dramatically expanded Britain’s network of immigration detention centres in order to lock up asylum-seekers while their claims were processed. After 2007, the government found a new use for the additional facilities: to detain the increased number of foreigners who were being scheduled for deportation after their prison sentences had ended.At a stroke, Labour had drastically expanded the definition of a dangerous foreign criminal. The policy had an immediate effect, raising the number of offenders removed from the UK from under 3,000 in 2007 to nearly 4,500 in 2008. But they did little to reduce the salience of immigration as an issue in the minds of voters or newspaper editors. When the Conservatives came to power, having pledged to reduce immigration to the “tens of thousands”, the incoming home secretary Theresa May focused much of her energy on removing unwanted people from the UK. In 2012, she gave an interview to the Daily  in which she declared her intention to create “a really hostile environment” for illegal immigrants: initiatives to identify and deport people, or to make everyday life so difficult for them that they would leave of their own accord. A host of new laws followed in the 2014 and 2016 Immigration Acts, which extended border control into everyday life by criminalising bureaucratic irregularities and forcing public servants and private companies to check the immigration status of prospective clients. These were accompanied by measures to encourage government agencies to collect and share immigration data more effectively.At the same time, Operation Nexus was rolled out to a series of police forces in England. Its definition of “foreign criminal” is far broader than the policy that existed before 2007 broader, too, than how New Labour redefined it. Serious offenders fall under its remit, but so do people convicted of minor offences.Yet if you look at the deportation figures, a strange picture emerges. The number of people deported from within the country (as opposed to those turned away at ports and airports) has stayed roughly steady at between 10,000 and 12,000 a year. That’s because deporting someone – an “enforced removal” in official euphemism – is a complicated process. A Home Office document entitled Country Returns Guide gives us some insight: this spreadsheet, a resource for civil servants, lists more than 200 countries and comments on how co-operative they are at taking their citizens back from the UK. Alongside each entry, wherever possible, are comments noting roughly how long it will take to issue a travel document (anywhere from a few days to six months, depending on the country), what kind of supporting evidence is required to prove a person’s nationality, and remarks on the country itself. In many cases the information is unclear or incomplete.It is for this reason that many of May’s policies are aimed at convincing people to leave of their own accord. But while you might expect the number of so-called “voluntary returns” to have increased since 2012, there has been no significant growth here, either. Indeed, the total number of returns, voluntary or enforced, has actually fallen since 2014. So as new policies seek to bring more and more people into the state’s immigration dragnet, fewer people are being made to leave. Instead, they are thrown into a state of uncertainty that can last many years. This is what happened to Fawaz.On Wednesday evenings, Stonebridge Boxing Club in north-west London is in full flow. When I visited, in mid-February, around 50 people were there for a training session, shouted at by a handful of coaches. The gym, on the second floor of a half-built office block, was hot with overworked bodies, and every 30 seconds or so there was a thud and a rattle as dozens of people, men and a few women, hit punchbags in unison. Most of the people there were black, Asian or eastern European. Stonebridge is in Brent, one of the most ethnically erse parts of London it is also one of the boroughs where, in 2013, the Home Office trialled a scheme to drive around advertising vans bearing the slogan: “In the UK illegally? Go home or face arrest.”As I watched, Aamir Ali, the club’s owner, pointed people out to me: two of the coaches had boxed for Nigeria and Lebanon, respectively, at the 1992 Olympics. Mikael Lawal, a young Londoner of Nigerian heritage, is the first from the gym to turn professional. In the main ring, a boxer who had recently arrived from Kazakhstan was dispatching one challenger after another with rapid blows, not seeming to tire. He had come to the UK to try his luck at a professional career, Ali explained a friend from his home village has lived in London for years and is a regular. “United Nations, is all I’m saying,” he joked.Although immigration is nothing new to Britain, its nature and shape has changed in recent decades. Between 1993 and 2014, the number of foreign citizens living in the UK rose from nearly 2 million to more than 5 million. At the same time, a series of changes to the law have made it much harder for these residents to secure UK citizenship. Instead, Britain’s multiethnic communities live with a plethora of temporary and precarious forms of leave to remain. Academics call this “multi-status Britain” – people have jobs, lives and families here, but on paper they are foreign.Fawaz arrived midway through the session, wearing an immaculate white T-shirt, fedora and ripped jeans that contrasted with everyone else’s sweaty gym gear. He walked around greeting people as a visiting celebrity might, then stood by a corner of the ring and watched the fight with the Kazakh boxer. His expression turned serious, and his head nodded in the rhythm of the two men.When Fawaz tells his story, he does it in soundbites and neat, well-worn anecdotes – the behaviour of a sportsman with one eye on fame, perhaps, but it is also what immigration control demands of its subjects. Testimony becomes everything, and the complex details of a life are turned into claims and counter-claims. By his account, this is roughly how it goes: he was born in northern Nigeria to a Lebanese father and a mother from Benin. His mother abused him (“You know when someone has a life that is not good for them and they take their anger out”) and his father left him with an “uncle” – either a relative or a family friend, Fawaz isn’t sure – in Lagos. During this time his mother was murdered in religious riots, and in 2004, when Fawaz was 14, his uncle announced that he was taking him to London to reunite him with his father. He was flown to the UK – on what documents, Fawaz doesn’t know – but instead of meeting his father, he was given to a family who held him captive and made him work as a domestic servant. After a few months, he escaped, and was taken into the care of social services in a west London borough.In the back office of the gym, overlooked by wallpaper bearing the famous 1930s photo of New York workmen eating their lunch on the girder of a half-built skyscraper, Fawaz told me what happened to him after he escaped his captors. To use the language of child protection workers, he had been trafficked into domestic servitude. The government offers protection to trafficked children, but it has strict limits, to avoid opening up a kind of back door to permanent citizenship. In most cases, they are refused asylum and granted a type of temporary leave to remain that expires before they turn 18. This is usually on the basis that there are no safe reception facilities for children in their home countries, but it means that they spend the formative years of their lives not knowing if they will be expelled from the UK when they become adults. Frequent delays in processing applications, which can take several years, increase the uncertainty further – making it even more difficult for children raised in care to build stable adult lives.Given temporary leave to remain, “while they worked out what to do with me”, Fawaz was placed in a group foster home in west London until he turned 16, then moved to a halfway house for older teenagers. There, he joined some of his new neighbours in what he described as “bad stuff. Weed, graffiti, sex with different girls, alcohol, smoking. It was only when I left that era that I looked back and I was like: ‘Oh my god, you really, really was going down.’”In early adulthood, as he waited to find out if he would be allowed to stay in the UK, Fawaz received a string of minor criminal convictions. But this was also a period, he told me, in which his life began to change for the better.Second, he met and fell in love with a young woman, who he married. “She retuned me, she made me see things differently,” he told me. Fawaz received a national diploma in sports science and was offered a place at university, although he couldn’t take it up because of his uncertain immigration status: without leave to remain, he was not eligible for a student loan. Gradually, his success in amateur boxing competitions – and the demands of training – led Fawaz further and further away from his old friends. In early 2012, he won the Amateur Boxing Association (ABA)’s national competition, becoming light middleweight champion of England. This convinced him to focus on his career, although he had not entirely put his old life behind him: his last criminal conviction was in 2014. Fawaz said a series of violent incidents, in which he was attacked or threatened, convinced him to completely break off contact with his former friends.I asked Fawaz to imagine his life since arriving in the UK – his life in care, his shift from delinquency to boxing – as a line on a graph. He moved his hand upwards in a steep slope, representing his progress all the way until that championship victory in 2012. And then he dropped his hand, sharply. It was in that year that his request to stay in the UK – made years earlier, when he was still a teenager – was rejected. With his status unresolved, Fawaz had no right to work and could not turn professional: he says he had to turn down a contract from a top boxing promoter worth more than £200,000.Next, Fawaz made a series of appeals that were turned down. The ABA wrote to the Home Office five times to ask that Fawaz be given travel documents and a work visa. Another attempt, to gain naturalisation via marriage, was rejected because Fawaz did not have the right to be in the UK at the time of his wedding. After several more years, having exhausted all legal avenues, he was issued with a document ordering him to leave the country, and told to sign in at an immigration reporting centre every week or face being detained.And yet, he said, he still couldn’t obtain a passport from any other country. The stress of this period, Fawaz said, led to the breakup of his relationship in 2015. At that point, he told me, he stopped boxing: “I gave up. I lost everything, I lost my motivation, I started drinking.” He suffered depression, and during a period in between houses, would sometimes sleep on public transport.Operation Nexus was Theresa May’s attempt to solve a problem that had bedevilled home secretaries since John Reid. Although the number of foreign-national offenders removed from the UK initially rose sharply, it has been stuck at roughly the same level ever since. Piloted in London, and since extended to other parts of England, Nexus is a way for police and immigration officials to identify “high harm” foreign national offenders and remove them.Some police forces now station immigration officers in custody suites, and others make immigration checks on everyone they arrest. When a person applies for citizenship, or to extend their leave to remain, their details are cross-checked with police records and, if necessary, passed on to specialist Nexus casework teams employed by the Home Office. As with other immigration cases, people can appeal against the decision to remove them, and evidence will be heard at a tribunal.But our notions of who counts as “illegal”, “criminal” and “foreign” depend on who defines them. And Nexus is playing a key role in broadening the terms of reference, so much so, in fact, that people with minor convictions – or even none at all – can find themselves labelled foreign criminals. On its own terms, the policy has been partly successful: between 2012 and 2015, for example, around 3,000 foreign-national offenders were removed.Some of these people committed serious crimes, but not all of them: Nexus also considers cases based on ancient, spent and petty convictions, and carries out “intelligence-led” deportation. Immigration tribunals have less strict rules of evidence than criminal courts, and a person can be more easily referred to Nexus the less secure their immigration status is. If you have valid immigration leave, according to the official Nexus guidance notes published by the Home Office, the police have to believe you pose a “current and ongoing threat to the public” to be referred. If you have no valid immigration leave – if, say, you are waiting for a decision on your application – you merely need to be “subject to active police interest” in order to be sucked into Operation Nexus and put before a tribunal.Melanie Griffiths, a social scientist at Birmingham University who has observed a number of Nexus-related appeals, has described how intelligence-led deportation leads to cases that “rest upon a medley of allegations, unproved assertions, hearsay, anonymous evidence, the behaviour of the appellant’s friends and circumstantial evidence”. Police often submit large bundles of evidence that include “non-convictions”: stop-and-searches where nothing is found, withdrawn charges, acquittals at trial and arrests that led to cautions or no charges. Officials are, in effect, able to paint a picture of serious criminality without having to definitively prove it.Fawaz told me that at one of his appeal hearings, “they brought police officers to testify against me”, who claimed he was a gang member. When I spoke to him, he was indignant at the suggestion that his minor convictions – “just naughty child stuff” – suggested something more serious. Other Nexus cases appear to work in such a grey area too: among the examples Griffiths collected was a teenager of Caribbean descent deemed “at risk” of joining a gang, an Eritrean refugee convicted of “illegal working” and a homeless, alcoholic Bangladeshi man who stole a steak.A standard defence of Operation Nexus would be that visitors to the UK have to abide by its laws, and that people should not commit crimes. Yet it exists in a context where the fact of living in the UK without secure immigration status is being treated increasingly like a crime itself.This is happening in two ways. First, specific new crimes are being created: among their provisions, the 2014 and 2016 Immigration Acts introduced the offences of “illegal working” and “driving when unlawfully in the UK”. Behaviour that would previously have been treated as a bureaucratic irregularity is now the behaviour of a “foreign criminal”.Second, enforcing the hostile environment involves treating immigrants – and people who look or sound like they might be immigrants – as potential criminals. Immigration enforcement officers have been granted greater powers to stop and detain people on the street. The laws compelling landlords, bank clerks, NHS staff and university administrators to check prospective clients’ immigration status turn ordinary citizens into border guards, while data-sharing initiatives on schoolchildren (cancelled by the Department of Education in April after a public campaign) or NHS patients (partially suspended earlier this month) increase the state’s powers of surveillance.At the same time, it has become much harder to fight for the right to remain. Since 2012, people in the UK without status must live here for 20 years before they can apply for temporary leave to remain on the basis of “long residence” it would take around 30 years in total to receive indefinite leave. Fawaz, who arrived in the UK aged 14, would be in his mid-40s if he took this uncertain route. It has become much harder to win an immigration appeal on human-rights grounds after new guidelines were introduced. Fees for citizenship applications have soared (from £200 in 2002 for indefinite leave to remain, to £2,389 in 2018), while cuts to legal aid as part of the coalition government’s austerity measures forced the collapse of the two main providers of free immigration advice.But for all this effort, the removal figures for foreign-national offenders have not grown – they vary between around 5,000 and 6,000 a year. In 2014, the National Audit Office found that removing offenders cost £850m annually – and was hindered by poor administration and other countries not co-operating. Much like the other policies intended to make life difficult for unwanted immigrants, Operation Nexus aims to remove people, but ends up leaving many in a precarious and ultimately untenable position, as it has done to Fawaz: still in the country, but with their rights and ability to move freely severely limited.I visited Fawaz again at the gym on a weekday afternoon when it was almost empty. Fawaz and a friend were in the ring together. Every now and then Fawaz would shout out advice to his less-skilled partner: to keep his feet moving, to think about his centre of gravity, to anticipate his opponent’s next move so he could dodge it.“I’ll just take the punch,” said the friend through his mouthguard, in a moment of bravado.“Why?” asked Fawaz. “Don’t take a punch unless you’re prepared to sacrifice something for it.”Aware that I was watching, Fawaz began to expound his theory of boxing. “Power isn’t everything … I don’t waste all my energy, I play … I do salsa dancing – who said men can’t do feminine things?”Stonebridge Boxing Club, Fawaz told me, is what rescued him after his marriage broke down. He began training there properly three years ago, occasionally competing for amateur titles: he won the ABA London middleweight championship in 2017. “I don’t want to waste the essence I have in me,” he said, explaining how he was trying to conserve his energy until his citizenship status was resolved. “So I made a conscious choice to only fight once a year.” His latest interest outside boxing is making afrobeats music: Fawaz sings, while a friend produces. He posts Instagram stories of himself dancing and singing in the studio. “I’m not a lazy person, you know,” he cautioned.Towards the end of last year, a few months after an application to be considered stateless was rejected – again, the Home Office did not believe Fawaz when he said he wasn’t eligible for citizenship elsewhere – his resolve faltered. His depression came back, and he missed several of his weekly sign-in appointments at his local Home Office reporting centre. On 29 November, as Fawaz was on his way into the gym, the building was surrounded by police and he was arrested by immigration enforcement officers. He was kept overnight in Wembley police station, and then driven to a detention centre near Gatwick airport – where officials told Fawaz that they were preparing to deport him to Nigeria.The UK places nearly 30,000 people in immigration detention each year, of whom half are foreign-national offenders. Detaining immigrants is officially supposed to be used as a last resort – and only when there is a reasonable prospect of imminently removing someone from the country. A recent Amnesty International report found that immigration detention has now become a “routine” procedure, in which administrative mistakes were common but difficult to put right. Once someone has entered detention, the report found, they are often kept there “as a matter of convenience”. Around half are released back into the community, which suggests that many should not have been in there in the first place. But the number of people released on bail from detention – living in limbo, as Fawaz now does – has more than doubled since 2010, to nearly 4,000 last year.Fawaz was initially bullish when he described his time in detention, calling it a “clarification of the mind”. He said he had spent most of his time in the centre’s gym, or teaching himself how to play the piano. But it was obvious the experience had disturbed him. He said he had self-harmed several times while he was there – “not because I wanted to die but because it’s a relief for me” – and showed me marks on his wrists and forearms.“For the first week, I felt like my life was finished,” he said. “Like an abandoned kid again.” His spirits were lifted when his case made national news. “Even the security in there came up to me and said: ‘You’re famous, man, everyone’s talking about you.’” Some weeks later, a representative of the Nigerian high commission told officials working on Fawaz’s case that he was not their citizen. On 2 January, an immigration tribunal appeals judge released Fawaz on bail, back to his old life of weekly sign-ins.One evening at the end of January, Fawaz stepped on stage at Amnesty International’s events hall in east London. The audience had just watched Leon Gast’s documentary When We Were Kings, which tells the story of Muhammad Ali and George Foreman’s 1974 world heavyweight championship match in Zaire. The film still has a political charge: Ali and Foreman’s views on history, racism and the role that boxing plays in reclaiming black power sit uncomfortably next to contributions from Norman Mailer and George Plimpton, white American writers praising the physique of their black compatriots and shouting with glee as they fight in the ring.The politics of the film were especially resonant at this event: a monthly club hosted by Welcome Cinema and Kitchen, an organisation that brings refugees, asylum seekers and the public together for social events. Many of the attendees were living with precarious legal status, and had come to hear Fawaz talk about his own situation.Before the event, he had been entertaining children in the creche downstairs, showing off his title belts and cracking jokes as he posed for photos. But when he entered the hall and saw his picture projected on to a large screen, he gasped in surprise. Fawaz’s self-confidence is evident, but there is also a certain naivety that came from his upbringing: he told me that he had barely left the west London suburbs until his early 20s.Since being released from detention, with the prospect of being recalled at any moment, Fawaz now has three possible routes. The first is to make another application to the Home Office: his lawyers are considering options for an appeal, supported by the 100,000 signatories of the 38 Degrees petition. If that fails, he could still be deported, but this is unlikely, since Nigeria, which usually co-operates with the UK in deportations, has been firm in insisting he is not theirs. This leaves a third route: an endless limbo as the UK tries unsuccessfully to remove him, and facing destitution if the donations he gets from friends dry up. Many of the people in the Welcome Cinema audience risked finding themselves in similar situations some, perhaps, already were. This complex system for removing immigrants affects thousands of men, women and children in Britain today, yet as Melanie Griffiths points out in her research, it’s striking how recent a phenomenon it is.Although states practised banishment or transportation throughout much of history, this largely stopped in the 19th century with the rise of the nation state. In the UK, deportation was reintroduced by our first modern immigration restrictions, the 1905 Aliens Act. But it was only during the 1990s that it began to be used on a large scale – at first to remove failed asylum seekers, and now as a more general tool for immigration control.Operation Nexus is one of the most sensitive parts of this system most politicians would shrink from giving it proper scrutiny. Yet as Fawaz’s story suggests, it seems to offer little room for redemption, which is usually regarded as an important part of the criminal justice system. There is also a wider question about equality before the law: do certain people deserve to be punished twice for a crime, on the basis of their immigration status?The drive to make expulsions easier is also adding a chapter to Britain’s relationship with its former colonies: the UK is spending £700,000 to build a prison wing in Nigeria for deportees, and has offered to fund a maximum-security prison in Jamaica. Deportation charter flights, in which immigration detainees are removed en masse, now operate several times a year to West Africa and South Asia.Governments often try to make distinctions between good citizens and bad citizens – the welfare scroungers v the hard-working families – but the way Britain has hardened its borders has created a situation that many of us were unaware of until recently, in which people who have lived in this country for many years find their right to stay here permanently under question. Griffiths calls them “almost citizens”. I mentioned this to Fawaz: “That’s me!” he exclaimed. “You know when you chuck a leaf in a stream of water and you don’t know where it’s going, you just – I have no control over this now. At this point, it’s up to the Home Office to give me a chance. To say: yes you can stay.”Fawaz’s first name – Kelvin – is a nickname he acquired as a teenager. At our last meeting, I asked him where he had got it from. “I just made it up when I came here,” he told me. “Because I kept on telling people my name is Bilal Fawaz and they couldn’t pronounce it, so I said: ‘OK, my name is Kelvin.’ I wanted to sound more British. I took on the persona.”  Lights in the Distance: Exile and Refuge at the Borders of Europe by Daniel Trilling is published by Picador on 31 May, and is available to buy at bookshop.

It will be rebranded as the London and North Eastern Railway.The transport secretary, Chris Grayling, told the House of Commons that after a “finely balanced” assessment by civil servants, he had decided to appoint the “operator of last resort” – a group led by the firm Arup and under government control – to run the service, rather than allow Stagecoach and Virgin to continue under fresh terms.Grayling said: “The route continues to generate substantial returns for the government. It is not a failing railway ... However, Virgin and Stagecoach got their bids wrong.”He insisted taxpayers had not lost out, adding: “Only Vtec and its parent companies have made losses at this time ... We cannot expect companies to take on unlimited liabilities otherwise they would not bid for franchises.”Despite the firms now avoiding up to £2bn in premium payments after the failure of the franchise, Grayling said “it would not be reasonable to place conditions” on Stagecoach or Virgin bidding for further rail services. He said: “They have paid a high financial and reputational price.”Transport secretary Chris Grayling’s decision was surprising given his vehement opposition to public control of rail. But he said the move was partly to expedite the planned east coast partnership, which would see a contract re-let to a private firm in 2020. However, several train companies – such as South Western, TransPennine Express and Greater Anglia – face similar struggles to Stagecoach and Virgin after overbidding for franchises and events may yet force his hand again.\u0026nbspIt’s not the plan, but it’s possible. The pressure to avoid any further franchise collapse – or to see Stagecoach-Virgin emerge as operators again, with a diminishing market of bidders – could see the government struggle to get a new operator in place.\u0026nbspSo who will now run the trains?Control will pass in June to the “operator of last resort” – an Arup-led group contracted on the government’s behalf. The train service will be rebranded London North Eastern Railway.What will the impact be for passengers?In the short term, little or none. New British-assembled Hitachi trains are already on order, paid for by the government.\u0026nbspHow much will it cost the public?The Department for Transport assessment was that either immediate option, a fresh Virgin Trains contract or direct control, was broadly similar in cost. Analysis by rail regulators in 2013 found East Coast required less subsidy than any other line when in public hands, while it delivered more than £1bn to the Treasury. Stagecoach promised vastly more, £3.3bn by 2023, but found it impossible to pay up.However, the shadow transport secretary, Andy McDonald, said it was “absolutely ludicrous” to not place conditions on Virgin-Stagecoach’s bidding passport. He accused the government of having “cynically reprivatised” the line on the eve of the 2015 election, adding: “We’ve had bailout after bailout ... Rail companies win, passengers and taxpayers lose. Franchising remains at the heart of the alleged partnerships. No amount of tinkering can solve the failings of a broken privatised system where the public takes the risk and the companies take the profit – aided and abetted by the transport secretary.” The chair of the transport select committee, Lilian Greenwood, said the previous transport secretary, Patrick McLoughlin, had told the Commons in November 2014 that the promised £3.3bn for the taxpayer was robust and had been subjected to rigorous, independent scrutiny. “If Virgin-Stagecoach got their figures wrong, so did the government,” said Greenwood. She said the committee would be examining the latest failure.Greenwood asked Grayling in the Commons: “What does this decision today mean for other franchises which we know are struggling to meet their obligations?” He replied that there was no other franchise in the same position. However, industry analysts widely believe that First Group overbid for TransPennine Express, and Abellio for Greater Anglia, while a sharp drop in passenger numbers has also left First potentially exposed to losses on its South Western franchise. Labour has also questioned the future of Arriva’s Northern Rail franchise, whose service was the subject of renewed attack by Manchester’s mayor Andy Burnham on Wednesday. Grayling announced in November that the East Coast franchise would be terminated three years early in 2020, allowing the operators to avoid up to £2bn in payments until 2023. Lower passenger numbers and revenue than forecast have seen Stagecoach losing around £200m on the franchise to date.Lord Adonis, who resigned as the chairman of the National Infrastructure Commission in protest at what he called the bailout of the train firms at taxpayers’ expense, said Wednesday’s decision was “vindication” of his criticisms, and that Grayling had now done the right thing. Stagecoach’s chief executive, Martin Griffiths, said the firm was “surprised and disappointed” by the decision. He said in the last three years, Vtec had “attracted more passengers, greatly increased investment, achieved industry-leading customer satisfaction and made significant payments to the taxpayer to reinvest in public services”.The collapse of the franchise marks the third time in a decade that a private train operator has failed to see out its contract on the east coast mainline, which was renationalised between 2009 and 2015.Rail unions urged Grayling to keep the line in state hands. The RMT’s general secretary, Mick Cash, said: “This is the second time that the government have called upon the public sector to launch a rescue operation on the east coast and instead of being a temporary arrangement Chris Grayling should listen to his staff and the public and make it permanent.” Grayling said he had chosen to bring in the operator of last resort to expedite his plans to introduce a partnership model for the east coast railway from 2020, where a single team including Network Rail and a private train operator would take decisions on both track and trains on the route."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e3b7498bf90c5604d1ae943276631fb3692ae138/0_552_5220_3133/master/5220.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=880dba95a36c73bcbbe1de9517ac0339","title":"leo varadkar theresa may sofia brexit deal","story":"EU ‘yet to see anything that remotely approaches’ a solution to Irish border issue, taoiseach saysThe Irish taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, has raised the prospect of the UK crashing out of the EU without a deal if UK government infighting continues over the next few weeks.With the Brexit negotiations stalling and Theresa May failing to offer any further solutions to avoid a hard border between Northern Ireland and the republic, Varadkar made his growing concern clear before meeting the UK prime minister at an EU summit in the Bulgarian capital, Sofia.The taoiseach said next month’s European council summit would be a key moment for the talks, despite attempts by the Brexit secretary, David Davis, and others in the UK government to play down suggestions of a “deadline”.Inside the EU, both Ireland and Northern Ireland are part of the single market and customs union so share the same regulations and standards, allowing a soft or invisible border between the two.Britain’s exit from the EU – taking Northern Ireland with it – risks a return to a hard or policed border. The only way to avoid this post-Brexit is for regulations on both sides to remain more or less the same in key areas including food, animal welfare, medicines and product safety.Early drafts of the agreement Britain hoped to get signed off on Monday said there would be “no ergence” from EU rules that “support north-south cooperation”, later changed to “continued alignment” in a formulation that appeared to allow for subtle ergences.But it raised new questions about who would oversee it and how disputes might be resolved. It was also clearly still a step too far for the DUP.The European council president, Donald Tusk, is also due to meet the prime minister in Sofia.The disagreements within May’s cabinet at this late stage of negotiations have been described by sources as “shocking”.Varadkar said that the EU and Dublin had “yet to see anything that remotely approaches” a way out of the current impasse. The UK government has vowed to find an arrangement that will avoid the need for border checks between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland, and to table a “backstop” solution involving regulatory alignment with the EU.Varadkar said: “We need to have that backstop because that gives us the assurance that there will be no hard border on our island. So we stand by our position that there can be no withdrawal agreement without that backstop.“If the UK wants to put forward alternatives … we’re willing to examine that. But we need to see it written down in black and white and know that its workable and legally operable. And we’ve yet to see anything that remotely approaches that.”EU leaders are due to meet on 29 June, after which it is hoped in London that Brussels will start drafting a political declaration on a future trade deal. The UK government this week promised to produce a 100-page white paper on the future trading relationship. But the paper could be largely ignored at the summit unless the Irish question is solved to the satisfaction of Dublin and Brussels.Last month, Davis dismissed the June deadline as a negotiating tactic. “One of the things that happens in negotiations is people try to set up deadlines, sometimes artificial deadlines, to put pressure on one element of the negotiation which they think is in their favour,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c03c57bf0c8bcfd6d87aeaf3cd2ff1d2aee2072d/0_15_3619_2171/master/3619.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=953007b5fda8a7c63da123b915bc8b19","title":"vote leave strategist dominic cummings refuses to appear before mps","story":"Snub raises questions over powers to compel reluctant witnesses to face committeesThe chief strategist of the Vote Leave campaign has refused to appear in front of MPs, risking possible censure from the House of Commons but also raising questions about what more can be done when a witness ignores the will of parliament.Dominic Cummings, who has been credited as the brains behind the successful Brexit campaign, told the select committee investigating fake news that he would not be willing to answer questions in public before the Electoral Commission finishes its ongoing investigation into his campaign.The digital, culture, media and sport committee said this was not a valid excuse and issued a formal summons through parliament’s serjeant-at-arms, demanding that Cummings appear before it by the end of May. Cummings rejected this summons, angering MPs on the committee who wanted to ask questions about the use of Facebook data during the EU referendum campaign. The committee confirmed that Alexander Nix, the former boss of Cambridge Analytica, had accepted a formal summons to appear on 6 June.“We are disappointed that Dominic Cummings has not responded positively to our requests for him to appear,” said the committee’s chair, Damian Collins. “Reporting the matter to the house is a first step, which could result in a decision that a contempt of parliament has been committed, a very serious outcome for the inidual.”However, the refusal raises questions about the system of compelling reluctant witnesses to appear in front of parliament. It is the second time this week that a potential witness has turned down a formal summons to answer questions from MPs, after Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg turned down a request from the same committee.In theory, parliament has the power to issue fines or even threaten imprisonment for non-attendance. In reality, the system relies largely on consent, formal rebukes and the idea that iniduals can be shamed by the media into attending.Hannah White, of the Institute for Government, a thinktank, has previously said there are serious risks in issuing such summons if they are ignored. “Every time everyone observers the emperor has no clothes, in that parliament can’t force people to come, they lose a little bit of their authority.”Cummings, who will be played by Benedict Cumberbatch in a forthcoming TV drama about Brexit, published a blog this week in which he explained his decision, saying lawyers had told him to “keep my trap shut” until the Electoral Commission completes its investigation into Vote Leave this summer. He said he had been willing to give evidence to the committee after this date, but the MPs’ decision to issue a formal summons via the media showed their priority was “grandstanding PR, not truth-seeking”.Cummings said he believed select committees should have the legal power to compel witnesses to attend. However, since no such law was in place, he said, he would not now give evidence “under any circumstances”. The committee system needed reforming to include “processes that push them towards truth-seeking behaviour rather than the usual trivialising grandstanding,” he said. “So far the inquiry on fake news has helped spread fake news across the world.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a5a54a26e4b9e8175e046541e70ae2da5cb65541/0_420_4794_2876/master/4794.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1fd785b864755515a4e5b43aeba3c0df","title":"brexit may denies u turn amid reports uk could effectively stay in customs union after transition politics live","story":"Rolling coverage of the day’s political developments as they happenThese are from RTE’s Tony Connolly on the MayVaradkar bilateral in Sofia earlier.

The excellent Bridget Christie even once included a joke to that effect, mentioning the blog (and auto-eroticism - don’t ask) in her Radio 4 comedy show.But it turns out that, for the population as a whole, the last 12 months haven’t been so awful after all. The Office for National Statistics has today published its annual survey of wellbeing and it says that “average ratings of happiness and feeling that the things done in life are worthwhile have slightly increased in the UK”.But the headline conclusion is misleading. Scotland is getting happier, and that is why the overall UK figures have nudged up a bit. In England, Wales and Northern Ireland we’re no happier.Between the years ending December 2016 and 2017, improvements in worthwhile and happiness ratings in the UK were driven by Scotland, where average (mean) ratings also improved. Interestingly, average life satisfaction ratings also improved for Scotland however, there were no significant changes for ratings of anxiety. No overall changes were reported for any measure of personal well-being in England, Wales or Northern Ireland.Sadly, the ONS report doesn’t explain what was different about Scotland in 2017.The ONS tracks wellbeing by surveying people and looking at four measures: Are you satisfied with your life? Are the things you do worthwhile? How happy are you? And how anxious are you?Nicola Sturgeon has ruled out giving all prison inmates in Scotland the right to vote, rejecting a recommendation from Holyrood’s equalities committee earlier this week.Sturgeon was pressed to respond to its report at first minister’s questions on Thursday and hinted that she could back limited voting rights, which would not extend to those jailed for the “most serious and heinous crimes.”Scottish National party, Labour and Lib Dem MSPs on the committee said extending the franchise to all prisoners, regardless of sentence, would improve rehabilitation rates and reinstill a sense of citizenship amongst inmates. Two Tory MSPs on the committee opposed them.Sturgeon and the then first minister Alex Salmond had emphatically rejected calls for inmates to be given a vote in the 2014 independence referendum. Holyrood was subsequently given new powers over setting the rules for council, Holyrood and EU elections in 2016.Sturgeon said she accepted that meant Holyrood had to decide how it would implement numerous European court rulings that the UK’s total ban on prisoners voting breached the convention on human rights (ECHR). She added, however: I’m not of the view that this should lead to the enfranchising of all prisoners and I am, to say the least, sceptical that complying with the ECHR requires all prisoners to have the right to vote.Holyrood’s deep isions on this issue were highlighted when Murdo Fraser, a senior Scottish Tory, asked Sturgeon to agree John Muir, a victims campaigner whose son Damian was stabbed to death, who said it was an “obscenity” this was being considered.Sturgeon sympathised, but John Finnie, a former SNP MSP and former policeman now with the Scottish Greens, told her Scotland should strive to match the progressive stance of Nordic countries which had substantial voting rights for prisoners.Dominic Cummings, campaign director for Vote Leave during the EU referendum campaign, is on course to be found guilty of a contempt of parliament. The Commons culture committee has been asking him to give evidence to its fake news inquiry, he has been saying no (or at least, not now), and today the committee has announced that it will report him to the Commons for contempt of parliament.But Alexander Nix, the former Cambridge Analytica boss who was also refusing invitations to appear, has now, having been issued with a summons, agreed that he will appear before the committee, on Wednesday 6 June.Damian Collins, the committee chair, said:We are disappointed that Dominic Cummings has not responded positively to our requests for him to appear. His reasoning that he must delay giving evidence due to ongoing investigations simply does not hold up, considering that Alexander Nix, Jeff Silvester and others involved have agreed to cooperate with the committee’s investigations despite currently being subject to various investigations.Reporting the matter to the House is a first step which could result in a decision that a contempt of parliament has been committed, a very serious outcome for the inidual.After the matter gets formally reported to the House, the committee of privileges has to investigate. If it decides Cummings is guilty of a contempt (and it is hard to see why it shouldn’t), it will get MPs to pass a motion censuring him. This happened two years ago when two former News International executives were found in contempt of parliament for misleading a committee.Collins says being found guilty of contempt would be “a very serious outcome” for Cummings. On this point, he is probably wrong.It was different in the past when people could get fined, or even imprisoned, for contempt. This is from a report (pdf) on the topic published six years ago.The Houses’ power to punish non-members for contempt is untested in recent times. In theory, both Houses can summon a person to the bar of the House to reprimand them or order a person’s imprisonment. In addition, the House of Lords is regarded as possessing the power to fine non-members. The House of Commons last used its power to fine in 1666 and this power may since have lapsed.In 1978 the House of Commons resolved to exercise its penal jurisdiction as sparingly as possible and only when satisfied that it was essential to do so in order to provide reasonable protection for the House, its members or its officers from improper obstruction or interference with the performance of their functions. Since that resolution, the Commons has not punished a nonmember. There is no equivalent resolution in the House of Lords, but the House has not punished a non-member since the nineteenth century.The Commons has not locked anyone up for contempt since the 19th century and, even if the power still exists in theory, lawyers argue it would be hard to square with the Human Rights Act. It also has not summoned any non-MP to the bar of the Commons for a reprimand since this happened to the Sunday Express editor John Junor in 1957 - although, if this were to happen to Cummings, this would make a good scene when Benedict Cumberbatch plays him in the Brexit drama.Being found guilty of contempt does have a reputational impact, and that is why Nix probably agreed to appear before the committee after being summoned, as did Rupert Murdoch seven years ago. But Murdoch and Nix are both business figures, operating in an environment where adherence with regulatory standards is seen as important. Cummings is best known as a political adviser famous for wanting to disrupt the establishment. Cummings and “contempt of parliament”? It is not so much a punishment as a description of his mindset.My colleague Jennifer Rankin says EU sources have their concerns about the UK government’s reported plan to effectively extend customs union membership.Here is my colleague Robert Booth’s story on the Judith Hackitt review of building regulations published this morning in response to the Grenfell Tower fire.Hackitt did not recommend an outright ban on the use of combustible material for cladding.But James Brokenshire, the housing secretary, who is making a statement on this to MPs now, has just said that the government will consult on banning combustible cladding.But John Healey, the shadow housing secretary, said a consultation was not enough.

Named after Alfred Russel Wallace, the 19th-century explorer and naturalist who traversed this area, it hosts floras and faunas that are incredibly rich and often include species found nowhere else on Earth. The natural history of Wallacea is complicated, and heavily dictated by geological forces such as plate tectonics and volcanism. As the oldest and largest island within Wallacea, Sulawesi (formerly known as Celebes) hosts a rich fauna with a large number of species that are unique to the island. Although its fauna is predominantly Asian in origin, it is the only island in south-east Asia with marsupials (the bear cuscus and dwarf cuscus), a typical Australian element. In addition, it hosts the smallest primate in the world, the tarsus tarsier, which fits in the palm of your hand. You can find miniature buffaloes, or anoas, whose lovable appearance is said to hide an aggressive demeanour. And there are wild pigs, babirusas, with wrinkled skin and impressive upper tusks that instead of growing down, grow up and backwards toward the skull. (According to Wallace, some old writers supposed that the tusks served as hooks, so that the animal could rest its head on a branch.)Wallace was puzzled by the origin of Sulawesi’s unusual fauna, and the stark difference between Sulawesi and its closest neighbouring island, Borneo. In his seminal work The Malay Archipelago from 1869, Wallace noted that there seemed very little affinity between many of Sulawesi’s birds and mammals and those in other parts of the world. This led him to propose that Sulawesi perhaps represented “a rather ancient land”, and that its unique fauna had its origin “in a remote antiquity”. Shaped like a giant “K” with four arms pointing in different directions, the geological history of Sulawesi is complicated. The island is a composite of several fragments of land that, over time, were driven into each other as they sat atop continental plates headed for collision. Some of these fragments are thought to be rather old, possibly dating as far back as the Cretaceous. Such an old origin for parts of Sulawesi would explain its unique biota and high species richness species would have rafted along on these fragments from worlds since long lost (a process known as vicariance). However, others have argued that much of Sulawesi’s flora and fauna originated more recently, and not through vicariance, but through over-water dispersal of species from Asia and Australia in the last 15m years. In particular, the emergence of new land from the ocean floor in the last 5m years would have increased land area and would have formed important connections between the island’s different regions that had remained isolated up until then. Such a recent increase in land area would have significantly affected the spread and evolution of animals and plants across the island. Now, with the help of molecular technologies such as ancient DNA, it is possible to test hypotheses regarding the origin and evolution of endemic species that were previously impossible to test. Laurent Frantz of Queen Mary University of London and a large team of geologists, biologists and molecular biologists set out to reconstruct the population history of three of Sulawesi’s enigmatic land mammals: the babirusa (Babyrousa), the Sulawesi warty pig (Sus celebensis) and the anoa, a dwarf buffalo (Bubalus). To do this, they collected genetic data of specimens of Sulawesi warty pigs, anoas and babirusas representing populations from different parts of Sulawesi. These data were then used to see if, and how, the spread of these three mammals across the island was affected by changes in the island’s past geography. The genetic data (mitochondrial DNA and microsatellite data) for the Sulawesi warty pig specimens show that populations from different parts of the island erged from an ancestral population that lived around 2.19m years ago. For the babirusa, the most recent common ancestor for all specimens was found to be at 2.49m years ago. Palaeontological evidence indicates that the babirusa may have colonised Sulawesi as early as 13m years ago, but these new data indicate that it did not spread out across the island until much later. The fact that modern babirusas and Sulawesi warty pigs ersified from their respective ancestral populations and spread across the island at roughly the same point in time suggests their spread was in response to a shared trigger. In contrast, anoas ersified 1.06m years ago, and this suggests that anoas colonised the island at a later point in time. To pinpoint the most likely geographical origin of expansion for each species, Frantz and colleagues then plotted the rate of molecular ersity for each sample of anoa, babirusa and Sulawesi warty pig on new reconstructions depicting changes in Sulawesi’s land area for the last 5m years. The underlying assumption here is that as animals spread from their origin, genetic ersity in these travelling packs decreases. The degree of ersity thus becomes a measure for how far a species has dispersed from its original centre. For the Sulawesi warty pig and babirusa, their most likely origin was in the east central region of Sulawesi. Anoas seem to have originated from the west central region instead. These areas did not form dry land until the late Pliocene to late Pleistocene, and their inferred geographical origins are thus consistent with the latest geological reconstructions of Sulawesi. When the researchers looked at population structure within the three mammal species, there was clear genetic and morphological differentiation between populations in different regions of the island. These regions overlap with zones of endemism previously identified for primates, toads and lizards. This pattern is particularly strong in Sulawesi’s northern arm, which was isolated from the rest of the island until the last 1m years. Now, after almost 150 years, it seems that scientists are finally coming to a solution for Sulawesi’s curious problems. Although the island’s ancient geological history set the stage, this new study shows how rather recent changes in land area affected the spread and population structure of three of Sulawesi’s land mammals. Furthermore, the pattern emerging is that not only land mammals but also birds, insects and plants were affected by these events as well. Wallace would have been pleased, but as the authors of the study point out, many aspects of Sulawesi’s natural history remain to be solved.Frantz, L.A.F., et al. 2018 Synchronous ersification of Sulawesi’s iconic artiodactyls driven by recent geological events.

The fly-half is being released by Wasps at the end of the season but instead of making an expected lucrative move to France, he is taking a pay-cut to put himself in contention for next year’s World Cup after his international career was revived last week.Eddie Jones had ignored Cipriani for more than two years, with the England coach not seeing him as a starter ahead of George Ford and Owen Farrell and not wanting to risk souring the mood in the squad by harbouring a perceived recalcitrant tackle bag holder.He used to tire of questions about Cipriani when they were raised during his first six months in charge, but a grand slam and a 3-0 series victory in Australia in 2016 subdued interest in one of rugby’s mavericks.Cipriani’s call-up last week was his first by England since 2015. There was a belief then that he had been recalled to show why he had been overlooked for so long, but his cameo in defeat in Paris in a friendly just before the squad for the World Cup was announced meant his omission did not go unquestioned.By joining Gloucester, Cipriani is looking to make up for lost time and salvage an international career that in 2008 looked destined to be a long one. He never settled down, leaving Wasps for the Rebels in Melbourne and international exile after falling out with the then England management, returning to Sale before rejoining Wasps, who after two seasons decided not to renew his contract at the end of the season.Cipriani has a reputation for being difficult, of questioning his coaches incessantly. One coach said earlier this season he had never seen a more naturally talented fly-half but had also not dealt with a player who was so high-maintenance. Asked to explain, he said that Cipriani would challenge coaches throughout a training session rather than pick his moment, to the point where his fellow players would urge him to shut up. It may explain his short stays at each club he has been involved with, an asset on the field who did not fit in, but whose fault is that?Does that comes down to Cipriani or the game rugby union has become? Is there no place in it for someone who is not cowed by authority? Is the relationship between coach(es) and player(s) that of schoolteacher and pupil or lecturer and student? How tight is the rein? Has it become a game only for conformists?Jones has not called on Cipriani to satisfy himself that he had been right to ignore him until now. England’s attack needs rebooting and at the end of the Six Nations Jones dropped Ford for only the second time (the other occasion, the first Test in Australia in 2016, saw him summoned from the bench after less than 30 minutes).Jones pondered aloud last week whether Ford is given enough licence at Leicester to trust his instinct, the quality he wants most in his fly-half. Cipriani has long played what is in front of him, making him an ideal fit for Wasps, who are at their most dangerous from turnover possession, and also for Gloucester whose coach, Johan Ackermann, encourages his players to back their judgment.He would not have fitted in so comfortably in Jones’s England for the first two years and a Six Nations where play was more structured, and Ford was encouraged to lie flat and take the ball to the line. Jones said one reason he had omitted Cipriani was the fly-half’s tendency to run laterally, but that is a hallmark of 10s through the ages.Phil Bennett was a prime example but as he made his way across a field defenders knew he possessed the ability to sidestep in a flash and that if they fanned out expecting a pass, he would be away. Yes modern defences are different but what England have missed from Ford in the last 18 months is the running threat Farrell provides for Saracens when the opportunity is there.Jones knows England have to speed up their game, from delivery at the breakdown to decision-making and passing. They need to be sharper and more reactive. Which is where Cipriani comes in: if he needs England to ensure his career does not have an anti-climactic end, England need the difference he provides as the game becomes less structured.How will Jones respond to his methods being questioned? Cipriani fell out with the managements of the two other England regimes he was involved in: first in 2009 when after a reported disagreement with the attack coach Brian Smith at a training camp in Portugal he was left out of the squad, hastening his move to Australia, and in 2015 when the Rugby Football Union confirmed he had had a disagreement (“robust conversation”) with the skills coach Mike Catt in training. And he was floored by Josh Lewsey during a Wasps session in 2008.Cipriani is unlikely to change, and why should he? As the game becomes faster and, generally, more open, players who can wing it have an increasing value. Jones has armed himself with an experienced eye from the outside and the talk will not be one-way. Nor should it be but Cipriani also has to listen. He spoke to the media for 30 minutes on Tuesday, relaxed, self-deprecating at times, and good humoured.And assured. Others have reached a conclusion Cipriani had drawn long ago but it is not ability that has reduced his flow of caps to a trickle, never mind questions about his defence. It is others’ opinion of his attitude, not aptitude, that has held him back. It would not have mattered in the amateur era when the game was more for players and having called on him, Jones’s man-management will determine whether the outsider gets in the side and, as his talent warrants, influences Test rugby.• This is an extract taken from our weekly rugby union email, the Breakdown.

However on a mild, overcast morning and coughing from a heavy cold, she found the step up beyond her as the feisty young Latvian ground out a 2-6, 6-3, 6-4 win in front of the packed marble steps on the ridiculously beautiful Court Pietrangeli.Konta broke her fingernail (on her bag) then Ostapenko’s serve in a bizarre opening to their second Tour encounter. After a brief delay to repair the digit, she was blasting the fifth seed off the court, and looked to be within sight of an early finish as her opponent complained of dizziness.Ostapenko got her first break point at the start of the second set – and Konta survived four deuces, saving a second break point with her fourth ace in the longest struggle of the match – but the world No 6 powered on to level at a set apiece.Konta has not beaten anyone in the top bracket since the then world No 2 Simona Halep at Wimbledon last year. She always puts the best possible face on setbacks but, having lost in the first round of the French Open three years on the spin, she needs to reassess over the next week and a half. She did hit 11 aces here and some of her groundstrokes were unreachable but she was agitated at the end, unhappy with a time violation, while the underlying problem appeared to be her dip in concentration. Her backhand could do with some attention, too.She held to love to stay in the match but Ostapenko’s shaky serve stood up (after she threw in a seventh double fault) and the 20-year-old forced a final wayward forehand out of Konta after two and a quarter hours.As Bob Dylan sang in Visions Of Johanna: “We sit here stranded, though we’re all doin’ our best to deny it.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d554ac3c733785e1d1619c9182db49d749637adf/282_617_4731_2839/master/4731.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6c735ca43ed6a1bdb7bd42553d3f6a53","title":"how can i stop an unexpected windows 10 update","story":"Celia’s working day was almost ruined after she was caught out by an enforced update. Can she stop it happening again?Yesterday, I intended to take my laptop to visit a client, but when I was about to set off, yup, I couldn’t turn it off without allowing Microsoft to do its upgrades. We all know how long that takes, and I had a train to catch, so I ended up having to wing the whole presentation.The infuriating thing is that I knew there was an upgrade around, so I had checked the power settings that morning to see if one was waiting to be installed. There was no update at 9am. Somehow Microsoft snuck it in without my noticing.I do understand that people need to install updates, but can’t Microsoft give us an escape route? This is my computer and my software and my business, so please can you trust me, just this once? CeliaIt’s easy to be caught out by Windows updates, and I once left the house carrying an open laptop, confident that the update would finish long before the battery ran down.However, there is a fundamental ide between consumer and business versions of Windows. With consumer versions, such as Windows 10 Home, Microsoft takes a paternalistic view of updates: it tries to do what’s best for people who don’t know what they are doing. Business versions – Windows 10 Pro and the Enterprise and Education editions – are designed to allow IT departments and knowledgeable customers more control. That includes ways to defer some updates for a week, a month or even a year.Many update problems stem from business people using consumer version of Windows, and this is understandable for sole traders and companies that are too small to employ IT staff. I don’t even think the extra features in Windows 10 Pro – BitLocker, Hyper-V, Remote Desktop etc – would be much use to people in your position. However, it doesn’t cost much to upgrade, and could be worth it if being able to delay upgrades helped you win a new client.Otherwise, Microsoft has a Windows Update FAQ and a help page with a troubleshooter that you can download to help fix update problems.Laptops that are only used intermittently seem more likely to receive forced updates. Microsoft tries to download updates in the background without users being interrupted or even aware that it’s happening. If you have an always-on desktop PC, the process is almost completely reliable. If you use a laptop for intense work then shut it down when you stop, there aren’t many gaps for updates to be downloaded and installed. You can help by setting your laptop to stay awake for an hour or two while it’s charging.You can also pre-empt some inconvenient upgrades by looking for them.Set aside an hour each week to clean up your PC, tidy away files, check your backups and perhaps run an extra virus scan with something like Malwarebytes Free. During your housekeeping session, run the Settings (cogwheel) app, click “Update \u0026amp Security” and see if any updates are pending. If there are, you can either install them or click “Advanced options” and pick a time and date when you want them installed. If there aren’t, click the button that says “Check for updates” and see if it finds any.Your PC may appear to be up-to-date, but a search may find updates marked “pending install” or “pending restart”. After you’ve installed those, check again, because there may be even more updates to install. If you need a lot of updates, they tend to come in batches, not all at once.Pay particular attention after the second Tuesday of each month – “Patch Tuesday” – when Microsoft usually releases security fixes.Microsoft is updating almost 700m PCs running Windows 10, and it doesn’t try to update all of them at once. By checking for updates, you can jump the queue and install them at your preferred time, not when Microsoft’s update servers get around to it.When you have a restart pending, the Settings app provides two options: “Restart now” and “Schedule the restart”. Choose to schedule it and you can enter a date and time for the restart, which means you can put it off for up to six days.Also click on “Advanced options” on the same Settings screen, and select the last option: “We’ll show a reminder when we’re going to restart. If you want to see more notifications about restarting, turn this on.” Instead of simply restarting at the time you entered, Windows 10 will ask again, enabling you to delay it again.Windows 10 lets you set “Active hours” in the Windows Update section of the Settings app. Click on “Change active hours” to set the times when you usually use your PC. You can reserve 18 hours out of 24 for work. Microsoft will generally not update your PC during these times.If you are using your PC, you should get a “Heads up” notification to tell you that a restart is pending. You can either hit “Restart now” or “View settings” and select a time and date for the restart.I suspect that Microsoft did once restart my PC during my active hours, after I left it unattended for a couple of hours, so always save any work-in-progress beforehand. It takes less than a second to hit Ctrl-S.Microsoft knows that not everyone has unlimited broadband, so it allows for “metered connections”. By default, Windows 10 sets ethernet wired and wireless networks to non-metered, and mobile connections to metered. People who have capped broadband and unlimited mobile broadband could switch these around, but the defaults suit most users.If you have a metered connection, Windows Update will only download priority updates automatically, so it will be up to you to download the others. Setting both connections to metered will limit the amount of data Microsoft downloads, making you less likely to get a major update when you don’t expect one.To set metered connections, run the Settings app, click on “Network \u0026amp Internet” and then select “Change connection properties”.Frankly, I don’t think setting metered connections offers enough benefits to be worth the effort, but some people may find it useful.The business and professional versions of Windows 10 provide more control, even to people who are not IT experts. For example, the advanced options page in the Settings app includes an extra control, Pause Updates. This prevents any updates from being installed for the next week, though when the time is up, you cannot pause it again.If you have Windows 10 Pro, this is the simplest solution to the Windows update problem. You can simply install all available updates on (say) a Sunday then pause updates during your working week.The business versions of Windows also include Group Policies, which allow IT managers to control how their fleets of PCs work. However, you can edit them manually. Type edit group policy in the Windows search box and run the editor (gpedit.msc), then look for Windows Update in the Administrative Templates section, under Computer Configuration. The default setting is “3 – Download the updates automatically and notify when they are ready to be installed”. You can change it to “2 – Notify for download and notify for install”. That will reduce the chances of Windows 10 installing downloads when you’re not ready for them.GPEdit also allows you to defer “quality updates” for up to 30 days, and “feature updates” for up to 365 days. This is useful for businesses that need to test applications before installing updates. It doesn’t prevent your PC from restarting to install security updates, but usually this doesn’t take very long.Windows geeks know that you can do all sorts of things with its Administrative Tools. For example, double-click Services, and find Windows Update in the list. Yes, you can control how this service starts up, and you can stop it from running until you next reboot Windows. People shouldn’t mess with Services unless they know what they are doing. However, a small utility called Winaero Tweaker provides easy access to all sorts of tweaks, one of which is Disable Windows 10 Updates. This is not something I recommend, but there are times when it could be a useful short-term expedient.At least Winaero Tweaker is safer than people changing Services or editing the Windows registry directly, where ignorance can lead to unfortunate results.Have you got a question?

One day Infinity War is smashing box office records to shreds, and you’re telling yourself that comic book adaptations have never been in better shape. The next you’re reading that DC is going to make an entire series based on Batman’s butler, and it makes you want to travel back in time and murder whoever invented comic books in the first place.Pennyworth is a 10-part Epix series about how Alfred the butler came to be. Set in 1960s London, it’s about a former SAS soldier who starts a secret business with Thomas Wayne before the latter’s notorious mugging and death. On paper, a whole series dedicated to the origin story of a peripheral Batman character seems dangerously niche. Surely there can’t be that many people clamouring to see a show that painstakingly explains how one man got to be so good at removing cloches. But, hey, Pennyworth might be great. And if it is, I’ve got first dibs on six more needless origin stories.So forgotten by The Avengers that he didn’t even appear in the last film, Hawkeye has become a cultural punchline of epic proportions. What could redress the balance better than an origin series devoted to explaining how a normal boy named Clint Barton could ever justify joining the ranks of an all-powerful superhero league. Episodes will revolve around other times that Barton had ideas above his station growing up, like the time he realised he was OK at tennis so immediately entered Wimbledon, the time he realised he was marginally above average at the piano and booked a concert at Carnegie Hall, and the time he made a paper airplane and basically thought it was the same thing as having a quantum engineering doctorate. Jacob Marley is dead. We never find out how he died in A Christmas Carol, though, which means he’s a prime candidate for an origin story. In Marley we meet Jake Marley, a cool cat who wears sunglasses and drives red cars. Every episode Jake encounters a situation that might kill him and turn him into a ghost, and the fun is seeing whether it does or not. Episode one: Jake puts a step ladder on a polished coffee table and tries to paint a ceiling. Episode two: Jake eats some chicken that’s still a bit pink in the middle. You get the idea. It is the year 1975, and the peaceful town of Amity Island has been thrown into chaos by a series of deadly shark attacks. When police chief Brody attempts to close the beaches, mayor Larry Vaughn stands in his way, citing the island’s tourism-based economy. When did Mayor Larry Vaughn get so short-sighted? And where did he buy that suit with all the anchors on it? Vaughn tells the story of how mayor Larry Vaughn came to that suit with all the anchors on it, and not really any of the shark stuff.Remember that scene in Quantum of Solace where Daniel Craig sits on a motorbike, while an extra behind him does the world’s least convincing job of sweeping up? What’s his story? How did he come to be a sweep when he doesn’t even know that brooms are supposed to make contact with the ground. In Bad Sweep we follow his story all through Sweep School, where he’s repeatedly beaten and tortured for his compulsive misunderstanding of how brooms work. Can he get through school and realise his dream? You know he can.Journalism is in crisis. Circulation is dwindling, redundancies raze offices into shadows of their former selves and Facebook keeps sapping media outlets of much-needed advertising income.

Everyone is welcome.Inside, in a study bathed by the afternoon sunshine, Wael Hussein, a 24-year-old gay man, is chatting with Naya, a transgender woman, ahead of International Day Against Homophobia, Transphobia and Biphobia (IDAHOTB) on Thursday. Behind the two is a bookcase filled with donated titles, including Les Amantes by French lesbian writer Jocelyne François. “This is my other home, I consider people here as my family,” says Wael. “Many come to find friends – outside, they find it difficult to be accepted.” Compared with other countries in the Middle East, such as Iran where homosexuality is punishable by death, Lebanon has a relatively thriving LGBT community. During a recent dinner at Em Nazih, a trendy cafe in Beirut’s Gemmayze district, stereos blared the indie rock band Mashrou’ Leila, whose frontman is Muslim and openly gay.But life is not without its hazards. On Wednesday Hadi Damien, the organiser of Beirut Pride, the only event of its kind in the Arab world, announced the festival had been suspended after authorities interrogated him and threatened him with prosecution. A roster of events that would have featured poetry readings, a storytelling night and a talk on sexual health had been cancelled, he said.For those still facing discrimination, obstruction, and even violence, Helem is a lifeline. “I’ve been coming here for a year now. I’m alone and I come here to talk to people,” says Suzy, a 41-year-old trans woman with a bruised left eye sitting on the organisation’s balcony. “Two weeks ago, I was in the disco. Two people riding on a motorbike stopped and punched me in the eye, stole my bag, money and my phone.”Wael joined Helem (which means “dream” in Arabic) two and half years ago as a volunteer before becoming one of only three paid staff seven months ago. He is a case worker, dealing mainly with those who have fallen foul of Lebanon’s infamous article 534, which criminalises “unnatural sexual acts”.In his bag he now carries a mobile phone that serves as a 24-hour emergency hotline. But the work is not all about crises. Wael also runs makeup workshops. “Some people have just found out about their gender identity, and they are intrigued to use makeup to intensify it, like trans women,” he says. “It makes me smile. When they see themselves in the mirror, their eyes start shining and what they can see in the mirror, they feel this person looks much more like the way they see themselves.”Helem was set up as an underground movement nearly 20 years ago and, despite never having received official registration by the authorities, has clung to life. The authorities neither rejected nor approved the request, said Genwa Samhat, Helem’s executive director, in a sign that meant “‘we won’t reject you but we will make your work really hard that you’d eventually stop’. But on the contrary we just kept on working.”Since then Helem’s reputation has spread beyond Lebanon throughout the Arab world and several similar organisations have been set up, including the NGO Shams in Tunisia, fighting for the decriminalisation of homosexuality. Afsaneh Rigot of British human rights group Article 19 said Helem was “an important and necessary LGBTQ oasis in the Middle East and North Africa region” and “a refuge for some of the most marginalised people in Lebanon”. But progress has not been straightforward. When Samhat, 31, joined four years ago, the organisation was almost moribund. Her arrival coincided with a Lebanese security forces raid on a local bathhouse, the Hammam al-Agha, which resulted in the arrests of 36 people.“When I joined, it was a trial to see if things would work again or not. Helem had lost its community centre, its offices, all of its funds. It had zero dollars in its bank account,” says Samhat. “It felt impossible at one point to get this going again, but with the Hammam Agha raid it was my first incident with such an arrest file … and it was a major push to try to do something about it.”Most of the people rounded up in the raid were sent to the Hbeish detention centre, and Helem’s ensuing work highlighted torture there. Such physical mistreatment appears now to have stopped. Today, at least 17 people are detained in Hbeish, mostly transgender people.“Trans people face the most discrimination – they’re visible,” Samhat said. “They were mostly arresting trans women who never ever got the opportunity to find a job, who were kicked out of their family houses, they were homeless for a long period of time, who actually dropped out of school because they were bullied at some point. We believe in personal freedoms and if people choose to be sex workers, it’s their right and we will defend them, but we do have to realise a lot of people do it out of survival reasons.”Naya, 21, heads Helem’s seven-member trans committee and says it is serving as an umbrella that makes people like her “feel stronger and let us make things we couldn’t do before – like offering hormones”. The organisation also provides more essential help. Aside from the study, there are places to sleep, a bathroom and a kitchen with basic appliances – a fridge, a gas stove and a washing machine. Its sister organisation, the sexual health clinic Marsa, provides free HIV tests, and charges $100 (£74) for comprehensive screening including for chlamydia and gonorrhea. Nearly 260 people visit Marsa each month – of whom two or three on average test positive for HIV. Back at Helem, Joseph Aoun, 33, is busy working on Helem’s campaigning week before IDAHOTB. He used to be the manager of Bardo, Beirut’s most famous gay bar, before joining Helem, an experience he says has opened his eyes to the discrimination faced by those from deprived social backgrounds.“It’s a constant struggle against the odds,” he says. “You have a lot of frustration but when you look back you see you’re impacting people’s lives and this is beautiful.”This year, IDAHOTB coincides with Ramadan, and Dana Darwish, a transgender lesbian, plans to go to Helem for iftar, the evening meal that breaks the daily fast during the holy month. “Islam is the religion of peace,” said the 31-year-old. “Helem makes iftar every week and it’s a wonderful feeling that this year Ramadan falls on the same day as IDAHOTB.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9780f4ae2d11d4e335e8714494f324a59ccca6db/0_187_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=04153bafd88518e901f6056de08cbad5","title":"burundi referendum presidential powers tensions high","story":"Opponents say proposals including extending term limit are an attempt to steal powerOpposition politicians in Burundi have urged voters to peacefully resist an effort by authorities to “steal power” in a referendum that some fear could spark widespread violence.Burundians are being asked to vote yes or no to a proposal to extend the presidential term from five years to seven, which would allow the incumbent, Pierre Nkurunziza, to rule for up to 14 more years after his current term expires in 2020.A yes vote would also boost the president’s powers and allow changes to the distribution of top government posts according to ethnicity. Critics fear this will upset a delicate balance between communities that has preserved peace since the end of a civil war. Tensions have been running high for months amid a wave of alleged detentions and killings of the government’s perceived opponents. At least 26 people were killed in an attack in the north-western province of Cibitoke on Friday. It is unclear whether the massacre was politically motivated.Aimé Magera, a spokesman for the National Liberation Forces (FNL), an opposition party, said campaigners for a no vote had made a “massive breakthrough” in recent days. “The people have overcome their fear and come out in huge numbers. We are going to resist right to the end,” he said. “We will show to the international community that the Burundian people are awake and standing and need help.”Government officials described long queues of voters waiting “in calm and serenity”. The electoral commission said the vote represented a “historic rendezvous with democracy and the consolidation of national sovereignty”.Opposition officials said they would ask voters to remain at polling stations after voting, even if the authorities deployed police and even the military to clear them from the streets.The EU and the US have denounced intimidation, repression and harassment of opposition supporters. Magera said: “We have been beaten, threatened, harassed and attacked. So many have been arrested it is impossible to count.”Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch have repeatedly documented widespread abuses by security forces and government-sponsored organisations.Burundi’s Catholic bishops have said many citizens “live in fear, so much so that people do not dare to say what they think for fear of reprisals”.Burundi’s government has said the charges are malicious propaganda spread by exiles. Last week it suspended BBC broadcasts in the country for six months, accusing the corporation of spreading ideas that discredited the president. Voice of America broadcasts were also suspended. Yves-Lionel Nubwacu, a presidential aide, told the : “The campaign has been free and contested. All different opinions have been represented on the airwaves … and some of the officials of these international organisations that have been so critical are far from objective.” Nkurunziza, a former teacher and rebel leader who is the son of a Hutu father and a Tutsi mother, has been in power since 2005. A born-again Christian who won some support with public displays of faith, he was re-elected unopposed in 2010 after the opposition boycotted the vote. In 2015 he triggered a crisis by pursuing a third term. More than 1,000 people have died and more than 400,000 have fled the country since.SOS Medias Burundi, a network of independent journalists, reported the arrests of more than 50 members of the opposition coalition Amizero y’Abarundi in a single week last month. Amnesty International has highlighted the case of Germain Rukuki, a human rights activist who was sentenced to 32 years in prison on charges that included rebellion.Richard Moncrieff, a regional specialist with the International Crisis Group, said: “In the short term there are only pockets of violence and serious human rights abuse … but in the medium to long term the government is unravelling the settlement that ended the civil war, and that does not augur well.”Ben Shepherd, an expert in the region at London’s Chatham House, said that “one big unanswered question” was the level of popularity of Nkurunziza, an evangelical Christian how has cultivated a folksy image, in rural areas.“There’s a sense that the ruling party has been seen as fighting the good fight for Burundi’s rural poor,” Shepherd said. Some analysts say they are worried by a growing theocratic mindset among members of the political elite.Other proposed constitutional changes include the appointment of a prime minister by the president, which would consolidate the position of the ruling party and could prevent some opposition politicians from running for office.Members of the Imbonerakure, the ruling party’s youth wing, have in the past urged supporters to harass opposition members and even to “impregnate” them, and are alleged to have threatened those who appeared unlikely to vote in the referendum.The ruling party’s secretary general blamed western powers for destabilising Burundi and said those who voted against the proposed changes to the constitution were “enemies of the nation”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c188dbf757c8cb3fc77228d61bf1293b54d24563/0_200_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f1a66e99f38efb09ee07d4759eee635b","title":"israeli airstrikes target militant sites in gaza","story":"Israel says strikes were in response to machine gun fire that hit a building in SderotThe Israeli military has said it has carried out airstrikes on what it described as militant sites in Gaza in response to machine gun fire that hit a building in the Israeli city of Sderot.The army said planes bombarded a military compound and a weapons production facility in the northern Gaza Strip overnight on Thursday.The Palestinian health ministry said a man was moderately wounded by shrapnel. It did not say whether he had been at a militant site or nearby.The airstrikes came hours after Israeli forces came under fire from within the Palestinian territory. The military said no troops were wounded in Wednesday’s exchange.On Monday Israeli fire killed almost 60 Palestinians who were protesting along the Gaza border as a ceremony was held in Jerusalem to mark the transfer of the US embassy from Tel Aviv to the city.Tens of thousands of people have been protesting along Gaza’s border with Israel since 30 March, calling for Palestinian refugees to be allowed to return to their homes now inside Israel. The weeks of mass protests and clashes along the border may now be reaching an end as the Muslim holy month of Ramadan begins.The death toll on Monday led to international condemnations of Israel and calls for an independent investigation. Israel has rejected those calls, saying its actions are necessary to stop mass infiltrations from the Palestinian enclave. It has accused Hamas, with whom it has fought three wars since 2008, of seeking to use the demonstrations as cover to carry out violence. Hamas has denied Israeli claims that it orchestrated the demonstrations, saying it supports them but that they were organised independently.Friday, the day when the protests usually peak, will be a key test of whether the current round of unrest will continue on any level. The demonstrations were initially meant to end on 15 May but Hamas officials have said they want them to continue.Arab foreign ministers are to hold an extraordinary meeting on Thursday in Cairo to discuss the border violence.

They since climbed to 2.5m barrels.Maersk Tankers operates more than 160 vessels and employs 3,100 people worldwide with a turnover of $836m in 2016.The speed of the pull-out decisions being taken by firms operating in Iran is threatening to wreck EU leaders’ plans to provide legal and financial guarantees to protect European firms that keep trading with Iran.EU leaders have insisted they must protect European economic sovereignty, and have met Iranian leaders to assure them they are preparing a package of countermeasures.The French economy minister, Bruno Le Maire, has warned that the US is attempting to use sanctions to force a change in EU policy towards Iran.The Iranian government, in turn, has warned any exodus of EU investment would force the government to pull out of the 2015 nuclear deal preventing it from enriching uranium.The heart of the Iran deal was a trade off between an Iranian commitment to end its nuclear programme in return for greater trade with the west, but EU leaders admit there is a limit to what they can do to persuade private EU companies they will not be hit by fines.The EU is planning to focus on three specific plans to protect EU firms. The first is an EU statute blocking US sanctions from having any legal effect. The measure has been passed before in 1998, but never been tested in court. The European commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker, said the EU would activate the blocking statute on Friday.It also plans to enhance the status of the European Investment Fund so it can provide finance in euros. The bank could fill the gap left by the withdrawal of private banks with connections in the US. The need for this may in part depend on whether the Swift network, whose financial messaging system facilitates cross-border payments, is forced to cut itself off from the Iranian banking system. Finally, it plans to establish an EU equivalent of the US Office of Foreign Asset Controls to enforce rules defined by the European Union on non-EU firms operating in EU jurisdiction.The EC vice-president, Valdis Dombrovskis, however admitted there was little the EU could do to protect European banks due to their inter-connectedness with US partners.The danger is that the EU-US dispute over Iran will spill into a wider dispute with the US over trade, and events will gather their own momentum as the US starts to impose new unilateral sanctions on key Iranian figures.The US treasury this week sanctioned Valiollah Seif, the governor of the Central Bank of Iran (CBI) as a “specially designated global terrorist” accusing him of moving “millions of dollars on behalf of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps-Qods Force to Hezbollah”. It was the first time the US has targeted a civilian figure in President Hassan Rouhani’s government.In a bid to keep the dispute from spiralling out of control, EU political ambassadors travelled to New York and Washington to urge the US to give carve-outs to EU firms from its sanctions policy. They are also warning the US administration that economic chaos imposed on Iran will be counter-productive, and is more likely to strengthen hardliners than lead to a regime change of benefit to the west.Günther Oettinger, the EU budget commissioner urged the EU to remain united.“One thing is very clear to me: Trump despises weaklings,” he said. “We need an unconditional European unity, because men like Trump love the game ‘ide and rule’. If he can split us, drive a wedge between France and Germany, between the commission and the council, then we would be severely weakened and lose.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dcf341364f4b3f00ddd6efa74bc8cb7c8f6e7944/122_0_2950_1770/master/2950.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6b4fcbb19bf8f4797b2fe7c3a418a943","title":"populists rise to power in italy sets perilous precedent for eu","story":"Some analysts fear coalition of M5S and the League could tip Italy into a Greek-style crisisItaly’s new government, likely to be formally confirmed within the next few days, sets a perilous precedent for Brussels: it marks the first time a founding member of the EU has been led by populist, anti-EU forces.From the EU’s perspective, the coalition of the anti-establishment Five Star Movement (M5S) and the far-right League looks headstrong and unpredictable, possibly even combustible. Leaked drafts of their government “contract” include provision for a “conciliation committee” to settle expected disagreements.Mainly it looks alarming. Both parties toned down their fiercest anti-EU rhetoric during the election campaign, dropping previous calls for a referendum on eurozone membership (popular votes on international treaties are, in any case, barred by the Italian constitution). But as they approach power, the historical Euroscepticism of the M5S and the League is resurfacing. An incendiary early version of their accord called for the renegotiation of EU treaties, the creation of a euro opt-out mechanism, a reduction in Italy’s contribution to the EU budget and the cancellation of €250bn (£219bn) of Italian government debt.The parties’ leaders, Luigi Di Maio of M5S and Matteo Salvini of the League (who counts the likes of Marine Le Pen and Viktor Orbán as his allies), were quick to say this leak was premature, and a later version of their contract showed the section on Europe had been much watered down.The euro opt-out had gone, and calls for changes to EU treaties and monetary policy were marked in red, meaning they are yet to be agreed. But the draft still urged a debate on the EU’s stability and growth pact, greater powers for the European parliament, a denunciation of austerity policies and the repatriation of “certain EU competences” to member states.The general tenor certainly suggests the new government will not back down from its belief that – in the words of one senior League official, Lorenzo Fontana – “people come before economic obligations”. Complaining about “unelected Eurocrats”, M5S’s Di Maio said it was time for Italy to “show courage … and change things”.The coalition could also fall out with Brussels over its plans for a clampdown on immigration and a call to cancel all economic sanctions on Russia. But of far greater concern in EU capitals are a raft of tax-cutting, welfare-boosting and budget-busting economic and social policies that could spell serious trouble in the eurozone.Economists and the Italian media have costed the agreed M5S-League policy programme at between €65bn and €100bn. And the two parties have repeatedly said they feel no need to respect European commitments in implementing their programme.Fed up with the country’s long, seemingly irreversible economic decline, persistent high unemployment, and a refugee and migrant crisis, Italy’s voters turned on the political centre that has governed (or failed to govern) Italy since the 1980s.But some analysts fear that if the radical new government they elected does push ahead with its promised policies, the result could be a Greek-style banking and debt crisis in the eurozone’s third-largest economy.Europe’s, and especially the eurozone’s, biggest fear is that Italy plunges into the kind of economic meltdown that in 2015 came very close to catapulting Greece – led, remember, by a radical-left government that was hellbent on overthrowing the eurozone’s rules – out of the single currency.The parallel is far from perfect, and neither M5S nor the League seem to be spoiling for the kind of fight that Syriza once sought. But the EU could most certainly do without a Greek-style crisis on an Italian scale."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e2ca317e53d08276e377c135e5cf0ff3dfcf4a8c/0_32_2150_1290/master/2150.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=023203c5c45a5019925bf162f6fc7b87","title":"quim torra sworn in catalan president xenophobia claims","story":"Catalan nationalist is facing growing criticism over anti-Spanish tone of past remarksQuim Torra has been sworn in as the 131st president of Catalonia amid growing pressure over the “xenophobic” and anti-Spanish tone of his past writings and comments.Torra, a hardline Catalan nationalist handpicked by the region’s deposed president, Carles Puigdemont, was elected by 66 votes to 65 on Monday and assumed office at a low-key ceremony in Barcelona on Thursday.“I promise to loyally fulfil the duties of the post of regional president being faithful to the will of the Catalan people represented by the Catalan parliament,” he said, using the same formula as Puigdemont and avoiding mention of obeying the Spanish constitution. Central government representatives did not attend the ceremony.Since his appointment the 55-year-old lawyer and editor has been dogged by accusations that he is Puigdemont’s puppet and that his long history of anti-Spanish comments makes him unfit to lead a government.Six years ago, Torra wrote an article in which he described Spanish-speakers in Catalonia as “carrion-feeders, vipers and hyenas” who hated the Catalan language and culture and were “beasts in human form”.“It is a sick phobia,” he wrote. “There is something Freudian in these beasts, a rough patch in their DNA.”In a string of tweets written the same year, Torra suggested that “Spaniards know only how to plunder”, claimed that Catalonia had been under Spanish occupation since 1714 and said Spaniards had long since removed the word “shame” from the dictionary. He later apologised “if anyone was offended by the tweets”. He has also been ridiculed for saying that Catalonia was suffering “a humanitarian crisis”.Politicians including Spain’s prime minister, Mariano Rajoy, and Pedro Sánchez, the leader of the opposition Socialist party, have criticised the “xenophobic nature” of his past pronouncements. On Tuesday, a Catalan anti-racism group took Torra to task for repeatedly using “a dangerous, irresponsible and unacceptable discourse, based on prejudices”. The Spanish justice ministry declined to comment on reports that prosecutors were looking into the possibility of bringing charges of racial hate crimes against Torra over his tweets and articles.Although Torra has said he wants to hold talks with Rajoy, he insists that Puigdemont remains the “legitimate president” of Catalonia and has vowed to try to restore his predecessor’s sacked cabinet to their previous posts and push on with plans to create an independence republic.The region has been under direct control from Madrid since the end of October last year, when Rajoy responded to Puigdemont’s unilateral independence referendum and the subsequent declaration of independence by firing the Catalan president and his cabinet and calling new elections.However, Rajoy’s electoral gamble failed to pay off: the pro-independence bloc retained its parliamentary majority and Puigdemont, who remains in self-imposed exile in Germany, finally anointed Torra as his successor after efforts to install three other candidates, including himself, failed.Torra’s closeness to Puigdemont and similarly firm stance on independence have not gone unnoticed. A cartoon in El Mundo this week showed the former president as a fairy godmother, telling a Pinocchio-Torra puppet: “And if you’re really good, I’ll turn you into a real boy.”Pablo Simón, a political scientist at Carlos III University in Madrid, said Torra was likely to prove a isive choice both inside Catalonia and within the independence movement itself, and that Puigdemont had chosen him as a means of maintaining the current situation of tension and polarisation.“It suits Puigdemont better because at the end of the day, it reinforces the idea of a stopgap presidency, which will be subordinate to his presidency in Berlin,” said Simón. “It’s about the idea of trying to restore the last government rather than trying to move things forward, like being a statue made of salt, paralysed and always looking backwards.”Antonio Barroso, an analyst at the political risk advisory firm Teneo Intelligence, said Puigdemont was using Torra as a means to remain relevant at home and abroad and was “prioritising his own strategy over the unity of the pro-independence movement”.Barroso said that Torra’s anti-Spanish declarations would damage the independence movement’s international image, with the president’s old articles being seized on by opponents of secession.“The whole rhetoric of the independence movement says: ‘This is about democracy.’ But now the other side can say it’s not about democracy because clearly you have someone with ideas that try to exclude one part of the population.”Some see the advent of Torra as proof that a latent strain of supremacism is seeping into the Catalan mainstream.“Catalan nationalism has always been characterised by what you could call a ‘civic nationalism’ it’s always been based on integrating people who come into Catalonia and on a non-ethnic idea of who Catalans are,” said Pau Marí-Klose, a professor of sociology at the University of Zaragoza.But the polarisation and radicalisation brought about by Puigdemont’s push for independence – and the Spanish authorities’ response to it – had “slightly opened the door” to Torra’s school of thought and reignited old feelings of resentment.“The idea that Catalonia has been mistreated by Spain has gathered more and more momentum during the process and has somehow given rise to these very supremacist ideas: that anything Spanish is despicable that Spanish culture is prone to authoritarianism and isn’t a truly European culture, whereas Catalan culture is,” said Marí-Klose.“There’s a metaphor that you see, even in cartoons, of Spain as an abusive husband and Catalonia as the wife trying to leave the relationship but isn’t allowed … Torra feeds off that but that doesn’t mean that the majority of Catalans buy into these ideas.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/427df8903ddd5c42d15e28c85f3ec8108c52cd58/0_172_4990_2994/master/4990.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e79ec387ed86ef6ceda05c697db87b17","title":"sun terraces and lawns dutch residents transform parking spaces","story":"Project in The Hague has ided streets and revealed a deeply-held attachment to carsIt seems a straightforward offer: swap your resident’s parking permit for a bit of greenery in the freed-up space, a lawn, a sun terrace or somewhere for the children to play. However, if any further proof was needed of the west’s destructive love affair with the car, the furious reaction to a pilot project in one of the Netherlands’ biggest cities has been all too telling.Streets have been ided, angry complaints made and Walter Dresscher, the organiser of the council-backed scheme in The Hague, given what he admits was a verbal going-over during a fiery public meeting. However, Dresscher’s determination remains undimmed: “We can’t go on like this. This has been a great success already because people are thinking.”The drama was sparked by the Dutch municipality’s proposal to residents in six streets in Segbroek, a suburb in the west of the city, to voluntarily swap their parking permit for six months and replace it with something green and pleasant on their street.Their vehicles would be stored in a car park for free, and those participating could choose between themselves how to use the vacant space.Dresscher, an architect by training, said opposition from many residents in the selected areas illustrated how deeply people were attached to their cars, even in the Netherlands, which is often a pioneer in terms of green transportation. The idea of a parking space being lost from a street was too much for some to bear.“I was a bit like a boxing guy, I took everything,” he said of the public meeting attended by 200 residents. “If I was to respond, like I would in a personal conversation, the meeting would not have finished very well ... Everybody took – and this in the Netherlands is more rare than in other countries – very opposite positions. Normally, we are a country where we have a dialogue, we talk to each other.News doesn\u0027t always have to be bad – indeed, the relentless focus on confrontation, disaster, antagonism and blame risks convincing the public that the world is hopeless and there is nothing we can do.This series is an antidote, an attempt to show that there is plenty of hope, as our journalists scour the planet looking for pioneers, trailblazers, best practice, unsung heroes, ideas that work, ideas that might and innovations whose time might have come.Readers can recommend other projects, people and progress that we should report on by contacting us at theupside@the“The idea was to get people together but it didn’t. Why? If there is one that is very angry and starts mobilising the whole street then you have a problem.“But if you don’t want to participate, don’t participate. But physically a car is getting out of the street. Nobody is losing anything.”Dresscher insisted the initial hostility has abated but, as yet, only six householders have signed up to the scheme, with their cars due to be removed in June. Two residents have, however, pre-empted the scheme by putting flower-filled tow-carts in front of their homes, much to the irritation of some. Drivers have been known to shout abuse as they drive by.Dresscher, who has €60,000 of funding from the council and charities, is still confident that more people will come round to his thinking, and is glad that a debate has been started.Rembrant Frerichs, 40, and, Wolfert Brederode, 44, both pianists, and neighbours on Newtonstreet, said they believed it was an important first step in changing the nature of their road, but were yet to decide how to use the space in front of their homes.Brederode said: “I just don’t think I need the car outside my house all the time and I’m going to see if we need it at all. I don’t think there is any reason.“People have this belief that they have a right to have a car, a right to have a parking space. A car is like a second home to people but it isn’t rational.”Dresscher said the project had been inspired by the experience of being forced to push his baby’s pram on the road when living in Amsterdam because cars were blocking the pavement.“I looked at these cars and there were actually plants growing under them. They hadn’t moved for three or four weeks. I started thinking: does anyone know how many cars are used or not?”“This is a completely ridiculous situation,” he said. “I want to get rid of unused cars. The municipalities of Netherlands cannot keep going like this. One day they will come and take away that right, I am sure about that. But this is chance for people to change their behaviour themselves.”A spokesman for The Hague municipality said: “People get the opportunity to choose themselves what they want to do with the public space. They can park their cars in the street or start sharing cars and fill up the free parking spots for other purposes like green, bicycle parking or picnic tables. “We want to see the effect of this approach. Will this bottom-up approach work, where people get a direct effect of their choice to get rid of their car, or is it still necessary to make top-down policy to manage the amount of parked cars in public spaces? It’s a project that, when it succeeds, can easily be scaled up to other streets and neighbourhoods. We think that’s why this pilot is worth funding.”This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world’s most stubborn problems. What else should we cover?

A giant “No” slogan has been erected by anti-abortion campaigners on Ben Bulben mountain in Co Sligo.The operation started at 4am on Thursday as campaigners wrote the word No in 50m high letters with white “cladding plastic” on the north side of the mountain.The action has sparked a furious reaction on social media, with many accusing those responsible of vandalism and of defacing the mountain . Those behind the action say the lettering will remain in place until after the referendum next week.During the 1970s and 1980s, various slogans including Brits Out and H Block were painted on the mountain, which was immortalised by WB Yeats.The campaigners responsible for the No slogan said they got permission from all the landowners and that up to 20 people were involved . Campaigner Tommy Banks told Ocean FM radio that it was a “cry from the mountain to save Ireland’s babies”. He claimed that most of the national media - including The  - were “pro-abortion” and that €1,000 worth of No posters have been pulled down in the Sligo area .Mr Banks said the operation was “well-planned and well-executed” .He claimed the Government was “planning to execute the future children of Ireland” and were not listening to the people. Mr Banks said his group had consulted local gardaí before erecting the slogan. Gardaí said they had received no formal complaint in connection with the incident.

Seven per cent said they will not vote or refused to say.Once the undecideds and those who will not vote are excluded, the Yes side leads by 58 per cent to 42 per cent, with just over a week to go before polling day.While this shows a decline of 10 points in the Yes lead since late April, those in favour of repeal still command a 16-point lead as the campaign enters its final, decisive stage.A tightening of the race was expected by all sides as polling day approaches, and pollsters say that process is likely to continue in the days ahead. But while the Yes side lead has been cut, the No side requires a dramatic acceleration of that process if it is to secure a majority on May 25th.Dublin remains the most pro-repeal part of the country, with the Yes side leading in the capital by 68 per cent to 32 per cent, once undecideds and unlikely voters are excluded.The Yes lead is smaller but clear in the rest of Leinster and Munster, while the two sides are almost tied in Connacht-Ulster, with 51 per cent of declared likely voters saying they will vote Yes and 49 per cent backing the No side.Younger voters are much more likely to support the Yes side, though the youngest cohort of voters (18-24 year-olds) shows a sharp drop in Yes supports in the last month. Voters aged over 50 are in favour of retaining the Eighth Amendment.Women, urban voters, and those from wealthier backgrounds are more in favour of repeal, while farmers and those from the poorest households have small No majorities.The poll shows that a significant minority of declared Yes voters believe that the Government’s proposal for legalising abortion “goes too far”, while 47 per cent of all voters say the law needs to be changed, but 12 weeks is too far.However, many of those voters still intend to vote in favour of the referendum proposal. Over half of all voters (54 per cent) say that while they have reservations about the 12-weeks proposal, they believe it is a “reasonable compromise”. Just over a third of voters (35 per cent) disagree.The poll also shows that voters are becoming more certain of their choice as polling day approaches. Two-thirds of Yes voters say they will absolutely not change their minds, while a further 23 per cent say they are “extremely unlikely” to change their minds. A further 9 per cent say they will probably not change their minds.Certainty is also growing on the No side, with 85 per cent of voters absolutely or extremely unlikely to change their mind. A further 9 per cent will probably not change their minds.Among those who have yet to decide, more undecided voters are leaning towards Yes (31 per cent) than No (24 per cent), though most say they are not leaning in either direction.The poll was conducted on Monday and Tuesday of this week in face-to-face interviews among a nationally representative sample of 1,200 eligible voters. Interviewing took place at 120 sampling points across all constituencies. The accuracy level is estimated to be about plus or minus 2.8 per cent.Get the latest news and best analysis ahead of the Eighth Amendment referendum here-the-  each Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3498859.1526556384!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"poll results show no room for complacency says harris","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tMinister for Health Simon Harris.

It is adding more pain and trauma to people in crisis pregnancies. This is a once in a generation opportunity.“Do not look back on Saturday week and think ’I wish I did more’, ’I wish I voted’ or ’I wish I rang that friend’...Leave nothing behind you.”The Minister has said he will participate in a debate next week on RTÉ with a member of the Pro-Life campaign.There has been a lot of discussion about adversarial debates, Mr Harris said, but this was about getting out the facts in a calm and rational way.The Minister said nine women today were travelling to airports to seek a termination in the United Kingdom, while another three were ordering pills to their homes.The Minister was joined by singer Christy Moore, author Marian Keyes and actress Pauline McLynn at the launch of a campaign advocating for a Yes vote in the forthcoming referendum.The aim of the ‘Hear Me Out’ campaign is to encourage people to talk about the referendum next Friday.Moore said he is supportive of the right of a woman to have a choice over her body and was voting Yes for his wife, mother, daughter and members of his family who feel the same way.“I call on people to use your vote, to look into your own conscience and do not get too involved in the brouhaha going on and look into your own heart.”Keyes said this was about supporting women and not turning on women in crisis pregnancies at their most vulnerable moments.McLynn said she wanted to reach out to the older people who may feel conflicted about the issue.Get the latest news and best analysis ahead of the Eighth Amendment referendum here-the-  each Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2018/05/17/TELEMMGLPICT000161696173_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfyf2A9a6I9YchsjMeADBa08.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"amsterdam ban airbnb raise visiting levies squeeze tourist monoculture","story":"People pose for a selfie on a bridge over Prinsengracht canal on King\u0026#39s Day in AmsterdamAmsterdam, city of red lights and cannabis cafés, may soon be pulling the plug on the party.Following the examples of Barcelona and Venice, Amsterdam’s main political parties have announced radical measures to turn down the volume of tourism and reverse the so-called “Disneyfication” of the Dutch capital.A coalition of four parties, negotiating to form the new city government, on Wednesday issued a pledge of agreed reforms to provide “balance in the city.”It will ban Airbnb short-term rentals in busy areas, ert cruise ships from docking in the centre, and crack down on “fun rides” like Segways, beer bikes, horse-drawn carriages and boozy boat trips.

Be that with gun salutes, marching guards, or golden carriages. The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge during their wedding carriage procession in 2011There is no doubt that this royal wedding will pack a punch, just like Queen Victoria\u0027s marriage to Albert which featured a 21-gun salute as she embarked on her carriage procession at St Jame\u0027s Palace.  But it was not until King George VI\u0027s marriage to Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon in 1923 that royal weddings became public affairs they were married to great fanfare in order to lift the spirits of the nation after World War One (and royal weddings have been lavish events ever since).At 1pm, immediately after the service, Prince Harry and Ms Markle will leave Windsor Castle by carriage. They will be driven along Castle Hill, the High Street and into Windsor town centre before returning along the beautiful, tree-lined Long Walk for their reception. The whole procession is expected to take just 25 minutes.Meanwhile, guests from the congregation will wait for the happy couple in St George\u0027s Hall, to celebrate the first of the day\u0027s two receptions.To see the newlyweds up close, the best positions will be on the 2.64 mile stretch that rolls from Snow Hill to the gates of Windsor Castle. This is known as the \u0027Long Walk\u0027. The length of this section will allow thousands of spectators to catch a glimpse of Harry and Meghan in the final minutes of the procession.  There will be events on the Long Walk  throughout the day, with live screens showing footage from the ceremony.  On the hilltop above the procession route, the eagle-eyed can find a sweeping aerial view of the carriage ride. Snow Hill will offer fantastic views of the final moments and will be a popular picnic spot on the day, so get there early to reserve a spot.According to legend, King Henry VIII sat on Snow Hill to wait for news of the execution of his second wife, Queen Anne Boleyn. A precedent that has fortunately not been followed since. Prince Edward and his bride Sophie Rhys-Jones pass the crowd inside the grounds of Windsor Castle in an open carriage in 1999Royal fans can also mingle with the residents of Windsor as the carriage passes through the streets of the town centre. Although you should probably arrive at the crack of dawn if you\u0027re after a front-row High Street viewing spot - it\u0027s bound to get busy.With Windsor dressed in bunting and ceremonial decorations – and bursting with local street entertainment – the town will provide a feast for the eyes. Expect big screens showing live footage of the wedding plus an array of food stalls and general facilities will be available at both the Long Walk and Alexandra Gardens.Spectators can also line the entirety of the procession route, on Castle Hill, High Street, Sheet Street, Kings Road, Albert Road and the Long Walk. Disabled viewing spots will be available at the junctions of Victoria Street and Albert Road. The council has advised that visitors should not bring tents, but foldable chairs and umbrellas are fine. Also look out for the weather forecast on the day, and prepare for large crowds with plenty of food supplies, water, and sun cream. Further information will be published on the Royal Borough of Windsor and Maidenhead Council website. Of the three parking options on offer, most motorists should make use of the 6,000 designated parking spaces available at the Review Ground, Windsor Great Park, which is located to the south of Windsor Castle and the town centre.  Parking tickets must be booked in advance for a price of £30. These are being allocated on a first-come, first-serve basis. With wedding invitations being sent to more than 2,000 members of the public and many more expected to watch the ceremony on the town\u0027s live screens, it\u0027s a good idea get these sooner rather than later.This car park opens at 4am and closes at 10pm. Though it is next to the Long Walk, motorists will have to take a 25 minute stroll to the nearest spectator spots.  The second parking option is provided by Windsor Racecourse\u0027s \u0027Park and Float\u0027 service, which must also be booked in advance. There are 3,000 spots available for £30, as well as weekend parking packages, and the opportunity to journey into the heart of Windsor on a return boat trip for £10. The third car park can be found at The Windsor Boy\u0027s School, where motorists can park on a first-come-first basis on the day without pre-booking. This is expected to fill-up early in the morning. To accommodate the large number of attendees at Windsor\u0027s public events over the weekend, there will also be a series of road closures, beginning with a 9am - 2pm closure of the procession route on Thursday May 17. Then, from 10pm on Friday May 18 and until late on Saturday May 19, road closures will affect the procession route and surrounding roads. During this time Windsor residents will be able to leave the road closure area, but only emergency services vehicles can enter.Access to the car park on the Long Walk will not be affected by the road closures in place, at any time. Road closures beyond the procession route will take effect from 6am on Saturday May 19 these include Maidenhead Road, Clarence Road, Alma Road, St Leonards Road, Frances Road, Barry Avenue, and Datchet Road. Local authorities suggest that you check this live map of road closures to check what time the roads reopen from Saturday evening onwards. Rail operators will be running a bumper service on the wedding to help everyone get in and out of the celebrations at Windsor, which is expected to be one of the largest one-day events ever held on the local rail network.  Both Great Western and South Western will be increasing train frequency and capacity, with trains running up to four times an hour from London Waterloo and Slough. These services will also benefit from extra carriages to keep up with the expected demand, given that some of the 100,000 expected visitors will arrive by public transport. Windsor is served by two train stations that are within minutes of the town centre and Windsor Castle, making the railway a reliable option for getting to the Royal wedding celebrations: Windsor and Eton Central and Windsor and Eton Riverside.Queuing systems are likely to be in place at London Waterloo, Slough, Staines, and Windsor, whilst \u0027park and walk\u0027 and \u0027park and glide\u0027 bus services will help people get into town.Great Western Railway services connect Windsor and Eton station to South Wales and the West of England, as well as Reading and Oxford, via Slough. This branch-line service will be running with four carriages running every 20 minutes, from the very early hours of the morning to late on Saturday night. The journey from Reading or Oxford takes around 30 - 50 minutes and 50 - 75 minutes respectively, with a change required at Slough. Cardiff and Swansea are around two and a half hours away from Windsor, requiring changes at Reading and then Slough. London is connected to Windsor via the direct Waterloo to Windsor and Eton Riverside service, which takes one hour. Travellers have been advised not to take the London Paddington - Slough route, in order to ease rail congestion around Windsor. From the Midlands, take a Cross Country service from Birmingham New Street to Reading, and then change at Slough for the Eton Riverside station. This takes around two and a half hours.Train services from the North require changes at London terminals. Almost five hours of train travel await any royal super-fans making their way from Newcastle.  Because it is such a huge event, it is wise to make travel plans ahead of time – so make ticket bookings and travel arrangements well before the big day. Up to date advice on the best routes and how to pre-book your tickets, can be found at: for Great Western Railway here and South Western Railway here.Royal wedding: the best hotels for celebrating Prince Harry\u0027s and Meghan Markle\u0027s big dayThere will be a designated pick up and drop off point on the wedding day at King Edward VII Hospital, St Leonards Road. This will be the termination point for buses towards Windsor, as well as local routes. A full timetable of buses is available at the Royal Borough website, and more information on transport and bus alterations can be found here. Hotels, B\u0026ampBs and guesthouses will be bursting at the seams, so expect no empty hotel rooms in town for the duration of the wedding weekend. Royal fans had only a few hours to book the local accommodation offerings before rooms ran out after the announcement that Windsor would play host for the big day.Many residents and visitors will no doubt find a solution via room sharing service AirBnb, with the average price of a room around Windsor currently standing at £321 for Friday night and £286 for the Saturday night. Such prices look like a bargain, with some of the most expensive hotel rooms in Windsor going for up to £10,000. Alternative locations with more \u0027last-minute\u0027 availability include Heathrow, Bracknell and Weybridge. The council also suggests that anyone wanting help to find accommodation can contact the Royal Windsor Information Centre on 01753 743907 or by emailing: windsor.accommodation@rbwm. gov.uk.The monarchy has embarked on grand processions from coronations, marriages, funerals and other state occasions since the 15th century. Each year, a carriage procession carries the Queen to the State Opening of Parliament and the races at Ascot, although royal weddings and coronations are arguably the grandest occasions.   The last royal couple to undertake a carriage procession in Windsor was Prince Edward and Sophie Rhys-Jones – now the Earl and Countess of Wessex – after their wedding in St George\u0027s Chapel in 1999.Prince Edward and Sophie Rhys-Jones pictured in their carriage after their wedding in 1999It was the biggest occasion in the Berkshire town since since the funeral of King George VI in 1952.More recently, the newly-wed Duke and Duchess of Cambridge travelled through Westminster in a 1902 State Landau after their 2011 wedding, waving at thousands of well-wishers who had packed the streets to catch a glimpse of the happy couple. It\u0027s possible Harry and Meghan could use the same carriage. Steeped in history, the carriage was specifically built for King Edward VII in 1902 and is usually used by the Queen to meet foreign heads of state when they arrive on state visits to Britain.The Prince and Princess of Wales used it to travel back from St Paul’s Cathedral after their 1981 royal wedding, as did the Duke and Duchess of York in 1986. It was also used by the Queen during her Silver Wedding anniversary celebrations in 1972 and in her Silver and Diamond Jubilees in 1977 and 2012.Royal Wedding of Prince Harry and Meghan MarkleDoria Ragland, Meghan Markle\u0026#39s mother, now expected to walk her down the aisle - who else could it be?  Royal wedding guest list: Here\u0026#39s who will be attending this weekendPolice marksman who shot dead Jermaine Baker could face the sackMeghan Markle confirms her father Thomas Markle will not attend royal wedding as he needs \u0026#39space\u0026#39WHO fears \u0026#39explosive increase\u0026#39 in new Ebola cases as outbreak moves to cityPrince Harry and Meghan Markle pictured arriving in Windsor for royal wedding rehearsalWhat time will the Royal Wedding start?

He was also intending to walk Ms Markle down the aisle on Saturday, meeting her at the chapel\u0027s west door after her drive to the ceremony with her mother.But after disclosures about his alleged dealings with the paparazzi and reports he suffered a heart attack earlier this month, the 73-year-old said on Monday he would avoid the ceremony for fear of embarrassing his daughter.The Mail On Sunday newspaper reported the story at the weekend claiming the images were staged and published CCTV footage stills of the US actress\u0027 father in the internet cafe with a photographer.The pictures were published earlier this month in a number of newspapers and news websites showing Mr Markle in a series of royal wedding related activities, apparently unaware he was being snapped.Mr Markle was pictured being measured for what was thought to be his wedding suit, looking at screen pictures of Ms Markle and Harry while in an internet cafe, and reading a picture book about Britain while having a coffee.Thomas Markle Snr: How Meghan Markle\u0026#039s father set her on a path to stardomMs Markle\u0027s half-sister Samantha Markle attempted to shoulder some of the blame when she earlier tweeted it was her idea for Mr Markle to pose for what she described as positive photos in a bid to combat his bad portrayal in the press, but stated it was not done for money.A Kensington Palace said it was a deeply personal moment for Ms Markle in the days before her wedding and called for understand and respect to be extended to Mr Markle. It would not comment further.However, on Tuesday he raised hopes of attending after all by saying his daughter had been in touch to reassure him, and was prepared to fly to Britain if his medical condition allowed.Mr Markle is reported to have said: “I hate the idea of missing one of the greatest moments in history and walking my daughter down the aisle.”But within hours he appeared to change his plans for a third time, claiming he required heart surgery after falling unwell again.The gossip site also claimed Ms Grant had suffered a broken ankle and fractured knee in what her boyfriend described as a paparazzi confrontation on a road in Florida.  Meanwhile, other members of Ms Markle\u0027s family have arrived in London - depsite reportedly not receiving an invite to the wedding.Tracy Dooley – who was married to Meghan Markle\u0027s half-brother Thomas Markle Jr – was pictured at Heathrow Airport with her sons, Tyler, 25, and Thomas, 26 on Monday.Ms Dooley, who has admitted she has not seen Ms Markle for 20 years, has previously told ITV\u0027s Good Morning Britain she had not received an invitation to the ceremony at Windsor Castle on Saturday.Yet she is expected to cover the event for an American broadcasting network and said she will be in the front row cheering them on in Windsor.Thomas Markle Jr, who not long ago issued an open letter urging Prince Harry to call off the wedding, appeared in Windsor, declaring his estranged half sister the “perfect modern princess”.Days until the Royal WeddingThe wedding is this weekend - Saturday, May 19 - at St George’s Chapel in the grounds of Windsor Castle, where Prince Harry was christened. It is said to have become a very special place for the couple in their relationship so far. The Lord Chamberlain\u0027s Office at Buckingham Palace is responsible for organising royal weddings, but the Prince and Ms Markle are leading the show. However, under the guidance of Harry\u0027s private secretary, Edward Lane Fox, the Lord Chamberlain\u0027s Office is dealing with the ceremonial aspects of the day.The service will begin at 12pm. The public will have the opportunity to watch the action from their sofas with several broadcasters showing the ceremony live.Read more about how to watch the wedding here.Copy of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle: The story of their relationship, in picturesInvitations have been posted to 600 lucky guests, with a select 200 close friends invited to an after party at Frogmore House, in the grounds of Windsor Castle. The couple do not have an official list of political leaders on the guest list, which means neither Prime Minister Theresa May or US President Donald Trump will be going, and former US President Barack Obama has also missed out. Expect to see many members of the Royal family, Ms Markle\u0027s family (apart from her father, Thomas Markle Snr), famous faces from the cast of Suits, conservationists, sportsmen and women and charity heads closest to the couple’s hearts.Invitations for Prince Harry and Meghan Markle\u0026#39s wedding in MayThose invited include Dave Henson, the former Team GB captain at the Invictus Games, the head of a tiny overlooked Welsh charity and the Botswanan friends so discreet even they do not know which others in their set are going.Some members of the public have received an invitation to wait in the grounds outside the chapel to watch the bride and groom and their wedding guests arrive and leave.As well a dress code, the guest list also reportedly includes \u0027critical guidance\u0027for the big day.The instructions ban cameras and bulky bags, adding that guests will be asked to surrender mobile telephones\u0085 and any devices used for image capture. They further specify that guests should not wear medals, in a list of suggestions about accessories that includes: No swords.Jessica Mulroney and Meghan Markle in 2016The invitations were produced by Barnard \u0026amp Westwood, which has held the Royal Warrant for Printing \u0026amp Bookbinding by Appointment to Her Majesty The Queen since 1985.Die-stamped in gold and then burnished, the invitation features The Three Feather Badge of The Prince of Wales. They also reveal that the dress code is Uniform, Morning Coat or Lounge Suit, or Day Dress with Hat.Read more about who is on the guest list here.The Duke of Cambridge will be Harry\u0027s best man, missing the FA Cup final to be at his brother\u0027s side.The Duke, who has always been the front-runner for the supporting role at the May wedding, is honoured to have been asked, Kensington Palace said.Prince William and Prince Harry in borrowed policemen outfitsKensington Palace has announced that Ms Markle will have no adult bridesmaids \u0027because she\u0027s unable to choose between her friends\u0027, and will instead be surrounded by children as page boys, bridesmaids and flower girls.On Wednesday, it was announced the bridesmaids are Princess Charlotte, Florence van Custem, Remi Litt, Rylan Litt, Ivy Mulroney and Zalie Warren. The pageboys are Prince George, Jasper Dyer, Brian Mulroney and John Mulroney.Royal siblings Prince George and Princess Charlotte already know the score - they performed those roles at the wedding of Pippa Middleton, the Duchess of Cambridge\u0027s younger sister, to James Matthews in May last year.  Prince Harry has paid tribute to former mentor and close friend Mark Dyer by requesting his son Jasper as a pageboy, while Ms Markle has publicly recognised one of her best friends, stylist Jessica Mulroney, by choosing her twin sons to take part in the wedding.Read more about the pageboys and bridesmaids here.Bookmakers suspended betting on the designer of Ms Markle\u0027s wedding dress in March when British couture company Ralph \u0026amp Russo pulled ahead to become 13 favourites.The label, helmed by Australians Tamara Ralph and Michael Russo (a couple in real life) have shot to prominence after a string of celebrity endorsements.In 2014, Angelina Jolie wore the label to Buckingham Palace to receive an honorary damehood, in 2016 Gwyneth Paltrow to the Oscars. Add to that list of fans Beyonce, Rihanna and, finally, Meghan Markle herself, who chose a £56,000 embellished couture gown for the official photos taken to mark her engagement to Prince Harry.Before betting was suspended, London-based designer Erdem was at 31. Ms Markle\u0027s stylist and close friend Ms Mulroney runs a bridal store in Toronto was said to have helped the bride choose her gown.Read more about Ralph and Russo here.Prince Harry will wear the ceremonial uniform of the Royal Marines,the regiment believes.The Prince will wear the uniform as a mark of respect to the regiment he took over as Captain General from his grandfather, the Duke of Edinburgh.Men from the regiment will line the route from St George’s Chapel, at Windsor Castle, to provide a ceremonial guard of honour.Palace officials will not confirm what the Prince is to wear for his wedding to Ms Markle, but soldiers of the Royal Marines who have volunteered to take part understand he will be wearing the same ceremonial regalia, or ‘Blues’, as them on the day.Other options include the uniform of the Household Cavalry, where Prince Harry served with the Blues and Royals, or morning dress.Read more on Prince Harry\u0027s outfit hereThe couple will be make their vows at St George\u0027s Chapel, which last hosted a royal wedding in May 2008 when Peter Phillips - son of The Princess Royal - married Autumn Kelly. The traditional ceremony will be conducted by The Dean of Windsor, The Rt Revd. David Conner while the Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, will officiate as the couple make their marriage vows.Pioneering American bishop, the Most Rev Bishop Michael Curry, from Chicago, Illinois, has been invited to deliver the address as the couple strive to reflect their transatlantic relationship amid the tradition of St George\u0027s Chapel.Bishop Curry, who has been praised for his infectious laughter and self-deprecating humour, is the first African-American bishop to have served as the Episcopal Church\u0027s presiding bishop, a role he has held since November 2015.The music will also have an American influence according to Christopher Warren-Green, who will conduct musicians on the day.Miss Markle, who was a UN women\u0027s advocate, is unlikely to opt to obey the prince. The couple will probably choose the Series One (1966) Book of Common Prayer ceremony, just as the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge did, which allows the bride to drop obey him and serve him from the religious proceedings.The regiments Prince Harry served with in Afghanistan will a have a “special place” during the ceremony.The 3 Regiment Army Air Corps, where the prince served as an Apache Pilot in Helmand Province will be represented, as well as The Royal Gurkha Rifles, his comrades in Afghanistan in 2007, and RAF Honington, where he is Honorary Air Commandant.Household Cavalry troopers will line the staircase at St George\u0027s Chapel, while streets within the precincts of the castle will be lined by members of the Windsor Castle Guard from 1st Battalion Irish Guards, and by Armed Forces personnel from the Royal Navy Small Ships and Diving, which has the Prince as Commodore-in-Chief, and the Royal Marines, where he is Captain General.Read more about St George\u0027s Chapel here.WATCH: How Diana, the in-laws and Prince Louis will fit into the Royal WeddingAfter the ceremony, among the first people to congratulate the couple will be some of the 2,640 charity workers, community champions and local school children who are being invited to watch the wedding from inside the walls of Windsor Castle. Then at 1pm, the newlyweds will undertake a two mile tour of Windsor in an Ascot Landau carriage, greeting well-wishers, which is expected to take 25 minutes.It\u0027s the same carriage the prince used in the procession at the wedding of Prince William and Kate Middleton,when he was surrounded by small bridesmaids and page boys.The couple will leave Windsor Castle by carriage via Castle Hill, travelling along the High Street and through Windsor Town before returning along the Long Walk for the first reception at St George\u0027s Hall.Read more about the procession here.Wedding at Windsor CastleFollowing the carriage ride, the congregation will await the happy couple in St George\u0027s Hall, for the first of two receptions.The first, more formal afternoon reception for some 600 guests, will be hosted by the Queen. The 180-ft long room, traditionally used for state banquets, seats up to 162 people and was redesigned in a modern Gothic style – with walls lined with suits of armour – following the fire at the castle in 1992.Fashionable \u0027bowl food\u0027 will be served at the standing-only reception. Made with seasonal ingredients grown on the Crown Estates, the food is intended to be eaten standing up, allowing guests to mingle freely in St George’s Hall.The food is likely to be accompanied by champagne and wine from the extensive Royal cellars, and soft drinks.The second evening reception, for 200 close friends and family, will be thrown at Frogmore House by the Prince of Wales. Standing about half a mile south of Windsor Castle in Windsor Home Park, Frogmore House has been a Royal Residence since 1792. It is where Harry and Ms Markle posed for their official engagement photos in November.The location of the venue - away from the Castle - will offer the pair privacy as they celebrate with friends and family.Read more about the food here.The couple have asked Claire Ptak, an east London pastry chef, to make an organic lemon and elderflower wedding cake incorporating the bright flavours of spring, according to Kensington Palace. It will be covered with buttercream and decorated with fresh flowers.It is believed to be the first time a Royal couple have eschewed tradition by not serving a fruit cake to their wedding guests.Claire Ptak, owner of Violet Bakery in Hackney, east LondonThe Duke and Duchess of Cambridge chose Fiona Cairns to make their 2011 wedding cake, a traditional multi-layered fruit cake with a floral design.Read more about the wedding cake here.The couple have chosen high society florist Philippa Craddock to design their day, using seasonal plants and flowers from the Crown Estates and Royal Parks chosen particularly for their pollinator-friendly properties.Aisles, pews, tables and halls will be lined with plants from wildflower meadows, picked to “provide a great habitat for bees and help to nurture and sustain entire ecosystems by promoting a healthy and bioerse environment”, Kensington Palace said.Ms Craddock has been named “Queen of London florists” by British Vogue and “a floral mastermind” by Tatler.On Wednesday Ms Craddock revealed the the flower arrangements will have royal roots.The London florist said that silver birch and English oak from nearby Windsor Great Park will be a part of the greenery adorning the scenery.Windsor Great Park is owned by the royal family and Prince Philip, holds the title of park ranger.William the Conqueror hunted there in the 11th century when the park was a forest. Roses, foxgloves and Ms Markle\u0027s reported favourite flowers peonies will also will be in the arrangements.There are moments where I\u0027ve focused on it being another commission, so it\u0027s like working with any one of our couples, and of course you take a step back and you just realise the enormity of it, Ms Craddock said.It\u0027s a huge occasion and we\u0027re just hugely privileged.Read more about the wedding florist here.The prince will be putting pen to paper to write his speech for their reception. But Ms Markle, who is an accomplished public speaker, is expected to break with tradition and deliver her own as well, offering “affectionate” praise of her new husband, thanks to the Queen and a few suitable jokes.The former actress, is “ready” to speak at the reception, should her father choose to avoid the limelight, the Sunday Times reported earlier this year.Mr Markle, an award-winning Hollywood writing director who now lives a quiet life in Mexico, was expected to walk Ms Markle down the aisle before changing his plans to attend.At the wedding of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, reception speeches included words from best man Prince Harry, the groom’s father the Prince of Wales and Michael Middleton, who affectionately described how he knew his daughter’s relationship was serious when her boyfriend landed a helicopter in his garden.Ms Markle will become an HRH and a senior royal after marrying Prince Harry. She is also expected to become a duchess, as Kate Middleton did when she became the Duchess of Cambridge after saying her vows in 2011.By tradition, male members of the Royal family receive a title from the monarch on their wedding day, and the vacant title Duke of Sussex is regarded as the most likely choice for the Prince, meaning Ms Markle would become HRH The Duchess of Sussex.Like Prince Harry, the previous Duke of Sussex lived at Kensington Palace, and he also married for love, rather than choosing brides who fitted the traditional royal mould.Read more about royal titles here.Prince William and his wife Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge, outside Westminster Abbey on their wedding day in 2011The wedding is on a Saturday, so there will be no new bank holiday. Although the public were given a day off to celebrate the weddings of Prince Charles to Diana Spencer in 1981, Prince William to Catherine Middleton in 2011, and Princess Anne to Mark Phillips in 1973, no such national holidays were awarded for Prince Andrew or Prince Edward.However, it\u0027s not all bad news because pubs and bars will be allowed to do away with the usual curbs on opening hours on the wedding weekend. Ministers have extended licensing hours across Britain to allow venues to remain open until 1am on Friday and Saturday - which is also the day of the FA Cup final.There will also be lots of street parties planned across the UK.For information about how to host your own, click here.The royal bride and groom-to-be have approved a range of commemorative china to celebrate their nuptials. The exclusive design in white and cornflower blue has a monogram of the couple\u0027s initials at its centre, tied together with white ribbons and surmounted by the coronet of Prince Harry.  The decorative border of each piece is inspired by the ironwork of the 13th-century Gilebertus door of St George\u0027s Chapel and each is finished with 22-carat gold.The Royal Collection Trust range, which is made in Stoke-on-Trent, includes a decorative miniature coffee mug, coffee mug, pillbox, tankard and plate. The Royal wedding souvenir phenomenon dates back to Queen Victoria’s wedding to Prince Albert in 1840, linked to the rise of mass production in Victorian Britain. It remains a thriving industry today, with an estimated £222 million spent on memorabilia in the run-up to the 2011 royal wedding, according to the Centre for Retail Research.Prince Harry and Ms Markle will delay their honeymoon to go straight back to work in the week after their wedding, scheduling their first public engagement as a married couple just days later.The couple will go on honeymoon privately later this year, before a “busy” autumn including a trip to Sydney for the Invictus Games. But where will they go?Namibia has pulled ahead as the odds-on favourite. The southern African nation is best known among travellers for the enormous Sossusvlei sand dunes of the the Namib Desert, but reports suggest that the couple are looking instead at a safari trip to Hoanib Valley Camp in the country\u0027s north west.Botswana, where they holidayed in the early days of their whirlwind relationship, is also a good bet, (Ms Markle\u0027s engagement ring features diamonds from Diana\u0027s personal collection, and a stone from Botswana), but wherever they go, the newlyweds will be looking for seclusion away from the limelight as they start their married life together.Other possible destinations could include Tuscany, Hawaii, Turkey and the Philippines.Read more about the honeymoon options here.Meghan Markle and Prince Harry wedding features gridPrince Harry and Meghan MarkleRoyal Wedding of Prince Harry and Meghan MarkleDoria Ragland, Meghan Markle\u0026#39s mother, now expected to walk her down the aisle - who else could it be?  Royal wedding guest list: Here\u0026#39s who will be attending this weekendPolice marksman who shot dead Jermaine Baker could face the sackMeghan Markle confirms her father Thomas Markle will not attend royal wedding as he needs \u0026#39space\u0026#39WHO fears \u0026#39explosive increase\u0026#39 in new Ebola cases as outbreak moves to cityPrince Harry and Meghan Markle pictured arriving in Windsor for royal wedding rehearsalWhat time will the Royal Wedding start?

It did not come about until after the first stars were formed, being released when they died again.As such, the oxygen discover was unexpected because it suggests that had happened even when the universe was relatively young. That discovery appears to be confirmed by a model that confirms the current brightness of the universe corresponds with it being formed when it was only 250 million years old.Scientists described the detection of such distant oxygen as a discovery that fundamentally changes our understanding of the beginnings of the universe, as well as being a major breakthrough in our technical exploration of it.Rather than saying I was happy, it would be more accurate to say I was thrilled to see the signal of the most distant oxygen, explains Takuya Hashimoto, the lead author of the research paper published in the journal Nature and a researcher at Osaka Sangyo University and the National Astronomical Observatory of Japan. I was excited enough that the signal appeared in my dreams and I had difficulty sleeping that night.The age of those stars raises questions about when the very first galaxies emerged from the complete darkness that initially made up the universe, a moment known by scientists as the Cosmic Dawn.Determining when cosmic dawn occurred is akin to the Holy Grail of cosmology and galaxy formation, said Richard Ellis, senior astronomer at UCL and co-author of the paper. With these new observations of MACS1149-JD1 we are getting closer to directly witnessing the birth of starlight! Since we are all made of processed stellar material, this is really finding our own origins.It also suggests that galaxies were forming long before we can actually see them now, making the process of star formation even more mysterious.The mature stellar population in MACS1149-JD1 implies that stars were forming back to even earlier times, beyond what we can currently see with our telescopes.

Parliament has a deep responsibility to stand up for the people that we represent, and we need access to the information to do that, he added.Labour former minister Stephen Timms said Mr Lidington\u0027s argument was fatally undermined given cabinet ministers were already discussing the matter in public.Labour\u0027s Chuka Umunna drew comparisons with the Second World War in terms of the demands to back a prime minister, noting his party did the unimaginable in 1940 by helping to drive Neville Chamberlain from office.He said Labour was criticised at the time for being opportunistic and undermining the then prime minister, adding: A lot in tone very similar to the criticisms levelled at us now for scrutinising what this government is doing on Brexit.Mr Umunna said Brexit was a very different situation but urged MPs against acting as a rubber stamp for the prime minister as he argued for the papers to be released.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

And we’ve yet to see anything that remotely approaches that.”Countdown to Brexit: What is still needed to complete a deal with the EU?Theresa May and Mr Varadkar held a lunchtime bilateral meeting at the Sofia summit on Thursday. The summit\u0027s main topic is the integration of the Western Balkans region, but Brexit, the Iran nuclear deal, and trade have inevitably reared their heads of the sidelines of the meeting.The UK Cabinet is ided between two options for customs procedures after Brexit, both of which were presented by the Government in a paper published in August of last year. The EU has already said UK plans for a so-called “customs partnership” are based on “magical thinking” and that a separate, vaguer proposal involving technology called MaxFac (“Maximum Facilitation”) would not prevent a hard border in Ireland. Brexit threatens life on the Irish border: in picturesBrexit threatens life on the Irish border: in picturesJohn Murphy flies the European flag outside his home near the border village of Forkhill, Co ArmaghAn abandoned shop is seen in Mullan, Co Monaghan.

Downing Street says the policy would keep the entire UK aligned inside the customs union to prevent a hard border on Ireland, while the EU has said the agreement would keep Northern Ireland in the customs union, and introduce customs checks at Irish sea ports between Northern Ireland and Great Britain. or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

The government may want to provide ‘sweeteners’ for communities affected, but nothing will change the fact that this will be a bitter pill to swallow.”Fracking is one of the least sustainable ways to produce electricityFracking in UK could be limited by lack of specialist waste facilitiesEnvironmental groups point to the water contamination and even potential seismic activity that can result from fracking, as well as the need to move away from fossil fuels altogether.“After seven years of fracking doing less than nothing to help our economy, the government’s still going all out for shale, and still trampling over democracy to prop up this collapsing industry,” said Rebecca Newsome, head of politics for Greenpeace UK. “Communities and their local councils across the UK have said no in every way they can, but the government have turned a deaf ear to everyone who doesn’t own a fossil fuel company.” If the proposed consultation that shale gas exploration development is treated as “permitted development” is accepted, companies would be able to drill without a planning application, environmental impact assessment or the approval of local governments.“The government’s plans pervert the planning process and could make England’s landscape a wild west for whatever cowboy wants to start drilling and digging up our countryside,” said Rose Dickinson, a campaigner at Friends of the Earth. “Permitted development was meant to help people build a fence or a conservatory, not drill for gas.” A leaked report that emerged in February suggested the government and industry leaders had exaggerated the economic potential of future fracking operations in the UK.Fracking has previously been banned in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland due to the associated risks.Rebecca Long Bailey, the shadow business secretary, responded to the news by stating “fracking should be banned, not promoted”.“But the government is encouraging this dirty fossil fuel by making the planning application easier and creating a special fracking regulator.”Ms Dickinson added: “If there was a referendum on fracking, it would be banished to the dustbin of history – and that’s where these proposals belong.”or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Sufficient care and rest during musth “will be ensured”the forests committee will meet at least twice a year – once just before festival season, when all violators should be reported “so that necessary steps are taken for ensuring the safety of the animals as well as that of the public”another meeting will be just after the season to take stock of implementation of the rules Wildlife wardens and forest chiefs discussed the problems at a meeting before issuing the new orders.Kerala has the highest number of festival elephants in India – thought to be about 500. Action for Elephants UK (AfE) has branded the state “ground zero for elephant torture”, and has called their illegal treatment “the worst case of animal cruelty in the world”. The plight of the 150 captive elephants in neighbouring Tamil Nadu is feared to be just as bad.For the six-month festival season, they are forced to walk for miles in searing temperatures on hot, stinging tar roads and ridden into noisy processions with fireworks. Some are carted from one festival to another – up to hundreds of miles – while still chained. Animal advocates say elephants are sensitive, intelligent and sociable creatures and rarely survive the “unrelenting neglect and torture” for a natural life. In the past seven years, 350 captive elephants have died. Often the water they are given falls short of the large quantities they drink in the wild, and many die of severe intestinal blockages. Campaigners staged a protest outside the Indian High Commission in London, coinciding with prime minister Narendra Modi’s visit to Britain, pleading for abuses to be policed.They said lucrative insurance claims provide incentives for owners to neglect their animals.Colourful processions can mask animal suffering (Getty)But the New Indian Express was concerned about the effect on tourism of the publicity about the elephants’ plight, saying the protest outside the High Commission in London added injury to insult.“For the Kerala Tourism Department, it seems it is a case of one step forward, two steps back, while it is trying to brand and market the state as a paradise for holidaymakers,” the Express website said.“State tourism director P Bala Kiran said this is a very serious issue and it will have long-lasting impact on the tourism sector of the state if not addressed properly.”The Kerala Tourism Department has decided to make films of elephant care and majestic festivals featuring the culture and tradition of the state to counter the bad publicity, the paper reported.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

His supporters successfully campaigned for social and political reform and against a corrupt and dysfunctional political establishment.It was the latest surprise in the career of a man who barely survived the murder of his father, the revered Shia religious leader Mohammed Sadiq al-Sadr, and his two brothers, on the orders of Saddam Hussein in 1999.Four years later, after the US invasion of Iraq, he was in danger once again of being killed, this time by American forces who twice besieged him in the holy city of Najaf in 2004.Mr Sadr will be very much the kingmaker – though he will have no official position – in the formation of a new Iraqi government.His coalition, which includes the Iraqi Communist Party, independents and secularists as well as his religious followers, appealed strongly to Iraqis who feel that, with the war won against Isis, they need to rebuild their country.The Iraqi prime minister Haider al-Abadi hoped to win the election – though no party was ever likely to win an absolute majority – by appealing to voters as the leader who recaptured Mosul from Isis last year.He followed this up with a largely bloodless reoccupation of Kirkuk, held by the Kurds since 2003, and the restoration of a large measure of government authority in Iraqi Kurdistan.The political movement formed out of the largely Shia paramilitaries, the Hashd al-Shaabi, which came second in the polls, had, like Mr Abadi, hoped to win more votes through their role in the war against Isis.Coalition led by nationalist cleric takes shock lead in Iraqi electionUS and Iran battle for influence in first post-Isis Iraq electionWomen brace for Iraq’s election after race marked by harassment What would Trump have done about Saddam Hussein? But the drop in violence to a level not seen since the overthrow of Saddam Hussein means that Iraqis are focusing on the theft by the political elite of hundreds of billions of dollars in oil revenues that should have been used to improve the supply of water, electricity, waste disposal as well medical care and education.Mr Sadr has been frequently underestimated as a political leader since he first emerged from house arrest in Najaf at the time of the US invasion.He was described by the western media as a ‘maverick’ or ‘firebrand cleric’, but his views were always more sophisticated and flexible than he was given credit for.The origin of Mr Sadr’s influence was his family’s role as religious leaders and the martyrdom of many of them, beginning with the execution of Mohammed Baqr al-Sadr in 1980.His father led a movement that appealed to the Shia poor of Baghdad and southern Iraq, combining religious revivalism with social and political radicalism. From the start, Sadrism had a strong element of Iraqi nationalism in opposition to all foreign interference in Iraq, be it American, British or Iranian.‘The near future of Iraq is dark’: Warning from Muqtada al-Sadr -In an interview with The Independent in Najaf in 2013 – the first he had given face to face to a Western journalist for 10 years – Mr Sadr spoke graphically of the ill effects of Iraq inviting in different foreign powers to try to solve its problems. He compared this to “somebody who found a mouse in his house, then he kept a cat, then he wanted to get the cat out of the house so he kept a dog, then to get the dog out of his house he bought an elephant, so he bought a mouse”,Mr Sadr created the Shia paramilitary Mehdi Army to resist the Americans. He was later to stand this down during the Sunni-Shia sectarian mass killings of 2006-7, saying that it had been infiltrated by people not under his control.He was denounced by the US as a pro-Iranian proxy, but he has made clear over the years that he opposes Iranian interference as well as that of other countries.The Sadrist success in the election this month will be unwelcome in both Washington and Tehran.The US had done everything it could to back Mr Abadi as a victorious war leader and a sort of Iraqi Winston Churchill – forgetting, perhaps, that Churchill lost the British general election in 1945.Mr Sadr’s influence over an incoming government in Baghdad puts in doubt the future of the 10,000 American troops and military contractors in Iraq, though a Sadrist spokesman said after the election that US training and the weapons procurement from the US could continue.World news in picturesWorld news in picturesPalestinians run away from tear gas shot at them by Israeli forces during a protest in Ramallah, in the occupied West BankA Palestinian demonstrator runs during a protest against the US embassy move to Jerusalem and ahead of the 70th anniversary of the Nakba at the Israel-Gaza border.A bullet hole on the window of a cafe in Paris, the day after a knifeman killed one man and wounded four other people before being shot dead by policeGermany\u0027s Chancellor Angela Merkel looks on after receiving the \u0027Lamp of Peace, the Nobel Catholic award for her work of conciliation for the peaceful cohabitation of peoples at The Basilica Superiore of St Francis of Assisi in Italy.Police forensics investigate the death of seven people in a suspected murder-suicide in Australia.

When I interviewed him five years ago he warned against Sunni-Shia sectarianism and foreign interference. He said: “The Iraqi people will disintegrate, its government will disintegrate and it will be easy for foreign powers to control the country.” This prediction was to be fulfilled six months later when Isis took Mosul and the Iraqi army broke up.Mr Sadr said that sectarianism was spreading at street level and “if it spreads among the people, it will be difficult to fight”.Iraqi politics is still largely based on sectarian or ethnic identity – Shia, Sunni and Kurd – but the religious parties that were in the ascendant after 2003 have discredited themselves. The majority Shia community is also more confident, after its military victories last year, that it is firmly in control and is not going to be dispossessed from power.Mr Sadr said that the problem was that the Iraqi psychology had been shaped by a “constant cycle of violence: Saddam, occupation, war after war, first Gulf war, the second Gulf war, then the occupation war”.The election this month, in which so many voters gave priority to social rather than security issues, may show that, as violence ebbs, Iraqis are becoming less traumatised.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

some of which are still being developed - and automation to streamline procedures while removing the need for physical customs checks wherever possible.But both methods have been rejected by the EU, adding to momentum for Remainers who believe that remaining in the customs union is the only viable option if Britain is to solve the Irish border problem."},{"url":"https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/1/590x/Alexandra-Hotel-in-Derby-is-a-royal-wedding-free-zone-961075.jpg","title":"royal wedding meghan markle prince harry wedding free zone alexandra pub derby","story":"MIRRORPIXAlexandra Hotel in Derby is a royal wedding-free zoneTHE royal wedding is sending the world into a frenzy but one pub has BANNED any mention of Meghan Markle and Prince Harry, with punishment for anyone who dares say their names.The Alexandra Hotel in Derby has declared itself a royal wedding free zone.Anyone who mentions the forthcoming nuptials in the Derby watering hole, has to pay up into the pub\u0027s charity tin.Landlady Anna Dyson-Edge said: A lot of out customers are blokes and they are not interested in it.

This shy man with an allergy to publicity will tug on the heartstrings of the world at Meghan’s wedding to Harry.Because no matter how awkward it feels to be under the pitiless gaze of planet Earth, Thomas Markle is above and beyond all else, a proud and loving father.No matter how bashful his instincts may be, no matter how comfortable he was in obscure retirement in Rosarito, Mexico, I would bet my life that there was never a chance that he would miss his daughter’s wedding. Thomas Markle is clearly — and understandably — apprehensive about the big day.He has been seen in one of his local cafes in Mexico, head buried in a book called Images Of Britain. At an internet cafe, he stares with some bewilderment at the engagement photos of Meghan and Harry. But what father of the bride, any bride, would not feel a giddy cocktail of pride, anxiety and a touch of sadness at the prospect of walking his baby girl down the aisle?I doubt if he is enjoying the big build-up — having a wedding suit made to fit his bear-like frame, contemplating meeting the Queen, Prince Philip and the sprawling royal clan, and, horror of horrors, working out what to say when he rises to his feet to make that wedding speech.But Thomas Markle’s nerves about the big day do not make him a misfit or a freak. They make him gloriously human. Meghan Markle is loved because she brings some Hollywood flash to our staid, stoic, rather fusty Royal Family.But Meghan is also loved because she seems strangely familiar to us — a mixed-race child of divorced parents, divorced herself and a working woman who has fought hard for her success.Beyond the showbiz gloss, we have some understanding of the life of Meghan Markle. Because millions of our own lives are not so different.Because no matter how self-conscious this shy man feels taking to the global stage, his overwhelming emotions on his daughter’s wedding day will be love and pride. As any father of the bride will tell you, love and pride trump everything.IT is exciting news that Major League Baseball is coming to the capital for the first time next year, when the Boston Red Sox meet the New York Yankees at the London Stadium.  Mayor Sadiq Khan has worked hard to make this happen.WITH their fiery eyes and flashing thighs, female cadets in Vladimir Putin’s barmy Red Army look as though they are ready to invade somewhere.Possibly Stringfellows.WHAT makes Brexit inevitable is the total lack of respect shown to this country by Brussels since we decided to leave.German EU commissioner Gunther Oettinger sneers that Theresa May is “weak” and mocks Boris Johnson for having the same hair as Donald Trump.“That says everything,” sneers Herr Oettinger, 64, who once called a group of Chinese ministers “slitty-eyed” and has joked that gay marriage will become compulsory.And that says all you need to know about this buffoon. LABOUR’S Emily Thornberry has called for the Little Miss books to be renamed because they are sexist.“I don’t like this thing about being little,” says Emily. “I think that’s my problem with the Mr Men books.” Funny enough, that’s my problem with the Labour Party. The institutionalised sexism. The casual misogyny. The assumption that men should lead and the little ladies should tiptoe meekly behind.The Labour Party is at least as overtly sexist as the Little Miss books, Emily.The Tories are already on their second female Prime Minister while Labour have never even had a woman as their leader. Why not? It’s not as though the long line of miserable male mediocrities who have led Labour were much cop.It’s hard to believe that Barbara Castle or Yvette Cooper wouldn’t have done a better job of leading Labour than Foot, Kinnock, Brown, Miliband or Corbyn – who didn’t win one General Election between them.If Thornberry truly wants to prove that women can do anything that men can do, she should be demanding to know why no woman has ever led Labour in its 118-year-history.When washing down the next bacon butty, better stick to the decaffeinated coffee, Ed.SIR BOBBY ROBSON inspired the current managers of Manchester United and Manchester City, and inspired love in all who played for him from England to Barcelona, including Paul Gascoigne in his mercurial prime. Sir Bobby remains one of only two England managers to take our national team to a World Cup semi-final.The subject of a new feature film called Bobby Robson: More Than A Manager, Robson was clearly a wise and com-passionate man.In comparison, Sir Alf Ramse was a cold, distant and aloof figure with a robotic voice and a weird accent fabricated by elocution lessons. He went to school with my father – he should have talked like a Cockney, not the Duchess of Devonshire.But Sir Alf did it. He made the dream – that eternal dream of every England football fan – come true.So I have to beg to differ when Gary Lineker says that Sir Bobby Robson is the “best England manager of all time”. There is only one Sir Alf Ramsey.THE Met Gala is the most fashionable party in New York and this year the theme was Heavenly Bodies: Fashion and the Catholic Imagination – inspiring a host of celebrities to bowl up in what looked like deeply religious lingerie. Rihanna was possibly a mini-skirted Pope or perhaps a cleavage-flashing cardinal. Katy Perry was an angel.Rosie Huntington-Whiteley had a golden halo and a neckline that skimmed her navel. Madonna wore a crown made of multiple crucifixes.It is true that these Big Apple fashionistas – the Met Gala is hosted by the editor of American Vogue, Anna Wintour – would not have taken the mick out of any non-Christian religion. But perhaps that is a compliment to Christianity. It can be mocked by empty-headed, attention-seeking celebrities and nobody gets a death threat. Perhaps all religions should be this tolerant.“I no longer want to continue life,” said Dr Goodall before he died. “I’m happy to have the chance to end it.”Every one of us should have that choice. Dr Goodall should never have been compelled to go to Switzerland.IN more than 50 years of going to watch football matches, I have still never had one of those mythical half-time pies. But man and boy, I have collected football programmes. What could be a more evocative memento of a match? An overpriced replica shirt? A polyester team scarf? A football programme is the next best thing to memories.But now, after more than a century of programmes being sold on match days, the English Football League will decide in June if it will continue to make it compulsory for clubs to produce them.In the age of social media, the death of football programmes makes sense, although 600,000 of them are still sold every weekend. But there will be a little less magic in the world if they are allowed to die.I still have my treasured copy of England v West Germany in the World Cup Final of 1966. Second-hand editions go for anything from £10 for a fake to £10,000 for the real thing.But to me, that programme is priceless.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Because it is supported by wooden peers.”The second chamber that acts within constitutional conventions is beneficial and helps prevent the “elected dictatorship” that our system of government can create.Asking the Government and the House of Commons to think again is both reasonable and valuable — it also has a distinguished history.As long ago as 1539, when Henry VIII was at his most powerful, the Lords amended his Act of Proclamation, which would have allowed monarchical despotism.This is the first example I know of the Upper House acting successfully as a revising chamber and preserving the nation’s liberties. The legislation was so ineffective that it was repealed eight years later.It is that act which spawned the expression “Henry VIII powers”, now used to describe the ability of ministerial action to amend the law.In the EU Withdrawal Bill, it is wholly unexceptional for the Lords to seek to reduce the number and extent of the Henry VIII powers available to the Government.These are technical issues when it is a matter of judgement as to where the balance between efficiency and process lies. It is not an attack on the democratic process or a power grab by an unelected chamber.This is not true of some of the other amendments passed against the withdrawal bill. There is a rule that the Lords does not oppose manifesto commitments.It was introduced in the 1940s to stop an inbuilt Tory majority blocking the then Labour government’s programme.It has relevance of a particular kind today when a Labour and LibDem majority could vote down any government proposal it dislikes.As was found in the 1940s, the Lords needs to observe this self-denying ordinance if it is to maintain credibility, otherwise it quickly becomes a matter of Peers against the People.In trying to insist on the UK remaining in a customs union, the Lords has overturned a specific manifesto promise by the Conservatives. Removing the date of departure — March 29, 2019 — similarly overturns an implicit guarantee in the same document.These are two of the most egregious breaches of the convention and raise the question: What is the Lords for?Tomorrow, it may be about to get worse. There is an amendment to the Data Protection Bill to require the Government to carry out Part Two of the Leveson Inquiry.This is in the name of Baroness Hollins, who has every right to feel her family was badly treated by the Press. And although I disagree with her, she deserves considerable sympathy because of what happened.Nonetheless, she is on dangerous constitutional ground.Page 80 of the Tory party manifesto says: “Given the comprehensive nature of the first stage of the Leveson Inquiry and the lengthy investigations by the police and Crown Prosecution Service into alleged wrongdoing, we will not proceed with the second stage of the Leveson Inquiry into the culture, practices and ethics of the Press.”This could not be clearer, yet the Lords are contemplating legislating to force this second stage upon the nation. It is a clear and outright tearing up of conventions.Unfortunately, it is even more serious than an arrogant desire to overrule a manifesto commitment — it is a proposal for the Lords to do the opposite of what it is there to do.The Lords ought to protect the liberties of the country against attempts by the government to erode them.It used to do this when it opposed extensions to detention without trial or efforts to reduce freedom of speech.Now it is suggested it will do the reverse to make our media less free and to ignore fundamental rights of justice.In just four years, the UK has already fallen ten places — from 30th to 40th — in the global rankings for free speech.Dozens of journalists have been put on trial and mainly acquitted for the reporting of stories involving the police and other public officials.The Leveson Inquiry was used to put journalists in the public pillory and now it is proposed that this should happen all over again.People who have been acquitted of a crime have nothing further to answer for and to demand they go on oath to rehash issues settled by a jury is the type of bullying of the Press normally seen in totalitarian states.If Lady Hollins’s amendment were passed, it would be giving in to the vested interests of the rich and powerful to punish newspapers which had exposed their peccadilloes.It would deter the Press from such fearless reporting in future and would be an attack on one of our most ancient and precious freedoms, a pillar of our constitution.A free Press must not be bullied or harried by those who do not like what it reports or else self-censorship will be the rule of the day.Fundamental questions will arise about the Lords if it ignores the constitutional conventions, sets Peers against the People and, instead of being the bulwark against an over-mighty Government becomes the cheerleader for censorship.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It is enforceable.If foam-flecked ex-Labour leader Ed Miliband gets his way, we won’t be able to write it, either.We won’t be able to expose silly hypocrisy like this, let alone the misdeeds and corruption of those who abuse their power over us.We could soon be kissing goodbye to 300 years of Press freedom, the cornerstone of democracy.Red Ed’s campaign to curb newspapers might be applauded by the young voters Labour is seeking to cultivate — ­millennial “snowflakes” who cannot be in the same room as someone with a different point of view.They demand “safe spaces” to protect their sensitive souls or, better, a total ban on speakers they dislike.The attack on Press freedom by Labour — and, to their ­eternal shame, some Tories — is simply a monstrous extension of this intolerance.How can we have come within nine votes of state ­censorship?Soon we may be breaking a law if we fail to say “please” or “thanks” to ­someone who labels themselves a “victim” or a “survivor”.Survivors used to be people who escaped mortal danger.Today, they include anyone ­subjected to heavy-handed ­flirtation or mild embarrass-ment.This is one-way traffic.Self-proclaimed victims or survivors can say anything they like. They are exempt from ­criticism.Only whites can be racist. Only men can be sexist.All white men are “privileged” — another invented offence — ­simply because they are white and male.This group is decreed by the Left to embrace all Tories who, by definition, are “scum”. Only Tories can be cruel.Schools might churn out 16-year-olds who can’t read or write but that is apparently because Tories support ­grammar schools, not because left-wing teaching unions ­outlawed classroom ­discipline.A tower-block inferno could have erupted in Labour- controlled Islington but fate picked Kensington and “evil” Tories are now forever ­identified with the incineration of poor immigrants.The NHS is in crisis — and has been under every ­government for the past 30 years.But despite pouring ­billions into healthcare, Tory “scum” are to blame.Labour delivered mass ­immigration but it is the “vile” Tories who failed to see we would need extra houses, schools and hospitals.Welfare was out of control but it was “callous” Tories who swapped jobs for benefits.Now, preposterously, the United Nations apparently agrees.After a brief flying visit — and without a shred of ­evidence — the UN’s racism busybody, Zambian Tendayi Achiume, says we are a racist nation in breach of international human rights laws, thanks to Brexit and austerity.Has she been to Europe recently, where attitudes to immigration suggest Britain is in fact a haven of tolerance and integration?Luckily, ­people are not ­stupid. They can sniff ­hypocrisy.So it is refreshing to see, in poll after poll, they put those evil Tory scum running this country ahead of saintly Jezza’s Labour Party.Can I say that?Tessa’s political achievements were significant, not least London’s 2012 Olympics triumph.But what set her apart was her role as good- natured peacemaker and cross-party conciliator.In the Blair-Brown years she was a smiling bridge builder for the embattled Blair government, not just with the press but with members of other ­parties who now mourn her death.This talent is now vanishingly rare.Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour could learn a lot from her example of old-fashioned give and take across the political divide.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It took only days for peers to resurrect it.Another inquiry would be an obscene waste of time and money and serves no purpose. The public do not want it. Even  opposes it.It’s not hard to see why some peers might have a vested interest in silencing the media.Some have been exposed by the Press for wrongdoing — whether it was fiddling their expenses or having extra-marital affairs.And many of the Labour peers rooting for it believe their party has been unfairly covered in the media.They want newspapers they can tame into giving them an easy ride. Well, that is not the role of the Press in a democracy.The Leveson inquiry and subsequent police probes cost taxpayers more than £48million after dozens of failed trials against journalists.Leveson’s 2012 report ran to 1,987 pages and contained over a million words. What do these peers seriously think is left to learn?They are foolish, too, to think the media landscape looks as it once did. Today, Facebook and Google dominate. Most newspapers belong to IPSO, a self-funded, independent regulator that holds the Press to account more than any regulator before.Then again, this is not really about probing the relationship between cops and the Press, or phone-hacking. That is a Trojan horse.These politicians, with their celebrity pals at Hacked Off, really just want to see newspapers neutered. This must not be allowed to happen.Traditionally, the House of Lords respects the Government’s manifesto commitments. The Tory manifesto said they would not pursue the second part of Leveson. That peers have so recklessly binned a constitutional convention is disgraceful.Britain has slumped in the global ranking for free speech. In the past four years, we have fallen from 30th to 40th. “Leveson 2” would mean we shamefully fall even further.Our free Press may not be perfect, but it noisily holds power to account. Our country is all the better for it.No one who values liberty would have it any other way.BRITISH politics has lost one of its good guys.The outpouring of tributes for Tessa Jowell highlights how widely she was admired as a politician and, more importantly, as a person.

Leaving ANY part of the EU is “Hard Brexit” now. It is laughable.Who do they imagine would tell 17.4million people their votes were to be ignored?Not Miliband, hiding in Manhattan.These Remain ultras are blind to the obvious: that the story has moved on.And that — while the nation is divided and Brexit negotiations are struggling — THEY are largely to blame, for laying siege to the referendum result itself.Their every word stokes division, helps Brussels and harms Britain.MPs must kill the second Leveson Inquiry.There is simply no case in this new, transformed media landscape — far more tightly regulated, yet dominated by UNREGULATED tech giants — for yet another public examination into alleged wrongdoing long ago.

It is to the Left’s shame that they act as its stooges.Andrew Parker is immersed in the facts about the Salisbury poisoning and other outrages. The Kremlin, he says, is guilty of “criminal thuggery” and covers its tracks with “bare-faced” lies.This should be indisputable. But Labour is now run by the gangster state’s apologists.

Everyone cheers.He does a fist pump to his mates and she pulls down her boob tube, flashing her breasts at her girlfriends.The same guy went on to have sex with five other women that evening.By the end of the night he was rubbing cocaine on his willy to try to maintain an erection.Over one summer I saw people having sex on stage, witnessed vast quantities of alcohol downed in seconds and dodged more puke on pavements in one hour than an A\u0026ampE nurse cleans up over New Year’s Eve.It might sound depraved and debauched but the fortnight rite of passage ensured those same kids returned home as smarter and wiser adults.Over the years I have made ­countless 18-30-based documentaries around the Med.The behaviour is wilder and more X-rated than any brochure can suggest — without it being relegated to the top shelf.That’s why I am gutted that there is a question mark dangling over the experience Club 18-30 owners Thomas Cook said this week it is “exploring options” for the brand’s future, including a possible sale.Naysayers may comment “bloody good riddance” to the iconic institution that sticks two fingers up to political correctness. But I disagree.Back in the Eighties and Nineties there were no low-cost flights to Alicante or flight-comparison websites.Instead the entire package tour was laid on for you — and there were zero complaints.The hotels were laughably basic. The food was about as foreign as a Maccy D’s.The pools often had more than lilos floating in them. But none of that mattered.The “factory fortnight” annual leave was when things really kicked off in resorts such as Ibiza’s San Antonio and Corfu’s Kavos.When the night flights churned out the up-for-it guys and girls, most didn’t bother going to bed.When you arrived the reps flogged you the tours that went with the holiday — the bar crawls, booze cruises and wet T-shirt contests.In reality, the price of the add-on excursions doubled the cost of the holiday. But no one cared because to decline was to miss out on the opportunity for lots of sex.Sex underpins the 18-30 experience and the games designed by the reps encourage it.Whether it is passing a water-filled condom down a line using only your thighs, or timing who can put the condom on an oiled courgette the quickest.To be a holiday rep you need the drinking stamina of an elephant and the energy of the Duracell bunny. Many burned out or got kicked out and sent back to the UK. Holiday reps aren’t supposed to shag one another — obviously that rule goes out the window the second the plane lifts off from Britain.In every resort I have filmed at, the reps have kept score of the ­number of women they had sex with. Did the girls know this? Absolutely. Did they care? No.Is it a suspect institution rotten to the core? Nope. What I saw is that underneath the sex, the dubious games and the round-the-clock drinking was an 18-30 safety net that protected men and women on ­holiday. The bar crawls were staffed by dozens of reps ensuring everyone got safely from one pub to another.Admittedly by the end of each bar crawl it wasn’t unusual to see couples attempting to have sex against the bar, someone crashed out on the pavement in his urine-stained jeans or a girl face down in a goldfish-sized cocktail bowl of her own vomit.But the purpose of the night was to consume enough shots to fill an Olympic-sized swimming pool — and make it out alive afterwards.The opportunity for sex is jumped on every minute of the day. I made the mistake of meeting the groups I was filming for a morning-after catch-up.I soon stopped using my universal door card key — because I’d often interrupt a couple in the kitchen, the loo or even on the balcony going at it hell for leather.The same women who prefer the missionary position and the lights off in the bedroom back in the UK don’t give a monkeys when they are away.It can be the only reason so many willingly enter the wet T-shirt competitions.My theory is the more that a girl says “no way” the more likely you are to see her on stage, arms in the air, egging the crowd on with her soaked top clinging to her braless boobs.Us Brits are certainly not afraid to get wet and wildInclude a contact number and any pics when emailing into features@the-sunWho are we to judge if — for some women — there is something empowering about a bloke pouring a jug of water over her nipples? No one was forced to do it, either.While filming a beach sunrise, I got used to seeing women doing the walk of shame to their hotel. Sick in their hair, one shoe missing but usually with a cheeky smile on their faces. Sloping off to do the deed in the dunes And the beaches get busier when the sun goes down. While on a pub crawl it is easier to slope off to the sandy stretches than it is to bonk in an awkward, tiny loo with pee all over the floor.We could always tells those who had done the deed in the dunes — bites on their legs and sand burns on their knees. My favourite nights to film were out with groups of girls. “We’re not here for a long time, we’re here for a good time!” was the motto of one lot I followed.Make no mistake. Every girl had already earmarked their target.Getting ready and the female camaraderie was just as important as the night out itself. And if you didn’t get laid? You always had a mate to walk back to the apartment with. Perhaps the most outrageous nights were the foam parties.When the soapy liquid was fired over the dance floor it was as though a “have sex now!” klaxon had sounded. Clothes would regularly be lost in the foam. More than once I saw women in a panic because after the foam had evaporated they had nothing to wear to go home in.It wasn’t all sex, either. During one season a couple had a holiday romance and got engaged on the dance floor. On another island I’ve seen a holiday rep have the confidence to come out. For those who went home without a tan it was to be celebrated.But in the middle of the chaos, these holidays are a rite of passage that forge friendships, teach kids about responsibility and let them make the mistakes that turn teenagers into adults — and I for one am sad to see them go.FOR decades Club 18-30 promised a debauched week of sun, sea and sex.For many it was their first ever trip abroad, delivering cheap, basic accommodation and the freedom to misbehave with impunity (and no chance of an embarrassing Facebook post alerting folks back home).Fast forward through the decades and today’s Millennial youngsters are light years ahead of their parents. They’ve been on umpteen foreign holidays with their families and got used to decent hotels and great pools.So now our sophisticated young travellers are looking further – and wanting more. The success of TV show Love Island conjoured up the paradise excess they all wanted to emulate.Add to that Instagrammers bragging about their global travels and Snapchat feeds full of celebs living it large in luxury and today’s youngsters aren’t satisfied with a dodgy 2H hotel in Malia and a pub crawl up Bar Street.Today’s youngsters with limited budgets are savvy enough to know how to book a holiday on one of the many online travel agencies.Thomas Cook is now targetting the Millennials with money who want to be seen in the right resorts with plenty of selfie-perfect settings.It’s new Cook’s Club hotels – the first of which will open in Crete this summer – will offer urban-cool, stylish rooms, decent food and chilled tunes around a signature pool.Thomas Cook wants to ditch the lower end of the market to concentrate on those aspiring Millennials prepared to dig deeper to emulate their social media idols.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

A senior female member of staff discovered “inappropriate material of a sexual nature” in their station cupboard.That is, she found a pair of novelty tea mugs which featured nude women with the crew members’ heads super-imposed on them.They had swapped them as secret Santa gifts.Four other crew members have resigned in protest at the sackings, locals have started a petition to reinstate the pair and long-term donors have threatened to withdraw funding. But the RNLI insists it has not gone overboard. A statement claims the incident was “not trivial” as the saucy mugs presented a “safeguarding breach”.“Safeguarding” in this context clearly has nothing to do with the physical safety of those at risk of drowning, ostensibly the remit of the RNLI. One of the offenders had 15 years’ experience of saving lives at sea, which he is now forbidden to make use of.Apparently, safeguarding the emotional safety of any potential offence-taker is more important. Similarly, few will be surprised to hear of a humour deficit in academia. But one incident shows that a poorly received joke is no laughing matter.At the annual meeting of the International Studies Association (ISA) in San Francisco, some scholars found themselves in a crowded hotel lift. Simona Sharoni, a professor of women’s and gender studies at Merrimack College in Massachusetts, offered to press the buttons for her colleagues.Richard Ned Lebow, a political scientist at King’s College London, jokingly asked to be let off at the “ladies’ lingerie” department. It was a fairly standard, if old-fashioned, gag. But Sharoni claims that “as a survivor of sexual harassment”, she was “quite shaken by this incident”. Later that day she lodged a formal complaint.Hearing she had done it, Lebow attempted to reach out to her, writing that: “Like you, I am strongly opposed to the exploitation, coercion or humiliation of women.”However, making such a “frivolous” complaint, he argued, risked diverting attention from “the real offences that trouble us both”. By describing the obviously frivolous complaint as frivolous, he aggravated matters further, it seems. Sharoni hit back, saying she “cannot and will not remain silent when misogyny is at play”.She was not alone in confusing a harmless attempt at humour with a hatred for womankind.Last week, the ISA upheld her complaint, ordering Lebow to write an “unequivocal apology” for his “offensive and inappropriate” joke or face disciplinary action.To his credit, he has refused to comply and denounced the ISA’s ruling as a “horrifying and chilling example of political correctness” that “encourages others to censor their remarks for fear of retribution”.No reasonable adult of sound mind, with any experience of real life, could possibly find Lebow’s joke about ladies’ lingerie offensive, let alone misogynistic. But policing of such saucy jokes is more common than you would think.Free Speech University Rankings, recently revealed by online free speech website Spiked, showed some British universities and students’ unions have bans on offensive jokes and banter — usually as part of their policies against sexual harassment.And it is not just jobsworth bosses, snow- flake students and highly strung academics taking offence at harmless banter — as saucy puns can even become a police matter. A butcher in Staffordshire was recently rapped by the police for the innuendo-laden signs outside his shop.Slogans promoting “big-breasted birds”, “big cocks” and offers to “have your rump tenderized” have adorned his boards for ten years. No member of the public felt sufficiently offended to complain to the police in that time.Nevertheless, the local police chief inspector warned the butcher to “give careful consideration” to his slogans, in case anyone takes offence in future. The joyless claims that smutty humour constitutes sexual harassment, a safe- guarding breach or any tangible harm whatsoever, are certainly worthy of ridicule.But when jokes no naughtier than Victorian postcards can see people disciplined and sacked, and innuendos no saucier than a Carry On one-liner draw the attention of the police, we need to get serious about defending smut.Fraser Myers writes for spiked-online, where this article also appears.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

What Labour do every time they’re in government - they’d have sold Britain out.”The PM insisted voters “simply cannot trust” anything Labour say.And she also sent out a message to all MPs who are trying to backslide on the referendum result - saying: I consider it to be a matter of integrity of politicians that having given the choice to the British people, we should then deliver for them on that choice.Mrs May is currently trying to thrash out an agreement on what customs arrangement to push for once we have quit the EU.But Labour is also divided - with backbenchers pushing Mr Corbyn to support plans to keep Britain tied to the European single market.During todays PMQs, Mrs May also announced that the Government will pick up the full £400million bill for removing dangerous cladding from tower blocks in the wake of the Grenfell disaster."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/nintchdbpict000404427254.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"stephen lawrence friend duwayne brooks tories mayor of london sadiq khan","story":"Speaking exclusively to The Sun, gang crime campaigner Duwayne Brooks branded Labours Sadiq Khan “the worst Mayor ever” as he revealed he has joined Theresa May’s party.He said: “I’ve made the decision to join the party in Government - because I want to be able give young black men a voice, across not just London but across the country.”Mr Brooks, who was with the slain teen when he was stabbed by racist thugs in 1993, last night slammed Labour for letting black community down with “poor houses, poor education and high crime”.And he urged Mr Khan to get a grip on rising violence in the capital or quit.Mr Brooks was waiting at the bus stop in Eltham with 18-year-old Stephen when the pair were brutally set upon in an unprovoked attack in 1993.He previously served as a Liberal Democrat councillor in Lewisham, South-East London and stood as an independent candidate in last month’s local elections.He was awarded an OBE in 2015 for his campaigning work.Now senior Tories believe he could be their man to run for City Hall in 2020.One London Conservatives source said: He would be a brilliant candidate to take on Londons failing Mayor.Yesterday Mr Brooks blasted incumbent Sadiq Khan over the politan Police’s controversial “Gang Violence Matrix” that a recent report found to be racially discriminatory.The police database holds information on thousands of people deemed a threat to community safety, but the Met have admitted 1,500 names on the list posed no threat to the public.Taking aim at the Labour Mayor, Mr Brooks blasted: “I don’t understand nobody has called for his head to roll following the discovery of the Gang Matrix.“It is beyond me that Amber Rudd can be forced to resign on issues that were nothing to do with her, and yet here here we have Sadiq Khan who must have had knowledge that this gang matrix document existed.“And he hasn’t apologised to London, he hasn’t apologised to black Londoners.”He added: “This is why London needs a voice, why young black men need a voice. And Labour isn’t that voice for young black men. I’ve seen it, I’ve experienced it.He added: “Labour failed us, and London predominantly.“Yet we have a Mayor that seems to not recognise that his leadership is part of the problem in London.”Asked if he could run for City Hall himself, Mr Brooks said he was focusing on his community work but did not rule out a bid one day.The Conservative party declined to comment.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Surprisingly good shape if you’re one of those Remainer banshees who said the entire country would be worth about two bob by now — no investment, no jobs, swarms of killer bees and plagues of locusts.Not a bit of it. Take employment. We now have the highest employment levels, and the lowest unemployment, for 42 years. We have an unemployment rate of 4.2 per cent.Would you like to know how our major European partners are getting on in that regard? Well, it’s 9.2 per cent in France, 10.8 per cent in Italy, a whopping 16.4 per cent in Spain and, of course, 20.9 per cent in chicken-in-a-basket case Greece.We’re even closing in on Germany, at 3.6 per cent.So that’s not bad for starters. Average earnings are at last rising, too. Inflation is down. Business investment is up.Better still, we are experiencing the kind of export boom we haven’t seen for a long time. A massive ten per cent increase in the past year.And for those who think this will all come to a halt when we actually leave the EU — um, no.The official statistics predict the boom is going to grow and grow. By 2020 it will have increased by 22 per cent. Much, much quicker than the growth in exports in EU countries.By then, of course, we’ll have an entire world to trade with, free of restraint.Assuming the Government doesn’t bugger it up by keeping us in the EU’s customs union.So, contrary to what you are often told, the news is all rather good for the UK.And there’s another country where the economy is looking pretty good, too.Donald Trump’s USA. The stockmarket is soaring to record levels. The economy is growing at a more than decent rate.But who have been the main winners of Trump’s presidency when it comes to the economy?Horrible rich white business-men, you might guess. That’s what was said when he won the presidency — he’d look after people like himself.Nope again. Dead wrong. The main beneficiaries have been the poorest of Americans. And in particular the blacks and Hispanics. Unemployment is down, employment is up.There are more black and Hispanic people in work than at any time under Barack Obama’s hopeless administration.Under Obama, the country was paying out record amounts in welfare benefits and food stamps for its black and Hispanic citizens.And if Trump manages to strike some kind of lasting peace deal with North Korea, he’ll deserve the Nobel prize.So here’s a prediction.Despite the toddler temper tantrums among Lefties whenever the name Trump is mentioned, despite the curled lip and sneer from BBC news reporters, the shrieking protest marches from thick-as-mince unwashed millennials, despite all that,I’ll bet you now that Donald Trump gets re-elected.But don’t expect to hear much about any of this on the BBC’s News at Ten.A NEW survey has discovered what British people worry about most.What is it? Maybe the spectre of Diane Abbott being Home Secretary? Global warming? Nuclear warfare? Or the black shadow of death hanging over their heads?Nope. It’s “not being in when a parcel is delivered”.Just how crap a worry is that? And people lie awake at night.Gripped by the terror that the Amazon delivery man might call round with the spare part for the hedge-trimmer when they’re down the shops.SO, you lot – you’re all gammons, apparently.That’s the name given by Jeremy Corbyn supporters to working-class people who voted for Brexit.You are dense lumps of pig meat. Which is often served with a fried egg and some chips. And a bit of pineapple on top.They coined the phrase because some of the Brexiteers seen on Question Time have red faces. OK.Many people have called this “racist”. Sometimes I think there is nothing in this world of ours which couldn’t be called racist by someone desperate to be offended.It’s not racist. But it tells you exactly what the Labour Party thinks of working-class people, doesn’t it?HERE we go again. England fans have been warned not to take the flag of St George with them if they go to support our lads in the World Cup finals in Russia.The police have told them the flag is too “imperialistic” and “antagonistic”.So, every other nation will be waving their flag.

Or you’ll end up looking like one of those glo-sticks children wave around.Wait until the tournament is held in a civilised country.(So that’s Qatar out too then).Listen, it’s just a matter of economics.Making a dress the size of a bleedin’ aircraft hangar costs more than it does to make a nice size 12. It uses more material.So either cut out the seven stuffed-crust pizzas you eat every day for your elevenses, plus the bucket of chicken wings.Or pay the extra price.MORE good news – the Government has voted down attempts to strangle the Press.There will be no new Leveson inquiry.What’s more, it looks like Tom Watson is going to give up on his ludicrous campaign to force newspapers to pay court fees even when they win legal proceedings against them.Tom dreamed this up presumably with help from his best chum, the former fascist Max “Beat me, beat me, Brunehilde!” Mosley.Dead in the water, Watson.THINGS In This World I Don’t Care Much About (No 1): Whether Meghan’s dad Thomas, makes it to the wedding or not.

People need to know. It could have gone differently if he had other intentions to hurt her or to traffic her,” she told Dallas News.According to her, the relationship between Gilstrap-Portley and the 14-year old freshman was never sexual.She only said she had had concerns about the age difference and although she had never met him, they two had spoken over the phone.He was always respectful to me. He said he understood my concerns but said that he was only 17 and that he didnt see a problem with them dating.Gilstrap-Portley’s deception was eventually revealed after one of his former basketball coaches from North Mesquite recognised him at a tournament and alerted the school.Robyn Harris, spokeswoman for the local school district authority, said they believe the motivation behind Gilstrap-Portley’s trickery was to play basketball.The youngster graduated from his high school North Mesquite in 2011 and went on to play college basketball for the Dallas Christian College between 2013 and 2014, but was not drafted by the NBA.Missing his basketball glory days, Gilstrap-Portley enrolled back to high school in the aftermath of Hurricane Harvey.Schools in the area opened their doors to evacuees who may not have had full documentation or records after the tropical storm battered the southern state last year, displacing thousands and inflicting damages worth billions of dollars.“He took that as an opportunity to gain access to our schools,” Harris said. “He was fairly savvy to be able to utilise that type of position, knowing that we were accepting Harvey students.”In a letter to parents sent on Tuesday, Hillcrest High principal Chris Bayer said the school immediately notified authorities after being made aware a student had been enrolled under “false pretences.”Bayer also said the “unique situation” highlighted how improvements needed to be made regarding opening schools to students in time of need."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/nintchdbpict0004045226521.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"royal wedding sadiq khan tube closures travel","story":"Sadiq Khan is under pressure to scrap engineering works set to bring parts of the capital to a halt on one of the busiest days of the year.Hundreds of thousands of people are expected to travel around London this Saturday, heading towards the Royal Wedding in Windsor, the FA Cup final at Wembley or public wedding parties in major parks.The Mayor has now launched an urgent review after being warned the closures could be disastrous.Most of the Circle and District Lines of the tube will be closed on Saturday, as well as a long stretch of the London Overground.There are fears the engineering works will make it much harder for those travelling to Windsor or Wembley.Other Londoners and tourists will be travelling to huge viewing parties including one in Greenwich and another in Chelsea.Keith Prince of the London Tories told The Sun: It is not acceptable on such an eventful weekend to disrupt tube lines with maintenance works.

Ministers have caved into pressure from campaigners to tackle the machines dubbed the crack cocaine of gambling which can devastate lives in minutes. David Cameron shelved plans when he was PM – but Theresa May gave the go-ahead when she moved into Downing Street. Punters can currently pump \u0026pound100 every 20 seconds into the machines for games such as roulette and blackjack. Betting firms launched a huge campaign opposing the move with warnings about job losses and losses to the Treasury in tax revenue. Research by KPMG estimated a \u0026pound2 limit would cut revenue for the Treasury by \u0026pound1.1bn over three years, an annual loss of \u0026pound45m to local authorities and \u0026pound50m to British racing. But today Culture Minister Matt Hancock revealed the government had prioritised vulnerable people over the gambling industry. And Ministers said they would raise the Remote Gaming Duty, paid by online gambling companies, at the next budget to offset tax losses. Hancock described the machines as a social blight and say they have taken the decision to do everything we can to protect vulnerable people.  Sports Minister Tracey Crouch said that a large number of people seeking treatment for addiction say FOBTs are their main form of gambling. But today Matt Hancock refused to say how soon the change would come in. Maximum stakes will need parliamentary approval before it comes into action and the government have said they want to give the gambling industry sufficient time to make the changes. The machines took \u0026pound1,000 from a gambler on more than 233,000 occasions in a single year. And individual losses have been known to reach nearly \u0026pound14,000 in a single session of play.  Interim findings by the Gambling Commission suggested cutting the maximum stake to \u0026pound30. But campaigners have demanded the stake be slashed to \u0026pound2 tackle addiction and linked crimes. Bookies claimed jobs will be lost, profits cut and taxes paid to the Treasury will fall if the Government bows to pressure and announces a new \u0026pound2 minimum. Earlier this week, William Hill’s boss wrote to Theresa May claiming slashing the stakes would be “catastrophic”.  Roger Devlin wrote: “Sadly, I fear that your Government is about to make a decision that is unnecessary and lacking in evidence - a decision that will also be catastrophic for a retail betting industry employing over 40,000 people.” “Consolidation within our sector continues and I would also not want to see the impact of a disproportionate… outcome being a factor in the name of William Hill being added to the list of companies now in foreign ownership.” While Betfred warned that 900 of the firm’s shops would become loss-making overnight, forcing it to axe 4,500 jobs in a letter to MPs this week.  But today Ministers risked the ire of the gambling industry by introducing the cap by taking the dramatic measure. Announcing the maximum stake, Culture Secretary Matt Hancock said: “When faced with the choice of halfway measures or doing everything we can to protect vulnerable people, we have chosen to take a stand. These machines are a social blight and prey on some of the most vulnerable in society, and we are determined to put a stop to it and build a fairer society for all.” Bookmaker William Hill claimed the cut to \u0026pound2 a spin could trigger a wave of shop closures and wipe up to \u0026pound100m off its annual salesprofits. In a stock market statement it said: “A regulatory change of this nature is unprecedented and its impact on customer behaviour will not be fully known until some years after implementation.” It warned the cut to \u0026pound2 would result in 900 of its shops - 38% of its total - becoming loss making. The firm warned: “A proportion of these would be at risk of being closed within a relatively short time.” Boss Philip Bowcock said: “The Government has handed us a tough challenge today and it will take some time for the full impact to beunderstood, for our business, the wider high street and key partners like horseracing.” Online giant Sky Bet, based in Leeds, slammed the increase in gaming taxes that will hit firms like it. Boss Richard Flint said: “Sky Betting \u0026amp Gaming doesn’t have any FOBTs but now we – and Yorkshire’s economy – risk being punished because of them. “Any increase in Remote Gaming Duty is a tax on hi-tech Yorkshire jobs.” But across politics the move has been welcomed. Shadow culture minister Tom Watson said he was absolutely delighted and that he hoped it would alleviate some of the misery caused by problem gambling in Britain. He said bookies had boxed themselves into a corner by refusing to back down on the issue and diversify into less dangerous forms of gambling. Bookies Paddy Power Betfair which has a much bigger online arm than William Hill welcomed the news. In a statement they said: “We’ve consistently called for a significant stake cut which would take this issue off the table, so we’re pleased that the Secretary of State and Government has acted so decisively. “Our industry provides a fun, exciting experience for the vast majority of customers and it makes sense to try and get back to that by removing what had become a toxic issue. “Today’s move will have a short-term impact on our business, but we think it’s a really important step towards building a sustainable industry”. As well as the cap, ministers have taken moves to toughen up protections around online gambling including stronger age verification rules. They are also examining proposals to require operators to set limits on consumers’ spending until affordability checks have been conducted. While Public Health England will carry out a review of the evidence relating to the public health harms of gambling Last year a report found more than two million people were addicted to gambling or at risk of developing a problem. It said about 430,000 people suffer from a serious habit. Adam Bradford, 25, a campaigner for stricter gambling controls welcomed the change. Adam\u0027s father David had a 30-year secret gambling addiction and hid it from his family, remortgaging their home in secret and stealing tens of thousands of pounds from his employer. He went to jail and served a sentence for fraud. Adam and David said today: “We are delighted that the Government has finally seen sense on this important issue. No longer will gamblers be able to run into serious trouble on the High Street and betting has been restored to a leisure activity.  It is also pleasing to see consideration given to advertising and the rise of online gambling however the measures such as affordability checks will not go far enough to prevent people from the dangers of online betting. “We believe all adverts for gambling should be banned, there is no need for them. We also believe more can be done to track risky online betting behaviour as more gamblers will now move their betting online after high street betting becomes less of a tempting option.” “In response to the industry’s scare tactics threatening job losses, we believe the industry will be able to stay sustainable through further strengthening their ranges of products and ensuring these are rolled out responsibly. We are unsure what calculations have been used to come up with these shocking job loss figures. The chief executive of amusement machine industry trade body Bacta, John White, welcomed the announcement. He said: A stake reduction to \u0026pound2 has long been needed to protect consumers from the harm caused by FOBTs. This is a decision that puts player protection first, and will allow the gambling industry as a whole to move forwards and create a safer, more socially responsible environment for consumers. It is a testament to the wide-ranging campaign for stake reduction from concerned individuals and organisations across politics, public health and the wider gaming sector. The Government has made the right decision and it now needs to be implemented without delay.

There was a furious backlash after Dame Judith Hackitt\u0027s review failed to recommend banning the materials with campaigners branding it a whitewash and a betrayal. Instead her report, which was commissioned in the wake of the tragedy which killed 72 people, calls for a new single regulator to be set up, with a tougher testing regime for building owners and managers and more serious penalties for those who choose to “game the system” and put residents at risk. The report calls for construction firms to devise contracts with subcontractors which “specifically state that safety requirements must not be compromised for cost reduction”. But the report does not call for any specific type of cladding to be banned. James Brokenshire told MPs that he was expecting private landlords to act responsibly but if they refuse I\u0027m not ruling anything out. Mr Brokenshire also said he will not hesitate to ban desk-top studies in building safety tests. Speaking in the House of Commons three hours later after the publication of the report, Mr Brokenshire said: We are consulting on significantly restricting or banning the use of desk-top studies to assess cladding systems.  He added: Having listened carefully to concerns, the government will consult on banning the use of combustible materials in cladding systems on high-rise residential buildings. But Labour\u0027s John Healey, who has described the report as a \u0027missed opportunity, told the Secretary of State: Don\u0027t consult on it, do it - 72 people died. And he said that both Dubai and Australia had banned the materials following similar fires in high-rise blocks. He said: We owe it to the Grenfell residents and we owe it to residents in tower blocks with Grenfell-style cladding.

A total of 53 pacts with “confidentiality clauses” have been struck in the past five years preventing disgruntled workers from speaking out, a senior MP has admitted. Deterring further complaints was one of the reasons given for defending covering up agreements. Campaigning Labour frontbencher Justin Madders unearthed the figures after it emerged a former private secretary to Commons Speaker John Bercow was paid \u0026pound86,250 in 2010 as part of a deal requiring him to sign a non-disclosure agreement. Mr Madders said: “These figures reveal a concerning pattern that raises serious questions about the culture operating in Parliament. “Any employer, let alone one that should be an exemplar to the nation, ought to be asking itself serious questions about why so many employees have been asked to sign these agreements.  “If those who may have been mistreated at work are bought off and silenced in this way then it is difficult to see how those who are responsible for these actions can ever be held to account. “Parliament needs to clean up its act and that has to start with it being honest with itself about the problems it has.” Mr Bercow’s former official Angus Sinclair claimed the Speaker shouted at him, undermined him in front of other staff, swore and attempted to physically intimidate him. A mobile phone smashed on the desk in front of him on one occasion, he said. Mr Bercow has denied all allegations of bullying. A written parliamentary answer shows that since 2013, “the Commons has signed a number of settlement agreements with employees (formerly known as compromise agreements)”. It goes on: “In some cases, the House has reached agreements with individuals through ACAS (Advisory, Conciliation AND Arbitration Service), which are equivalent to settlement agreements but known as COT3 agreements.  “The majority of these have brought the employment contract to an end, although there have been a small number of in-employment settlements.” The deals were used eight times last year on 15 occasions in 2016 five times in 2015 14 times in 2014 and 11 times in 2013. Answering for the Commons Commission, Lib Dem MP Tom Brake, said: “Confidentiality clauses are included in all or almost all of these agreements. “Confidentiality clauses are intended to protect both the employer and the employee, as well as to ensure that the content of the settlement agreement itself is not discussed (so, for example, neither side will reveal how much, if any, money was paid under the agreement). “An agreement will often include an agreed reference or public statement from the employer about the employee, and the confidentiality agreement will state that the only comment made by either party will be in the specified form.” Mr Brake, a former Minister, said that gagging clauses “have no longer been included as a matter of course” since January 2015. He insisted: “Each case is considered on its merits.

But Dominic Cummings, who has declined a series of invitations, has said the committee is more interested in \u0027grandstanding PR\u0027 rather than \u0027truth-seeking\u0027 .  The move to report Mr Cummings, who was campaign director of the Brexit supporting campaign group, is the first step in a process which could end with Dominic Cummings being found in contempt of Parliament.  In theory the penalties for being in contempt of Parliament include fines and even imprisonment but fines have not been imposed by the Commons since the 17th Century. DCMS Committee chair Damian Collins said Mr Cummings had been issued with a formal summons to appear on May 22.  Meanwhile, Cambridge Analytica boss Christopher Nix has agreed to return to Parliament to give evidence about alleged misuse of Facebook users\u0027 private data.   Mr Nix will answer the committee\u0027s questions in an open hearing at Westminster on June 6. We are disappointed that Dominic Cummings has not responded positively to our requests for him to appear, said Mr Collins.  His reasoning that he must delay giving evidence due to ongoing investigations simply does not hold up, considering that Alexander Nix, Jeff Silvester and others involved have agreed to co-operate with the committee\u0027s investigations despite currently being subject to various investigations. Reporting the matter to the House is a first step which could result in a decision that a contempt of Parliament has been committed, a very serious outcome for the individual. He added: We are glad that Alexander Nix has accepted our summons. The Committee will use the opportunity to address numerous inconsistencies in his previous evidence. Asked for his response, Mr Cummings pointed to an entry on his blog posted a week ago, in which he accused the committee of grandstanding.

Matt Fairfull, 62, who has several front teeth missing said he had no intention of paying for expensive dental work. He insisted that he did not want to change his trademark smile with one tooth poking out of his mouth, despite the cash windfall. When Matt was asked at a press conference if he would be getting his teeth fixed, his wife Marilyn, 64, stepped in to reply: He probably will. Matt immediately corrected her, saying: No I won\u0027t because it would not be me. I am what I am. I am happy with the way they are. I am the governor, no matter what. Factory worker Marilyn joked: He won\u0027t do anything I say. He does what he wants. But she admitted that she would probably pay for a dentist to improve her own discoloured teeth.  The couple who have four sons and five grandchildren said they wanted to spend their win on decorating their home in Stowmarket, Suffolk. They are also splashing out on a trip Jamaica which will be their first holiday in ten years, new furniture and a giant TV to replace their existing 50-inch model so Matt can watch the World Cup in comfort. But self-employed Matt who works up to seven days a week said he was not giving up work because he had to keep busy and did not want to let anyone down. He also has no plans to replace his 22-year-old Vauxhall Corsa van which he bought five-years-ago for \u0026pound470. Matt said: I have always been around old vehicles for work. I am used to old vans, and that is me. At the moment we have commitments for people and we need to settle down and take it from there.  We are going to carry on and keep being normal people. It\u0027s not going to be normal, but you want to keep yourself pretty straight and narrow. Matt confessed that he had gone into work this week because he had promised a plastering job for someone moving home. He joked that he would now be limiting himself to working just six and a half days a week to give himself a half day off. Matt also insisted that he and his wife of 33 years did not want to move from their three bedroom semi detached house. He said: We are happy where we are living.

Tennis fan Marilyn who has never been to the Wimbledon championships said she may buy herself a ticket for the mens\u0027 final this year, as well as a new car to replace her 14-year-old Toyota Celica. She also plans to cut back her hours at her part time job packing greeting cards at a family run factory in Stowmarket.  Marilyn said she did not want to retire completely because she enjoyed working with her colleagues so much. Her jackpot winning Monopoly Classic scratchcard was one of two she bought for \u0026pound5 each from the Esso petrol station last Sunday at Combs Ford near Stowmarket. She paid for the cards with a \u0026pound10 win on another card, while on her way to pick up her son who was travelling back to Stowmarket from Ipswich by bus. As she waited for him in her car at the town\u0027s station, she scratched one card which won \u0026pound20 and then did the other one which turned out to be worth \u0026pound1 million. She said: I felt physically sick. I just didn\u0027t believe it. I kept looking at the card until my son arrived, and I said: \u0027Look at this.\u0027 He just said, \u0027Oh my God\u0027.

Callum Chase, 25, and brother Connor, 23, spotted three men unloading mattresses and chairs from a van. The tree surgeons stopped and confronted the men who denied they were doing anything wrong. The brothers were joined by their boss and two other passing workmen, who used their vans to box in the group. They spent the next two hours waiting for police and were able to persuade the suspected fly-tippers to put the waste back in their van. The local council is now investigating with a view to taking possible legal action. Callum said: “The first hour was almost a constant argument with the men, about why they couldn’t be fly-tipping and not realising at all why they were doing something wrong.  “We’d say, ‘no you are not allowed to do that’, and they’d reply, ‘But there is rubbish already here’ - there were beer bottles, bags, etc. “They kept saying they didn’t do it all, only the mattresses and the chair. One of the men, who was in the van, panicked, and started reversing, but my brother was leaning against the van to stop it. Callum and Connor trapped the men in Kensworth, Beds., last week alongside a plumber who was driving behind them. They then called in boss Duncan Tomblin, who arrived with his van and blocked the three men in. Police took the men\u0027s details and statements which were then passed to Central Bedfordshire Council.

Meghan Markle\u0027s sick dad cancelled, procrastinated and then accepted he had to have urgent surgery for heart problems. Her brother told Harry to call it off. A half-sister gave catty interview after interview and on Wednesday was in a car crash. And in London, royal palace staff watched it all with increasing anxiety. They have dubbed chaotic preparations the Markle Debacle but are divided about where the blame lies. What is certain is the feuds, late announcements and last minute decisions are overshadowing what should be another immaculate operation for the well-oiled royal machine. More importantly, the chaos must be very distressing for 36-year-old Meghan as she prepares for the biggest day of her life.  According to royal sources, hardly anyone has met Meghan, Harry is attempting to organise everything by himself and the bride\u0027s dad, who is not attending the wedding, has been left unprepared for the fanfare. Staff are reportedly whispering that Sir Christopher Gedt, the Queen\u0027s former private secretary who was forced out in a fall-out following Prince Philip\u0027s retirement, would have known how to handle things...in particular, how to handle Harry. But instead of an expertly planned and repeatedly rehearsed event, Kensington Palace appears to be winging it. We won’t know until the day itself exactly what our instructions are and what we are meant to be doing, a senior member of staff told the Daily Mail\u0027s Richard Kay and Geoffrey Levy . Normally we would have known a good week in advance, just as we did with Prince William\u0027s wedding. It would all have been written down and printed out for us. But this time, so far, we’ve got nothing. It’s being kept secret until the day. It’s all very unsettling. Staff also said Kate Middleton was known quite well by key members below the stairs before she married Prince William, whereas Meghan remains somewhat of a stranger. And Prince Harry, along with a small team, is trying to do too much by himself.  Kensington Palace was blindsided when Meghan\u0027s dad Thomas Markle sensationally pulled out of this weekend\u0027s royal wedding with days to go. Thomas Markle Snr, 73, remains in North America - with Meghan and Prince Harry\u0027s nuptials in the UK just two days away. He had been expected to walk her down the aisle on Saturday but last week claimed he no longer planned to give her away. He admitted staging photos for the paparazzi amid reports he had suffered a heart attack last week and said he did not wish to embarrass his daughter or the Queen, according to reports. It later emerged the royal family were allegedly caught flatfooted by the news. Today, Meghan confirmed her father would not be attending.  TMZ reported up until Mr Markle\u0027s shock announcement, the palace had been planning a security detail, accommodation and access to events for the father of the bride. Kensington Palace declined to comment on claims it was blindsided by the news when approached by . Mr Markle told TMZ he has been popping Valium to ease chest pains after suffering a heart attack. Mr Markle allegedly sold paparazzi snaps - showing him going to shops and fast food restaurants - for \u0026pound100,000. Meghan\u0027s mum Doria Ragland could walk the American actress down the aisle at St George\u0027s Chapel, at Windsor Castle.  Meghan is said to have been distraught in recent days, reportedly begging her father to change his mind and walk her down the aisle in front of 600 guests and a TV audience of millions. But Meghan released a statement through Kensington Palace this afternoon, which read: Sadly, my father will not be attending our wedding. I have always cared for my father and hope he can be given the space he needs to focus on his health. I would like to thank everyone who has offered generous messages of support. Please know how much Harry and I look forward to sharing our special day with you on Saturday. On Tuesday, Piers Morgan lashed out at Meghan\u0027s estranged sister Samantha Markle for being a media vulture in a furious tirade on Good Morning Britain on Tuesday. He was left fuming when Meghan\u0027s sister tried to blame the media for her father\u0027s troubles.

And what royal festivities wouldn\u0027t be complete without some rather spectacular tat - and some shops and people seem keen to outdo each other this year.  Alongside the usual flags, hats and party gear, you can buy everything from a Prince Harry swimsuit with a VERY awkwardly placed chin to royal sick bags.   When Prince Harry and Meghan Markle tie the knot on Saturday, everyone knew the streets of Windsor would be lined by adoring royalists draped in the Union flags - but many have got there early and are already camped out in anticipation.   Fans started arriving in Windsor yesterday ahead of the \u0026pound32m event at St George\u0027s Chapel. And plenty of them are wearing head to toe brilliant royal tat, including a full Union Jack suit. Royal fan John Loughrey showed off his impressive collection of royal badges while waiting for a glimpse of the rehearsals underway today. Shops in Windsor have been proudly displaying their selection of souvenirs and houses have been decorated in masks of the pair.  Other eye-catching outfits included Anne Daly and her dog Camilla, who both wore pink, and plenty of fans with flags and signs wishing the couple well. Those who want to imitate Harry and Meghan can get their hands on masks and even a replica of the bride\u0027s engagement ring.  Argos has released the Meghan Sparkle which at \u0026pound14.99 is 8,000 times cheaper than the real deal.  It features an emerald-cut cubic zirconia set between two brilliant-cut stones on a yellow gold-plated band.    The limited-edition 24k gold iPhone X is the brand\u0027s unique twist on a royal-inspired keepsake. This particular version launched in anticipation of the wedding bears an engraving of Prince Harry and his bride on the back. For the food fans, there are special Marmite jars on sale with the couple\u0027s names printed on the label. But for those who can\u0027t stomach royal wedding mania, graphic designer Lydia Leith has created souvenir sick bags.  Lydia previously made bags for Prince William and Kate Middleton\u0027s wedding and for the births of royal babies. The bag features Harry and Meghan\u0027s faces and reads: Another Duke to make you puke. And it also says: Sick Bag - Keep This Handy 19th May 2018.  If that isn\u0027t quite what fans are looking for, Windsor shops are packed with more traditional items. Royalists can get their hands on flags, mugs, commemorative plates, magnets and coasters to name but a few. Houses in Windsor have been spotted decorated with masks of Harry and Meghan in the windows, while shops also include the Queen and Prince Philip. They seem to have proved popular, with a wide variety on display at various shops in the town.

The royal is widely expected to wear the outfit as a mark of respect to the regiment where he took over as Captain General from his grandfather the Duke of Edinburgh. Harry is also fiercely proud of his service in the armed forces - where he served in the front line in Afghanistan - which helped shape him become the man he is today.  Soldiers from the regiment will provide a ceremonial guard of honour lining the route from St George\u0027s Chapel at Windsor Castle on Saturday.  Insiders say that marines who have volunteered to take part have been led to understand Prince Harry will wear ceremonial regalia, also known as \u0027Blues\u0027.  However, the Prince could decide to opt for morning dress or the uniform of the Household Cavalry, where he served with the Blues and Royals.  Corporal Adam Caunter, who will form part of a Half Company from 30 Commando IX Group Royal Marines performing the royal salute as the couple pass by in their carriage, told the  : “I think he’ll be in his Blues, which is what we’ll be wearing, and that gives us a special connection.  It’s something we’re very proud of.” He later added: He\u0027s one of us. He\u0027s served on the front line just as we have.  They will be joined by a Half Company of sailors, as Prince Harry is Commodore in Chief of the Royal Navy’s Small Ships and Diving divisions. Prince Philip had been Captain General of the Royal Marines for 64 years until Harry took the title last year. Every one of the men who will line the streets in Windsor at the weekend has volunteered for the duty. They have been busy at HMS Collingwood, Hampshire, practicing the drills required for the guard outside the chapel.

Doria Ragland is expected to step into the role at the last minute after Meghan\u0027s father Thomas Markle Snr needed emergency heart surgery this week - and, it\u0027s now claimed, needs days to recover in hospital. While it\u0027s unusual for a mum to give their daughter away - it\u0027s not rare, not even within the royal family. Indeed, the former actress isn\u0027t the first royal bride to be walked down the aisle by her mother - as Queen Victoria, who ruled Britain from 1819-1901, walked two of her own daughters down the aisle .  First was her third daughter Princess Helena in 1866, followed 19 years later when her youngest child, Princess Beatrice, married in 1885. Prince Helena married Prince Christian of Schleswig-Holstein, fives years after the death of Prince Albert, at the Private Chapel at Windsor Castle. Her mother Victoria gave her away, wearing a black mourning dress and white widow\u0027s cap and dripping in diamonds.  She also wore similar attire for Beatrice\u0027s big day at St Mildred\u0027s Chapel in Whippingham on the Isle of Wight, when she married Prince Henry of Battenberg. The then Queen was originally opposed to the match, according to the Royal Collection Trust, but eventually agreed to it on the condition the groom resigned from the Prussian army and the couple made their home with her. Princess Beatrice was also accompanied to the alter by her brother, the Prince of Wales, and her nieces were bridesmaids. The Queen\u0027s subtle outfit choice for Beatrice\u0027s wedding was in memory of husband Prince Albert, who only managed to witness one of his children marry prior to his death in 1861.  That was eldest daughter Princess Royal Victoria, who married Crown Prince Frederick of Prussia. Royal weddings following Princess Helena and Beatrice snapped back to tradition, with brides\u0027 fathers giving them away. When Queen Elizabeth II married Lieutenant Philip Mountbatten in 1942, she was escorted down the aisle by her father King George VI. Eight years after his death, his daughter Princess Margaret was given away by her brother-in-law Prince Philip when she wed Antony Armstrong-Jones at Westminster Abbey in 1960.    In 1973, the prince then walked his daughter Princess Anne down the same aisle to marry Mark Philips, and again at her second wedding to Timothy Laurence in 1992 during a private ceremony. Earl Spencer gave Princess Diana away in 1981 to Prince Charles - who when in 2005 he married Camilla Parker Bowles, now the Duchess of Cornwall, the pair walked down the aisle together. And when Kate Middleton became the Duchess of Cambridge on marrying Prince William in April 2001, of course her father Michael Middleton accompanied her down the aisle of Westminster Abbey.

Thomas Markle Jnr, 51, flew to London ahead of the royal wedding to offer his support to his half-sister after their dad Thomas Snr said he could not attend for health reasons. The 73-year-old had surgery today after revealing medics will “go in and clear blockage, repair damage, and put a stent where it is needed”. The retired lighting engineer is reported to be \u0027awake and alert\u0027 but will remain in hospital while he recovers. Thomas Jnr today visited Windsor Castle to see where Meghan will marry Prince Harry in St George’s Chapel on Saturday. He said: “My dad will be heartbroken that he cannot be with Meg in Windsor to walk her down the aisle. He would have moved heaven and earth to be there. Follow our royal wedding countdown here    “It’s the most beautiful, stunning wedding venue and it’s going to be an amazing day.” His father’s operation came days after he was accused of staging pictures of himself with a British paparazzi photographer close to his home in Rosarito, Mexico.  Speaking exclusively to the Mirror ahead of the ceremony, Tom said Kensington Palace should have offered more guidance to the American family as they were thrust into the spotlight after Suits actress Meghan, 36, started dating Harry. The glazier said of his dad: “He’ll be hugely embarrassed that he was found to have faked pictures, but what’s clear is that he’s not benefited from the best advice. “It would have been better for the palace to have guided him, as well as us for that matter, to ensure the focus is on Harry and Meg and not her family back in the States. They should have intervened and guided us when Meg and Harry’s relationship was first made public.” He said his dad’s heart problems were a wake-up call, adding: “All the drama of my dad’s health scare put everything into perspective about what’s important in life. “My sister’s going to be one of the best things ever to have happened to the royal family. “She will be the perfect modern princess. I wish Meg and Harry nothing but a happy and healthy future together.”  Tom’s support for Meghan comes after months of family infighting left a dark cloud over the ceremony. Two weeks ago, while at “breaking point”, exasperated Tom wrote an open letter calling the wedding a “fake fairy tale”. In it he said: “As more time passes to your Royal Wedding, it becomes very clear that this is the biggest mistake in Royal Wedding history.” But now Tom bitterly regrets his “moment of madness”. He said: “I didn’t mean to upset anyone. I had hoped it might jolt someone into giving us help.  “I wrote to Kensington Palace months ago asking for their aid. We’ve all been so overwhelmed by the attention and have found it difficult living under such scrutiny. “We needed guidance from the royals but didn’t get it.  “Our family was thrown into the limelight and there’s been enormous pressure on us all. It’s taken its toll on all of us. Much has been said, a lot of which I regret, but now after arriving in the UK and seeing Windsor Castle, I understand much more what this wedding means to people. “The fact Dad’s not well enough to travel makes me want more than ever to be as supportive as I can to Meg.”  Tom is “mortified” at reports that his father blamed his letter for his heart scare last week. Tom insisted: “My letter wasn’t intended to cause hurt or upset. My earlier pleas fell on deaf ears, and after exhausting everything I could think of, I’d hoped my letter might shame the palace, I guess, into getting in touch. “I was wrong. It wasn’t designed to humiliate Meg into inviting me, but more hoping we could get the help we needed. Ever since her relationship with Harry emerged two years ago, our lives have been changed forever.  “There hasn’t been a day gone by when the phone hasn’t rung or we’ve not been followed. It’s placed a massive strain on us all. Given our time again I’m sure we’d all handle it differently. I know I would.” Tonight the dad-of-two was prepared to cut short his trip the UK to be by his dad’s bedside if needed. He said: “I’ve tried calling Dad but his phone is off. Of course we’re all worried. What people must understand about my dad is that he’s an intensively private man. He doesn’t want to cause a fuss for anyone.”  For now Tom is just pleased to be able to see his sister’s new world. As well as visiting the castle where she will marry, he posed alongside a cardboard cut-out of his sister with her husband-to-be. He said: “All I want is to see Meg happy and I hope she has found that with Harry.  “It’s a historic event that I’m extremely proud my family is part of. Before I arrived in the UK I was hesitant, in fact quite nervous, about what reaction I would receive but everybody has been so lovely. “Leaving the country you were raised in to move to another is a major step for anyone. “But after meeting so many wonderful folks, I know Meg will be in great hands in Britain.” Now that Meghan’s dad is unable to attend the wedding, Tom from Grant Pass, Oregon, and Meghan’s mother, Doria Ragland , are the only two members of the bride’s immediate family in the UK for the ceremony. The actress’s half-sister, Samantha Grant, who has been highly critical of the royal couple, is staying in the US. Shockingly the 53-year-old from Florida this week claimed she was not invited to Meghan’s first wedding to Trevor Engelson in 2011 because she is in a wheelchair as she suffers from multiple sclerosis.

Their big day, like all weddings, is set to be filled with traditions from both sides of the family. Some are very similar to those carried out by brides and grooms across the world, but some will be much more extravagant. But there is one particularly sweet tradition Meghan is expected to continue when she marries into The Firm, and it will hopefully make her feel closer than ever to her new royal in-laws.  Every royal bride since Queen Victoria has carried a small piece of myrtle in their wedding bouquet. The flower represents love and marriage, so it\u0027s very fitting. But it\u0027s not just any old myrtle. It\u0027s myrtle grown from a bush on the Isle of Wight given to Queen Victoria as a gift by Prince Albert\u0027s grandmother, reports The  . Kate Middleton was no exception to this rule and carried a piece down the aisle in her simple classic bouquet, designed by Shane Connolly.  She combined it with her family and her future in-laws\u0027 favourite flowers - lilies, hyacinths and ivy. Princess Diana and the Queen also had myrtle in their wedding bouquets. Prince Harry and Meghan Markle will tie the knot in St George\u0027s Chapel at Windsor Castle on Saturday. The couple have now arrived in the town ready for their big day, and well-wishers are already camping out to get the best view on the big day. The bride-to-be has released an emotional statement explaining her dad will now not attend the wedding, even though he was originally due to walk her down the aisle.  The statement reads: Sadly my father will not be attending our wedding. I have always cared for my father and hope he can be given the space he needs to focus on his health. I would like to thank everyone who has offered generous messages of support. Please know how much Harry and I look forward to sharing our special day with you on Saturday.

Natalie Howes, 22, was viciously assaulted after asking for some cigarette paper on a night out in Weymouth. The assistant restaurant manager was left with a huge gash after being struck on the head and was told by doctors she was less than an inch from losing her sight. Natalie, from Kingswinford, West Midlands, needed five internal and external stitches after the assault and has been left with a 4cm scar above he3r right eyebrow.  Recalling the night four years ago, Natalie said: It\u0027s horrendous that I was attacked with a weapon and the woman just got a slap on the wrist. She was intent on hurting me. I\u0027ve now been left scarred for life and she got away scot-free. Natalie, then 18, was enjoying a night out with her then-partner in Weymouth in June 2014. She added: We were having a great time and decided to pop outside for a cigarette at 11pm. I realised I\u0027d ran out of paper to roll a cigarette so I approached a nearby group of girls and politely asked if I could have some paper. But one of the women told me to f off. I was taken aback by their rudeness as I could see they were so much older than me. I said there was no need for that and walked away. As I made my way down the street, I heard footsteps behind me. Suddenly, I was whacked on the side of my face. Blood gushed over my top. I tried to protect myself with my hands but the woman kept slashing at me. I could see it was the woman who had told me to f off. I realised she\u0027d taken her stiletto off to attack me.   RAF was \u0027running hot\u0027 during war on ISIS, reveals top Ministry of Defence official  Natalie was pulled to safety by her ex and his friend. She said: I was pumping with adrenaline so didn\u0027t feel the pain until I\u0027d walked away. My ex took a photo of my face to show me my injuries and I was horrified to see a huge gash on my face. He called an ambulance and, an hour later, paramedics arrived to take me to Dorchester Hospital. There I had five internal stitches and five external stitches to the deep gash on my face. The doctor said that it was only one cm away from blinding me. It was terrifying. I looked as if I\u0027d been slashed with a knife. I was determined to get justice for the unnecessary attack. The next day, Natalie reported the assault to the police. She added: They found the girl who attacked me, I\u0027m assuming from CCTV, and took her in for questioning.  But a few days later, an officer told me that no further action was being taken and she was let off with a caution. I couldn\u0027t believe it. She ran at me with a stiletto already in her hand - in my mind, that counts as a weapon. A year on from the attack in March 2015, Natalie received \u0026pound2,500 in compensation from the Criminal Injuries Compensation Authority. She said: Although the money helped, it doesn\u0027t change what happened. I would much rather have never been hurt and left with an awful scar than have the compensation. And Natalie has been left physically and emotionally scarred. "},{"url":null,"title":"beast birmingham residents left terrified","story":"NewsThe Beast of Birmingham?

Dawn Paige checked her security cameras after noticing the wheelie bins at her home in Oldbury, West Mids, had been moved. But the 53-year-old was left horrified when she saw what she believes to be a female lion prowling among the wheelie bins. And she says she\u0027s now too scared to let her children out, with the large animal roaming around. The CCTV footage shows the beast - which appears to be around a metre tall - slinking around in the middle of the night. Dawn, a teaching assistant who lives just four miles from Dudley zoo, said: I saw my bins had been moved and I thought it was kids messing around.  I had the shock of my life when I saw that thing come into view. I was physically shaking. At first, I thought it must be a big dog, but it moves just like a cat. I took the footage into work and asked some of the teachers what they thought, and they agree with me it looks like a leopard, or a she-lion. I\u0027ve got a little dog and I\u0027m absolutely terrified for her safety. She then called her next door neighbour, Rachel George, 47 who posted the video on Facebook , in order to try to identify the animal or find out if it’s somebody’s pet. Rachel said: It just went mad when I posted it on Facebook. There were so many people worried about what it might be, and thousands of people commenting saying they thought it was a big cat.

Possibly not, but many have been left astounded by the apparent revelation that is means this: Chicken and lettuce under bacon.  We have Will Taylor to thank for this. He\u0027s head of strength and conditioning at London Welsh RFC.  A few days ago, he tweeted:    It proved a welcome surprise to many. The Club Sandwich had been, up until then, just one of the those (great) things. A fine layering of toasted bread, mayonnaise, cold chicken or turkey and hot crispy bacon. Usually, the chicken and lettuce, and the bacon would be divided by an additional middle layer of bread. And the final product is always – always! – cut into dainty triangles.  Meaning at long last...     Sadly, the idea of chicken and lettuce under bacon might well be an afterthought. Or a mere striking coincidence.  The name Club Sandwich originated not in its ingredients and composition, but in where it was invented. This in itself is up for debate. But one thing\u0027s pretty much for certain – the sandwich was born in New York member\u0027s clubs in the mid 1890s.  One, an upmarket gambling club in Saratoga Springs, New York, claims to have first made the Club Sandwich.  The Saratoga Gambling Club says this: So how did this high-class gambling venue become the birthplace of the club sandwich?  It\u0027s still up for debate who actually created the towering layered sandwich: the chef or the clubhouse owner, Richard Canfield himself, but The Encyclopedia of American Food and Drink states that the club sandwich originated in the Saratoga Club House\u0027s kitchen in 1894.  The swanky Union Club of New York City also claims to have been first. Apparently, a hungry member arrived home late to find his staff all asleep, so set about making himself some food.   The story (we\u0027ve cut it for length), told by food writer Marion Neil in 1916, goes: A man, we are told, arrived at his home one night after the family and servants had retired, and being hungry, sought the pantry and the ice chest in search of something to eat. There were remnants of many things in the source of supplies, but no one thing that seemed to be present in sufficient abundance to satisfy his appetite. he man wanted, anyway, some toast. So he toasted a couple of slices of bread. Then he looked for butter, and incidentally something to accompany the toast as a relish. Besides the butter he found mayonnaise, two or three slices of cold broiled bacon, and some pieces of cold chicken. These he put together on a slice of toast, and found, in a tomato, a complement for all the ingredients at hand. Then he capped his composition with a second slice of toast, ate, and was happy.  And so it was named a Club Sandwich – or, originally, a \u0027Clubhouse Sandwich\u0027 – as the very hungry man was a member of the Union Club and took his snack to the chef there, who put it on the menu.   We don\u0027t know which club house was first. There are scores of references citing the dish.   There are also lots of recipes and Club Sandwich photos that don\u0027t appear to layer the ingredients in line with the acronym.  But looking at these early notes, chicken and lettuce under bacon seems fitting. Conformity early on.

The 31-year-old, from the western state of Vorarlberg, was discovered to own several bottles of the wine and increasingly popular wine. He was jailed for six months after being found guilty of glorifying the activities of the Nazis - a crime in countries like Austria and Germany. The sentence will be added to a non-related 18-month prison term for an offence against drugs laws he was convicted of earlier this month.  Austrian investigators found multiple bottles at the home of the man, whose name was not made public due to strict local privacy laws. The items featured the image of Adolf Hitler on the side, a court heard. The bottles were labelled with messages such as: Ein Volk, ein Reich, ein Fuhrer (One People, One Empire, One Leader), Hitlerwein (Hitler Wine) and Die Anhangerschaft von Hitler (The Fanbase of Hitler), according to the prosecutor. The man admitted he had found the wine amusing upon purchasing it. But he said he had lost interest and described himself now as rather left-wing orientated.  According to local media, the defendant bought the bottles of wine in Italy,where they still remain legal to sell and buy. In many other European countries, such as Austria and Germany, the use of symbols of unconstitutional organisations or re-engagement in National Socialist activities are forbidden by law. Benito Mussolini\u0027s 1930s Italy was the breeding ground for the ideology of fascism, but there are still plenty of Il Duce supporters around today. The Hitler winemaker also makes bottles of Mussolini wine.

Tomasz Komenda, 42, was wrongly convicted of the brutal rape and murder of a 15-year-old girl in south-western Poland in 1997. Following a review, Poland’s Supreme Court acquitted Mr Komenda and stated that he could not have been responsible for the slaying. Justice minister Zbigniew Ziobro, who personally ordered a review of the case, said the acquittal shows that the mistakes of the justice system can be corrected.    He said: No-one can give back the years that Tomasz Komenda has lost. Still, the acquittal restores the sense of dignity of an innocent man who had been wrongly convicted.  The case has shocked Poland, which is currently governed by the right-wing Law and Justice party. Campaigners say the trial and subsequent fallout poses serious questions about the country’s dysfunctional legal system. The parents of the teen said they had developed doubts as to the guilt of the man and urged authorities to reexamine the conviction. Mr Komenda was clearly emotional as the trial judge ruled he could now walk free.

squad for next term, the striker has been identified as a man who can grab the goals to get them back to the Premiership.The 26-year-old scored 25 times in a two-year spell with the Tangerines before moving to Hibs when his contract expired last summer.Despite scoring 14 times during his first six months at Easter Road, he was loaned out to Dundee for the second half of the campaign.He hit the net three times for the Dark Blues, helping them get vital points as they survived in the top flight.Murray has now returned to the Hibees and has a year left on his contract but the feeling is he will be allowed to leave this summer if another club comes in for him.Dundee could be interested in making his switch to Dens permanent but are understood to be considering other options as well, while Scottish Cup finalists Motherwell are eying a move for him. And United are definitely considering taking him back.If a deal comes off, the Dundonian will be one of more than an entire team of new faces fixed up in the coming few months.One stumbling block could be the fact Hibs, despite signing him for free a year ago, are likely to demand a fee.As United’s rebuilding process goes into overdrive, former Hamilton Accies and Partick Thistle full-back Ziggy Gordon is another name under consideration.The 25-year-old has spent the last year-and-a-bit in Poland with Jagiellonia Bialystok, but would welcome a move back to Scotland.\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"ex dundee defender julen linked with inverness move","story":"\t\t\t\t\tFormer Dundee defender Julen Etxabeguren could line up against the Dark Blues\u0026#8217 rivals in the Championship next season.Inverness are reportedly leading the charge to sign the centre back.The 27-year-old was nearly sent on loan to the Highlands in January, only for injury to scupper any move.Dundee announced that the Basque defender was among nine players to have left the club yesterday.Julen\u0026#8217s last season at Dens was blighted by injury with an Achilles problem then a dislocated shoulder.\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"ross county offer new deal to michael gardyne amid dundee interest","story":"\t\t\t\t\tRoss County have moved to try to head off Dundee’s advances for Michael Gardyne by offering the midfielder a new deal.After the club’s relegation to the Championship, Gardyne is out of contract and has drawn “interest from a couple of Premiership clubs”.Ferguson said: “Michael has had interest from a couple of Premiership clubs and we’ve put an offer to him that, hopefully, convinces him to stay.“We don’t need to sell the club to him – he knows what it’s all about and he would be a big player for us in the Championship.”Leaving the Staggies is former Dundee United loanee Thomas Mikkelsen along with Tim Chow, David Ngog, Aaron McCarey, Blair Malcolm and Reghan Tumilty.The Highland side secured the capture of Iain Vigurs yesterday.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"wighton hopes frustrating end to campaign can spur dundee to success next term","story":"\t\t\t\t\tCraig Wighton hopes the anger at the way Dundee finished their season can spur them on to better things next campaign.A long season for most may have just come to an end with the 1-0 home reverse to Partick.For Wighton, however, it feels like it has only just begun after missing the first nine months of the term with a serious knee injury.With the manager and players alike angry at how they finished off 2017/18, Dundee’s youngest-ever goalscorer has more to be annoyed about.He said: “The frustrating thing for me, personally, is I’m just starting to get into it, starting to feel fully match fit and the season’s done.“That is frustrating but I’ll go away in the summer and work hard, come back fit and, hopefully, get a full pre-season under my belt and start the next campaign well.“Maybe Tuesday night against Ross County I got a bit leggy towards the end before I came off but I felt good again against Partick.“It was difficult, it was warm which took its toll on everyone but I feel fit, I feel good and, as I say, it’s a bit frustrating that’s the season done now.“For a lot of the boys they’ll maybe be glad it’s done because it’s been a long one but, for me, I’ve just had a pre-season!“This is basically the start for me and already it’s done which is unfortunate.”Wighton admits the performance across the board at the weekend wasn’t up to scratch.“The manager wasn’t happy and the players weren’t either,” he added.“It’s alright if it’s just not your day and you get beat but the way we played, second half especially, is not acceptable.“We weren’t at it at all.“We knew Partick were fighting for their lives and they would have a go at us but I don’t think we showed any real quality in the final third.“We were slow in possession at the back and Partick deserved the win for their second half.”The defeat echoed the finale to the last campaign – a 4-0 thumping at the hands of 11th-placed Hamilton.That stung for Wighton and he’s hoping this year’s failure to perform on the last day can niggle away at the squad over the summer break enough to spark better next time out.“Obviously, we did our business early in the split but it doesn’t mean that’s it – we wanted to win every game and four out of five would have been a good return so we are disappointed.“Last year it didn’t affect us but when you come back it’s still on your mind a wee bit, it still annoys you.“I think everyone will go away and have a good summer and next season we know we have to be a lot better.”One thing he personally is looking to add is goals – something the team as a whole has lacked in the past year.“Not taking our chances this season has really cost us. We haven’t been clinical enough in front of goal and that’s the difference,” he added.“You look at Kilmarnock – Boyd scoring goals for them – but we feel we’re a better side than Kilmarnock. We are but we just haven’t had that cutting edge in the final third.“Obviously, I never got a goal this term which is frustrating but I think the main thing for me was I didn’t think I would play this season.“Just playing is a big thing for me but next season I do need to start adding goals to my game. It doesn’t matter where I play, goals and assists are where I’ll get judged on at the end of the day.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/resources/images/7486028.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"She did it  Swindon star Maisie Sly s film wins at the Oscars","story":"                          Swindon\u0027 own Maisie Sly has topped off her trip to Hollywood in style, after the film she starred in, The Silent Child, was announced as the winner Best Live Action Short Film at the 90th\u0026nbspAcademy Awards."},{"url":"http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/resources/images/7590066.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"11 things you d only hear in Glasgow","story":"                          There are some things you will only ever hear in Glasgow or Glesga, as us locals call it,\u0026nbspand this is our definitive list of the best."},{"url":"http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/resources/images/7608211.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"Pensioners and kids to pay more to use Glasgow swimming pools under new pricing plans","story":"                          Pensioners will now be charged to swim at Glasgow pools, under new pricing plans."},{"url":null,"title":"Sir Andy Murray jokes about his  love  for birthdays in hilarious glum picture","story":"                          SIR Andy Murray has lived up to his moody persona with a hilarious tweet to celebrate his 31st birthday."},{"url":null,"title":"Review  Evita at the King s Theatre is a masterclass in musical theatre","story":"                          WATCHING any Andrew-Lloyd Webber and Tim Rice musical feels like a masterclass in\u0026nbspthe genre, and the latest production of Evita offered up a real education for\u0026nbspthe audience, leaving them in awe from the opening number."},{"url":"http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/resources/images/7799532.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"Streets Ahead 2018  Meet the inspirational finalists helping to make Glasgow better","story":"                          CREATIVE clean-ups, cracking community gardens and super schools are all in the running for the 2018 Streets Ahead Awards."},{"url":"http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/resources/images/7800562.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"Glasgow Coffee Festival and 10 other things to enjoy this weekend","story":"                          Scottish Street Food FestivalRiverside Museum, tomorrow to Sunday"},{"url":"http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/resources/images/7800652.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"Major MOT test changes come into place this week -

But the Courier understands the \u0026pound370,000 art installation, still branded by Highland Council as the Gathering Place, will be divided into two sections positioned on either side of the river. The installation is thought to be a mix of stone and wooden construction.There is great excitement among city councillors who have seen two-dimensional design work, and there is apparent consensus that it is aesthetically pleasing and will easily blend into the local, tranquil environment.The \"pier\" project, proposed for a spot by Eden Court, was aborted two years ago due to the scale of public objections to the design.The location for the new proposal is believed to be nearby, slightly further upriver, at the most shallow point on the edge of the Ness Islands.The council\u0027 Inverness city committee delegated powers of approval to the Inverness city arts working group. Its current chairwoman, councillor Isabelle MacKenzie, said she had closely scrutinised the fresh concept adding that it was \"within budget\".Giving little away, she added: \"I can see it appealing to the local community. It\u0027 innovative and there are a variety of ways to use it.\"The artwork is believed to be static and radically different from the previous offering.Fellow city councillor Duncan Macpherson said: \"The whole thing looks good.

Backers also emphasised that if Inverness spurned the project the funding would simply go elsewhere in Scotland.The local authority\u0027 Inverness city manager David Haas said: \"It is in development and about to be revealed to the public.\"I\u0026rsquom confident the new proposal will prove a big hit for the city.
