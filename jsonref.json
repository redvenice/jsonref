To me if someone sends that in a first message it\u0027s a straight no.\u0027I said no to him in what I think was a polite way. I could have gone on a massive rant about how you shouldn\u0027t speak to women like that but it wasn\u0027t worth the argument.         But Miss Kerr refused to get upset by the fat-shaming messages or block Tom on the dating app         Tom started the exchange with a blunt message asking for a s**g but when Miss Kerr refused he launched into a vitriolic attack on her appearance\u0027Then I got all that abuse back. At first I was shocked. I\u0027ve been called boring or frigid before by people on Tinder but this is the first time someone has really tried to hurt me.\u0027But then I started picking up on all of his mistakes and it was making me laugh, like he called me the mad controller instead of the fat controller.\u0027I also found it funny that he compared me to a Fiat 500 because I own a Fiat 500.\u0027I tried to find the funny side. That\u0027s my coping mechanism.. And I wasn\u0027t going to give him the satisfaction of just blocking him and acting like he\u0027d hurt me.\u0027So I sent him a funny reply and it\u0027s not the response he wanted. I got loads more abuse back.\u0027After reading his angry rant, Miss Kerr replied to Tom awarding him 1010 for effort and highlighting how funny she found it that she owns a Fiat 500.Tom appeared to continue trying his luck, asking Miss Kerr to perform a sex act on his \u0027average size c**k\u0027 in exchange for the party drug ketamine which is also used as a horse tranquilizer.When Miss Kerr pointed out that she had no need for the drug as Tom had called her a hippo not a horse, he replied: \u0027Shut up you fat ugly horrible dirty obese t***e.         After being branded a \u0027hippo\u0027 Miss Kerr laughed off Tom\u0027s offer of ketamine, a party drug which is also used as a drug tranquiliser         Miss Kerr poked fun at Tom who continued to mock her appearance, saying she looked like Bruce the Shark from the Disney film Finding Nemo\u0027You look like a mix between Bruce the shark and Shrek you fat ugly b***h. You have more rolls than f***ing Greggs.\u0027She responded by telling Tom he \u0027can\u0027t handle rejection\u0027 and questioning his taste in women.But the baker, who compares dating a fat girl to opening a bag of crisps in church on her own Tinder profile, thinks taking Tom\u0027s cruelty on the chin only angered him more as he quickly unmatched her.She said: \u0027It didn\u0027t upset me because he had asked me to sleep with him before so I can\u0027t be that bad.\u0027It\u0027s purely because I said \u0027no\u0027 to him that he was then being so spiteful.\u0027He wasn\u0027t giving me abuse out of nowhere. He messaged me asking for a shag but I knew I was better than what he was offering and he just couldn\u0027t handle the rejection.\u0027He wanted me to argue back and get upset so he could think he was the big man upsetting a girl but I wasn\u0027t going to let him win.\u0027And he was really unimaginative. He just picked up on one thing, the fact that I\u0027m a big girl. But my whole bio is a jokey metaphor about dating a big girl. \u0027He thought he was being funny so I thought it would be entertaining to give him a funny response back and he just couldn\u0027t handle it. He ended up unmatching me.\u0027I think he was really offended that I was seeing the funny side.\u0027While she was able to laugh off Tom\u0027s \u0027shocking\u0027 behaviour, Miss Kerr feels this kind of abuse from the Tinder reject could seriously impact women struggling with their body image.         She said: \u0027He obviously has no respect for women whatsoever and will go around hurting people\u0027s feelings and not caring about the consequences\u0027She said: \u0027It\u0027s lucky it was me he was giving abuse to and not someone who\u0027s more insecure.\u0027It could have a really serious impact on some people.\u0027If someone was already feeling quite down and depressed or struggling with their body image that abuse could be their breaking point.\u0027A few of my friends who saw the messages told me they would have been raging or in tears. \u0027He obviously has no respect for women whatsoever and will go around hurting people\u0027s feelings and not caring about the consequences.\u0027It\u0027s just not right. He\u0027s probably a keyboard warrior and wouldn\u0027t dare say any of those things to someone\u0027s face.\u0027If other women have had that kind of abuse they should just ignore it, there\u0027s no use taking any notice of it.\u0027"},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2019/03/22/13/048E864F000003E8-6838575-image-a-33_1553260992922.jpg","title":"Lionel Richie says hes far retirement ahead 70th birthday celebration","story":"Share this article          Richie was accompanied by much younger girlfriend Lisa Parigi at the gala as he was honored for his charitable contributions and then performed his biggest hitsHe performed three of his biggest hits All Night Long, Hello and Dancing On The Ceiling to a packed house at the MGM Grand Garden Arena.Before that stars like Snoop Dogg, NE-YO,, Miguel, Leona Lewis, Bernie Williams and Pedro Capó performed some of his iconic hits.Close friend Shania Twain got emotional as she presented Richie with the award, she said: \u0027He\u0027s my buddy, my pal, he\u0027s a lifesaver and a really wonderful friend.

In the men\u0027s pole vault, nine men are listed as competing in that age group.Meiler said the events she likes the best are the hurdles and the pole vault - one of the more daring track and field events, in which competitors run while carrying a fiberglass or composite pole, brace it against the ground to launch themselves over a high bar, and land on a mat.\u0027You really have to work at that,\u0027 she said. \u0027You have to have the upper core and you have to have timing, and I just love it because it\u0027s challenging.\u0027She revealed to the BBC that saw a lady doing the sport and thought \u0027I can do that\u0027, even setting the bar higher. Mrs Meiler admitted she never thought she would be a pole vaulter. \u0027Not in my wildest dreams!\u0027 she said.  She is used to hard work having grown up on a dairy farm, where she helped her father with the painstaking labour, feeding the cattle and raking hay.          The petite, energetic woman from Shelburne, Vermont has won a staggering 750 medals         Mrs Meiler also competes in the long jump, 60-meter hurdles, 800-meter run and pentathlonIn school, she excelled at basketball, took tap and ballroom dancing, and, living near Lake Champlain, she water skied.Meiler, who worked for 30 years as a sales representative for Herbalife nutritional supplements, and her husband, Eugene, who was a military pilot and then became a financial analyst, together competed in water skiing.\u0027Many times when I did water ski competition I was the only gal in my age group,\u0027 she said.She\u0027s a relative newcomer to pole vaulting and track and field, overall. At age 60, she was competing in doubles tennis with her husband in a qualifying year at the Vermont Senior Games when a friend encouraged her to try the long jump because competitors were needed.\u0027That was the beginning of my track career,\u0027 she said, standing in a room of her home, surrounded by hundreds of hanging medals. She took up pole vaulting at 65.Athletics has helped her though some hard times, she said. She and her husband adopted three children after losing two premature biological babies and a 3-year-old. Two years ago, their son died at age 51.         Mrs Meiler admitted she never thought she\u0027d be a pole vaulter. \u0027Not in my wildest dreams!\u0027 she said         Meiler turns 85 in June, when she\u0027ll head to the National Senior Games in New MexicoAnd she desperately misses her training partner, a woman who started having health problems about five years ago and can no longer train. It\u0027s tough to train alone, she said, and she hopes to find a new partner.\u0027She\u0027s incredibly serious about what she does,\u0027 said Meiler\u0027s coach, Emmaline Berg. \u0027She comes in early to make sure she\u0027s warmed up enough. She goes home and stretches a lot. So she pretty much structures her entire life around being a fantastic athlete, which is remarkable at any age, let alone hers.\u0027And it has paid off, said Berg, an assistant track coach at Vermont.Berg herself first started following Meiler 10 years ago while she was a student at New Hampshire\u0027s Dartmouth College, watching her at the annual Dartmouth Relays.\u0027She was like a local celebrity,\u0027 she said.Setting a record at age 80 with a 6-foot (1.8-meter) pole vault at the USA Track and Field Adirondack Championships in Albany, New York, while her husband watched, Meiler said, was one of her happiest days.\u0027I was screaming, I was so happy,\u0027 she said.The overall world record for women\u0027s pole vaulting is 16.6 feet (5.6 meters), according to the International Association of Athletics Federations.Meiler turns 85 in June, when she\u0027ll head to the National Senior Games in New Mexico. That will put her in a new age group, in which she hopes to set even more records.Meiler\u0027s athletic achievements are remarkable and something to be celebrated, said Dr. Michael LaMantia, director of the University of Vermont Center on Aging.Pole vaulting clearly isn\u0027t for everyone of her age, but in general, activity should be, LaMantia said.\u0027She can serve as a role model for other seniors,\u0027 he said."},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/03/21/19/7572810-6833739-Transport_Secretary_Chris_Grayling_had_mooted_the_Government_lea-a-20_1553198139940.jpg","title":"Terrifying moment bear mauls forest officer chases reservoir","story":"               Forest protection officer, Kumar, was mauled by a bear while he was trying to rescue it today at Velugodu Reservoir in Andhra Pradesh, IndiaThe bear had run into the reservoir to try and get away from the forest workers that were trying to rescue it. He then starts charging towards Kumar, who dashes into the reservoir to try and escape. He makes it into the water just before the bear catches up to him and mauls him. Other forest workers managed to stop the attack by throwing stones at the bear to distract it. Kumar was rushed to Kurnool General hospital and he is still there recovering from his injuries.Forest officials and local villagers continued the rescue mission and managed to get the bear back to the forest. "},{"url":null,"title":"Two college students balance couch SCOOTERS wheel two miles city friends house","story":" But after a quick attempt at trying to carry the furniture the whole two miles, they boys decided to get inventive. One of the students, Matt Cortigiani, said: \u0027Alex Wheels and I met at WashU\u0027s PT school.

Herb, at 89, still calls her his ‘little girl,’ ‘little lady,’ and his ‘rock.’‘After I met his sister, who had an accent, and I said to him: “How come your sister has an accent and you don’t?” That’s when he told me where he’d come from,’ Gloria says. ‘Other than that, he was very secretive.’Herb remained that way as the two married and built a life together they worked day and night to make a lighting business succeed and now have an international workforce. They raised a son and a daughter – and it was their daughter, truly, who spearheaded efforts to find out more about Herb’s past. She studied abroad in Germany and kept digging from there.‘It was at the insistence, help of my daughter that we finally, after 50 years, had a reunion in Sweden, when I got to meet no longer the parents but now the children and grandchildren of the parents,’ Herb tells DailyMail.com, adding: ‘The parents that were the original people that took us in were no longer alive.’Herb and Gloria arrived in Sweden with their two children and several grandchildren, and Gloria lights up when she describes seeing her husband meet his Swedish ‘sister.’It was ‘very touching,’ she tells Daily Mail.com. ‘I had to hold myself back from crying.

When I came back, I saw who I presumed was Agneta, but that was an old lady sitting there! And I remembered her as a 17-year-old playmate. It was 50-somewhat years later since we had seen each other, and yet she called me “little brother”, hugged, kissed and talked about the things that we remembered.It was quite an exciting reunion, and I got to meet her family … they said they knew in the stories their parents told about a young boy that lived with them in Sweden, but they didn’t know too much about Little Herbie.’The reunion of the families was a heart-warming conclusion to one of the few uplifting stories to take place during World War II – one of different countries and cultures banding together for the overall good of humankind.‘I think that my story, and our story, is such a wider story, because it is so different than most people my age that tell their children and grandchildren about their life … it’s all about concentration camps, gas chambers, death,’ he tells DailyMail.com. ‘Ours was a difficult time, but it was wonderful people doing wonderful things.

They were greeted by a red-headed waitress with a distinctive British accent.‘Since the restaurant was nearly deserted, she repeatedly checked on us, making pleasant conversation each time she came to our table,’ remembers Mrs Adams.The 17-year-old told them she and a friend had planned an American road trip that her father had sanctioned but not paid for. After they ran out of money in San Francisco, the adventurous pals took a Greyhound bus to Squaw Valley in the hope of finding work.         Recently Mrs Adams was thrilled to receive a signed photo card commemorating Princess Eugenie’s wedding to Jack Brooksbank at Windsor Castle on October 12 last yearThere they picked up casual jobs, cleaning rooms, waiting tables and – in the ski season – accomplished skier Sarah worked as an instructor with children.When they left, the American couple expected to never see their friendly waitress again.But on July 23, 1986, along with 500million others worldwide, they watched the wedding of Prince Andrew and Sarah Ferguson. It was then that Mrs Adams began to suspect the waitress and the new duchess were one and the same.However, it wasn’t until 13 years later, after the royal orce, that Mrs Adams, a retired writer and PR executive, decided to find out. She wrote to the duchess and, in June 1999, was astonished to receive a heart-warming reply.         Mrs Adams was sent a children\u0027s book written by the Duchess of York in 2012         Since that first speculative inquiry, the two have exchanged handwritten letters and gifts every year, along with Christmas cards and photos showing their families growing up‘You will never know the effect your letter had on me!’ Sarah wrote. ‘I was indeed the girl who served you in the Squaw Valley coffee shop … It has brought back so many memories.’Ever since, the duchess has sent regular letters and gifts, including a ‘Sarah’ doll produced to raise money for her children’s charity, her children’s book Ballerina Rosie published in 2012, and a round china box, a memento of William and Kate’s 2011 wedding.The duchess has also sent many photos, taken by herself and with handwritten inscriptions, along with thoughtful English treats, such as teas and biscuits.The letters regularly open with ‘Dearest Elaine’ and are signed ‘with special love’. One, sent after Mrs Adams shared details of her granddaughter’s breast cancer, is particularly treasured. Sarah wrote: ‘I am always here for you and your family, dearest Elaine. All these years we have been together …’Mrs Adams has since met the duchess twice, first in 2000 after she appeared on the Good Day Sacramento TV show and invited Mrs Adams to tea, then in 2003 when Sarah made a speech on women’s health in neighbouring Roseville and they shared tea again.Last night the duchess told the Daily Mail: ‘I remember being so moved when Elaine went out of her way to write to me all those years ago at a difficult time in my life. Her letter reminded me that at heart I was still just that same girl who had been waiting her table in Squaw Valley.‘I now have her letter framed and we have kept in touch ever since. She is a very special lady and I’m honoured that she has chosen to speak about our friendship in such a warm way. As ever, I am sending her lots of love from England.’ "},{"url":null,"title":"Ten year old skateboarding champion heading Britains Olympic team","story":"Share this article Does this little dynamo have a hope of winning a medal? Experts think so. Skateboard GB chair Lucy Adams describes her as ‘absolutely phenomenal’, pointing out that she can pull off moves such as a 720, which involves two full mid-air rotations. ‘There are only a handful of girls in the world doing that.’When she was just eight, Sky was the youngest competitor in the Vans U.S. Open, and placed higher on the leaderboard than women 20 years her senior. This year, she won gold at Simple Session, a women’s contest in Estonia. The course had been designed for men twice her size.         Skateboard GB chair Lucy Adams describes her as ‘absolutely phenomenal’, pointing out that she can pull off moves such as a 720, which involves two full mid-air rotations. ‘There are only a handful of girls in the world doing that\u0027Today’s venue — a skate park in Salford, Greater Manchester — is pretty much Sky’s UK ‘home’. She certainly seems at ease here.One minute we are standing together at the edge of an 8ft drop, talking about her favourite pop stars, the next she has tipped her board off the side and disappeared. No helmet. No knee pads. Argh!‘This is the thing we have most arguments about,’ says her dad. ‘She hates the pads, so we don’t make her wear them for bowls this size — but we do for bigger ones, and when she’s on concrete. We’ve said that if she breaks a bone, we may reconsider.’Off she goes, arms out, body bending, sun-bleached hair billowing behind. She swooshes up the other side of the bowl, coming right over the edge, and flips her body upside down. Afterwards, she’s grinning ear to ear.What does it feel like? ‘Like I’m flying,’ she says. ‘The minute I stop, I want to do it again, but higher.’         Her father Stu claims to be a social media novice, and was astonished when the first YouTube video he posted of Sky in action got tens of thousands of hits. Another followed. And anotherDo skateboarding prodigies exist? Well, Sky did develop the skills early. Perhaps some of it was in the genes.Before she was born, her father was a passionate and committed surfer. He admits that when his Japanese wife Meiko gave birth to Sky, he thought those days were over.‘My attitude to risk changed when I became a dad,’ he says. ‘It seems weird now, given how things have turned out, but when I knew I was having a girl, I thought she’d want to do things with her mum. I never imagined she would be into the same things as I was.‘She’s taught me a lot about gender equality — about everything.’ He had a tiny tornado on his hands. When he tried to wrap her in cotton wool, she broke through.‘She was fearless. She’d say: “Higher, Daddy, again.” Sky could surf pretty much before she could walk. She still surfs every morning.’The fact that their house is on the beach helps. ‘School starts at 7.30am so I have to get up at 5,’ Sky says. ‘Ocean and I run down the beach. When Dad tells us it’s time to get ready for school, we say: “Just one more wave!” ’They surf on their own? Stu nods. ‘They know what they’re doing. It’s natural for them.’There are shared skills between surfing and skateboarding, and they’ll both be making their Olympic debuts at the Tokyo games. And guess what? Sky hopes to qualify for the GB surfing team, too. ‘Two medals would be good,’ she admits. ‘I’d like to win, yes, but even if I don’t, it doesn’t matter. I just do it because it’s fun.’ Is she ever afraid? ‘Yes, but I want to beat it,’ she says. ‘And if you fall, you just get up again.’And it’s not just sport. She will try anything, especially if there is a competition involved. ‘She and her brother will see who can eat the spiciest chilli,’ says Stu.What’s the most adventurous thing she has eaten? ‘Tarantula,’ Sky says. ‘We were in Cambodia and they have restaurants that serve crickets and all sorts of insects — and tarantula. Someone said: “Would you like to try it?” and I said: “Why not?” ’Stu claims to be a social media novice, and was astonished when the first YouTube video he posted of Sky in action got tens of thousands of hits. Another followed. And another.The family were asked to get involved with skateboarding charities. Sky developed a taste for mentoring, it seems, and was happy to try her hand at being a feminist icon, too.‘Why should the boys have all the fun? I’ve been to Cambodia to teach children who have never skateboarded before. It was amazing. I said to the girls: “Just try it. You can do it.” ’ When she first pitched up at contests, she admits the men raised their eyebrows. ‘Then they started crowding round to watch and I was like: “Yeeeeesss!” I want to show them that girls can do anything boys can do.’In the space of just a few short years she has amassed an extraordinary fan base. She was seven when she got her first sponsorship deal, but the big sporting juggernauts have started to take note. She recently signed a deal with Nike, which meant her image was emblazoned on posters all over the U.S.All the attention has thrilled and alarmed her parents in equal measure.‘We are nervous about putting too much pressure on her, and it becoming more than just fun for her,’ admits Stu. He isn’t specific about how much money she has made, but it sounds as if her parents are determined that she is sensible about it.‘She self-funds a lot of the charity projects, so she will put money into that, with flights for instance,’ Stu adds. ‘And her merchandising goes 100 per cent to charity. After that, well, money has been put away so that it will help her in the future.’They certainly don’t seem to be limelight seekers. Stu declines to be in our photographs, ‘because this isn’t about me’.Nor is his wife mad keen on the attention. ‘We live in a small village in Japan, and we want to keep it low-key.’That may prove tricky. Last year, Sky won the junior version of the U.S. programme Dancing With The Stars, despite the fact she’d never had a dance class in her life.Stu says that the family were reeling when Sky got the offer, yet Sky insisted she wanted to do it. Why? ‘Because it sounded fun,’ she says.She couldn’t dance but threw herself into training, adapting her somersaults to moves she could do in a sequinned ballgown.While her mum and dad had moved to California for the filming of the show, they hesitated over allowing her to be too much of a media darling. Offers to appear on big chat shows such as Ellen were politely declined.And Sky’s parents were nervous when the idea of her aiming for the Olympics was mooted.‘I didn’t think it was a good idea, because I didn’t want to put too much pressure on her, but Sky said she wanted to do it,’ says Stu.The family set-up is quite unique, but, as a blueprint for creating a future Olympian, it has its merits.The Brown family have a Californian beach vibe going on, but also a rigid Japanese work ethic. ‘Her school is quite strict. They don’t mind her being off if we have to be travelling, but she has to do her homework. That idea of hard work is important.’Sky’s first language is Japanese, but she is also fluent in English, helped by her time in the U.S. She’s very much a global citizen, though. She’s travelled all over the world on sporting and charitable adventures. She has released her own skateboard, with proceeds going to charity, and has so far raised £13,000.Some of her mentoring has happened closer to home. Little Ocean is his sister’s double. They are inseparable and share everything, even a bed.‘He’s my bestie,’ she says, as he joins her on his skateboard, trying to match her every leap.When he takes a tumble — doubtless acquiring another bruise — she pulls him up.‘Let’s go again,’ she says, and they do. "},{"url":null,"title":"Tories plan rival MP candidate against Speaker John Bercow election","story":"Share this article If the Tories stand against him – the party has comfortably held the seat since 1970 – they would almost certainly capture the constituency. This means if there is a snap general election as a result of the Brexit impasse, Mr Bercow could be out of a job much sooner than he expected.One senior Tory said: ‘As soon as it’s practicable we are going to hit him with everything we have got in our armoury. I know we are breaking with precedent but that is exactly what Bercow does when it suits him, and he hides behind precedent when it doesn’t suit him.’It is not only the Tories who have turned against Mr Bercow. There are two petitions circulating in his constituency, urging him to name a date to go. One – the ‘Give us a voice – not a Speaker’ petition – has 6,750 signatures.         To challenge a sitting Speaker would break with centuries of tradition, but they have given their blessing to the Conservative association in Buckingham, where Mr Bercow is the MP, to advertise for a new candidate. The decision was taken long before Mr Bercow dramatically announced he was blocking a vote on Theresa May’s Brexit dealWhen he became Speaker in 2009, he promised that in line with his predecessors he would serve for nine years. This meant he should have resigned last June but grandly announced he would be staying on to ‘see Brexit through’.The decision to stand against Mr Bercow, described by one senior minister last night as ‘the nuclear option’, was taken long before he dramatically announced he was blocking a vote on Theresa May’s Brexit deal.In his local association, there is mounting frustration that he has refused to give any indication of when he intends to quit, despite endless requests.A senior Conservative source said: ‘The voices of more than 75,000 voters in the Buckingham constituency have not been heard in Parliament since 2009. \u0027Bercow is high-handed and arrogant in the Commons chamber.

The rodents carry several diseases harmful to humans and domestic animals. Photograph: Yann SchreiberAFPGetty Waterways Ireland has warned the public to be on the alert for a very “large invasive rodent” species which has been spotted along the Royal Canal in Dublin.Sightings of coypu, a semi-aquatic creature with bright orange teeth, a long cylindrical tail, and webbed back feet have been reported near the Ashtown area of the canal close to Castleknock.The rodents, which can be up to a metre long and weigh up to 9kg, carry a number of diseases harmful to humans and domestic animals.Waterways Ireland has issued an “invasive species alert” and warned the public “not to engage” the animals or make any attempt to trap them but to report any sightings, with photographs where possible.Coypu are “highly invasive impacting on wildlife, river and canal bank stability and is a pest of agriculture crops”, Waterways Ireland said.“Eradication programmes can cost several millions of euro and are not always successful.”“Its appearance is similar to a very large rat it could even be mistaken for a bulky otter at first sight,” Waterways Ireland said, but unlike an otter it does not have a fur tail but a “long rat-like tail”. Coypu are vegetarian, and particularly like carrots and parsnips.\u0026nbspThe “invasive alien species” originates from wetlands in South America, and is thought to have arrived in Ireland about five years ago. It is believed the animal was introduced as a novelty attraction to a pet farm in Cork but some escaped in 2014 and began breeding on the outskirts of Cork city.In 2016, 10 coypu were shot on the Curraheen river on the outskirts of the city. Sightings should be reported to Waterways Ireland and National Parks and Wildlife Service which will undertake “eradication measures”.A successful eradication programme in East Anglia in Britain in the 1980s “took 10 years and cost several million pounds sterling”, Waterways Ireland said."},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Update of Taoiseach\u0026rsquos social media persona was to \u0026lsquoheighten awareness\u0026rsquo of his Instagram accountHigh Court judge\u0026rsquos ruling could affect conduct of marathon litigation by the five childrenPrioritisation of upgrades to existing schools needed, Fianna F\u0026aacuteil leader saysWomen want to know why they were not warned of the risks of taking an anti-epilepsy drug while pregnantSolidarity expressed by religious leaders following the New Zealand mosque attacksConnecticut Democrat Chris Murphy says UK \u0026lsquocannot compromise sanctity\u0026rsquo of peaceMinister says \u0026lsquomisinformation and nonsense\u0026rsquo commonly spread about vaccinesAlleged IRA member has pleaded not guilty to sexually abusing two boys at safe houseHotel next to plant used for homeless familiesIrish Cancer Society fears repeat of 2013 when snow, ice and rain hit fundraising driveTeam Ireland hailed after winning 86 medals across 12 sports at Abu Dhabi world games\u0026lsquoVery dark cloud\u0026rsquo hanging over inner city community after death of woman (34) and man (70s)Teenager accused of striking man with \u0026lsquohammer-like blow\u0026rsquo using broken hurleyMurder accused told social worker Tipperary woman \u0026lsquofixated\u0026rsquo on her new relationshipTwo men also facing charges of abusing woman\u0026rsquos two children over two-year periodIan O\u0026rsquoConnor (29) threw petrol bomb at another family home less than a month laterDrugs, cash and cars seized in operation against criminal activities of East Belfast UVFIrish company says it will use recovered ocean plastic in manufacturing of insulationTimothy O\u0026rsquoSullivan (67) jailed for 11 years for grooming and raping two boys in 1990s"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3835484.1553277385!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"gold rush at dublin airport on return of our special olympians","story":"Team Ireland arrived home from Abu Dhabi with a haul of 85 Olympic medals across 12 sports.  \t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tSpecial Olympian Mark Saddler shows off his bowling medal as he celebrates with his family after arriving home.

It was really the most incredible experience, four days of playing nine holes of golf. It was very tight until the very last hole. He was ecstatic and we were ecstatic too. It’s a fantastic achievement by him, we’re delighted.”Patrick Quinlivan (36), from Letterkenny in Co Donegal, won seven medals (two gold and five silver medals) at the games in gymnastics, more than any other Irish athlete.“I’m over the moon because I didn’t think I was going to win this many medals. I thought I would win one or two, but I didn’t expect to get them all,” he said. “I think it was all the hard training because I was training every day of the week working in the gymnastics gym, doing Jiu-Jitsu, a bit of pilates and yoga at home.”Former Republic of Ireland international soccer player Niall Quinn came to congratulate the men’s seven-a-side football team, which won bronze at the games.“I went out to Abbotstown (sports campus) before they travelled and got to meet them and was just taken aback by their commitment, their unity and how determined they were to do well,” he said.Matt English, chief executive of Special Olympics Ireland, said “the incredible achievements of our athletes over the last week has resulted in a ripple of pride across the country.

Not as many share my view that we should do an EU agreement before a Britain agreement but, in the United States Senate, it only takes a minority of senators to stop a trade agreement,” said Mr Murphy.Trump criticismHe criticised the Trump administration for leaving the role of US ambassador to Ireland vacant for more than two years.“There is no excuse for this post remaining unfilled for this long,” he said.The White House only last week submitted the file on Mr Trump’s nominee as ambassador, Ohio businessman Ed Crawford, to the foreign relations committee, which must approve his appointment.“Assuming that there are no issues, I would hope that we would get him on the ground here as quickly as possible,” the senator said.He had “an open mind” about the appointment of a US special envoy for Northern Ireland.Mr Murphy said he wished Mr Trump “wasn’t such an unconditional cheerleader of Brexit” but sought to temper expectations that the president’s support for the UK’s exit from the EU might lead to a quick trade deal.“I worry that the only voice that is getting through in the Brexit debate is the president’s,” he said, arguing that Mr Trump does not control Congress and claiming he did not understand international trade.Russian attacksThere was a “growing worry” in Congress about the long-term stability of the EU given Russia’s attacks on it, he said. He argued that the US should show a preference for multilateral institutions rather than a bilateral arrangement by agreeing a deal with the EU first ahead of the UK.“If we reward Britain’s departure from the EU with a quick trade agreement, it is another arrow in Russia’s quiver,” he said.The senator said he supported the EU and UK agreeing to an extension to the article 50 Brexit process to April or May, saying it was “too complicated to rush given that the consequences are permanent”.He drew parallels between the political tensions around Brexit and the Trump administration.“The exhaustion you feel with Brexit is the same exhaustion that we feel with the president and his daily social media barrage,” he said.The Democrat, who has ruled himself out as a presidential contender in 2020, predicted a “wild” Democratic race and “some big fights” in the primary, but said he believed the level of enthusiasm within the party would win back the White House.“The louder our primary is, the better, I think, it is in the end,” he said.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

Photograph: Yves HermanFile PhotoReuters“Until April 12th, anything is possible,” European Council president Donald Tusk said of the Brexit process on Friday.Summing up the EU’s summit in Brussels and the breathing-space extension the UK has been given to get a Brexit deal, Mr Tusk said the options still ranged from a deal to a long extension – “if the UK decided to rethink its strategy” – or abandoning Brexit altogether by “revoking article 50”.But pessimism pervaded the meeting. Leader after leader privately expressed their fear that UK prime minister Theresa May would not be able to win a majority for the withdrawal agreement and that a no-deal scenario must be, as lead negotiator Michel Barnier was quoted as saying, their working assumption.Diplomats say they fear that Mrs May, if voted down in the Commons, would indeed prefer no deal to a deal with Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn. Her next “meaningful vote” is expected on Tuesday.There was a sense of bewilderment at Mrs May’s repeated inability or unwillingness in response to their questions on Thursday night to set out her plans should she lose the meaningful vote.All she would say is that she intended to win, and yet she was here looking for their support.Needing a ‘miracle’Latvian prime minister Krisjanis Karins asked her why she remained “so optimistic”, while the Luxembourg prime minister, Xavier Bettel, said only a “miracle” would allow her to succeed.French president Emmanuel Macron warned that what they faced was a systemic crisis of British politics: “The EU today had to face up very clearly to a crisis of the British political system. British politicians are today incapable of putting into practice what their people have asked of them.”Thursday night’s deal moves the departure cliff edge from next Friday night until April 12th, and beyond to May 22nd should Mrs May win her vote next week.Unusually, it was drafted by the leaders themselves, meeting late into the night. Officials said the process was extremely political and so necessitated high-level input from the leaders, who appear to have been particularly concerned to demonstrate that, if a no-deal happens, the EU cannot be blamed.China demotedBrexit was inevitably a leitmotif in all the discussions, even pushing aside the important debate on China-EU relations.A lengthy discussion on preparing for an EU-China summit in April was curtailed but officials were keen to emphasise its importance strategically.As leaders joined their counterparts from Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein on Friday morning to mark 25 years of the European Economic Area – the free-trade zone that links them to the EU – Donald Tusk spoke pointedly about “the spirit of neighbourly co-operation”.No one could really doubt what he was suggesting: “Today, within the EEA, more than 500 million people are free to move and travel, to do business and invest with ease, to receive an education, conduct cutting-edge research abroad, while enjoying the safest consumer protections, the highest standards at work and the cleanest environment.“We have accomplished this through shared pragmatism, and in a spirit of neighbourly co-operation.”Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

Photograph: Aris OikonomouAFPGetty ImagesThe House of Commons may insist on a closer relationship with the EU rather than a no-deal if MPs again vote to reject the withdrawal agreement next week, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar has suggested at the conclusion of the EU summit in Brussels this afternoon. “I hope the withdrawal agreement will be ratified by the House of Commons,” Mr Varadkar told a press conference. “If it isn’t I imagine they’ll go onto indicative votes and that may point the way to a closer long term relationship.“But Brexit is uncharted territory. I’ve almost given up speculating on what’s going to happen next.”Mr Varadkar was speaking before departing the two-day summit in Brussels which say EU leaders set a new date for Brexit, moving the original date from March 29th - this day week - to either April 12th or May 22th, depending on whether Mrs May can secure passage of the withdrawal treaty through the house of Commons in another vote expected next week.If MPs again reject the deal, the UK will either leave on April 12th, or propose a new closer relationship with the EU which would require the UK to take part in the elections to the European Parliament.In a statement responding to Friday’s events, DUP deputy leader Nigel Dodds said Mrs May had missed an opportunity to put forward proposals to EU leaders to improve the prospects of an acceptable deal, describing it as a “disappointing and inexcusable” failure. “Lectures by the Prime Minister putting the blame on others cannot disguise the responsibility her government bears for the current debacle and the fact that her agreement has been twice overwhelmingly rejected,” he said.Asked what was his assessment of the chances of Mrs May passing deal, Mr Varadkar said: “I honestly don’t know. Prime minister May believes that there is a pathway to victory and to get a majority in the House of Commons and I hope she can achieve that. But I really wouldn’t be in a better position than she is to assess the parliamentary arithmetic that exists in the United Kingdom and it’s very much a matter for the British parliament.”Asked if he would be in contact with the DUP, whose support is crucial to Mrs May’s chances of securing a Commons majority, Mr Varadkar said he had met with the DUP leader Arlene Foster in Washington last week.“She gave me a clear indication of the kind of things they would be looking for from the UK government and those discussions are ongoing,”The Taoiseach also confirmed the DUP MP Jeffrey Donaldson would be attending the Fine Gael conference in Wexford this weekend. Mr Donaldson will join the leader of the Alliance Party Naomi Long, Claire Hanna of the SDLP and Tánaiste Simon Coveney for a panel discussion on Saturday on the re-establishment of the Stormont executive.They will also discuss “the importance of the North-South ministerial councils”, according to the programme.They will also talk about fostering “north-south relations to the benefit of all who live on this island and a peaceful, prosperous future.”The discussion will take place during the Fine Gael national conference which takes place in Wexford on Friday night and throughout Saturday.Mr Varadkar will make an address on Saturday evening. Speaking at the Fine Gael conference on Friday evening, Tánaiste Simon Coveney said there would need to be regulatory alignment between Northern Ireland and the Republic to keep the Border open even if there was no Brexit deal. “Whether there is a deal or no-deal, the way will resolve these issues will involve some form of regulatory alignment. Even in the British paper which was published, which we didn’t have any input into, they’re effectively talking about the all-island economy not being interrupted by any form of checks.”Mr Coveney refused to engage with suggestions that an EU task force could be set up to deal with the Border in the event of a no deal Brexit.When asked if there was any frustration at EU level with Ireland, Mr Coveney said: “First of all, I don’t accept your assumption that there is clearly a frustration with Ireland. There isn’t actually. There is an understanding across the EU that the Border question is a very emotive and very political question on this island.“That is why we have had so much solidarity and support from across the EU for solutions to that question.” - Additional reporting ReutersDeal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

Mrs May’s Brexit deal has already been twice rejected by lawmakers but the prime minister was expected to try a third time next week.An EU summit on Thursday granted an extension to the UK’s departure from the bloc to try to give her time to get her deal through parliament, but in a letter to lawmakers on Friday, she suggested that such support might not be forthcoming.“If it appears there is not sufficient support to bring the deal back next week, or the House rejects it again, we can ask for another extension before April 12 - but that will involve holding European Parliament elections,” she wrote in a letter published on Twitter by a BBC reporter.“If it appears that there is sufficient support and the Speaker permits it, we can bring the deal back next week and if it is approved we can leave on 22 May.” MPs at Westminster could vote next week on a number of options for Brexit, including Mrs May’s deal, after European leaders set a new deadline of April 12th for Britain to decide how it wants to leave the EU. A cross-party group of MPs has tabled an amendment to a motion on Monday that would open the way to “indicative votes” later next week.Labour has tabled a similar amendment demanding that the government provides sufficient parliamentary time to debate alternatives to the prime minister’s deal. The amendment identifies the alternatives under discussion as Labour’s proposal for a customs union and close alignment with the single market Common Market 2.0, which would see Britain remain in both the single market and the customs union a customs union and a second referendum.“Following a series of meetings with MPs from all parties, EU leaders, businesses and trade unions, I am convinced that a sensible alternative deal can be agreed by parliament, be negotiated with the EU and bring the public together, whether they voted Leave or Remain,” Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said.‘Chaos and confusion’“It’s time for parliament to take control of the Brexit process from this failed prime minister, and end the chaos and confusion created by the government’s isions and incompetence.”Business secretary Greg Clark suggested the government would offer MPs such a choice if, as expected, they rejected Mrs May’s deal for a third time next week.“The government will facilitate . . . the ability for parliament to express a majority of what it would approve,” he told the BBC.“The commitment that the government has made seems to me very clear: the government will provide that so there’s no reason why the government should be forced to do something that it is committed to do anyway.”The move towards indicative votes comes amid mounting speculation at Westminster over Mrs May’s future as prime minister. She survived a confidence vote among Conservative MPs last December so she is safe from a similar challenge until next December.But her handling of the Brexit negotiations and her mismanagement of the Conservative parliamentary party has persuaded many of her own MPs that she must step aside soon, or at least announce her intention to do so.Fresh blowEU leaders agreed in Brussels on Thursday night that, if MPs approve the prime minister’s Brexit deal next week, Britain can remain in the EU until May 22nd. The deal’s prospects took a fresh blow on Friday when DUP deputy leader Nigel Dodds accused Mrs May of capitulating to the EU and securing no changes to the withdrawal agreement.“Nothing fundamentally turns on the formal ratification of documents which the attorney general has already said do not change the risk of the UK being trapped in the backstop,” he said.“The DUP has been very clear throughout that we want a deal which delivers on the referendum result and which works for all parts of the UK and for the EU as well. But it must be a deal that protects the Union. That remains our abiding principle. We will not accept any deal which poses a long term risk to the constitutional and economic integrity of the United Kingdom. ”Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

Photographs: Saul Loeb and Brendan SmialowskiAFPGettyMore than twenty-two months after he was appointed to investigate Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election, Special counsel Robert Mueller concluded his investigation on Friday , submitting his report to the attorney general.Following feverish speculation in recent weeks that the investigation was nearing its conclusion, the Department of Justice confirmed on Friday evening that the report had been submitted to attorney general William Barr.While the submission of the report marks the conclusion of the investigation that has overshadowed Donald Trump’s presidency, it now falls to the attorney general to report to Congress on its findings.In a letter to Congressional leaders, Mr Barr said he was reviewing the report and anticipated that he could be in a position to advise Congress on the special counsel’s “principal conclusions” as soon as this weekend.“I remain committed to as much transparency as possible, and I will keep you informed as to the status of my review,” he wrote.It remains unclear how much of the report will be made available to Congress and to the public.Refused to confirmThe special counsel is obliged to provide a “confidential report” to the attorney general on completion of his or her work which must explain any “prosecution or declination decisions reached by the Special Counsel.”Mr Barr, who was previously attorney general during the George HW Bush presidency, assumed his position at the head of the Justice Department last month.During his senate confirmation hearing he refused to confirm if he would make the Mueller report public.Mr Mueller’s final report was delivered to Mr Barr as President Trump met with Caribbean leaders at his Mar-a-lago estate in Florida.“The next steps are up to Attorney General Barr, and we look forward to the process taking its course,” adding that the White House had not received or been briefed on the report.Earlier, as he left Washington for Florida, Mr Trump dismissed the Mueller investigation as a “hoax” and a “witch-hunt”.“There was no collusion. There was no obstruction. Everybody knows it. It’s all a big hoax . . . I call it the witch hunt,” he said.“We’ll see what happens. I know that the Attorney General, highly respected, ultimately will make a decision.”Under the regulations governing special counsel investigations, the attorney general must share an outline of Mr Mueller’s report with Democratic and Republican leaders of the judiciary committees in Congress.Lawmakers from both parties, including the Democratic chairman and the top Republican member of the House of Representatives Judiciary Committee, immediately called for prompt release of the Mueller report to key congressional committees and the public.House speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer – the two top Democrats in Congress – said it was “imperative” that the full report be made public and that the White House play no role in determining what is released.“The American people have a right to the truth. The watchword is transparency,” they said in a joint statement.Trump lawyers Jay Sekulow and Rudy Giuliani said they were pleased that Mr Mueller has delivered his report and that Barr “will determine the appropriate next steps”. – Additional reporting ReutersRead more about the Donald Trump administration"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/02/10/TELEMMGLPICT000051671687_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqO65TkrT7BriBrd3fK6VEg2oOnP5Tf-6BsL77M1adEXU.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"sir philip green staff told wear revealing clothes visited","story":"Sir Philip Green in 2014 with models, left to right, Suki Waterhouse, Kate Moss, Cara Delevingne, Sienna Miller and Naomi Campbell.

The storm has killed hundreds of people and affected more than 2.6 million others with catastrophic damage occurring in and around Beira in southern Mozambique. Was Cyclone Idai caused by climate change?It’s impossible to say if the storm itself was caused by climate change but experts believe its impact was made worse by the gradual rise in temperature.How did climate change make it worse?Experts point to three factors.First, warmer air temperatures mean more rain is held and then released. Idai produced nearly a year’s worth of rain in just a few days - more than two feet in parts of the region.Second, the region has been suffering from sustained drought in recent years, itself a problem associated with climate change. The hard, parched earth was unable to absorb water quickly, increasing the risk of flash flooding.Third, rising sea levels mean that storm surges are much more powerful, increasing the risk of the sort of inland flooding seen in the port city of Beira. Sea levels are about a foot higher than a century ago fed by melting ice at the poles.What do the experts say?“Cyclone Idai is a clear demonstration of the exposure and vulnerability of many low-lying cities and towns to sea-level rise as the impact of climate change continues to influence and disrupt normal weather patterns,” said Mami Mizutori, the UN’s Special Representative for Disaster Risk Reduction.What does the future look like for the region?Rebuilding with climate change in mind will be essential. This was not done after the last major cyclone 19 years ago. Roads, housing, utilities should all be built with future storms and flooding in mind.Sounds expensive, can this be done?Ironically, climate change makes future-proofing more difficult as the region’s economy, and therefore its capacity to rebuild, has already been depleted by rising temperatures, drought etc.At the Paris climate summit in 2015, then-prime minister of Mozambique, Carlos Agostinho do Rosario, said: “These weather phenomena affect the government’s efforts to meet national priorities, especially food security, that are critical to poverty reduction.”Secretary General of International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC), Elhadj As Sy talks with a survivor of Cyclone Idai, at an evacuation centre in Beira, MozambiqueYes, developed nations, including the UK, are scrambling to send aid and disaster relief teams to the area.The rich nations also pledged in Paris 2015 to ramp up aid to $100 billion per year in restorative climate funding to poorer nations by 2020. This is because industrialisation in the west caused most of the current rise in global temperatures. But so far less than 10 per cent of this funding has been secured.Protect yourself and your family by learning more about Global Health Security Please review our commenting policyRobert Mueller recommends no new criminal charges as he ends Russia probe into Donald TrumpJeremy Hunt seeks to woo Tory MPs at private dinner as he is nicknamed \u0026#39continuity May\u0026#39Comment: Petition signatures and celeb endorsements are nothing compared to the Will of the PeopleTheresa May gambles on customs union vote as Boris Johnson reminds her of pledge to step asidePolice chief becomes first to back statutory duty of care on social mediaDowning Street draws up plan to let MPs vote on different Brexit options as Eurosceptic fears of softer orce growComment: What’s at stake now is not just Brexit, but how we are governed as a countryBritain needs a no-deal Brexit now - not a long delay, say entrepreneurs in swipe at CBIJared Kushner \u0026#39used WhatsApp to contact foreign leaders,\u0026#39 Democrats claimMozambique residents continue to wait for aid after Cyclone IdaiDispatch: Hope stirs in Hardware City as Donald Trump\u0026#39s regeneration plan spurs investorsUS announces new financial sanctions on Venezuela after \u0026#39illegal\u0026#39 arrest of Juan Guaido\u0026#39s chief of staffComment: As Brexit goes down to the wire, the EU are finally starting to blinkChurch employed fascist to carry out pastoral care Seven police officers sent to remove four women from \u0026#39inclusive\u0026#39 talk on transgender issues featuring CEO of MermaidsDUP signals it will reject Theresa May\u0026#39s deal again over \u0026#39inexcusable\u0026#39 failure to demand more concessions from EuropeWimbledon five-year debenture tickets \u0026#34to double in price\u0026#34 as as investors prepare to swoop on valuable seatsBingo loyalists unhappy about millennial slang creeping into the gameLondon Marathon: Charities win review of \u0026#39unfair\u0026#39 system that benefits same organisations annuallyWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"cyclone idai happens next","story":"A major humanitarian crisis has unfolded in the wake of Cyclone Idai, with hundreds of thousands of people in urgent need of assistance across Mozambique and Zimbabwe.

Emergency responders are struggling to reach parts of the three countries after some roads, bridges and communications networks were washed away or destroyed.The city of Beira with its some 500,000 residents is said to be 90 percent destroyed, while some 152 square miles have been flooded. Mozambique\u0027s president, after flying over the region, has warned as many as 1,000 people could die.

Army veterans will be furious that no IRA members have been convicted for the Birmingham bombings while soldiers are being charged over deaths in Northern Ireland.Two years ago, Hayes gave an interview to the BBC in which he said he took “collective responsibility” for the IRA’s attacks on the mainland, including the explosions in the Mulberry Bush and Tavern in the Town pubs.Six innocent men were wrongfully convicted of the Birmingham pub bombings, spending almost 17 years in jail before their convictions were quashed.The three other men identified by Witness O were named as Seamus McLoughlin, who was described as the ringleader Mick Murray, who died 20 years ago and was one of the bomb makers and James Gavin who planted one of the bombs. The four men have all previously been named in the media in connection with the attack.Mick Murray (left) and James Gavin (right)Witness O also said he was also aware of the nicknames of two other men involved that he knew only as “Socks” and “Dublin Dave”.Witness O, who gave evidence via videolink from Dublin, told the inquest that McLoughlin was the officer commanding the Birmingham IRA and the person responsible for selecting the targets and that Murray was “one of the bombers”. He recalled Murray telling him there would be “no harm” if similar bombings had been repeated, because of the “chaos” caused.When pressed by a lawyer for the bereaved families, Witness O said Hayes and Gavin were also members of the team.Lesley Thomas, the barrister representing nine of the victims’ families, asked Witness O if Hayes was part of the cell to which he replied: “Hayes, Hayes - I’ll give it (the name) to you now.”Witness O then added, in apparent reference to the Good Friday Agreement: “But he can’t be arrested. There is nobody going to be charged with this atrocity. The British Government have signed an agreement with the IRA.”When asked about Gavin,  he replied: “Well he was (involved), I met him in Dublin and he said he was.”Witness O, who described the bombings as an “atrocity”, said he had nothing to do with the attacks as he had been remanded to Winson Green jail some time before.Inside the Mulberry Bush pub in Birmingham after the blastHe also claimed he had given McLoughlin’s name to two police detectives while in prison just days after the bombings, but heard nothing more.Mr Thomas QC then asked whether another suspect Michael Patrick Reilly had been involved. Mr Reilly, who lives in Belfast, was named in an ITV documentary last year and accused of being the ‘Young Planter’, placing one of the bombs. Mr Reilly has strongly denied the allegation. Witness O, who told the jury he was a convicted IRA bomber who served a prison sentence in the 1970s, replied: “No, I don’t remember him at all. Reilly? I would remember that.”The barrister went on: “Michael Patrick Reilly, sometimes referred to as ‘The Young Planter’? You know who he is, don’t you? He’s the one you’re protecting, isn’t he?”Julie Hambleton, whose sister Maxine was killed, said yesterday: “Witness O has today named the bombers involved in the Birmingham pub bombings.“I have a letter from David Thompson, chief constable of West Midlands Police, that says this is an ongoing live investigation - as such we expect action to be taken as a matter of urgency. Isn’t 44 years long enough to wait for Justice?”The wrecked interior of the Mulberry BushIn a statement West Midlands Police said: “The pub bombing investigation has never closed. Our approach is where new facts come to light, they are scrutinised to see if people can be brought to justice. “The force will never lose sight of the tragic fact that 21 people lost their lives in the atrocities that took place in Birmingham in 1974.“It’s not appropriate to make further comment at this stage while we’re in the middle of the Coroner’s inquests.”Robert Mueller recommends no new criminal charges as he ends Russia probe into Donald TrumpJeremy Hunt seeks to woo Tory MPs at private dinner as he is nicknamed \u0026#39continuity May\u0026#39Comment: What’s at stake now is not just Brexit, but how we are governed as a countryTheresa May gambles on customs union vote as Boris Johnson reminds her of pledge to step asideDowning Street draws up plan to let MPs vote on different Brexit options as Eurosceptic fears of softer orce growBritain needs a no-deal Brexit now - not a long delay, say entrepreneurs in swipe at CBIComment: Petition signatures and celeb endorsements are nothing compared to the Will of the PeoplePolice chief becomes first to back statutory duty of care on social mediaJared Kushner \u0026#39used WhatsApp to contact foreign leaders,\u0026#39 Democrats claimMozambique residents continue to wait for aid after Cyclone IdaiDispatch: Hope stirs in Hardware City as Donald Trump\u0026#39s regeneration plan spurs investorsUS announces new financial sanctions on Venezuela after \u0026#39illegal\u0026#39 arrest of Juan Guaido\u0026#39s chief of staffComment: As Brexit goes down to the wire, the EU are finally starting to blinkChurch employed fascist to carry out pastoral care Seven police officers sent to remove four women from \u0026#39inclusive\u0026#39 talk on transgender issues featuring CEO of MermaidsDUP signals it will reject Theresa May\u0026#39s deal again over \u0026#39inexcusable\u0026#39 failure to demand more concessions from EuropeWimbledon five-year debenture tickets \u0026#34to double in price\u0026#34 as as investors prepare to swoop on valuable seatsBingo loyalists unhappy about millennial slang creeping into the gameLondon Marathon: Charities win review of \u0026#39unfair\u0026#39 system that benefits same organisations annuallyWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/03/22/TELEMMGLPICT000191938478_trans_NvBQzQNjv4Bq3480UNUU8UfSxDSaY1n7MGtT0gK_6EfZT336f62EI5U.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"jared kushner used whatsapp contact foreign leaders democrats","story":"Jared Kushnerused WhatsApp to communicate with foreign leaders, Democrats have claimed.Using the encrypted messaging service for government duties could violate a law banning White House officials from employing non-official electronic messaging accounts.Elijah Cummings, Democrat chairman of the House oversight committee, asked the White House to provide information on whether Mr Kushner, a senior adviser to the president, had used WhatsApp to communicate sensitive or classified details.Mr Cummings suggestions were based on comments made to the committee by Abbe Lowell, Mr Kushner\u0027s lawyer.However, Mr Lowell later said the committee chairman\u0027s characterisation of what he said was not completely accurate.Mr Lowell denied saying that Mr Kushner had been communicating with foreign leaders or officials.He said Mr Kushner had many friends abroad and that he only used the messaging service to talk to some people.Mr Cummings also suggested that Ivanka Trump - the president\u0027s daughter and Mr Kushner\u0027s wife - had continued to use a personal email account while a White House adviser, which would violate the Presidential Records Act.But Mr Lowell denied having told the committee that the president\u0027s daughter was doing that.He indicated that she always forwards official business to her White House account.Donald Trump said he knew nothing about Mr Kushner\u0027s use of WhatsApp.He said: I know nothing about it. I\u0027ve never heard that, I\u0027ve never heard about it.In the 2016 presidential campaign Mr Trump railed against Hillary Clinton, his Democrat opponent, over her use of a private email server while she was serving as secretary of state.Mr Kushner\u0027s communications, particularly with foreign leaders, have been under scrutiny and officials have previously raised questions over whether he should be given a top-secret security clearance.Robert Mueller recommends no new criminal charges as he ends Russia probe into Donald TrumpJeremy Hunt seeks to woo Tory MPs at private dinner as he is nicknamed \u0026#39continuity May\u0026#39Comment: What’s at stake now is not just Brexit, but how we are governed as a countryTheresa May gambles on customs union vote as Boris Johnson reminds her of pledge to step asideDowning Street draws up plan to let MPs vote on different Brexit options as Eurosceptic fears of softer orce growBritain needs a no-deal Brexit now -

Although at first some found them strange-looking or were convinced they would fall out of their ears, they quickly became the in-ear wireless headphone to aspire to.Rarely in the two years and three months since launch has demand eased off. As a result, the look has gone from curious to acceptable to – dare I say it\u0026nbsp– iconic. And certainly ubiquitous.Now, the second-generation AirPods have been announced, I talked to Greg Joswiak, Apple’s Vice President of Product Marketing and Kate Bergeron, Vice President of Hardware Engineering about the new arrivals.The new AirPods look, at first glance, like the older model, even down to the price, which remains the same at £159. There is no difference in the look or shape of the buds themselves and there is only one visible change to the case: a Wireless Charging Case is now available\u0026nbspfor an extra £40, allowing you to place the case on a compatible wireless charging pad instead of plugging it in with a Lightning cable.This means there’s a tiny LED on the outside of the case to show when it’s charging.\u0026nbspThe new\u0026nbspAirPods\u0026nbspare on sale online now and will be in Apple Stores next week.Created with Sketch.Apple unveils the iPhone X Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Apple Senior Vice President of Worldwide Marketing, Phil Schiller, introduces the iPhone x during a launch event in Cupertino, California, U.S. September 12, 2017Apple Senior Vice President of Worldwide Marketing, Phil Schiller, introduces the iPhone X during a launch event in Cupertino, California, U.S. September 12, 2017Apple Senior Vice President of Worldwide Marketing, Phil Schiller, introduces the iPhone X during a launch event in Cupertino, California, U.S. September 12, 2017Apple Senior Vice President of Worldwide Marketing, Phil Schiller, introduces the iPhone x during a launch event in Cupertino, California, U.S. September 12, 2017Apple Senior Vice President of Worldwide Marketing, Phil Schiller, introduces the iPhone x during a launch event in Cupertino, California, U.S. September 12, 2017Apple Senior Vice President of Worldwide Marketing, Phil Schiller, introduces the iPhone x during a launch event in Cupertino, California, U.S. September 12, 2017Apple Senior Vice President of Worldwide Marketing, Phil Schiller, shows Animoji during a launch event in Cupertino, California, U.S. September 12, 2017Apple Senior Vice President of Worldwide Marketing, Phil Schiller, speaks during a launch event in Cupertino, California, U.S. September 12, 2017Apple Senior Vice President of Worldwide Marketing, Phil Schiller, introduces the iPhone x during a launch event in Cupertino, California, U.S. September 12, 2017Tim Cook, CEO of Apple, speaks about the iPhone X during a launch event in Cupertino, California, U.S. September 12, 2017Apple Senior Vice President of Worldwide Marketing, Phil Schiller, introduces the iPhone x during a launch event in Cupertino, California, U.S. September 12, 2017Apple Senior Vice President of Worldwide Marketing, Phil Schiller, introduces the iPhone X during a launch event in Cupertino, California, U.S. September 12, 2017Apple Senior Vice President of Worldwide Marketing, Phil Schiller, introduces the iPhone X during a launch event in Cupertino, California, U.S. September 12, 2017Apple Senior Vice President of Worldwide Marketing, Phil Schiller, introduces the iPhone x during a launch event in Cupertino, California, U.S. September 12, 2017Apple Senior Vice President of Worldwide Marketing, Phil Schiller, introduces the iPhone x during a launch event in Cupertino, California, U.S. September 12, 2017Apple Senior Vice President of Worldwide Marketing, Phil Schiller, introduces the iPhone x during a launch event in Cupertino, California, U.S. September 12, 2017Apple Senior Vice President of Worldwide Marketing, Phil Schiller, shows Animoji during a launch event in Cupertino, California, U.S. September 12, 2017Apple Senior Vice President of Worldwide Marketing, Phil Schiller, speaks during a launch event in Cupertino, California, U.S. September 12, 2017Apple Senior Vice President of Worldwide Marketing, Phil Schiller, introduces the iPhone x during a launch event in Cupertino, California, U.S. September 12, 2017Tim Cook, CEO of Apple, speaks about the iPhone X during a launch event in Cupertino, California, U.S. September 12, 2017So far, so good.“The bigger picture, though, is that AirPods simply deliver a magical wireless experience.”I’m not sure I like using the word magical, but I see what he’s saying. Pairing AirPods with an iPhone is exceptionally simple. As Joswiak explains, “As soon as you’ve pulled the AirPods out of the box and flipped open the lid on the case, there’s a simple one-tap set-up, they’re automatically paired and connected. Once you’ve done that, they’re immediately set up to work with all your Apple devices, including an Apple Watch, iPad or Mac that uses the same Apple ID. Once you’ve used AirPods, you never go back. They’re the most popular wireless headphones in the world. They’ve become a cultural phenomenon. For us, they’re the key ingredient to the wireless future. We designed them to be effortless to use.”Open the case near an iPhone and a screen will pop up showing the exact battery life. And there are other cool features, like the way when you’re talking to someone, and you naturally take one of the AirPods out your ear to do so, the music pauses, resuming when you put the bud back into your ear.All these features remain the same in the new version. By the way, you can use AirPods with Android phones, for instance, but the pairing is not as seamless.Kate Bergeron explains the new headphones in more detail:\u0026nbsp“When we were thinking about generation two, we really wanted to focus on this new H1 chip that was designed specifically for headphones. We’re combining wireless technology which is a hallmark of Apple’s and very highly customised audio. Together, these things create an amazing audio experience. Because the H1 chip is more powerful, it delivers some profound efficiencies, which means you can have Siri available all the time.”Ah, yes, I forgot to say, another AirPods feature is the way you can tap on either of the buds while they are in your ear and then ask Siri, Apple’s virtual personal assistant, to change the track, lift the volume or even give you spoken directions to wherever you’re going.AirPods 2 on Wednesday, 20 March (Apple)Now, with the new AirPods, you don’t need to tap. Just say, “Hey, Siri” and it will respond. This is made possible thanks to the H1 chip saving so much battery life that it can be listening for the magic wake words at all times.“So, we’re able to have \u0027Hey, Siri\u0027 listening enabled at all times and still keep the same battery life as before: five hours’ listening time is still achieved thanks to this new chip,” Bergeron says.“In addition, we’ve been able to deliver 50 per cent more talk time so when you’re on a call, you’ll have three hours of battery life, not two.”Leaving aside whether jabbering on for three hours is really desirable, this is quite a feat. So, how come more talk time but no extra battery life? That’s because when you’re talking, listening out for “Hey, Siri” is turned off.Switching between devices is up to twice as fast, now, too. “If you’re using your AirPods between your Mac, your iPhone and your iPad, switching is even more seamless and the connection to phone calls, when you’re pulling your AirPods out of your pocket to connect to a phone call, is up to 50 per cent faster than before,” Bergeron says. “In addition, for some casual gaming on your iPhone, for instance, we’re able to provide up to 30 per cent lower latency.”My experience of Apple’s stats in situations like this is that the figures don’t mean that much but the experience when you use them is noticeably different.Apple leak reveals bizarre new feature for 2019 iPhoneApple unveils brand new iPads in surprise announcementThe improved chip means improved audio in different ways, too. “The combination of the wireless changes we’ve made in the chip as well as the audio gives a more robust wireless connection, which turns into better audio quality in different conditions. When going outside, some people have found that in that environment there can be problems maintaining RF (radio frequency) links. Now, in all sorts of different conditions we find we’re able to have better audio quality all the time.”The LED on the new wireless charging case is the main visible difference compared to the previous case. “The cases are exactly the same size, there’s a slight increase in weight thanks to adding the wireless charging coil but it’s negligible.”Wireless charging is traditionally slower than through a Lightning cable. “It’s just over two hours to charge the case from zero to 100 per cent via Lightning,” Joswiak chips in, “and around three-and-a-half hours wirelessly. But realistically, customers rarely charge from zero, and the fast charge is the same as before – just put the AirPods themselves into the charging case for 15 minutes and you get three hours of listening time.”Apple is expected to release a new version of iOS, the operating software for iPhones and iPads, soon. I wonder if the new hands-free Siri feature will have to wait for that, but Joswiak’s reply is elegant rather than factually revealing: “We always recommend that for every new product that customers install the latest version of software that’s available at that time.”Reading the runes, I would imagine it means that by the time the new AirPods reach customers next week, that enhanced software will be available to make hands-free Siri work.The new AirPods are a big event because almost no product attracts the level of interest of these little in-ear wireless headphones.\u0026nbsp Next week, if they live up to Apple’s promises, they’ll be even more desirable.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It was on the side of the angels with the second of those, and stands a better chance of winning the next fight\u0026nbspClick to followThe IndependentHyundai\u0027s patriach Chung Moon-Koo. The family Chung family is locked in a battle with Elliott over HyundaiHyundai Motor was celebrating victory this morning. Its investors rejected a demand for the appointment of several new directors and a huge special idend, tabled by the activist investor, Elliott Advisers, which has become a major thorn in the side of the South Korean conglomerate.\u0026nbspPaul Singer’s outfit may have pushed too hard when it came to the size of the Won7tn (£4.7bn) idend it wanted. Hyundai has vast reserves of cash, but its profits have been in decline and the global outlook is cloudy for the motor industry. Given the latter, it’s perhaps understandable that investors baulked and opted for the company’s offer, even though it is worth less than a sixth of what Elliott was proposing.It was on far firmer ground with its demand for a shake up in the boardroom to foster improved governance and greater accountability at the firm, one of the country’s famed family controlled Chaebol that have long dominated the South Asian nation’s vibrant economy. They have been facing criticism on a number of fronts, including the charge of taking minority investors for granted.\u0026nbspHyundai creates app to unlock and control vehicles with mobile phoneHyundai unveils walking car to help save livesHyundai to introduce new electric cars for 2022While this battle may have been lost Elliott’s war is far from over.\u0026nbspIt won a dust up\u0026nbspover a proposed\u0026nbspownership restructuring last year, which critics held was designed solely to benefit the Chung family, and cement its control.The next one will come when a revised plan is submitted later this year. Hyundai only needed the support of 50 per cent of its investors to knock Elliott back over the idend and board seats, and it was assisted by investors such as South Korea’s National Pension Service, the second biggest shareholder, falling in behind the Chung family.\u0026nbspA revised restructuring plan could require up to two thirds support to pass. Elliott should find that easier to win if it objects by aligning with other overseas investors. They hold about half the company.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.Business news: in pictures Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.110 No deal, no tariffsThe government has announced that it would slash almost all tariffs in the event of a no-deal Brexit.

Flybe said it cancelled 994 flights in the three months to 31 March, compared to 372 in the same period last year.I’ve been critical of the activists in the past. They can be of benefit to lumbering,\u0026nbspunderperforming companies with moribund boards that get stuck in the mud and are in need of a good jolt. But they can also cause a great deal of damage in their desire for a quick buck, leaving scorched husks behind them and longer term investors scratching their heads and wondering how it happened.\u0026nbspHowever, while its demand for a huge payout from Hyundai is debatable, Elliott’s call for improved governance sees it on the side of the angels. It\u0027s a sad fact that good corporate governance is an under rated virtue\u0026nbspand it sometimes seems to require the movement of financial mountains to achieve it. Elliott is a rare outfit with the clout to make it happen when so minded.\u0026nbsp \u0026nbspIts activities are certainly being watched very carefully by other Chaebol for fear they’ll be next\u0026nbspas investors in the country demand more influence, better returns.We’ll tell you what’s true.

The supermarkets described the CMA’s provisional findings into the merger, as “prohibition in all but name”.Sainsbury\u0027s boss Mike Coupe and Asda chief executive Roger Burnley added: “We have asked the CMA to correct significant errors in its provisional findings.Created with Sketch.

Their deaths on Pakistan’s ‘Killer Mountain’\u0026nbspleave a sport reckoning with its own burgeoning popularity, writes Adam WithnallClick to followThe IndependentThe bodies of British climber Tom Ballard and Italian Daniele Nardi were found after a two-week searchTom Ballard will never climb Everest. Before his death on Pakistan’s Nanga Parbat was confirmed earlier this month, the prodigious British mountaineer would joke that he had been scaling peaks since before he was born –\u0026nbspin a way, it was what he was born to do.\u0026nbspAged just 30, Ballard already had some extraordinary feats on his climbing resume, foremost among them his record for scaling all six of Europe’s most challenging north faces in a single winter.Ballard’s mother was Anna Hargreaves, the first woman ever to climb Everest solo in 1995 and who, equally famously in the eyes of the press at the time, then died descending K2 the same year, leaving behind a husband, Jim, and two children, Tom and his sister Kate.\u0026nbspShe carried Tom up the north face of the Eiger in the Swiss Alps when she was six months pregnant, and after he was born the family moved to Scotland so Hargreaves could practice on the local crags.The story of how Ballard came to attempt this particular mountain –\u0026nbspthe mountain where his body will remain unless and until a recovery attempt is made –\u0026nbspis as much about his co-climber Daniele Nardi as it is about the way this extraordinary, exhilarating yet occasionally deadly sport has evolved since Ballard’s mother’s own demise.Ballard, 30, and Nardi, 42, were attempting to reach Nanga Parbat’s 8,126m peak via the most direct route, the Mummery Spur. It is an audacious approach, flanked on both sides by towering ice walls that make avalanches a regular occurrence and requiring “mixed climbing” across both ice and rock, a technique beyond even some of the most proficient mountaineers.Created with Sketch.Peaks of Europe Show all 35Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.‘Peaks of Europe’ is a photobook by Johan Lolos.

Published by LannooThe dangers and challenges are such that no one has ever successfully taken the Mummery Spur route in winter before. And for Nardi, who had already turned back from four previous attempts at the same expedition, that was the point.\u0026nbspThe Italian was obsessed with the route, says Pakistani climber and tour operator Ali Muhammad, who accompanied Nardi on his 2014-15 attempt but chose to turn back when conditions became too hazardous.In winter this mountain is so dangerous very windy, many avalanches and cloudy, with zero visibility. Sometimes you have to stop on the wall because you cannot see where to go – down or upNanga Parbat is known as the “Killer Mountain” for a reason, he tells The Independent. “In winter this mountain is so very dangerous very windy, many avalanches and cloudy, with zero visibility. Sometimes you have to stop on the wall because you cannot see where to go –\u0026nbspdown or up. Then we have no choice:\u0026nbspjust hold on until we get better weather.”It was only three years ago, in early 2016, when an international team of climbers made the coveted first winter ascent of Nanga Parbat by any route, leaving K2 as the only mountain above 8,000m anywhere in the world that has yet to be conquered in winter.Muhammad says he understands the urge to conquer a mountain in a way that has never been done before. “Daniele and Tom were trying to make a new history in winter climbing,”\u0026nbsphe says.But the Mummery Spur, he says, is not just one of the hardest ways to summit Nanga Parbat\u0026nbsp–\u0026nbspit is, in Muhammad’s view, the most difficult unconquered route anywhere in Pakistan, perhaps even the world.Nanga Parbat is seen as a far greater challenge for serious climbers than Everest\u0026nbsp(AP)Simone Mori, the star Italian climber among the group that completed the winter ascent in 2016, has described the Mummery Spur as “suicidal”. “It is ice, rocks, snow, and deep crevasses, and that’s just to reach Camp 2. After Camp 2 there are no crevasses. It is all vertical,” Muhammad says.Nardi and Ballard last made contact with base camp when they were at an altitude of about 6,300m. After a search of almost two weeks, their bodies were found using a high-power telescopic lens by Spanish climber Alex Txikon, another of the successful 2016 ascent team. The families consented to the release of the images, showing two figures and a tent lying close together on a small patch of snow at the bottom of a gully, surrounded by jagged rocks.What changed in the sport of mountaineering between Hargreaves’ generation and that of her son, Ballard, and Nardi? Everest is still Everest, the highest peak on the planet, its height unchanged,\u0026nbspmore or less,\u0026nbspfrom 1995 to 2019.Rather what has changed is our perception of what is humanly possible, argues Jake Meyer, a mountaineer who at the age of 21 years and four months became the youngest Briton to scale Everest in 2005.\u0026nbspHe says that the cultural allure of Everest comes from the fact that it wasn’t climbed at all, that we know of, until Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay as late as 1953.The number of climbers worldwideAfter that, the landmarks tumbled:\u0026nbspin 1975, the first woman to reach the summit. In 1978, the first successful climb without supplemental oxygen. In 1980, the first winter summit. All the way to Hargreaves’ own achievement in 1995. To elite climbers, Everest now has little left to offer.Like Ballard, Meyer started climbing when he was young, gaining a degree of competency quickly so that his youth alone was basis enough to set new benchmarks and, almost just as importantly, attract the interest of sponsors to make the expeditions possible.\u0026nbspHe describes a never-ending “arms race” among professional mountaineers to keep pushing the boundaries and achieve things that have never been done before, or at least do them in a way that is new –\u0026nbspplaying with the “semantics”, he calls it.Nanga Parbat is the ninth tallest mountain in the world (AFPGetty)Nardi was keenly aware of this competition, and indeed saw it as integral to the sport. Pakistani mountaineer Karim Shah Nizari quoted him in a tribute after his death by saying: “He always said, ‘A climber is someone who climbs new routes’.”In a modern world of social media and round-the-clock connectivity, that urge to open up new frontiers and explore the world’s last wildernesses may be appealing –\u0026nbspbut it is also one “that has always been there” as a driving force for the great historic mountaineers, Meyer says.The difference now is that with Facebook, Instagram and Twitter, hundreds of thousands of fans around the world can follow their favourite climbers’ expeditions in real time.Nardi’s official Facebook page had more than 100,000 followers at the time of his death. The latest updates in the search and rescue operation for the pair were distributed direct to supporters by Stefano Pontecorvo, the Italian ambassador to Pakistan. And Alex Txikon, who has more than 58,000 Facebook followers, shared dramatic photographs and video from the frontline of the search.Alex Honnold, the first solo climber to scale Yosemite’s El Capitan Could this new exposure, and the fact that sponsors pay a lot of attention to mountaineers’ status as modern influencers, be another factor leading them to take greater risks? It’s a question Meyer poses. “Everyone is so aware of what everyone else is doing,” he says. “You have\u0026nbspto be doing bigger, badder, more awesome and, as a result, slightly dangerous things to keep up? I think that if people are treating it like that, then it is a race to the bottom.”If mountaineering and climbing have taken an edgier and more extreme turn in the past 20 years, it isn’t just on new media formats that people are taking notice.\u0026nbspUp until the turn of the century, the sport was considered fodder for low-rent thrillers like Vertical Limit (2000, starring Chris O’Donnell), Cliff Hanger (1993, Sylvester Stallone) and The Eiger Sanction (1975).Something changed around the time of North Face (2008), a critically acclaimed German film about the competition to scale the most dangerous ascent of the Alps. In 2010, 127 Hours about mountaineer Aron Ralston’s fall down a canyon in Utah was runner-up for six Academy Awards.\u0026nbspFinally, this year the suspenseful Free Solo, about Alex Honnold’s successful climb up Yosemite’s El Capitan rock wall without a rope, won the Oscar for best documentary.I don’t go to the mountains because I have a death wish. On the contrary, I go there because that’s where I feel aliveClimbing is now officially cool –\u0026nbspand there are figures to back up the assumption that young people who might once have been inspired to take up skate- or snowboarding are now turning to their local bouldering gym instead.\u0026nbspIn North America, indoor climbing is set to be a billion-dollar industry by the year 2021, according to the Climbing Wall Association, with a record 43 new climbing gyms opening up across the US in 2017.The International Federation of Sport Climbing estimates 25 million people are climbing regularly worldwide, with the number of young competitors in the UK up 50 per cent in the past five years.\u0026nbspAnd in another landmark for the sport unthinkable a generation ago, sport climbing will feature at the summer Olympic Games for the first time in history next year at Tokyo 2020.Created with Sketch.Jake Meyer: youngest Briton to climb Mount Everest Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.110 Jake Meyer and K2210 Team climbing at 7400m on K2310 Ottalie and Poppy (with Daddy on the front page)410 Camp 4 on K2 - 7650m510 Jake on way to summit610 Climbing though the glacier710 Jake at summit of K2810 Ottalie, Jake and Saskia at Heathrow as Jake arrives home1010 Basecamp panorama K2 on left, Broad Peak on right110 Jake Meyer and K2210 Team climbing at 7400m on K2310 Ottalie and Poppy (with Daddy on the front page)410 Camp 4 on K2 - 7650m510 Jake on way to summit610 Climbing though the glacier710 Jake at summit of K2810 Ottalie, Jake and Saskia at Heathrow as Jake arrives home1010 Basecamp panorama K2 on left, Broad Peak on right“It’s amazing to see how much it’s changed over my career, and we’re talking 20 years since I watched the new millennium dawn over Kilimanjaro,” Meyer says.\u0026nbsp“It’s incredible, fantastic, and it’s an inspiration.”As the sport’s popularity continues to grow and its elite members keep pushing the limits of what’s possible, a point will be reached where mountaineering must pause and take stock of the element that makes it stand apart from other pursuits – the extraordinary risk to life involved.The Italian climber Mori has been the most outspoken in the community since Ballard and Nardi’s deaths, telling The Times newspaper that “if we continue to say they were just unlucky, the risk is someone will die there next year”.And if the trend continues for increasingly young climbers to seek out the road less travelled, in search of new and more impressive feats, the dangers posed are not just from the mountains themselves.\u0026nbspSearchight)Nowhere is this more evident than with Nanga Parbat. In 2013, a major terrorist attack was launched at the mountain’s base camp, itself a remote outcrop 4,200m above sea level that can only be reached on foot.\u0026nbspThe attack, claimed by the Pakistani Taliban, killed one local guide and 10 international climbers, among them an American-Chinese citizen who was believed to have been the prime target for the gunmen in a kidnapping gone wrong.In 2013 at Nanga\u0026nbspParbat\u0026nbspbasecamp a\u0026nbspterrorist attack by Pakistani Taliban claimed the lives of one guide and 1o international climbersAfter the massacre, the gunmen walked for five hours before eating breakfast at a village and dissipating in the small hours of the morning. An AFP report a year on from the attack suggested most, if not all of the perpetrators remained at large.\u0026nbspThe 2013 attack aside, the Gilgit Pakistan region where most of the country’s biggest mountains lie is generally very safe, far from the restive western border with Afghanistan.Trekkers and climbing enthusiasts are starting to return to the region in larger numbers and can expect encouragement from visa officials and a warm welcome from locals, says Karra Hadri, spokesman for the Alpine Club of Pakistan, the sport’s governing body in the country.\u0026nbspHadri, who remembers Ballard from the time when he visited Pakistan as a toddler with his mother and was carried up to K2 base camp on a porter’s back, says last year there were more than 40 major expeditions in Pakistan –\u0026nbspup from just one or two in the years after the 911 attack.The Bigger Red Nose Climb: Charity trek could do with less BallsStray dog follows climbers to become first to reach Himalayan summitWoman becomes first in India to climb ‘men only’ sacred mountainBut he is concerned that growing numbers of young people will come to the country seeking adventure and put their lives in danger. He is calling for a change to the regulations for permits, so that climbers must prove themselves on smaller peaks before attempting any of Pakistan’s five 8,000m-plus summits.“Mountaineering in Pakistan, especially above 8,000m, can be very difficult compared to the rest of the world,” he says. “We still have many mountains that have not been climbed, but youngsters need to know the risks. They should have a lot of skill, a lot of experience, and much budget. And they should go in a group,\u0026nbspnot just one or two alone.”Hadri was closely tracking the progress of the search operation over the past two weeks and was “very sorry to hear” about Nardi and Ballard’s fates. “Tom’s mother was a brave lady,”\u0026nbsphe adds.Ballard is survived by his sister, Kate, who posted a message on Facebook after he went missing thanking people across the world for their “love and thoughts”, and by his girlfriend Stefania Pederiva, who wrote: “I will find you in nature, in the rivers, in the trees, in the mountains, you will always be my most beautiful rock.”Nardi is survived by his wife Daniela and a son Mattia, who is just six months old.\u0026nbspAnd while the sport mourns two of its most promising sons, climbers as a whole are stoic about the risks they take in pursuit of their passion.\u0026nbspMeyer, who last year joined an elite group of only 10 Britons to have scaled K2, says he cannot imagine removing the element of danger from mountaineering,\u0026nbspdespite having, like Nardi, young children at home.“I don’t go to the mountains because I have a death wish. On the contrary, I go there because that’s where I feel alive,” he says.\u0026nbsp“If you remove the element of risk completely, then what you are left with is almost every other sport. Having children didn’t change my desire to want to go, but what it did was it gave me three times the reasons to come home safe.”We’ll tell you what’s true.

Then on 25 October a cow fell ill on a farm near the market town of Oswestry in Shropshire.That was the beginning of an epidemic that only ended five months later, with the farming business on its knees and huge areas of the country covered by overlapping five-mile exclusion zones.A total of 442,000 animals had been slaughtered in 2,364 separate outbreaks. Roughly £150m\u0026nbsp–\u0026nbspa huge amount at the time –\u0026nbspwas spent on slaughter costs and lost sales farmers received £27m in compensation.It became known as the Great Cattle Plague, and even today it is still the subject of angry discussion in rural circles.As outbreaks popped up around the country, triggered by the combination of the virus’s 14-day incubation period and its extreme infectiousness, the Ministry of Agriculture began imposing five-mile exclusion zones as new infections were identified animals could not be moved in or out.Created with Sketch.Looking back at Britain’s foot-and-mouth outbreaks: 1927-1967 Show all 25Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Two farmworkers read a notice declaring a footpath closed because of foot-and-mouthA man hoses down a car at Cockernach Farm, Barkway,  Hertfordshire, in an attempt to contain the spread of foot-and-mouth.

Entrances to fields and farms were blocked with disinfected straw members of the public were not allowed to enter them.Humans are usually safe from the disease, but at least one person died from the epidemic some of the worst outbreaks were in Cheshire, Shropshire and Wales.The disease was later reckoned to have been virtually eradicated throughout the European Union after a campaign of vaccination and slaughter. That makes yesterday’s action, in which the EU banned all meat, milk and livestock exports from the UK, understandable.After slaughter, farms had to be scrubbed twice a day with special disinfectant and animals were not allowed on to the land for at least six months. Restricted entry signs stood over the entrance to farmland, bearing warnings including: “You are now entering an infected area.”Horse racing was suspended in Britain after the 1967 outbreak and the official Shrovetide football game in Ashbourne, Derbyshire, was cancelled in 1968 because of continuing restrictions.The outbreak was finally linked to frozen lamb carcasses imported from Argentina.Although Britain did suffer another foot-and-mouth outbreak in 1981 on the Isle of Wight, it was easily isolated. A total of 200 cattle and 369 pigs were destroyed.This article first appeared in The Independent on 22 February 2001We’ll tell you what’s true.

In nine days, Scottish farmers and dealers reach the more important deadline when they can apply for a resumption of overseas exports, because then they will have been free of the disease for 90 days.The auction at Kirkwall, capital of the Orkneys six miles off the mainland, was seen as a trial run for the resumption of trade in other unaffected areas of the United Kingdom.Though no more than two dozen buyers, many of them mainland farmers from Aberdeenshire, made the ferry trip for yesterday’s sale, only auction and government veterinary officials, and representatives from the Scottish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, were allowed close contact with the livestock. The buyers, dressed from head-to-toe in hats, clean boiler suits, rubber boots and white plastic raincoats, had to forgo the usual close inspections of the cattle before the sale began.For the Orcadians, the resumption of the weekly cattle mart was more than just a lifeline for business. The social effect of the closure has been devastating. Since the beginning of the crisis, movement on the island has been curtailed because friends and neighbours fearful of spreading the disease kept their distance from other farms.Created with Sketch.How the 2001 foot-and-mouth outbreak brought Britain to a standstill Show all 26Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Around 150 dead cows that may have come in contact with foot-and-mouth disease are burnt on a funeral pyre at Great Warley Hall farm in Great Warley, Essex, 27 February 2001.

There’s much still to do to get out of the mess that foot-and-mouth has caused and get the farmers back to a kind of normality.”Steven Metcalf, chairman of Orkney Auction Mart, said: “The social effect of the mart reopening is good news. Early in the outbreak people were frightened to move around and weren’t visiting neighbours or friends. It is a good boost for the morale of agriculture and it is a step nearer to normal trading and normal life.”Although the slaughter of more than 800,000 animals north of the border has so far limited the number of confirmed cases to 187, Maria Limonci, spokeswoman for the NFUS, said Scottish farmers needed to see export bans lifted. “Around 40 per cent of the sheep produced in Scotland usually go out of the country and at present they have nowhere to go,” she said. “More farmers deal in sheep than cattle, and this was only one sale. It’s a huge step in the right direction but it doesn’t mean things are now OK.“We have to hope nothing goes wrong in next few days. Having 90 clear days would give Scotland grounds to put forward the proposal to Europe to allow exports to restart.”In England, continuing restrictions prompted 600 farmers yesterday to demand a public inquiry into the handling of the crisis.David Handley, head of the pressure group Farmers For Action who spearheaded last year’s fuel blockade, led a protest march from Hyde Park to Downing Street to hand in a petition condemning the government’s policy on dealing with the crisis and the failure to implement a vaccination strategy to prevent the spread of the disease.Although the turnout was lower than expected, protesters included farmers from foot-and-mouth hotspots in North Yorkshire, Cumbria and Devon and Cornwall.Up to 3,000 civil servants at the Department of the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs held a one-day strike on 20 August 2001 over pay inequalities that followed formation of the new departmentThis article first appeared in The Independent on 21 August 2001We’ll tell you what’s true.

The meth maker believes his days of cooking are long over. Having lunch with his family, everything seems perfect. And then everything goes wrong. So, so wrong. Hank (Dean Norris) goes to use the toilet and picks up a copy of Walt Whitman\u0027s Leaves of Grass – a gift from Gale to Walter White. “To my other favorited WW. It\u0027s an honour working with you. Fondly, GB.” And with that, as Hank realises Walt’s true identity, the end of Heisenberg’s empire begins.The debate over whether certain final scenes of television shows are actually good will rage on and on. The Sopranos remains front and centre of the conversation. It\u0027s a seemingly banal occasion – a restaurant dinner scene. We watch on as Tony sits there, observing other customers. Carmela arrives, then AJ and Meadow, who the last we see, is parking her car outside. A bell rings, Tony looks up and the screen cuts to black. It’s an ending that’s inspired essays offering varied interpretations but ultimately, it remains a beautifully-executed few minutes of television – and a cliffhanger that’ll never have a resolution.337 EastEnders – The Kat and Zoe revelation (2001)“You can’t tell me what to do ‘cause you ain’t my muvva”  “YES I AM!” - not the work of Shakespeare, granted, but surely one of the biggest moments in soap history. The nation’s jaws collectively dropped as they learned that Kat Slater (Jessie Wallace) wasn’t Zoe’s sister at all, but her mum.  437 Game of Thrones – The Rains of Castamere (2013)Game of Thrones knew George RR Martin was willing to kill off leading characters, but nothing prepared non-book readers for The Red Wedding. Robb Stark (Richard Madden), Talisa Stark (Oona Chaplin) and Catelyn Stark (Michelle Fairley) are attending the wedding of Roslin Frey (Alexandra Dowling) and Edmure Tully (Tobias Menzies) when things go terribly, terribly wrong for the Starks. The Freys turn on them, killing Robb, Talisa and their unborn child. Then, as the blood spills everywhere, Catelyn’s throat is slit. Cut to black. Devastating.The cliffhanger that kickstarted the end of season cliffhanger trend. Larry Hagman’s oil baron JR Ewing had made plenty of enemies in Dallas. By the end of season three, one of them took justice into their own hands, shooting JR in the back twice. However, rather than reveal the culprit, the team behind Dallas left the case unsolved. And over the next eight months – the time between seasons – the whole world was asking “Who shot JR?” Unsurprisingly, considering the hysteria around the mystery, 350 million people tuned in to watch the revelatory episode “Who Done It”.Showrunner Matt Groening had long wanted to do an episode where Mr Burns was shot, and the culprit was not revealed until the next episode. Taking inspiration from Dallas, the animation concluded Part One with the nuclear power plant owner being shot by an unknown assailant. Then, after a Summer of waiting, fans were finally treated to the answer. The two-part episode has gone down as a classic and is often heralded as the series’ best.737 Doctor Who – The Parting of the Ways (2005)Choosing one standout Doctor Who cliffhanger is almost impossible – especially when you consider that all 37 (and counting) seasons have frequently used the plot device. While the introduction of John Hurt’s Doctor certainly ranks among them, one of best came at the end of the rebooted first series. Having absorbed a bunch of vortexes, the Doctor is struggling and on the verge of regenerating. Turning to Rose (Billie Piper), Christopher Eccleston’s incarnation of the iconic character utters the timeless lines: “Before I go, I just want to tell you, you were fantastic. Absolutely fantastic. And you know what – so was I.” Queue shoddy CGI and the introduction of the soon-to-be nation’s favourite Doctor, David Tennant. “So, where was I? That’s it – Barcelona.”Gale (David Costabile) is one of the nicest characters on Breaking Bad. He is not interested in wealth or fame, but in science. However, niceties and a good cup of coffee are not enough to stop him getting in Walter White’s (Bryan Cranston) way. When the choice between their lives has to be made, Walter chooses his own and sends Jesse Pinkman (Aaron Paul) to do the dirty work. Season three ends with Jesse killing Gale – an incident that eventually brings down the drug kingpin Gus Fring.937 The West Wing – “What Kind of Day Has it Been” (2000)The West Wing’s biggest cliffhanger came in the season one finale. The episode works its way back from the beginning as we see a Secret Service Agent sense danger from a nearby window at a town hall meeting with the president in attendance. When the episode catches up, gunfire rings out and each member of his senior staff is thrown to the floor. Cut to black as we hear an agent ask over the radio: “Who’s been hit?”It wasn’t until the third season finale of Smallville that Superman fans’ patience was rewarded as viewers saw Clark (Tom Welling) appear naked in the middle of a Kryptonian symbol burned into the field of his family’s farm. “You shall be reborn,” Jor-El can be heard saying to Clark Kent, but he wasn’t the alone one the ending marked a radical turning point for the series.Twin Peaks’ season two finale – the mystery drama’s last episode for 27 years – may have featured the most chilling cliffhanger, but the biggest gasp of the series came at the end of season one as the seemingly untouchable Dale Cooper (Kyle MacLachlan) responds to a knock on his hotel room door, only to be gunned down by an unseen assailant.1237 Buffy the Vampire Slayer – The Gift (2001)The 100th episode of Buffy ended with one of the show’s most shocking moments (and no, we’re not talking about the musical episode). Season five concluded with the eponymous ass-kicker sacrificing herself to save the world by jumping into a demonic portal. The episode ends with a slow zoom onto Buffy’s tombstone, which reads: “Beloved sister. Devoted friend. She saved the world. A lot.“It\u0027s easy to forget that True Blood began life as an acclaimed Emmy-nominated drama, and it was a cliffhanger such as this that made it so: Sookie Stackhouse (Anna Paquin) falls asleep with the friendly neighbour dog Dean for company. Upon waking up, Dean is gone and in his place is local barman Sam Merlotte ( Sam Trammell). Turns out he\u0027s a shapeshifter.1437 The Walking Dead – Last Day on Earth (2016)After eight episodes of build-up, the comic book’s deadliest villain, Negan, reared his head in a scene fans were dreading. With the majority of the main cast lined up at his mercy, Negan – in retaliation for the death of one of his gang – decides which one to kill by using “Eeny Meeny Mino Moe”. After selecting his victim, the camera switches POV and Negan bludgeons the unseen character to death leaving fans with a six-month wait before finding out who had met their maker.Lost co-creator Damon Lindelof\u0027s HBO drama was set in a world that saw two per cent of the world’s population disappear into thin air during a tragic event known as the Sudden Departure. Season two presented an intriguing mystery: the disappearance of three teenage girls from a Texan town that nobody had vanished from. It was the season\u0027s penultimate episode that cleared up this plot line as Matt Garvey (Chris Zylka) breaks into a heavily-guarded trailer – only to be met with the three teenage girls staring back at him. What’s more is they’re dressed all in white, a callback to the disbanded cult from the first season.In episode 11, the writers had introduced a hatch buried underground and, week in week out, the fans waited patiently for any detail about the mysterious structure the writers were willing to give them. The end of episode 19 saw a desperate John Locke (Terry O’Quinn) banging on the door, just as desperate to get inside as the viewers were... only for a light to come on from within. This ending remains an unforgettable moment for those who watched it at the time of broadcast.1737 Lost – “Two for the Road” (2006)“I’m sorry.” “For what?” BANG. On paper, not so effective but on screen, it equated to one of Lost’s most gasp-inducing cliffhangers. Viewers watched behind their eyes as Michael (Harold Perrineau), desperate to save his son from the mysterious Others, shoots Ana-Lucia (Michelle Rodriguez) and, in a cruel twist, Libby (Cynthia Watros), who has accidentally stumbled upon the whole thing while looking for some blankets.1837 Lost - \u0027Through the Looking Glass – Part 2Whether you love or hate Lost, there’s no denying that the season three finale deployed one of the most breathtaking rug pulls in television history as writers Damon Lindelof and Carlton Cuse revealed a shake-up long in the running: flashbacks featuring a suicidal Jack Shephard (Matthew Fox) were, in fact, flashforwards to the future. The Oceanic Flight 815 plane crash survivor made it off the island he’d been so desperate to get off for three whole seasons, but was, disturbingly, desperate to get back. The ending set the benchmark for all future finale and was so huge it made newspaper headlines.1937 Line of Duty – Series four premiere (2018)The fourth series of Line of Duty didn’t hold back on the shocks. In fact, its first episode featured a cliffhanger ending to rival the best of them. With DCI Roz Huntley (Thandie Newton) dead on his floor, her murderer – Forensic Coordinator Tim Ifield (Jason Watkins) – sets about dispatching her body, but as his chainsaw nears her face, Roz’s eyes suddenly open.After season one, Heroes became pretty dreadful television. But this cliffhanger looms in the memory for being so left-field it warrants applaud: having captured serial killer Sylar, Angela Petrelli – parent to superheroes Nathan and Peter – tells him she can provide him with the love and guidance he needs. Angry, Sylar tells her she’s not his mother to which Angela drops the bombshell: “But I am dear, I am.” A head-scratching mid-season reveal that had fans chomping at the bit for the next episode.After spending an entire season watching the blossoming romance between medical intern Meredith Grey (Ellen Pompeo) and Dr Derek Shephard (Patrick Dempsey), the world of viewers was rocked upon discovering the shock revelation that Derek was married all along.Channel 4 sitcom Green Wing took the term “cliffhanger” quite literally for each finale of its two series. While it became a tad gimmicky the second time around, the first remained a genuinely surprising way for a comedy series to end: having discovered that the colleague he’d just slept with was his mother, drug-addled anaesthetist Guy Secretan (Stephen Mangan) steals an ambulance, drives it to the country and loses control. After crashing, the episode ends with Guy and several other characters dangling – you guessed it – off a cliff.A particularly nail-biting fourth season was shaping up to end well: after weeks of playing cat-and-mouse with the Trinity Killer (John Lithgow on Emmy-winning form), Dexter finally put an end to his murderous ways and returned home ready to pack up and join his wife Rita on their vacation. Only Rita’s still at home... dead in the bathtub. Trinity killed her before Dexter got to him. A heartbreaking end to a standout season.When things are going supremely well towards the end of a season finale, you know something big is about to go down. Battlestar Galactica proved no different. After destroying the Cylon Basestar – a warship belonging to the enemy – crew member Boomer, who viewers had learnt was a Cylon in the mini-series that aired the year before, fires a round into the chest of Commander Adama (Edward James Olmos), the show’s main character.Having been warned for two seasons that Z’ha’dum means death, fans expected big things from an episode called “Z’ha’dum”. They weren’t wrong. It ended with the show’s lead character jumping to his death. The episode was so big the episodes leading up to it teased “Z minus 14 days” and “Z minus 7 days.”24 was filled to the brim with huge cliffhangers, but this one – arriving at the 16 episode mark – stands out for sparking what would be the show’s best run of episodes. President Charles Logan (Gregory Itzin) is revealed to be the mastermind behind the shocking assassinations of David Palmer and Michelle Dessler, which kickstarted the season. And thus the show’s most memorable villain was born.2737 Friends – The One with Ross’s Wedding (1998)While Ross (David Schwimmer) and Rachel’s (Jennifer Aniston) “will they, won’t they” courtship arguably went on far too long, there was one moment during the season four finale that left fans with their jaws on the floor. Just after Rachel had accepted Ross was happy with fiancé Emily (Helen Baxendale), everything goes catastrophically wrong. Instead of saying Emily’s name during the wedding vows, Ross says the iconic line: “Take thee Rachel”. After the wedding, as the season finished, everyone was left wondering whether the pair would finally rekindle their romance for good.“I’m in a boxcar, buried inside a quarry, and there are bodies everywhere,” says Mulder to Scully during the season two finale. And just as Mulder solves the riddle of how those people died, the roof of the boxcar slams shut, trapping him inside. Worse still, the Smoking Man then arrives with a unit of soldiers. When they open the boxcar, Mulder’s somehow nowhere to be seen and they decide to blow the freight to smithereens. Did Mulder survive? Did he get away?2937 Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life – Fall (2016)“It certainly wasn\u0027t the ending I expected,” Rory Gilmore actor Alexis Bledel said of the finale. “Fitting but frustrating”, was how Vanity Fair referred to the episode. The Gilmore Girls sequel, A Year in the Life, concluded with a four-word exchange between Rory and her mother, Lorelai (Lauren Graham). “Mum”, the daughter says, sitting in a park’s bandstand. “Yeah”, she replies. “I’m pregnant,” Rory says. Queue hundreds of fans wanting more from the story, which had, ultimately, come full circle.3037 Star Trek: The Next Generation – Best of Both Worlds (1990)Another science fiction show filled to the brim with cliffhangers. Star Trek: The Next Generation had many, but few can measure up to Picard (Patrick Stewart) becoming a Borg. The season three finale sees the Enterprise’s crew having no choice but to turn on their former captain, with Riker (Jonathan Frakes) ordering Worf (Michael Dorn) to open fire on Picard’s Borg ship. Fans had to wait three months to discover whether Picard could be saved – and the fandom almost imploded in the meantime.Marissa Cooper (Mischa Barton) and Ryan Atwood (Benjamin McKenzie) would have done anything for each other. When Ryan’s brother Trey (Logan Marshall-Green) gets in the way, attacking Marissa, Ryan has no other course of action but to settle things “once and for all” between them. As the brawl ensues, Marissa somehow ends up shooting Trey. And as the bullet goes through him, Imogen Heap’s song “Hide and Seek” – AKA the “Mmmmh, what you say?” song – suddenly starts playing. It’s hard not to laugh. The pop song cuts through the scene, completely at odds with what’s happening on screen. No wonder, then, that Saturday Night Live famously parodied the scene in one of their most-beloved skits of all time.Jim (John Krasinski) and Pam (Jenna Fischer) were the ultimate “will they, won’t they” couple, their chemistry electrifying the early seasons of The Office. Things peaked for the first time during the season two finale. Following Casino Night at Dunder Mifflin, Jim finally takes Pam aside to reveal his true feelings, telling her: “I’m in love with you.” She is, at the time, engaged to Roy (David Denman), and decides to reply to Jim: “What are you doing?” While all hope for the pair seems lost, Jim finds Pam (calling her mother) before the episode’s end and kisses her. Cruelly, the showrunners decided to cut to black after the moment, leaving fans wondering for months whether the couple would return to screens happily together (spoiler: they do not).JJ Abrams loves ending things on a twist. Before creating the mystery-box filled Lost, the filmmaker created Alias, and the season two finale marks one the show’s greatest endings. The episode sees Sydney (Jennifer Garner) discover that Francie (Merrin Dungey) is not Francie at all, but a duplicate. The two then brawl, ending with Sydney shooting Francie and then collapsing due to exhaustion. We immediately jump to Sydney waking up in Hong Kong. After reuniting with her lover Michael Vaughn (Michael Vartan), Sydney realises things are amiss as Michael is wearing a wedding ring. Turns out, she has been missing for almost two years. Cut to black, and the world asking “What just happened?”3437 Spooks – Smoke and Mirrors (2003)The season two finale of Spooks shocked the nation. While the episode begins with the CIA taking on a seemingly straightforward mission – to prevent a member of the Cabinet being assassinated – we soon discover that everything’s not as it seems. The formerly-presumed dead Herman Joyce (Tomas Arana) is still alive and masquerading as Herb Zeigler. Not only that, but the villain has masterminded an elaborate plan to make it seem as if Tom (Matthew Macfadyen) has assassinated the Chief of the Defence Staff. With everything working against Tom, the agent finds himself backed into a corner. And when Harry (Peter Firth) loses faith, Tom decides to shoot Harry with his shotgun. Does Harry die? Will Tom ever be found innocent? The questions were many.3537 Dragon Ball Z – Next time on Dragon Ball ZThere’s really no definitive Dragon Ball Z cliffhanger, as almost every single episode in the series finishes with one. From Vegeta staring menacingly at the camera to the villainous Cell launching a deadline attack on Goku, the series leaves you anywhere and everywhere. When that voice-over comes in with “Next time on Dragon Ball Z”, you can guarantee any child watching will be hooked and instantly wanting to watch the next episode.Pushing Up Daisies was unceremoniously brought to an end after just two seasons, with showrunner Bryan Fuller having to quickly conclude the whimsical series with very little notice. The epilogue was added late into the writing process and sees the narrator offer some closure to each characters’ story. Yet, with Ned (Lee Pace) and Chuck (Anna Friel) standing on her aunts’ doorstep, waiting to finally reveal that she’s alive, fans could see that there were originally supposed to be many more seasons to come – and they still want them desperately.Following a war of words with Jim Moriarty (Andrew Scott) on the roof of a building (in which Moriarty shoots himself in the head), Sherlock (Benedict Cumberbatch) decides to seemingly commit suicide by jumping off the building. However, not all is at it seems, as Sherlock is seen alive before the episode end. Fans of the series – plus Martin Freeman’s Watson – were left questioning what exactly happened to Sherlock, with all being revealed in the following special.Karma for killing Gale comes for Walter White in season five. The meth maker believes his days of cooking are long over. Having lunch with his family, everything seems perfect. And then everything goes wrong. So, so wrong. Hank (Dean Norris) goes to use the toilet and picks up a copy of Walt Whitman\u0027s Leaves of Grass – a gift from Gale to Walter White. “To my other favorited WW. It\u0027s an honour working with you. Fondly, GB.” And with that, as Hank realises Walt’s true identity, the end of Heisenberg’s empire begins.The debate over whether certain final scenes of television shows are actually good will rage on and on. The Sopranos remains front and centre of the conversation. It\u0027s a seemingly banal occasion – a restaurant dinner scene. We watch on as Tony sits there, observing other customers. Carmela arrives, then AJ and Meadow, who the last we see, is parking her car outside. A bell rings, Tony looks up and the screen cuts to black. It’s an ending that’s inspired essays offering varied interpretations but ultimately, it remains a beautifully-executed few minutes of television – and a cliffhanger that’ll never have a resolution.337 EastEnders – The Kat and Zoe revelation (2001)“You can’t tell me what to do ‘cause you ain’t my muvva”  “YES I AM!” - not the work of Shakespeare, granted, but surely one of the biggest moments in soap history. The nation’s jaws collectively dropped as they learned that Kat Slater (Jessie Wallace) wasn’t Zoe’s sister at all, but her mum.  437 Game of Thrones – The Rains of Castamere (2013)Game of Thrones knew George RR Martin was willing to kill off leading characters, but nothing prepared non-book readers for The Red Wedding. Robb Stark (Richard Madden), Talisa Stark (Oona Chaplin) and Catelyn Stark (Michelle Fairley) are attending the wedding of Roslin Frey (Alexandra Dowling) and Edmure Tully (Tobias Menzies) when things go terribly, terribly wrong for the Starks. The Freys turn on them, killing Robb, Talisa and their unborn child. Then, as the blood spills everywhere, Catelyn’s throat is slit. Cut to black. Devastating.The cliffhanger that kickstarted the end of season cliffhanger trend. Larry Hagman’s oil baron JR Ewing had made plenty of enemies in Dallas. By the end of season three, one of them took justice into their own hands, shooting JR in the back twice. However, rather than reveal the culprit, the team behind Dallas left the case unsolved. And over the next eight months – the time between seasons – the whole world was asking “Who shot JR?” Unsurprisingly, considering the hysteria around the mystery, 350 million people tuned in to watch the revelatory episode “Who Done It”.Showrunner Matt Groening had long wanted to do an episode where Mr Burns was shot, and the culprit was not revealed until the next episode. Taking inspiration from Dallas, the animation concluded Part One with the nuclear power plant owner being shot by an unknown assailant. Then, after a Summer of waiting, fans were finally treated to the answer. The two-part episode has gone down as a classic and is often heralded as the series’ best.737 Doctor Who – The Parting of the Ways (2005)Choosing one standout Doctor Who cliffhanger is almost impossible – especially when you consider that all 37 (and counting) seasons have frequently used the plot device. While the introduction of John Hurt’s Doctor certainly ranks among them, one of best came at the end of the rebooted first series. Having absorbed a bunch of vortexes, the Doctor is struggling and on the verge of regenerating. Turning to Rose (Billie Piper), Christopher Eccleston’s incarnation of the iconic character utters the timeless lines: “Before I go, I just want to tell you, you were fantastic. Absolutely fantastic. And you know what – so was I.” Queue shoddy CGI and the introduction of the soon-to-be nation’s favourite Doctor, David Tennant. “So, where was I? That’s it – Barcelona.”Gale (David Costabile) is one of the nicest characters on Breaking Bad. He is not interested in wealth or fame, but in science. However, niceties and a good cup of coffee are not enough to stop him getting in Walter White’s (Bryan Cranston) way. When the choice between their lives has to be made, Walter chooses his own and sends Jesse Pinkman (Aaron Paul) to do the dirty work. Season three ends with Jesse killing Gale – an incident that eventually brings down the drug kingpin Gus Fring.937 The West Wing – “What Kind of Day Has it Been” (2000)The West Wing’s biggest cliffhanger came in the season one finale. The episode works its way back from the beginning as we see a Secret Service Agent sense danger from a nearby window at a town hall meeting with the president in attendance. When the episode catches up, gunfire rings out and each member of his senior staff is thrown to the floor. Cut to black as we hear an agent ask over the radio: “Who’s been hit?”It wasn’t until the third season finale of Smallville that Superman fans’ patience was rewarded as viewers saw Clark (Tom Welling) appear naked in the middle of a Kryptonian symbol burned into the field of his family’s farm. “You shall be reborn,” Jor-El can be heard saying to Clark Kent, but he wasn’t the alone one the ending marked a radical turning point for the series.Twin Peaks’ season two finale – the mystery drama’s last episode for 27 years – may have featured the most chilling cliffhanger, but the biggest gasp of the series came at the end of season one as the seemingly untouchable Dale Cooper (Kyle MacLachlan) responds to a knock on his hotel room door, only to be gunned down by an unseen assailant.1237 Buffy the Vampire Slayer – The Gift (2001)The 100th episode of Buffy ended with one of the show’s most shocking moments (and no, we’re not talking about the musical episode). Season five concluded with the eponymous ass-kicker sacrificing herself to save the world by jumping into a demonic portal. The episode ends with a slow zoom onto Buffy’s tombstone, which reads: “Beloved sister. Devoted friend. She saved the world. A lot.“It\u0027s easy to forget that True Blood began life as an acclaimed Emmy-nominated drama, and it was a cliffhanger such as this that made it so: Sookie Stackhouse (Anna Paquin) falls asleep with the friendly neighbour dog Dean for company. Upon waking up, Dean is gone and in his place is local barman Sam Merlotte ( Sam Trammell). Turns out he\u0027s a shapeshifter.1437 The Walking Dead – Last Day on Earth (2016)After eight episodes of build-up, the comic book’s deadliest villain, Negan, reared his head in a scene fans were dreading. With the majority of the main cast lined up at his mercy, Negan – in retaliation for the death of one of his gang – decides which one to kill by using “Eeny Meeny Mino Moe”. After selecting his victim, the camera switches POV and Negan bludgeons the unseen character to death leaving fans with a six-month wait before finding out who had met their maker.Lost co-creator Damon Lindelof\u0027s HBO drama was set in a world that saw two per cent of the world’s population disappear into thin air during a tragic event known as the Sudden Departure. Season two presented an intriguing mystery: the disappearance of three teenage girls from a Texan town that nobody had vanished from. It was the season\u0027s penultimate episode that cleared up this plot line as Matt Garvey (Chris Zylka) breaks into a heavily-guarded trailer – only to be met with the three teenage girls staring back at him. What’s more is they’re dressed all in white, a callback to the disbanded cult from the first season.In episode 11, the writers had introduced a hatch buried underground and, week in week out, the fans waited patiently for any detail about the mysterious structure the writers were willing to give them.

This ending remains an unforgettable moment for those who watched it at the time of broadcast.1737 Lost – “Two for the Road” (2006)“I’m sorry.” “For what?” BANG. On paper, not so effective but on screen, it equated to one of Lost’s most gasp-inducing cliffhangers. Viewers watched behind their eyes as Michael (Harold Perrineau), desperate to save his son from the mysterious Others, shoots Ana-Lucia (Michelle Rodriguez) and, in a cruel twist, Libby (Cynthia Watros), who has accidentally stumbled upon the whole thing while looking for some blankets.1837 Lost - \u0027Through the Looking Glass – Part 2Whether you love or hate Lost, there’s no denying that the season three finale deployed one of the most breathtaking rug pulls in television history as writers Damon Lindelof and Carlton Cuse revealed a shake-up long in the running: flashbacks featuring a suicidal Jack Shephard (Matthew Fox) were, in fact, flashforwards to the future.

The ending set the benchmark for all future finale and was so huge it made newspaper headlines.1937 Line of Duty – Series four premiere (2018)The fourth series of Line of Duty didn’t hold back on the shocks. In fact, its first episode featured a cliffhanger ending to rival the best of them. With DCI Roz Huntley (Thandie Newton) dead on his floor, her murderer – Forensic Coordinator Tim Ifield (Jason Watkins) – sets about dispatching her body, but as his chainsaw nears her face, Roz’s eyes suddenly open.After season one, Heroes became pretty dreadful television.

The supermarkets described the CMA’s provisional findings into the merger, as “prohibition in all but name”.Sainsbury\u0027s boss Mike Coupe and Asda chief executive Roger Burnley added: “We have asked the CMA to correct significant errors in its provisional findings.Created with Sketch.

I couldn’t do very much.\u0026nbspIt was a really difficult time, and all the while his visa was getting refused.“Right now I’m just sitting at home, and I’m desperate to go back to work. Childcare costs almost £1,000 each per month,\u0026nbspso it’s not worth me working part-time. I’m having to rely on benefits, which is not what I want.“If he were here and we were a unit, everything would be consolidated. We would be able to support each other. But right now our life is on hold. If I’d have known things would be this complicated, I would have had an abortion.”If she were able to go back to work, Ms\u0026nbspMettle-Olympio\u0026nbspwould be able to sponsor a visa for\u0026nbspMr\u0026nbspKponouglo, which carries a minimum income requirement of £18,600 a year. But without childcare, it is impossible for her to meet this threshold.Families forced to spend Christmas apart due to UK immigration rules“I’m in a catch-22 situation,” she said. “And it’s been very difficult for my partner.

fresh referendum supporters delighted - while minister floats extraordinary plan to suspend parliament and start a new sessionClick to followIndy PoliticsTheresa May’s hopes of forcing MPs to back\u0026nbspher Brexit deal by staging repeat votes are in tatters, after speaker\u0026nbspJohn Bercow dramatically blocked the tactic, citing rules dating back to before the Gunpowder Plot.The prime minister was left stunned by the shock announcement – which torpedoed her hopes of a third “meaningful vote” while threatening MPs with a long delay to leaving the EU if they refused to give way.The dramatic twist, outlawing fresh votes without substantial changes, left ministers scrabbling for solutions – including an extraordinary proposal to suspend parliament and start a new session.It also achieved the remarkable feat of uniting supporters of a no-deal Brexit and a second referendum, who both believed it made their favoured option more likely.The solicitor general, who warned of “a constitutional crisis”, put forward the escape route of ending the current parliamentary session early to get around the 1604 convention invoked by the speaker, which lapses after a fresh Queen’s Speech.Here’s how Theresa May can get around Bercow’s dramatic Brexit ruling“There are ways around this – a prorogation of parliament and a new session,” said Robert Buckland.Created with

surrenders in reference to the likelihood of Brexit being delayed after the vote Experts pointed to a possible precedent from 1948, when Attlee’s Labour government prorogued parliament for a new 12-day session to pass legislation to reduce the power\u0026nbspof the House of Lords.No 10 is also mulling a possible vote to overturn the speaker’s ruling – but this seemed only likely to succeed if there are enough supporters of the deal in the first place.There was no immediate official response from Downing Street, other than to express its fury that Mr Bercow gave no warning of his bombshell announcement, made in the Commons chamber.The speaker said a further meaningful vote\u0026nbspwould be ruled out of order if the motion was “the same or substantially the same” – under a 1604 convention to stop the government bullying parliament on issues MPs have rejected.Ms May has already admitted that the negotiations with the EU are over, making it hard for her to argue that a further meaningful vote will be on a different question.Crucially, the speaker suggested something would have to be renegotiated with the EU to constitute a “change”, rather than, for example, a clarification of legal advice by the attorney general.Is Matteo Salvini going to veto a Brexit extension?French EU minister names cat ‘Brexit’ because of its indecisive natureMr Bercow told MPs: “What the government cannot legitimately do is resubmit to the house the same proposition – or substantially the same proposition – as that of last week, which was rejected by 149 votes.”The Independent revealed in January that pro-EU MPs believed that Ms May’s tactic to bludgeon her deal through, despite heavy defeats, was barred by parliamentary rules.Senior Tories were livid, believing the speaker had once again laid bare his anti-Brexit bias while twisting constitutional rules to suit his purpose.Rory Stewart, the prisons minister, taunted Mr Bercow by tweeting: “‘When I use a word,’\u0026nbspHumpty Dumpty said, in rather a scornful tone, ‘it means just what I choose it to mean.’”He added: “In the normal course of events, as the speaker says, parliament says no, and the issue is dropped.“But in this case, this is not an option, because these votes respond to an instruction in a referendum, endorsed by parliament, which rules out dropping back to the status quo.”Supporters of a Final Say referendum were delighted, with former Tory MP Anna Soubry telling\u0026nbspThe Independent: “It puts a second referendum very firmly at the top of the agenda –\u0026nbspit must do. We need a way out of this and this is the only way out.”Guto Bebb, a former Tory minister and People’s Vote supporter, said: “It is inconceivable now for ministers to carry on trying to force this broken Brexit deal on the people of the United Kingdom.”And David Lammy, a Labour supporter of the anti-Brexit Best for Britain group, said: “If the prime minister wants us to vote on her deal again, she should add an amendment allowing for her deal to be put to the people.”In the short term, the speaker’s intervention killed off any prospect of a third meaningful vote this week – already in doubt as the Democratic Unionist Party failed to switch sides.It appears certain that Ms May will have to ask EU leaders for a long\u0026nbspextension – anything between nine\u0026nbspand 21 months – to the Article 50 process at a summit in Brussels on Thursday.The new departure date will then be put to a “take-it-or-leave-it vote” in the Commons and Lords next week, just days before the 29 March Brexit day.For that reason, it increases the chances of a crash-out Brexit, which the Treasury has predicted could\u0026nbsptrigger a near 10 per cent GDP decline.However, a long extension could also open up the space for a further referendum, which some believe the prime minister might yet embrace if it is the only hope of passing her agreement.Speaking to a silent Commons, Mr Bercow said repeat votes had been blocked on 12 occasions up until 1920 – a situation only not repeated since because of “general compliance”.“This convention is very strong and longstanding, dating back to 2 April 1604,” the speaker said.“It’s a necessary rule to ensure the sensible use of house time and the proper respect for the decision which it takes.”We’ll tell you what’s true.

A containment was temporarily put in place and a description circulated. No arrests have been made. There are no reported injuries. The containment has been lifted. Enquiries continue.Responding to the latest Brexit developments, Ireland\u0027s deputy leader Simon Coveney has said the UK holds the prime responsibility for protecting the Good Friday Agreement.\u0026nbspThe commission has always said that their responsibility will be to obviously respect the Irish situation, but also to protect the integrity of the EU single market and customs union, he said.\u0026nbspWe also have a competing challenge here which is as a co-guarantor of the Good Friday Agreement that needs to be protected.\u0026nbspThe British government also has that responsibility. In fact, arguably I would say the British government has the prime responsibility here, because of course it is British government policy that has led to this challenge in the first place.\u0026nbspMr Coveney added: There is an understanding across the European Union that the border question is a very emotive and political question on this island, that\u0027s why we\u0027ve had so much support and solidarity across the European Union for solutions to that question, that\u0027s why we have the backstop within the Withdrawal Agreement.\u0026nbspIt\u0027s why, even in a no-deal scenario, the European Commission will work with Ireland to ensure that of course we need to protect the single market.The prime minister has also offered a sort-of-apology for her speech on Wednesday night when she blamed MPs for the UK\u0027s failure to leave the EU on 29 March.\u0026nbspShe wrote: I expressed my frustration with our failure to take a decision, but I know that many of you are frustrated too.\u0026nbspYou have a difficult job to do and it was not my intention to make it any more difficult. People on all sides of the debate hold passionate views and I respect those differences.Theresa May has written to MPs outlining the options ahead for Brexit.\u0026nbspThe Council\u0027s decisions mean we have a clear choice, the prime minister wrote.\u0026nbsp1. We can revoke Article 50 - but that would be to betray the result of the referendum.\u0026nbsp2. We can leave with no deal on 12 April - but the House has previously said this is not something it will support.\u0026nbsp3. If it appears that there is not sufficient support to bring the deal back next week, or the House rejects it again, we can ask for another extension before 12 April - but that will involve holding European Parliament elections.\u0026nbsp4. If it appears that there is sufficient support and the Speaker permits it, we can bring the deal back next week and if it is approved we can leave on 22 May.Former Tory minister Sir Oliver Letwin, who is part\u0026nbspof the group of senior MPs pushing for indicative votes to be held next Wednesday, says:\u0026nbspWe believe that we have the numbers to pass the amendment on Monday and thereby guarantee indicative votes on Wednesday.Analysis: Britain is ruining its political reputation with Brexit, writes Europe Correspondent\u0026nbspJon Stone...\u0026nbspHere\u0027s more from Tom Watson, Labour\u0027s deputy leader, who has this evening said a fresh Brexit referendum is the only way to resolve the current crisis.\u0026nbspSpeaking ahead of tomorrow\u0027s Put it to the People march, he said:\u0026nbspBrexit is currently stuck in the pipework of Parliament, with MPs split, completely unable to agree or find a way forward.The current impasse is not working for people who voted to leave or people who voted to stay. I really don\u0027t think Parliament will be able to resolve this.That\u0027s why I\u0027ve come to the reluctant view that the only way to resolve this and have legitimacy in the eyes of the public is for the people themselves to sign it off.It can only bring closure if we\u0027re all involved in making the decision.It can only begin to bring the country back together again if we all have a final say - and then live with the result.So, I have an explicit message for Theresa May: I will vote for your deal or a revised deal you can agree with my party. I will help you get it over the line to prevent a disastrous no deal exit. But I can only vote for your deal - or any deal - if you let the people have a vote on it too.A leaked Cabinet Office document says the government\u0027s system for dealing with a no-deal Brexit could fall apart within weeks.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspThe document, obtained by ,\u0026nbspsays government departments will have to take major decisions themselves rather than escalated them to the top levels.\u0026nbspIt warns:\u0026nbsp“The … structure will quickly fall if too many decisions are unnecessarily escalated to the top levels that could have reasonably been dealt with internally\u0026nbspwith pre-arrange internal processes.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspIt also admits that\u0026nbspthere are “likely to be unforeseen issues and impacts” of a no-deal Brexit that officials have not yet predicted.\u0026nbspThe document said there would be a critical phase lasting at least 12 weeks after a no-deal Brexit, with some impacts likely to be felt for up to 24 weeks.

When asked about her desire to be leader, she replied it’s never wise to rule anything out in politics but I’m absolutely not thinking about itThe prime minister\u0026nbspis facing a third Commons defeat on her\u0026nbspdeal next week, and a rift has reportedly opened up between No10 and Chief Whip Julian Smith’s office over her handling of Brexit.With the government in turmoil, the odds of general election taking place this year have been slashed, with Ladbrokes putting the chances at 54. The month of May – at 52 – is deemed the most likely time it could take place.Jessica Bridge of Ladbrokes said: “If the odds are to be believed, May’s speech doesn’t seem to have done the trick.”The odds of Ms May being replaced at No.10 this year have been cut by Ladbrokes to 16. “As far as the odds are concerned things are going from bad to worse for the prime minister,” Ms Bridge added.Betfair has the Labour leader as 41 favourite to be the next prime minister, compared with 61 odds for Mr Johnson, while William Hill has Mr Gove\u0026nbspas 41 favourite\u0026nbspahead of Mr Corbyn and Mr Johnson on 51.\u0026nbspKeir Starmer leave the European Commission headquarters in Brussels after a meeting (Reuters)Although Ms May won a\u0026nbspConservative party\u0026nbspno-confidence vote in December, preventing\u0026nbspher opponents from bringing the formal process again until the end of 2019, Tory MPs\u0026nbspcould put pressure on her to resign.Another route to Ms May’s exit comes from the opposition. The Labour leader has threatened to call a fresh confidence vote in the government if Ms May’s deal fails to pass the Commons a third time – although such a move is unlikely to win backing from Tory MPs.“At that point the confidence motion would be appropriate,” Mr Corbyn told Sky News’ Sophy Ridge on Sunday ahead of another meaningful vote. “I think at that point we should say there has to be a general election.”Editor of The Spectator Fraser Nelson has suggested an offer by Ms May to stand down soon might\u0026nbspbe enough to get her deal through,\u0026nbspdescribing\u0026nbspresignation as “her most powerful card”.Goldman Sachs analysts have increased their estimated likelihood of the UK crashing out of the EU without a deal to 15 per cent from 5 per cent.We’ll tell you what’s true.

It happens when it rains hard.But this spring, the poppies have been so abundant and so strikingly coloured – orange peel, marigold and burned copper – that the number of people coming to walk among them has simply been too many.\u0026nbspAs a result, the city was forced to say “no” to visitors, after what some officials termed a “super bloom apocalypse”.“The city has expended all available resources to address the #SuperBloom,” they wrote on the the city’s Instagram page. “We have brought in all available staff, as many outside traffic controllers that we could, more shuttles, and our small city can not sustain crowds of this magnitude – our city is not made for Disneyland-size crowds.”It urged residents: “Please, we need your help and understanding. This is beyond our control.

Residents have complained about traffic jams, as visitors have arrived as early as 5.30am to visit the wildflowers, whose burst of growth was triggered by recent record-breaking rainfall. One person was reportedly hurt in a traffic accident.For the last few weeks, crowds have swarmed onto the fields, many ignoring\u0026nbsp instructions that they stay on the designated path. Some have even picked the flowers to take home.\u0026nbspMayor Steve Manos told The Independent he had never known a\u0026nbspbloom as spectacular as the one this year. “It only happens when it rains hard,” he said. “The last one was 2017, and before that it was 2010.”“People were pulled over on the side of the road to see the flowers as we drove here,” she said. “It was amazing to see the number of flowers grow as we got closer.”Mr Manos, mayor of the city located 70 miles to the south east of Los Angeles, posted videos of himself helping direct traffic on Facebook, to try and give an insight into how bad the situation was.\u0026nbspOn Monday morning, amid some criticism over the shutdown, the city said access to Walker Canyon had been reopened, though parking was extremely limited.\u0026nbspMr Manos appeared in another brief video, standing in front of people walking through the footpaths amid the flowers.REDIRECT Nature Studies by Michael McCarthy: A Western Isles idyllWild flowers are overpowered by exhaust fumesBritain’s most common wild flowers are latest species to disappearThe last stand of the wild flower“As you can see, there are a number of people behind me here to experience the bloom.\u0026nbspBut we are full.

Run for your lives.“But it really isn’t like that.”Oh, OK, you could maybe take your chances listening to her Fanny impression then. Talking of which, This Morning’s Martin Lewis. There’s a strong argument to say he should have been made to do If I Were A Rich Man, from Fiddler On The Roof. And an equally strong one to say he really shouldn’t. But he ended up doing Any Dream Will Do, from Joseph, and oh-my-s**tting dachshund he was bad. Talking point of the night, evenCorrie’s Daniel Brocklebank won, was Alan Titch-marsh singing Some Enchanted Evening, from South Pacic, on a stretch of thoughtfully placed decking.A man overcome with emotion. The main one being anger by the look on his face.Like next door’s kids had just punted their football straight into his prize begonias, it was.The audience went nuts for it, though, the judges were in floods of overwhelmed tears and, must admit, even I was aware I was watching something that would be played again and again, for both good and bad reasons.But I must urge caution here. Antony Cotton got his own ITV chat show after winning Soapstar Superstar.It just needed Simon Cowell tuning in on Sunday, and, before you know it, he’s got Titchmarsh back in the white blazer trying to Dream The Impossible Dream for the Christmas No.Still, we have to look for the positives, and what I’ll ultimately take from All Star Musicals is the fact John Barrowman appeared on telly, for two entire hours, and didn’t shout: “FAB-U-LOUS!” once.Progress. FRIDAY.

Then MPs backed a Brexit delay.It’s asthe House of Commons is ­following Tony Blair’s step-by-step guide to overturning the  referendum.A No Deal Brexit will only happen in nine days’ timethe EU refuses an ­extension. That is unlikely.Theresa May will beg for a delay, whatever the conditions.EU members will not want to be blamed for a messy No Deal outcome.From next week, MPs could start voting on their preferred Brexit options through so-called indicative votes. Spoiler alert — they will not end up backing a harder exit.I know there are Leave voters who do not like Theresa May’s Brexit deal.Butyou do not like her deal, look at the alternative options for softer Brexits, which would be far worse for the country.If you think this deal risks the UK ­getting stuck in a customs union, just wait till you see what the deal would look like with Labour’s “permanent” customs union glued on top.Better to have an imperfect route to controlling our own trade policy than no route at all.If you do not like the fact that, under the PM’s deal, we would have to keep existing EU goods and agricultural rules, imagine staying in the Single Market or, as it is rebranded, Common Market .. We would lose the veto over goods rules which we have in the backstop, and be forced to follow rules on services too.Even in a worst-case scenario, Theresa May’s deal lets us escape the EU’s “ever closer union” political project and seize control of our own immigration policy.We would be in control of almost all our economy and not have to pay a penny for it on an ongoing basis.It is far better than most critics will admit. Thanks to changes secured at Strasbourg last week, we have new protections.The EU can no longer do what French President Macron arrogantly threatened. It will not be able to use the backstop as a “trap” to demand access to UK fishing waters.The EU cannot just say “non” to every sensible idea for resolving the Irish border issues. The so-called Star Chamber of MPs were quick to reject the Strasbourg changes.But they should listen to the Irish opposition party.Their Brexit spokesperson said: “We have come a long way” from a “bullet-proof, rock-solid, cast-iron backstop”.Or how about top barrister Lord ­Pannick  He is the QC who won the case for Gina Miller against the Government.He argues that in some circumstances the UK could terminate the deal through the so-called Vienna Convention.Conservative Eurosceptic big beasts, from ex-leader Michael Howard to former Chancellor Norman Lamont, have all weighed in behind the deal.David Davis, who resigned over ­Chequers, is now onside.Lord Trimble, who won the Nobel Peace Prize for the Good Friday Agreement, has backed it. If he can live with the backstop, that should count for something.But some Eurosceptic back- benchers still refuse to support the PM’s deal.Led by Jacob Rees-Mogg, they would prefer a harder deal. But face facts. There is no harder Brexit on offer.With No Deal out of reach, there is no incentive for the EU to provide any more concessions.That means the choices are this deal or a softer Brexit. Or no Brexit at all.And be sure that the Speaker, John Bercow, will bend every possible rule to frustrate Brexit.So, do not expect a long delay to offer a better answer.Anyway, the choice on our future could be made soon.There is no time to lose to save Brexit. Even a snap General Election offers no easy salvation. It would mean Theresa May leading the Tories into another campaign on a manesto of her deal — precisely what her critics want to avoid. And of course, the Conservatives could lose any path to power at all, kissing goodbye to any Brexit.Brexit would never have happenedit had not been for Boris Johnson.Now he has a crucial opportunity to save the whole project.He can show how he can be a ­statesman, by compromising in the national interest.And he can demonstrate the sort of leadership that won him so much praise as Mayor of London.If the Government can persuade the DUP to vote for the deal, backbenchers including Dominic Raab, Iain Duncan Smith, Theresa Villiers and Mark Harper should follow suit.Otherwise, they risk being remembered as the MPs who wrecked Brexit, along with Labour MPs who helped trigger ­Article  and then opposed both No Deal and the current deal.Theresa May also needs to recognise that backbenchers want someone  to take forward the next stage of the negotiations.If she tries to cling to power, critics on both sides of the Brexit ide may never back her deal.Whereasshe pledges to step down on getting her deal through, she can step down as a hero who delivered Brexit against the odds.MPs should know that politics is about taking the world as you find it, not as you would like it to be.And leadership is about taking decisions, even when all the choices are unpalatable.It is fine to stick to principle, but notthat means emulating King Canute’s stand against the waves.If Brexit does not happen it will be a ­national democratic calamity.As the party in power, the Conservatives will be punished.That means risking ­letting Jeremy Corbyn — a leader who can not even deal with anti-Semitism in his own party — seize control of the country.The stakes simply could not be higher. If this chance is squandered we will likely never get another moment.Right across Europe, critics of Brussels will think “even Britain couldn’t break free”.Henry Newman is director of the Open Europe think tank.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Maybe to keep up levels of national happiness we should leave horrible, authoritarian bureaucracies every year. Just to put a grin on our faces. I mean, the French don’t seem very happy, do they But here’s the bad news. Theresa May is still Prime Minister and we’re currently heading for a Brexit which would be a travesty of the one we voted for in . If we get Brexit at all.Some of the Brexiteers in Parliament think we might still be able to escape the EU with a No Deal, on World Trade Organisation terms. I think they are deluding themselves.Parliament, which is two to one in favour of NOT leaving the EU, simply will not let it happen.And the EU, desperate to retain its market for goods in the UK, will make sure it doesn’t happen, too.Our Brexiteers are right that Theresa May’s deal is awful. Butthey get a chance to vote on it again, they should hold their noses and vote in favour.Because I reckon it’s that or nothing. We will have a delay, the EU may insist we hold a second referendum as a condition of that delay.And trust me, the second referendum will be rigged in favour of remaining in the EU. It will not be a straightforward in or out option. There will be three options, to split the Leave vote down the middle.In this fight to leave the EU, the British people have had everything against them. The EU, obvs. But also the House of Commons and the puffed-up, ludicrous, pro-Remain speaker John Bercow. And the House of Lords, the civil service and the BBC.The lesson for us low-born, powerless Leavers is to take what we can and scarper before the whole idea is killed stone dead. Which I fear it may be.And now Mrs May is heading back to Brussels to plead for a delay in triggering Article .All along she has been too obsessed with the process of leaving the EU, rather than the clear imperative as demanded by the British people — to simply LEAVE the EU, all of it.She has followed Brussels’ agenda at every twist and turn. And she’ll be following it now. She’ll do what the EU wants.So here’s the deal, as I see it. Give her hopeless proposal one more chance and this time vote for it.We will have been cheated, but not as badly aswe do not leave at all.Because the longer this goes on, the more likely that outcome will be.THIS country becomes more deranged by the very hour.A Roman Catholic journalist claims she may face JAIL because she referred to a transgendered person by the sex assigned at birth, rather than the one she now identies as.Caroline Farrow has been told she must attend a police station for a taped interview.She said: “I have pointed out to police that I am a Catholic journalist commentator and it is my religious belief that a person cannot change sex.”Quite.

Such as “zir” and “hir” and the horrible “peoplekind”.I hope they have room next year for these following words I’ve just made up: Togerov – a Bulgarian man who has transitioned to female.Abbottophobia – the irrational fear that Diane is about to appear on the TV talking complete b******s.Droll – an internet troll who is nonetheless quite funny.WYLFWTS– someone on a gender studies or media studies course.

I quickly came to learn that, in relation to Brexit, nothing could be further from the truth.Unfortunately, I must remain anonymous for fear of the backlash I would receive at my place of work.However, I can reveal I am a senior policy professional within the service and work closely with a number of government departments.There are a number of extremely dangerous myths regarding civil servants that I must dispel because of the impact they are having on the Brexit process.MYTH : The civil service is independent. The civil service was founded on the pillars of political neutrality.Civil servants are meant to ensure that their own political persuasions do not affect their work. Crucially, they should accept those from all political leanings and points of view.It has become clear to me that the vast majority of civil servants support Remain.From my observations I would estimate this number to be well over  per cent.This is worrying in itself and far from representative of the  per cent of the people who voted for Brexit.Most horrying, however, is the sheer disdain and utter contempt that my colleagues display towards people who voted to Leave.I have lost count of the number of insulting and derogatory terms that are used in my own department and where to refer to the .million people who voted for Brexit: “Racist”, “stupid”, “uneducated”.Anti-Brexit jokes and snide remarks are dropped casually into everyday office con-versations. I live in fear that my colleagues will discover through a slip of my tongue that I am a Brexiteer.Were this to happen, I believe that most would refuse to talk to me again and I might even lose my job.This entire culture creates a thickening cloud of negativity towards Brexit that shades all areas of the civil service. I have witnessed first-hand civil servants doing everything within their power, subtly and under the surface, to frustrate Brexit and talk it down at every opportunity.This can only seriously undermine our efforts to be in the strongest position possible on leaving the EU.MYTH : Civil servants are experts in their field.One would like to think the iniduals making decisions that affect our entire nation would have some level of skill or experience.If only that were true.For example, I know of one stand-alone “expert” policy team leading our preparations for Brexit.You can imagine my disbelief when I discovered none of its members had worked on anything remotely related to the EU before. In fact, I have discovered over time that the vast majority of “experts” within the service have no expertise whatsoever.In many cases the “portfolio” you take on when you join the service is dictated by the one held by your predecessor.As a result, you have new civil servants inheriting politically sensitive and highly important work without the faintest clue about what they are dealing with.Civil servants who are seriously underperforming will usually have a new job title and position created for them somewhere  in the organisation instead of being sacked or performance-managed — they become someone ’s problem then.Given the influence that civil servants are exerting over the Brexit process, this is truly concerning.MYTH : The civil service does not engage in scaremongering.I had hoped that civil servants, even in times of crisis, would be able to remain calm and level-headed in pursuit of ensuring the best outcomes for our country.And yet it is not uncommon for me to receive emails from colleagues promoting Brexit scare stories that are nothing more than lies and speculation. Recently, things have become so panicked that ious “Brexit contingency” plans have been set up throughout the organisation. This is to prepare for the “national public transport breakdown”, “surge in criminality” and “widespread public unrest” that is going to follow after we leave.These plans also involve collecting the personal details of certain civil servants to put in place a -hour, on-call rota for the “emergency” that is looming. This scare-mongering, created and whipped up by civil servants, is having a marked impact on the confidence and well-being of ordinary citizens.For example, one acquain-tance of mine is so terried by the speculative threats put out by the service they have started to stockpile large quantities of their medication. This needs to stop.MYTH : Ministers are in charge.When I was outside the civil service looking in, I always believed civil servants were there simply to advise their ministers, who, as elected representatives of the people, would make the ultimate decision. However, I have come to realise that ministers are often mere puppets, with civil servants pulling ferociously at their strings.The level of bureaucracy is unimaginable.In my experience parlia-mentary briefings go through — at a minimum — five stages of internal clearance, with crucial information being amended or deleted at every stage on the whim of that inidual civil servant.The power and competence of our ministers is, I’m afraid, a facade.They are nothing more than a megaphone for the views of biased civil servants who lurk behind them in the shadows.I am a supporter of the Leave campaign.To go against the will of the people expressed in the  referendum would be the ultimate act of betrayal.The Government MUST allow us to take back control by leaving the EU on World Trade Organisation terms. If the people are betrayed, I may have no choice but to resign.Honesty, impartiality, integrity and objectivity. We will soon discover, once and for all, whether our politicians embody these values.©The Sunday Times News Licensing Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But doorstepped on a trip to Essex, Home Secretary Sajid Javid refused to back Mrs May’s blast.Former Labour Minister Caroline Flint yesterday insisted she would still support the PM in a ‘Meaningful Vote ’ and called her deal the best “compromise” available.But leading Labour MP Lisa Nandy warned the PM she had thrown away any chance of winning over any more Labour backbenchers to her cause.Downing Street needs at least  Labour MPs to back the PM’s deal next week to stand any chance of passing it through the Commons.Ms Nandy said: “There is absolutely no chance she is going to win over MPs in sufficient numbers after that statement.”And Labour backbencher Wes Streeting said Mrs May could have blood on her hands. He stormed: “Theresa May knows that MPs across the House are subjected to death threats – some very credible.“Her speech was incendiary and irresponsible.“If any harm comes to us, she will have to accept her share of responsibility.” Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Possibly [someone] had his eye on her, drugged her earlier in the day to make sure she wouldnt kick up a fuss when she was snatched later in the evening.And Maddie OLeary said: My opinion having watched episode   is that the McCann children were all sedated by someonethen someone abducted Maddie somehow and sold her through the dark web.Viewers have been gripped by The Disappearance of Madeleine McCann since it was released on Netflix last week.Brit tourist Neil Berry, who was staying at the Ocean Club at the same time, told the documentary makers his daughter Jessica became pals with Maddie at the resorts play group.He said: They were of a similar age and they became thick as thieves.I remember they had been out sailing, which I though was quite brave of the kids club, that they took them out on the sea. They were together in the boat.Jessies only real recollection of the holiday was Jess lost her straw summer hat in the sea and Madeleine launching herself into the sea to recover it for her - much to the alarm of the kids club staff who swtly grabbed her and dragged her back into the boat.The eight-part series features  experts and key figures in the case, details how bungling cops wrongly tried to pin the blame on Kate and Gerry, and runs through the ious theories on what happened to three-year-old Madeleine in May .It sensationally claims Maddie may still be alive - and explains how Portugal is a prime target for traffickers because its location allows abducted children to be instantly taken overseas.Jim Gamble, the top child protection cop in the UK’s first Maddie investigation, says:  I absolutely believe that in my letime we will find out what has happened to Madeleine McCann.There’s huge hope to be had with the advances in technology. Year on year DNA is getting better. Year on year other techniques, including facial recognition, are getting better.And as we use that technology to revisit and review that which we captured in the past, there’s every likelihood that something we already know will slip into position.Yesterday we told how a British gran who saw a scruffy weirdo lurking near the apartment is convinced he was a sex gangs lookout man."},{"url":null,"title":"tory mp admits fiddling his office expenses and could face a year behind bars","story":"Christopher Davies admitted to two charges involving falsying invoices related to his Parliamentary expenses claims for furniture and pictures for his office.District Judge John Zani said that although there was no financial gain for his actions he admitted two very serious offences which were absolutely intended to deceive.He now faces being booted out of Parliament as a recall petition is automatically triggered in relation to expenses.His own voters in Brecon and Radnorshire will have their say on whether they want to trigger a by-election in the area and vote in a new MP.But the Tories today refused to say whether or not hed be kicked out of the party after his criminal conviction.The first charge he admitted to was providing  or misleading information for allowances claims.He said that in March  he made a claim under the MPs allowances scheme and provided an invoice that he knew to be  or misleading.The second charge was attempting to provide  or misleading information for an allowance claim using an invoice that he knew to be  or misleading in April .The former Parliamentary Private Secretary appeared at Westminster Magistrates Court earlier today and could face a year behind bars.The judge said he did not consider the sentencing power of Westminster Magistrates Court to be sufficient and sent the case to crown court.Thomas Forster QC, defending, told the court Davies accepts his responsibility and expresses his sincere and unreserved apology for what he has done.Mr Forster said of the -year-old: A disastrous accounting episode, as far as he is concerned.Speaker Bercow was informed of his guilty plea before he made it.The police were handed a dossier of evidence last year relating to the MP.Mr Davies was questioned twice about his expenses over a claim back in .The MP claimed he made an honest mistake with the claims.Mr Davies was accused of manually creating two invoices for £ and £ rather than submitting the full £ claim for the pictures.He had previously said that he repaid the £ sum, which was charged to a start-up fund for new MPs to set up offices.Today Labours party chair Ian Lavery said: Trust in politics and politicians is essential to our democracy.

I took a picture, sent the picture back to Kate, and I said ‘sorry, it’s not Madeleine’”.Patrick said: “They were shattered. You can’t even imagine how they must have felt.”Maddies parents Kate and Gerry refused to take part in the Netflix documentary amidst fears it could hamper the search for their daughter.The Spanish tourist who took the photo told the Daily Mail in : I am totally convinced I saw Madeleine with a Muslim woman crossing the street in Zaio towards the end of May.I saw her face clearly from just a few yards and immediately thought Thats Madeleine!The woman was acting strangely, hiding her face from the traffic, which struck me as odd.I screamed at my husband for him to stop the car so we could get to the woman and challenge her.But by the time we stopped the car and jumped out, the woman and the girl had disappeared.I was in tears, distraught and felt totally powerless.Brian and Patrick also spoke about the £, trip on the tenth anniversary of Maddie’s disappearance.Brian, worth £million, offered to help the McCanns in the weeks after their girl, then three, vanished.The tycoon kept his plane scrambled ready to help.He said: To see Kate and Gerry suffering so much really touched me.He and Patrick dropped everything after hearing the tourist had photographed the blonde girl being carried on the back of a woman in Morocco in September .After arriving in Tangier, they hired a guide and found the girl in the mountain village of Zinat.Patrick said: We realised very quickly it was not Madeleine.

It can cause tiredness and sometimes breathlessness.In some cases bowel cancer can block the bowel, this is known as a bowel obstruction.Irrespective of whether these sweeteners are having a direct effect on tumour development and growth, people wishing to reduce their likelihood of developing cancer should limit their intake.It comes after experts warned that drinking Coke or even Diet Coke could increase your risk of dying young.Research found that two cans of regular Coke increases the risk of early death from heart disease by a third.The move could save more than , lives a year, experts say.Bowel cancer is the second deadliest form of the disease, but it can be curedits caught early - or better still prevented.Caught at stage  - the earliest stage - patients have a  per cent chance of living for five years or longer.But catch it at stage  - when its already spread - and that chance plummets to just seven per cent.In April, Lauren Backler, whose mum died of the disease at the age of , joined forces with The Sun to launch the No Time  Lose campaign, also supported by Bowel Cancer UK and Beating Bowel Cancer. Donate here.Lauren delivered a petition to the Department of Health complete with almost , signatures, to put pressure on the Government to make this vital change - one that could save thousands of lives every year, and the NHS millions.We all deserve an equal chance to beat this disease, regardless of where we live.We know bowel cancer is more likely after the age of  - so it makes sense to screen from then.Plus, its got to save the NHS money in the long-run, catching the disease before patients need serious and expensive treatments.Its a no brainer, thousands of lives are at stake every year.You can still sign Laurens petition to show your support - click HERE to add your signature."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/NINTCHDBPICT000341911933.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"birmingham pub bombings ira 1974","story":"The man described only as Witness O told an inquest hed been given permission to do so by the head of the IRA.He said that the officer commanding the Birmingham IRA at the time was Seamus McLoughlan, and that he was responsible for selecting the targets.Speaking over a secure video-link, the ex-IRA volunteer added that Mick Murray was one of the bombers, and claimed he recalled Murray telling him there would be no harmsimilar bombings had been repeated, because of the chaos caused.Pressed by Lesley Thomas, the barrister representing nine of the bereaved families, that another member of the bombings team was Michael Hayes, he replied: Hayes, Hayes - Ill give itto you now.He added, in apparent reference to the Good Friday Agreement: But he cant be arrested.There is nobody going to be charged with this atrocity.

during that flight Ms Mackay was drinking from her own alcohol she had in her hand luggage.She was originally seated in G but moved to H, an extra leg room seat which attracted an additional cost of £.She was asked by a member of cabin crewshe wanted to continue accessing that seat she would have to pay or  she would have toto her original seat.However it is alleged that throughout the flight Mackay was verbally abusive to staff, swearing at them several times - she was disruptive and on several occasions placed her foot out into the aisle as staff walked past, thus assaulting them.Ms Mackay was reported and she was met by police when the flight landed in Heathrow.At an earlier hearing in January Mackay described her actions, saying: I was practising judo sweeps, so it wasnt to target those three people.The prosecution at that hearing added: She did a judo sweep on an aeroplane which constitutes an assault because people were tripped up.Lucey Downey, the cabin service supervisor and one of the alleged victims, described being sworn at after asking Mackay to move back to her seat.She said: I approached her in a calm manner - I came down to her eye level, spoke softly to her and explained the situation about the seating.I gave her the option of staying in the seat and paying the extra money or moving back to her seat - she was agitated and aggressive in her tone, she didnt like the idea of moving because it was an empty row of three and more comfortable.She said she didnt f*****g see why she would have to move seats - I asked her not to swear at me.She said to me thatI was going to be p*****g her around she was going to make the night very dficult for us.Ms Downey then told her manager about Mackays refusal to move, who told her she would speak to the defendant after take-off.Ms Downey said it wasnt until later in the flight as she was walking down the aisle that she was assaulted by Mackay.She said: I felt a sharp kick to my shin which made me trip and grabbed onto the seats either side of the aisle to stop myself from falling.I took a deep breath and put myself upright - I didnt engage with Ms Mackay - I was very shocked, something like that had never happened to me before - I felt very shaken up actually.Manager Alex Scott, who went down to speak to the defendant after the flight took off, said Mackay called her a bitch three times.Addressing the court, cabin crew member Leanne Palmer described being kicked in the ankle by Mackay and nearly hitting the ground.She said: As I was walking I felt a kick to my ankle and I tripped, a big trip, and just saved myself by grabbing onto the lower part of the chair - I was really shocked.Another crew member, Philip Sumner, told the court that Mackay tried to trip him up twice.He said: The lady put her right leg out as she saw me walking down - she held eye contact with me as she did it.I saw it and was able to climb over the leg and continued on to do the toilet checks.The passenger was looking at me as I was doing this - her eyes were on me all the time - and as I came back she puts her leg out when I was very close to her.I climbed over it again and said youre going to seriously hurt someone - she just shrugged her shoulders at me.Police in Heathrow were called just after am after being alerted about a disruptive passenger - PC Carl Brackley arrived at the airport with two other officers and took Mackay off the plane.In a statement read out in court he said: I could smell intoxicating liquor on her breath and her eyes were glazed, she was slurring her words.I could see what appeared to be a tear in her eye, it appeared she had been crying.He explained to her there were reports of her being antagonistic to crew members on the flight about a seat.Mackay said she wanted to lie down and sleep on the three empty seats in the row.She said: Im short, extra leg room means nothing to me, I was interested in the two empty seats beside me - it was a  hour non smoking flight, I was interested in getting through the flight.PC Brackley asked her whether she had been drinking to which she said yes.He said: She pulled out a bottle from her bag, I asked her what it was and she said it was rum - a quarter of it was gone and she said at the start of the flight it was full.She said she had also had two bottles of wine, the single glass bottles given on flights.He added: I believe she was drunk.Mackay was arrested on suspicion of criminal damage and being drunk on an aircraft, both of which were later dropped -

they should be there to make the flight as smooth and quiet and beautul as they can.There are people who do smoke and cant smoke on an aircraft and they shouldnt aggravate those passengers.Defending herself today, Mackay said after she sat in the extra leg room seat, a man had sat in hers and she was unable to go back.She said: I explained that to them but they refused to listen - they didnt want to listen - they just wanted money for the seat.But this was refuted by the witnesses, who said they told her they would move the man - which they did.The verdict will be given later."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/NINTCHDBPICT0004752367593.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"meghan markle prince harry delay house move","story":"The couple hoped to move in to Frogmore Cottage this week but workmen are well behind.They have now targeted next month — just a week or so before baby Sussex is born.A royal source said: “It’s been all hands to the pump.

If Labour’s alternative plan for a close economic relationship can’t get a parliamentary majority, then Common Market . is a Brexit compromise which might just get us out of this dficult period and out the other side with unity, pride and purpose.

It would avoid a isive second referendum.    While not perfect, it is a Brexit that can deliver on the result of the referendum whilst protecting jobs, enhancing our control over EU migration and restoring sovereignty to the UK.

In news that will no doubt shock you to your core, British citizens are - no! - allowed to live in foreign countries and sign petitions. Of course, France, Spain, Germany and the US are among nations with higher numbers of British ex-pats. And there are Brits living in Russia, too, and hostile countries around the world. Even with all other nations of the world included, the vast majority of signatures were still registered in the UK.    Overall the Commons authorities say as of Friday afternoon, .% of the signatures came from the UK. The other .% were not based in the UK. Now there is a wider question here, obviously. Evenonly a small number of signatures are registered abroad, couldnapost people just lie  How do the Commons authorities make sure spambots arenapost simply listing multiple addresses in the UK  There are, after all, YouTube videos showing you how to do that. The short answer is, of course, no system is perfect. This is not a general election, nor is it run to the same exacting standard - and some people are bound to get around it. But this isnapost quite the point Nigel Farage was making. And of course, there are still rules to try and ensure that only British citizensor people living in the UK sign petitions.  As a basic start, petitioners are asked to enter their name, e-mail address and postcode, but Parliamentaposs authorities insist thereaposs more to it than that. A House of Commons spokesman said: The Government Digital Service use a number of techniques, automated and manual, to identy and block signatures from bots, disposable email addresses or other sources that show signs of fraudulent activity. They also monitor signing patterns to check for fraudulent activity. Much like the traditional paper petitioning system, which asks people to provide an address and signature, the e-petitions system aims to strike a balance between allowing people to easily register their support for issues which are important to them, whilst discouraging dishonesty.

Under the headline “Baby left on canal bank”, it told of a premature boy, barely two hours old, found abandoned on a freezing November night, wrapped only in two sheets of newspaper. The dark truth of his birth left him devastated. Richard, , says: “I was so horried I felt numb. I tried to read on, but couldn’t take it in because my eyes filled and blurred my vision. “It was a terrible story to read about any baby, and realising that baby was me felt overwhelming. “Knowing I came into the world like that, unwanted from the moment I arrived and left to die in minus two degree temperatures, made me sob for three hours afterwards.” It was a miracle Richard survived the rat-infested canal bank in Birmingham’s Gas Street Basin. But his headline-grabbing birth was the start of a childhood so tumultuous he recalls his years in a children’s home as his happiest. Being adopted at the age of four should have been the moment Richard felt the love of a family and a chance to find security and happiness. Instead, he endured merciless beatings from his sadistic adoptive father.  Since that traumatic day in the adoption office, Richard has traced blood relatives and information about the man who saved him from the canal. Gradually, with painstaking research, he has pieced together the story of his le and family and felt able to move on. Richard says: “I’ve spent decades wondering about my birth parents. Maybe to ease the painful knowledge that they had given me up, I wrapped thoughts of them in romantic stories. “Maybe my blood mum and dad were lovers too young, or too poor, to bring me up as well as they’d hoped  “Maybe they wept as they handed me over to a children’s home  I always hoped that one Mother’s Day I’d turn up at my mum’s home with chocolates and flowers, and she would throw her arms around her long-lost son.” Reading his adoption file shattered all his illusions. Richard read that his birth mum Lucy Cunningham was  when she had him.    Lucy had abandoned her three children and husband to be with his birth father Harold Wrenn. She had a daughter with him before Richard’s birth, and two other children after him. Harold, a gang leader in league with the Kray twins, was in prison when Richard was born and never knew he existed. Lucy had always refused to see any reminders of the baby she gave birth to on the freezing canal bank. Richard says: “According to my file, Lucy had been offered pictures of me throughout my le and declined to see them. As I read all this information, all the self-esteem I’d ever built up vanished. I was left feeling utterly inadequate, isolated and inferior. “My adoptive father always said nobody had wanted me, and I started to feel that was true.” Hitting rock bottom that day he saw his file in the Birmingham Children’s Services offices gave Richard, from the West Midlands, no other option but to rise up. Realising how lucky he was to be alive, his first vow was to find and thank the man who had rescued him from the canal bank. At around pm on November , , postman Joseph Lester had just finished his sht at Birmingham’s sorting office and was walking home through freezing fog. It was a familiar route and Joseph was used to hearing the lapping water and muffled sounds of the city as he walked.  That night he was alerted to a faint whimper. He beamed his torch over the water and strained his eyes in the darkness until he spotted something pale. He stooped to find what looked like a parcel wrapped in newspaper, only two or three inches from the water’s edge. As he peeled back the paper, Joseph saw a newborn baby who was white and cold. He tucked the baby inside his coat and walked to the nearest phone box to call . Richard says: “I found this out from newspaper cuttings. Because that evening, Joseph ed home to his we and kids, and this kind, heroic man was so humble he did not tell his family he had just saved a le. “When I tried to find him, I was sad to find a record of his death. But I was so happy to meet Joseph’s sons, John and Keith, who said their dad often helped people without telling a soul.” Richard’s quest to find out more about his early le led him to trace some half siblings, who are now in regular contact and share stories of their childhood with empathy. Richard says: “It was a strange feeling to meet siblings – asI felt every emotion I had ever known rolled into one. “They gave me the first photos I’d ever seen of my birth mother and father. “With my half sister Patricia, I felt a genuine connection between us and an outpouring of love that I will cherish for the rest of my le.”  Patricia had attended their mother’s cremation and visiting the cemetery last September finally gave Richard the closure he craved and helped him look back on his le with new appreciation. He says: “My birth mother died in . Cemetery staff were good enough to open the book of remembrance from the day her ashes were interred, and I saw the names of her six other kids there, but not mine. “That felt like another blow, asI had been purged from her existence. Why had she singled me out  Why was I so bad  “When I was taken to the spot where her ashes were interred, I laid a white roses and tied a photograph of myself to them. “I said, ‘You didn’t want a picture of me when I was alive. But you have one of me now’. “Lucy kept all knowledge of her pregnancy and me from everyone, including my father, my brothers and sisters. I was a secret she took to her grave. “That’s why I had to close the circle, in the way I did in the hope I could move my le forward. “When I drove home that night I felt lighter. I’d done everything I could to find out about my birth family and when my front door closed, I felt I’d laid my past to rest.” Finding the truth about his birth hurt Richard so deeply because le with his adoptive parents had been far from happy. His first four years were spent in Field House children’s home in Clent, Stourbridge, Worcs, and he has only fond memories of his time there.  But the moment Richard met his adoptive parents he felt uneasy with Arnold Gallear, who would not look him in the eye. His instincts were right. Although Arnold’s we Pearl was gentle, patient and caring, Arnold was violent towards Richard, putting him in hospital more than once. The first time Richard suffered at Arnold’s fists, and feet, was just minutes after leaving the children’s home. Furious when Richard was sick in the back of his van, Arnold slammed on the brakes, hauled him out on to the road and laid into him with kicks and punches. Richard says: “No adult had ever hurt me in any way before, let alone hit me. I had a horrible feeling that this was what le would be like from now on. And it was.” On the outside, Arnold was a well-off insurance executive, regular church-goer and loyal member of The Salvation Army. But behind closed doors he ruthlessly controlled we Pearl and constantly verbally and physically attacked Richard.  He says: “He was a sadistic tyrant. But every time social services visited our home to check how I was, they interviewed me in front of Pearl and Arnold and I couldn’t tell the truth. “Teachers and doctors noticed my cuts, bruises, black eyes and broken bones. But no one intervened.” Richard escaped his unhappy home le at , when he ran away to work in the hotel and catering industry, where he could live on-site. Over the years he built up businesses of his own, but never felt he could trust anyone enough to have a lasting, loving relationship. He says: “I felt that loving someone would mean they’d vanish from my le. “First my house mother at the children’s home, who I loved but had to leave behind when I was adopted. And my adoptive mother, who suffered greatly because of Arnold’s violence against me.  “She could never show me affection when he was around, so lived on her nerves and it wore her down. “When I left to take jobs in hotels, I didn’t tell Pearl where I was going or keep in touch because I didn’t want Arnold to know where I was for both our sakes. “That has haunted me all my le and I missed her dreadfully. “So although I never settled down to have a family, I’m blessed with a circle of friends who are so loyal and close I call them my chosen family.” Writing his story in a new book, The Forgotten Child, gave Richard time to reflect on his le. Now, most of all, he feels lucky. He says: “I was incredibly lucky to be found that night on the canal, and also lucky not to have inherited any character traits from my birth parents or adoptive father. “I’m fortunate to have built up businesses to make sure I live comfortably. And I’m lucky I’m still here, despite the way I was born and some health bumps along the way.  “It makes me feel sure someone up there is looking out for me. Researching my le has made me feel, after a letime of self-blame and insecurity, that the bad things that happened were not my fault. “It’s helped me fully move on from the sad aspects of my le, and now I feel I’ve found peace and can finally be happy.”The Forgotten Child, by Richard Gallear, published by HarperCollins, on  March at £."},{"url":null,"title":"couple upgrade 1920s home leaves","story":"NewsCouple upgrade to s home leaves Ugly House to Lovely House viewers horriedAma and Amin, from Bellingham in South East London, overhauled their entire home - including painting the entire exterior a steel blue and neon orangeShareCommentsByAbigail OLeary:,  MAR Updated:,  MAR Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror tv tv-news video viewers-compared-colours-bq-store-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror UK News ,bundledCss:,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror UK News ,bundledCss:,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true\"\"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA couple who gave their dated s home a huge makeover on Channel  show Ugly House to Lovely House have left viewers horried.

Nathan Stevens, , of Edgeley, Stockport, lashed out with aposexcessive self defenceapos when challenging a punter at Hula Bar in West Didsbury, last year, a court heard. The assault started when Stevens had apostaken exceptionapos to something the victim Daniel Roberts had said to one of his female friends on the dancefloor at the venue last April, and aposwords were exchangedapos between, the judge was told. Mr Roberts initially pushed him but Stevens argued in court that he was grabbed by the throat. But Stevens responded by swinging a punch with a beer glass, which ended up sending glasses in the face of -year-old Mr Roberts.  Mr Roberts was rushed to hospital where doctors performed a seven-hour operation in bid to save the sight of his left eye, but it was unsuccessful. He also sustained a number of deep cuts on his face which now have left him scarred. Prosecutor Maria Brannan said Mr Roberts, who works as an electrician, spent three months off work and now struggled having lost half of his vision. In a statement read in the court, the victimaposs eyeball was luckily saved thanks to a silicon implant which helps it retain in its shape, but he had to put steroid drops into it every day. Mr Roberts said: I am normally a very positive person but I have down days when I wished this had never happened and that I still had the sight in my eye. He was pushed against the wall after the attack and Stevens, who didnapost realise how bad the injury was, left the bar. But Stevens handed himself in to police weeks later after an appeal in the Manchester Evening News.    The Stockport man pleaded guilty to unlawful wounding at an earlier hearing. He stated in a plea that the blow was a case of aposexcessive self defenceapos after he was pushed or grabbed by the victim. Daniel Travers, defending, said the father had been left aposdevastated at the injury he had caused and aposthat was never his intentionapos. He said: He knows how signicant an effect that will have for the rest ofle. This is a very poor reaction and was a very bad decision made whilst in drink. It is an immediate and instinctive reaction and we are talking about a few seconds. He has not picked up the glass to use as a weapon, it was already in his dominant hand and thataposs what has caused this injury. He urged Judge Timothy Clayson to suspend any prison term as court was told Stevens was aposcommittedapos to his family, including his children. However those appeals were ignored and he was jailed for two years and four months at Manchester Crown Court on Thursday afternoon.    Passing sentence, Judge Clayson said: This is a really tragic situation which has resulted in the loss of sight in one eye, an injury that is lelong and grave. This was not pre-meditated, it was a single blow which was issued in response to a push or you being grabbed for a few seconds by the throat. However you were affected by alcohol and itaposs right that you would have likely not have reacted by swinging a punch at your victimyou had been sober. And in the end, those who cause serious injury in violent offences whilst in drink have only themselves to blame and will be held responsible for their actions.

The -year-old felt sheaposd lost her identity after her husband died and children moved away but is now loving performing after losing seven stone in weight - and claims it makes her aposthe coolest gran everapos. The gran-of-two now regularly takes to the stage as her alter-ego Foxy La Mer, complete with corset and nipple tassles - and even reckons burlesque should be on prescription for fellow OAPs. Retired outreach worker Marilyn said: Burlesque encompasses everything I want to do. From the first day I was hooked. I suddenly felt feminine and so glamorous.    Before, Iaposd felt like Iaposd lost all my femininity. Since my husband was ill there was nothing to make me feel glam. Iaposd lost that we role. Sex was out of the window, there was nothing making me feel sexy. It was like I was just existing. I felt very alone. I felt there was something missing. At  years old people have this idea that youaposre old and should just sit at home but thataposs not me.    I wanted something to make me feel like a woman, to feel glamourous and to feel desired. I say itaposs apostease without the sleazeapos. Thereaposs nothing sleazy about what we do. It should be on prescription.

Marilyn found love again with second husband David Bersey but the pair were devastated when he was diagnosed with Parkinsonaposs Disease shortly after they married in . He died four years ago. Marilyn said: The we role had gone and I had become more of a carer. I felt Iaposd lost my identity - as a we and a mother, my children were all grown up. I was thinking aposwho am I apos My weight was up and down and Iaposd been suffering from high blood pressure for years. I started to steadily lose weight.I lost three stone then another three stone after I retired and joined Slimming World. Another stone fell off after my husband died. I now maintain my weight of st lbs.I was scrolling through Facebook and saw this burlesque group pop up and I thought it sounded interesting.I was very tentative at first. There were a lot of younger ladies and I was the oldest by a long way. They were in their twenties up to their forties.    But I loved it and now go once a week. We learn a routine for four weeks and in the last week we dress up in burlesque and perform it. Theyaposre a fantastic group of girls. Marilyn quickly took on the persona Foxy La Mer and now has two comedy burlesque chair routines that she does at charity events and parties - where she strips down to a sexy corset and nipple tassels which she makes herself. Marilyn, who has a grandson Brandon Hanmore, , and step-grandson Aaron Knight, , said: One is to the ghostbuster tune where, as sexily as I can, I take off a bit of clothing and strip down to my burlesque outfit.  The other routine is the Burlesque Granny. Iaposm an old lady with a walking frame and do part of the routine as a grandma then the music changes and I take off my wig and glasses and strip down to my stockings and corset for the burlesque routine using the walking frame. Then I rip my bra off and reveal the nipple tassels. I love performing because Iaposm not being somebody  - Foxy La Mer is an extension of me rather than a character. Itaposs not important how old I am. I prefer itthey donapost say my age when they introduce me on stage. I want them to clap me because Iaposm doing well and they like it.  Itaposs also toned me up. When I first started I couldnapost get my leg over the chair but itaposs built up my stamina and strength and I can do everything that the others can do now. My daughter will come and watch me. She thinks itaposs fantastic and my son is really proud. My grandson thinks Iaposm the coolest gran ever. Although not looking for a relationship Marilyn said burlesque has given her the confidence to flirt and look men in the eye. She added: Itaposs made me feel sexy again. Iaposm quite happy doing what Iaposm doing andit met someone Iaposd feel confident enough to go for it. I would say to anyone just to try it. Weaposre all living longer and should be out there doing things not staying at home feeling miserable.

Instead, he is drowning his sorrows in a pub in hometown Swindon — claiming the best man they trusted to organise things with almost £, called the night before they were due to fly and confessed to spending it all without booking anything. Ben, , said: “I could not believe what I was hearing. “I never even got angry really, it was just shock and disbelief. “You can’t believe someone would do something like that. “So we’ve gone from thinking we’d be at a pool party in Vegas to sat having a beer in Swindon.”    Ben, who ties the knot with fiancee Emma in Royal Wootton Bassett on April , planned the Sin City jaunt with three pals from Swindon St George Rugby League Club, dad Craig, his two brothers-in-law and another family friend. They all handed cash over to the best man. Ben, a rugby coach at Gloucester University who also works as a service engineer, said: “As soon as we had set a date, I told Emma I wanted to go to Vegas for the stag party.  “I’d always dreamed of playing the tables in those iconic casinos and what better time than just before I get married  “We had decided on the flights and the hotel on the strip where we would stay, and he just said he’d take care of it all. “We handed over more than £ each and trusted him to deliver the dream trip. In the weeks running up to the stag, we were all getting excited and there were no signs that anything was wrong.”  Telling of his shock when he got the confession call, Ben said: “I was stunned. I couldn’t believe what he’d done. “It wasn’t just my money, there were others who were going to miss out on a trip of a letime.” To make matters worse, one of the stag members is already in Las Vegas after travelling to Nevada from his home in New Zealand. Police are probing and Ben and his group tried to keep the Vegas dream alive – but flights were too dear.  Ben, whose stag plans had included hitting the Hakkasan party venue, said: “It looks like a weekend in Newcastle rather than Vegas. “There is no use moping about it, I am just trying to make the best of a bad situation and even see the humour in itI can.” Thankfully, Emma’s hen party — a weekend of drinks and games in a Somerset mansion — went without any hitches. Emma, , said: “Ben and his friends were so looking forward to the trip and what happened has been a blow. But they’ll find something  and have a good time.”  Ben added: “At least Emma had a good time and I’m sure we’ll have a blast — just not on the tables in Vegas.” Wiltshire police said: “We can confirm this matter is being investigated. It would be inappropriate to comment further.” "},{"url":null,"title":"libby squires friends tribute beautiful","story":"NewsLibby Squires friends tribute to beautul victim at bench she was last seen aliveMemorial to beloved Hull student at the bench where she was last seen alive as police launch homicide probeShareCommentsByLucy Thornton:,  MAR NewsThe bench where Libby Squire was last seen has become the centre of loving tributes to the student \"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailThe bench where Libby Squire was last seen alive has become a memorial to the “big-hearted” student.

We engaged with organisers before the go slow began, they ignored our advice to stay in lane  and limit speed to no less than mph.He added: Deliberately slowing or stopping traffic amounts to inconsiderate driving.The drivers were stopped and have been reported for that offence. The rest have been advised they face the same should they continue. There was some traffic in places but it was hard to tell whether this was caused by Brexiteers or just by the Friday rush hour. Highways England tweeted: There have been a few issues but nothing of any major impact and at present everything is running as usual. One angry Brexiteer told Kent Live he “trundled down the M” from Junction  to junction  but “it was a shame no one joined me”. Another driver added: “People ain’t got the b*******. It was a good idea but we have failed.” On the M M past Bristol it was barely noticed however on the M it appears there was some disruption as protesters blocked all three lanes - against police advice. Two drivers on the M in Devon are set to be fined as well.The go-slow started at approximately .pm and consists of around  vehicles, reports Devon Live.  Inspector Si Jenkinson tweeted that two drivers ignored police advice to not deliberately obstruct the carriageway and were prosecuted. He wrote: M go slow. Our advice was the same, make your protest, don’t deliberately obstruct the carriageway. It seems two drivers ignored this advice, slowing to speeds as low as mph on the motorway. They’ve been stopped and prosecuted. Speaking at the start of the protest, organiser Ian Grindod attempted to dampen expectations: “It was never going to be a massive event anyway.” On the A in Flintshire around  vehicles or more turned up - there was slow traffic south and westbound but that was not helped by a closure due to an accident. The go-slow protest is part of a series of action taking place across the country over the next few days. Here is a list of the roads protesters planned to block:  A Cornwall - .pm A M Telford - pm A to M Somerset - pm M Derby Nottingham - pm A Felixstowe - pm M Lancaster Morecambe J to - .pm South Wales M around the Prince of Wales Bridge M M between Avonmouth and Bath - .pmUKIP issued a statement to its members warning against participation. It reads: This will achieve nothing - except the possible arrest of participants on public order offences - and party leader Gerard Batten MEP has requested that UKIP members do NOT participate, and do not allow others to use UKIP flags, banners and other insignia in such a protest. To do otherwise will simply risk bringing the party into disrepute, undermine all our hard work and be a media own goal. A Highways England spokesman said the authority is also aware, adding: Our focus is on providing a safe, reliable network for the millions of drivers who use our motorways and major A roads every day. The penalty for wilfully obstructing the highway is a fine. A Peopleaposs Vote march is due to be held in London on Saturday, finishing in Parliament Square.

The body was placed into a crouching position to fit them in, almost a sleeping position. They put a lovely little flint kne in the grave with this person for their use in the after-le.” It is understood the woman would have been much loved because a lot of effort was put into creating her final resting place.

For the successful candidate answering an advert posted online is expected to dress - and act - like a Disney Princess while looking after their five-year-old twins.The applicant must turn up to the school gate in costume and stay in role while she supervises play dates, does Disney-related activities, such as singing Disney songs, doing Disney dances or going for Disney-themed picnics. She will also cook dinner and put them to bedtheir City worker parents are busy - all in Disney role. The nanny is required to act as a dferent Disney Princess every months, choosing from positive role models such as Princess Jasmine, Belle and Pocahontas.    The part-time job comes with a generous annual salary of £, and all costumes and props will be paid for in exchange for sprinkling some magic into the little girlsapos lives. Their parents also want their nanny to be a positive influence on the children and believe that many of the Disney princesses encapsulate those values. We hope they can teach our girls about determination, ambition, compassion and fearlessness, says their father. The idea came from the girlsapos mum one day while watching a Disney film - what   - with her daughters.My we came up with the idea, their dad told The Express .She thought it could be a great way to add some magic into their afternoons whilst helping us out.    We were in need of a part-time nanny anyway to pick up the girls after school four days a week and help out until weaposre home. This will make sure itaposs fun for the girls as well as them having a strong role model around them. The family - who want to remain anonymous - are adjusting to hectic le with boisterous twins and as the couple both have demanding jobs, they wanted to ensure thatsomeone  was collecting them from school, it should be a fun experience. We realise it might not be too comfortable, but it shouldnapost be for too long each day, says their dad. He and his we, who commute from Brookmans Park, Hertfordshire, to London, daily, hope that the successful candidate will have a background in performing or acting. They would like her to play the character of each dferent princess, adopting personas and dressing up to perfect the role.  The father said: Like most five-year-olds, our twins are obsessed with Disney and their favourite characters change all the time. However, Elsa from Frozen, normally tops the list. Activities arenapost necessary every evening as sometimes the girls might have homework. However Disney focused activities for most afternoons might include painting, arts and crafts, baking themed biscuits or cakes, dancing or singing - the girlsapos favourite - or even going for a picnic once it is warmer. The parents have also said applicants must be prepared for long-term work, as they are looking to keep them in the girlaposs lives for the foreseeable future. The advert, which starts with I have a slightly unusual request that Iaposm hoping someone will be able to help me with, is on childcare. The site, with more than two million users nationwide, has become the largest online community for parents in the country since launching in .  It is the first time the family have employed a nanny and it is why they want the experience to be extra special. We have used babysitters and a childminder before but never a nanny, says the girlsapos dad who works in finance. Both a qualied nanny and a qualied actor would be amazing, but we realise that might be hard to find. However a qualied nanny is more important as they will have more experience with children than an actor might. The couple have added a £, premium on top of the basic salary for the Disney-related aspects of the job. The advert specied that the role is well-paid and part-time, however the chosen nanny must be willing to work around the parentsapos busy schedules. While the parents will pay for the hire of the costumes they do require applicants to demonstrate a creative flare as well as a passion for all things Disney.  The girlsapos mother, who works for a law firm, composed the advert: My husband and I are looking for a part-time nanny to care for our twin girls during the week, but we want to hire someone to look after our children whilst in character as a dferent Disney princess every month, such as Princess Anna, Moana, Rapunzel and Princess Merida. Like most five-year-olds, our girls are obsessed with Disney and we feel this would be the best way to communicate some important values. We know this isnapost a normal request for nannies, however it would be a great way to teach our girls about things like determination, compassion, fearlessness and ambition from strong yet relatable female role models like Princess Tiana, Princess Anna, Belle and Cinderella. So, how do they react to criticism that not all Disney characters imbue the qualities they are seeking, such as Sleeping Beauty and Cinderella who portray weak women who need rescuing by a Prince Charming  Honestly, before having children, I wouldnapost have known anything about this, but after seeing what seems like a million Disney films I can understand this, says the girlsapos dad.  Despite some older films needing a prince to save the princess, the woman is always the protagonist and holds the values we hope to teach our girls so this isnapost a big problem for us. I think the other parents will think weaposre crazy but hopefully will agree that itaposs a great idea to make the girlsapos days a bit more special - as well as teaching them great le lessons and values, their dad says. Most definitely, I think we will have a lot of girls wanting to come round to play. The girls are already devotees, says their father: We took the girls to Disneyland Paris last summer for the first time and I think it was the best week of their lives. They own a ridiculous amount of Disney toys and they probably have all of the princess costumes between them. We are planning to go to Florida next year too but the girls donapost know about that yet. We are hoping to surprise them and catch it on video. Are they looking for a real le Mary Poppins then  She is more than welcome to apply, says dad, laughing. Our girls have seen the movie and they love it, but I think they might be swayedit was between her or Elsa - sorry Mary! Real le princess Childrenaposs party organiser Lianne Cole understands the attraction of the Disney Princess for little girls. I have been doing princess parties for five years and I absolutely adore it, she says. I arrive at the door in a princess outfit and ask to come to the party. Seeing their young faces is an absolute joy. I organise games but the best part is the singing. I busk parttime at Covent Garden, so I have a big repertoire of songs. Naturally, I get asked to sing Let It Go from Frozen, which the children absolutely love. I have a microphone which I pass around and as you can imagine they all want to have a go. I have two other girls working with me sometimes and when we are together it is an absolute ball. There are so many princesses and so many stories there is a lot of material to draw on. Lianne, , who runs Southamptonbased Ever After Princess Parties is tempted to apply for the nanny role herself. If it wasnapost for the condition about being a nanny with two yearsapos experience I think I would apply, because it would be a fantastic job.

During an interview, Ball denied that she was Nedaposs owner but admitted that she had owned him from .She said she had given the dog away in between January to March last year aposfree to a good homeapos on Facebook , but she couldnapost provide any evidence of this.She claimed she came home on June , last year, to find the dog on her lawn in a mess. After trying to wash him and cut out the matts, she took Ned to a dog rescue. When the inspector vistied Ballaposs address she observed a run at the side of the house that was being dismantled and had dog faeces in it.  A witness also gave evidence that they had seen the defendant with the dog recently and the dog was micro-chipped to her. Ball appeared before Lincolnaposs Magistratesapos Court on March  for sentencing. In mitigation, the court heard that she had previously pleaded guilty to one offence of causing unnecessary suffering to Ned under the Animal Welfare Act . Ball said she found the dog dficult to look after due to its behaviour and family commitments. Inspector Burris said: This was one of the most distressing cases I have dealt with because of the utter lack of any emotion or empathy displayed by the owner towards this dog.

We based it on the fact he was coming back from a serious injury and he had to go and play games. He has seen the benefit of that. For me, he is still our player.”McInnes is also delighted with the form of Anderson.“Wee Bruce is on fire.

This area of Argyll is the most fragile in the region. The people of Argyll, businesses and visitors deserve no less.Forget the squandering of £m on unreliable, mitigation measures trying to justy a flawed decision made many years ago to use the Old Military Road as a ersion which has failed on many occasions and now has a landslip between the two roads. Forget the expensive excavation of pits by the A rather use the cuttings into the hillside to form a two lane road protected with a flow over canopy with closed outer edges at the four problems gullies. If the contractors on the present scheme can work without any road closures then the flow over canopy option would not lead to closures as many officials and some politicians claim.This is a red herring postponing #a proper solution#. When this is option is completed it will save on the expense of manning the ersion route involving - personnel and - vehicles, replacing expensive nettings, delays whilst the farmer clears his animals and collect his fees. A scandalous waste of public money. Solve The Rest Landslides and stop wasting on mitigating measures.Like Brendan O#Hara I#m neither an engineer or geologist but both of us are blessed with plain common sense. If the Faroese can build a tunnel at £.m per kilometre surely a simple open sided m canopy would cost considerably less. In  at Dawlish .km of double tracked railway and .km of sturdy seawall was built at a cost of £m in eight weeks.

Transport Minister Michael Matheson, Transport Scotland and our Government must abandon their obsession with mitigation measures and fund a permanent solution. We demand no less.Sir,Calls for assurances that the Rest and Be Thankful section of the A will be improved to resist future landslides were made during a session of Transport, Infrastructure and Connectivity questions in the Scottish Parliament.I quizzed transport secretary Michael Matheson, about what was discussed at the last meeting of the A Taskforce in November , and asked what assurances the Cabinet Secretary could give to local residents and businesses who rely on the A being open at all times.The Rest and Be Thankful was closed off for nine days in October  following the largest landslide in a decade, forcing road users to either take a major ersion, or to use the Old Military Road during certain hours of the day.A number of petitions were created during the period of the incident, including one by myself, calling for a permanent solution to the Rest and Be Thankful.The transport secretary said that the meeting was #full and frank#, and that there would be a #review of the potential for additional landslide mitigation measures at the Rest and Be Thankful#, and that this would be discussed at the next A Taskforce meeting in March .There was also a commitment that Argyll and Bute would be #prioritised# in the next Strategic Transport Projects Review.I welcome the assurances by the transport secretary that there will be a review of any additional measures for the Rest and Be Thankful, and that Argyll and Bute will receive priority at the next Strategic Transport Projects Review.Donald Cameron, MSPReserve forcesSir,Last issue#sletter raising concerns about the UK government’s proposed use of the army’s reserve force in the event of a no-deal Brexit is timely.In case anyone out there still thinks a no-deal Brexit is a good idea it’s worth noting that the legal authorityof Reserve Forces Act  allowing the Secretary of State to take this step requires him to establish that it is necessary #for the alleviation of distress or the preservation of le or property in time of disaster or apprehended disaster#.Enough said.Frances Roberts, Ardrishaig"},{"url":null,"title":"honours even for red star in argyll derby","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThe Ropework played host to this keenly contested local derby which was watched by a healthy crowd on Saturday February .And for the second time this season, Red Star and Campbeltown Pupils shared the points in a match both sides will feel they could have won.Both sides were struggling for fluency in the opening stages but Red Star settled first and grabbed the opening goal after  minutes.

The youngster took a touch before slotting past the Pupils# goalkeeper to give Star a - lead.Star continued to press and doubled their lead when Coll McCallum robbed the Pupils# defender on the edge of the box before cutting the ball across goal.

The game continued at a frantic pace, however, there was no further scoring in the first half and Star went in with a - advantage.Pupils came out with purpose in the second half as they looked to force themselves back into the game, however, it was a howler from Red Star which allowed them back into the match.A square ball across the back resulted in a mix-up between Star keeper Luke Kalache and defender Ben Forbes which allowed Donald McCallum to prod the ball home from just inside the box and Pupils were back in the game at - with eight second half minutes gone.The home side didn’t recover from this and you could sense a nervousness that gave the visitors plenty encouragement. The equaliser arrived with  minutes remaining when good play from Pupils down the right by Soudan saw him get a low cross in which was met by the on-rushing run of Ryan Deans and he finished well to level the score at -.This set up a frantic finish and both sides could have nicked it towards the end. Pupils went close with a headed effort which was clawed to safety while at the other end there was a goalmouth scramble which Star couldn’t convert and both sides had to settle for a draw in the end as referee Jimmy Litster blew for full time.Red Star were dealt a blow as it emerged that captain Aaron Moore suffered a dislocated shoulder.

Plans to buy council-owned Dam Park are at an advanced stage. The club, currently top of the Tennent’s Premiership, hope the bold switch will take them to the next level. Ayr would earn a multi-million pound jackpot by hiving off their own land for housing, with builder Cala Homes believed to be preferred bidder for the site. And they plan to use part of the cash for a £, synthetic surface to be laid at their new home. Club chiefs have spent the last year in talks over a move and hope to seal the deal soon.  If the switch is rubber-stamped by South Ayrshire Council Ayr could be playing out of Dam Park as early as . One source said: “It is the move that makes sensethe club is to continue growing. “Next season sees the start of the Super Six set-up with games to be broadcast live on television. “It is potentially a great  for Ayr and bringing the club into the heart of the town can benefit so many.” The switch would see Ayr Seaforth Athletic Club on the move to a new sporting centre planned for Craigie. And junior side Whitletts Victoria couldto the heart of their community with a revamp of the old activity complex on the cards. Ayr rugby supremo Billy McHarg said talks on the move are progressing well.  He said: “Discussions to this point have been positive. “We’re keen to work with all parties to find the right solution and one which will benefit the whole town. “We feel that Ayr Rugby Club coming into the town centre would be a big step forward.” Club members would still have to approve such a move. Ayr have been at scenic Millbrae since . Prior to that they played out of Newton Park, Dam Park, the Old Racecourse and King George V playing fields. Whitletts chairman John Dalton said: “Talks have been very positive and we are currently looking at alternative options. “The football park at Whitletts is the obvious route to go down and would represent ahome to our roots. “A lot of water is still to go under the bridge but as Ayr’s junior football club we are viewing this as a positive opportunity.” Craigie councillor Ian Cavana said: “It may be that a deal is close but nobody will be moving anywhere until the new sports centre at Craigie is up and running. “Work is due to start on that next summer and that’s when we should see real progress.” A council spokesman said: “Discussions on the future of Dam Park are ongoing.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr NewsAyrAyr Rugby"},{"url":null,"title":"eyesore burns house knocked down","story":"South Ayrshire Councils Burns House, Burns Statue Square.\"Get the biggest daily stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailEyesore Burns House is set to be torn down this upcoming year.

The cost to flatten the office block is estimated to be £. million.

Police objected to McLelland getting a personal licence at the council’s licensing board meeting heard last week, McLelland, , of Main Street, Auchinleck carried out the crime in November . Police Sergeant David Dougan told councillors McLelland was sentenced to a community payback order at Ayr Sherf Court last year as punishment. But McLelland said she was plagued by anti-social behaviour outside at her home in Main Street. She told the board: “I love kids. I regret it.” She claims she has had problems with people “chapping her door” and urinating in her garden. She rushed out to the nearby bus shelter during one incident, she told the meeting.. McLelland said: “I went out. It wasn’t even raw bleach. It is not an excuse. I shouldn’t have done it.” She claimed the bottle was kicked out of her hand and spilled over the victim. But the meeting heard McLelland pled guilty in court. The shop worker said: “I am not in the habit of going out and fighting with kids. “I am a -year-old woman.” She added: “Everybody in this le makes mistakes.

Councillors adjourned the meeting to discuss whether she should be handed a licence. Ontheir opinion was split with three councillors voting to grant her application and the same number against. Board Chair Councillor Tom Cook had the ruling say and decided to grant McLelland’s licence. He said giving her the licence would not increase her chances of committing a similar offence in the future. Councillors George Mair, John Campbell and Fiona Campbell voted to refuse the licence. Councilors Drew Filson, Lillian Jones supported Councillor Cook’s view to grant it.

The consultation and engagement exercise – approved by Councillors last year – gives tenants the chance to choose their preferred option for the long-term future of the flats: Refurbish  – this means the Council would keep the flats, decant tenants, carry out identied refurbishment works, and thentenants to their refurbished flats. Rehouse  – this means tenants would be rehoused permanently in suitable alternative accommodation and the flats would be demolished. Rebuild  – this means tenants would be decanted to temporary accommodation and the flats would be demolished before some tenantsto a new-build housing development on the Riverside Place site. The detailed consultation, which is based around inidual one-to-one meetings with more than  tenants, has been planned in conjunction with the River Ayr Tenants Association, which represents tenants in the three blocks. The Council has communicated regularly with tenants in the lead-up to the consultation to ensure they have all the information they need to take part. A further letter has now been distributed to homes in Riverside Place following queries and concerns raised by tenants regarding a letter sent to them by Fort, Seafield  Wallacetown Community Council. The community council’s letter appears to query the three consultation options being discussed with tenants and questions South Ayrshire Council’s interpretation of the expert report approved last year regarding the “essential and advisable” works required to the flats. Councillor Philip Saxton, South Ayrshire Council’s Portfolio Holder for Housing and Community Wellbeing, said: “We are committed to ensuring that our tenants are fully involved in the discussions about the future of their flats, which is why we’re taking such a detailed approach to this consultation. “It’s vital that tenants understand all the facts so they can form their own views about the option that is best for them. That is why we have gone back out to them to respond to the queries and confusion that have been generated by the community council’s letter. “We fully appreciate that the community council may have a view on the consultation, which is why colleagues are meeting with them next week and we’re happy to keep them informed about the consultation and engagement process. “However, our focus – which was clearly expressed by tenants at the recent River Ayr Tenants Association meeting – has to be on hearing the views of those who will be directly affected by Councillors’ decisions later this year: the tenants of Riverside Place. “We thank them for their participation in the consultation and I can reassure them that their views will be taken into account before any decisions are taken about the future of Riverside Place.” Joe Lafferty, Chair of the River Ayr Tenants Association, said: “We have worked closely with the Council over the last couple of years as discussions around the future of the flats have moved forward – and we very much appreciate the approach the Council has taken. “It is for every tenant to consider what is the best option for them and to ensure their voice is heard by those who will be making the decisions about what happens next. Clear facts, easy to understand information and answers to the questions tenants have is what’s needed and that’s exactly what we have got from the Council.”   Feedback from the consultation will be considered by Councillors in June this year.Full details of the Riverside Place consultation are available at  www.south-ayrshire.gov.uk riverside-place .

The Post can exclusively reveal that the developers McCarthy  Stone have thrown in the towel and withdrawn their multi-million pound proposals. Major question marks hang over the building’s future following the bombshell announcement. The news prompted an angry backlash from Derek Hart, chair of Prestwick North Community Council. In an extraordinary outburst he claimed the building has been “plundered and left to rot.” The building provided a retreat for children battling cancer for more than  years. It was opened by Princess Diana in . In  it was sold by owners Clic Sargent after claims of a “challenging fundraising environment”. They sold it to McCarthy  Stone and trousered £.m from the deal. However, since McCarthy  Stone took ownership and unveiled their luxury flat plans they have been embroiled in a bitter fight with neighbours Prestwick Golf Club. The club was opposed to the development on the basis of its scale and design. Other objections included the potential impact it would have had on their historic course and the surrounding conservation area. In addition, there were fears that errant balls could smash into residents’ properties. Plans involved building  flats for people aged over , spread out in a T-shape over four floors. Many would have had sea views and balconies. The proposals were approved by South Ayrshire Council but last year Prestwick Golf Club successfully petitioned for a judicial review, meaning demolition work on the former retreat had to stop. It was estimated that  jobs would be created between the construction phase and posts at the new development. Despite a PR charm offensive from McCarthy  Stone throughout the process and a public exhibition of plans at the  Club in Prestwick’s Main Street, the developers pulled the plug on the project. A spokesperson said: “Following a strategic review last year we are no longer pursuing any new developments within Scotland and have withdrawn our plans for Prestwick.” Derek Hart reckons the decision is a kick in the teeth for all the campaigners who fought to retain the presence of a sick children’s home in Prestwick.

A statement by the club said: “While we welcome this news we hope that, should a new development proposal for the site be put forward in the future, the design and scale will be more sympathetic to the surrounding area.” The statement said the club was not against the principle of redeveloping the site but was “disappointed” at the scale and design of the proposed development.

Super-fit Fiona McBlane was , practised yoga and cycled and was in London lapping up a glamorous working le in the music industry for companies such as EMI and Smash Hits. But during a Christmas visit home to Ayrshire she fell unwell with leg, arm and head pain. Such was her distress she admitted herself to hospital. First the minor stroke hit - on January ,  - and then the searing biggie nine days later. It left her semi-paralysed in hospital for  months, unable to speak, hardly walking and retaining very limited brain capacity. That was when Clan McBlane rallied round to give her the best future they could. They had been advised the best place for her was an old folks home but they stood firm. Once Fiona was fit enough to leave hospital she was brought into the bosom of the family in Prestwick. Twelve years on at the age of , Fiona is battling away and has got to the stage where she has joined the gym at Prestwick Tennis Club. Her loving older sisters Gillian McBlane, , and -year-old Gaenor Hardy have just pounded round the Stroke Association’s Resolution Run with Gillian’s -year-old son Graham to continue raising money for the charity. That added £ to a total now of about £. Gillian, a top civil lawyer in Ayr, and Gaenor, headmistress at Heathfield Primary, assist their parents Jean and Ian who are Fiona’s full-time carers. And Gillian is helped by the other legal eagle in the family, Ayr criminal defence agent Steven Maxwell. Gillian said: “She loved her work and was a real high flier. “People were drawn to Fiona’s fun-loving nature and her great big heart. “Never for a minute did we think she would have a stroke. “At  years old she had lost everything she loved.” Fiona is prone to falling and choking, often passing out. Sometimes the enormity of what has happened becomes too much for her and she struggles emotionally. But Gillian said: “Our parents taught us to look for the positive things in le and not to feel sorry for ourselves. We spend time together and Fiona enjoys the company. “Despite the extent of her disability, she does brilliantly. “Doctors told us that her friends would eventually tail off but Fiona’s haven’t . They keep in contact with her and visit when they can. “People have shown us great kindness over the years in so many ways and this means a lot, helping us immensely. We don’t know what the future will hold for Fiona but we do know that whatever it is we will face it together.” There are , strokes in Scotland every year. Angela Macleod at the Stroke Association said: “Our latest research shows that by training and taking part in a Resolution Run you are helping to lower your stroke risk. “The funds raised by each runner means we can reach out to more stroke survivors and their families to offer the support that they may need to rebuild their lives.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnstrokeAyrAyr NewsPrestwickRunningCharity"},{"url":null,"title":"upper crust roost alloway","story":"NewsAn Upper Crust roost in AllowayAyrshire Post Property of the WeekShareByStephen Houston:,  MAR Updated:,  MAR News\"Get the biggest daily stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailThere are few better places to bring up a family than the secluded suburban streets of Alloway.

That could be as simple as a bullet point list or as fulsome as a report running hundreds of pages.What will the Attorney General do William Barr said he envisions two reports, and only one for congressional and public consumption.Mr Barr has said he takes seriously the ldquoshall be confidential part of the regulations governing Mr Muellerrsquos report. He has noted that department protocol says internal memos explaining charging decisions should not be released.During his confirmation hearing, Mr Barr said he would draft, after Mr Mueller turned in his report, a second one for the chairman and ranking members of the House and Senate Judiciary committees. But the regulations provide little guidance for what such a report would say.The Attorney General is required only to say the investigation has concluded and describe or explain any times when he or Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein decided an action Mr Mueller proposed ldquowas so inappropriate or unwarranted that it should not be pursued.In a letter Mr Barr sent on Friday to the four members of the two Judiciary committees, he said there were ldquono such instances.

But he has hedged on specics and said his plans could change after speaking with Mr Mueller and Mr Rosenstein.Will Donald Trump be able to see the report It is not yet clear whether Donald Trump will get to see the report It is unclear whether Donald Trump will ask to see the report and under what circumstances he or his attorneys might be able to view it, especially because the document is meant to be confidential for Justice Department leadership.Mr Mueller reports to the Justice Department, not the White House.Mr Barr said at his confirmation hearing that he would not permit White House interference in the investigation. But he has also voiced an expansive view of executive power in which the president s as the countryrsquos chief law enforcement officer and has wide latitude in giving directives to the FBI and Justice Department.Democrats could seize on any disclosure to the president to argue that the report is not confidential and should be immediately provided to them as well.Can Democrats in Congress subpoena Mr Mueller and his report Yes.

Craig Galbraith worked well playing with, eventual man of the match, Calum Johnson for the first time.In the th minute there was a skirmish in the box after a corner, Johnson cleared the ball but it ricocheted off the incoming player into the net.The Glasgow students had more possession with the wind advantage. With  minutes left, a tremendous fingertip save, by Neil McMillan, pushed the ball over the bar.With four minutes left the away side put the game beyond #Dale#s reach when Matthew Lamont tried to clear a corner shot but unforunately scored an own goal.In high winds and driving rain the game fizzled out.Both sides had played well in the conditions and kept the ball on the deck in addition, referee, Archie Mitchell said it was an easy game to ref with no bad tackles.The match ball was sponsored by Wee Toon Sports and a Carradale spokesperson thanked Food for Thought for the post match hospitality.Tomorrow Carradale travels to Helensburgh for an early kick off at noon."},{"url":null,"title":"machrihanish bay is britains second best beach","story":"The bay, which is the beginning of the longest continuous stretch of sand in Argyll, extending all the way to Westport, was second only to Sandown Bay on the Isle of White in the BBC Countryfile Magazine Awards .After a long and detailed judging process to determine the shortlist for each category, the magazine#s readers and website visitors were given a month to vote for their favourites, with winners announced last week.The magazine#s editor, Fergus Collins, said: #Congratulations to each of the winners – and all the people and places who were shortlisted.#The aim of our awards is to celebrate the best of the British countryside and shine a light on lesser known places, projects and people who are doing great work.#Westport beach looking towards Machrihanish Bay. _cwestport"},{"url":null,"title":"down memory lane march 15 2019","story":"Peter Docherty, born and brought up in the Wee Toon, lives in a first floor flat, in Tangy Place tenement, at the end of the High Street, with a #marvellous# view of all the comings and goings on Campbeltown Loch.Back in , aged , he was an apprentice painter and decorator for a town firm, which he thinks might have been Galbraith and Cochrane.Mr Docherty#s son, also Peter, , talked to the Courier on Monday and said: #Dad told me that the young apprentices were always given the awkward, high up places to paint.#Back then this wall must have been under a ceiling as now the graffiti chipped into the plaster is at waist height.#Painters always used to leave their mark on a building, many will be painted over in people#s houses.#They often wonderedtheir #marks# would be uncovered in the future.#On this wall they could see the names of people who had painted it in the past.#When he saw Down Memory Lane last week dad said he was the only P Docherty in the town at the time.#Peter junior, who visits two to three times a year, said: #I was born in Craigard.

which the papers were presented this year which made alternative motions possible.However what did this year yield The main dferences in the budget came down to the administration of the council proposing £, more for winter gritting, outwith the A which is covered by the contract with BEAR.This was against cuts in the road safety unit, an award-winning safety programme for young children, a cut in youth and adult learning, a cut in environmental warden services, which means a focus on more fines but less time for fly tipping and dog fouling and a cut to music tuition in schools.There were amendments lodged by Councillor Donald Kelly and myself, the SNP group and councillors George Freeman and Jean Moffat.While gritting our roads is important Councillor Kelly and I, along with other council opposition groups, thought the other considerations were important to our communities which strangely enough is also supported by our corporate plan.Alas the gritting won the day.Full motions and votes can be found on the council website.However it was more disappointing that Councillor Kelly and I included in our motion a scheme to change funding due for Helensburgh and Dunoon.Just more than £ million would be moved to the regeneration project of Tarbert Lochgilphead Ardrishaig.This was defeated by the rest of the council which was particularly galling.Money for Helensburgh had been questioned by its community council which felt that too much had already been spent.The money for Dunoon was because of poor procurement processes and a general #I want syndrome#

Lauder, it is said, was the first place he stopped after fleeing from the Battle of Prestonpans.ldquoI suppose we kind of followed in his footsteps, said my friend, ldquoalthough in a very dferent way and totally dferent circumstances of course. Folk round here donrsquot really know the story, but coming from the Pans it gave us an immediate connection.The actual house on Lauder High Street that Johnnie Cope arrived at is now gone, replaced over  years ago. But Lauder must look much as it did on that fateful day when Cope arrived, with his horse close to collapse with exhaustion.Johnnie Cope was the general commanding the British Army at Prestonpans on that fateful day, September , . The battle was a major victory for the Jacobites. Cope fled the scene of battle, but only when it was clearly lost. He eventually arrived at Berwick-upon-Tweed to give news of his own defeat. Ever since, popular tradition has mocked Cope for running away and not standing his ground and dying lsquohonourablyrsquo, as Colonel Gardiner of Bankton House did.This ridicule was encapsulated in a traditional popular song, and the chorus remains well-known:Hey, Johnnie Cope, are ye wauking yet Or are your drums a-beating yet If ye were wauking I wad waitTae gang to the coals irsquo the morning.The song pokes fun at Cope and concludes with a harsh indictment:Now Johnnie, troth, ye were na blateTae come wirsquo news orsquo your ain defeat,And leave your men in sic a straitSae early in the morning.There are earlier versions with slightly dferent words, but the sentiment remains the same: Johnnie Cope ran away and should be ashamed of himself for leaving his men. However, he was later found to have done his duty, and this reputation deemed unfair. But mud sticks, especially when a catchy tune is added to it.This popular song is believed to have been written by Adam Skirving, a farmer at Garleton in East Lothian. There is a story that he visited the battle site a few hours after the fighting. Perhaps he spoke to some eyewitnesses who saw Cope flee up the road to Birsley Brae, and therefore got the idea for the song. The road Cope took as he fled from the battle has ever after been called Johnnie Copersquos Road.Lauder is a short journey from Prestonpansgoing by car. It had been a while since I had last ventured over Soutra Hill and into the border country and I enjoyed the drive despite the wild weather, or perhaps partly because of it.But what was Copersquos journey like as he galloped over Soutra Hill with some of his dragoons  He must have paused at the summit and cast a glance at the view over East Lothian and screwed his eyes to find Prestonpans. The panic and terror by this time would have given way to dferent feelings, I suspect.He rode more or less the same way I took to Lauder but it would have taken him much longer with very dferent emotions. His arrival in the town would have been a bewildering spectacle for the locals. He later continued his flight to Coldstream, which he reached by nightfall.All this was in my head as we headed home to Prestonpans from Lauder the next day. I could almost see the ghosts of Cope and his dragoons gallop past us as we ventured over Soutra.As we drove, I re-told the story to my kids and we sang the song in the car. They know the story and the chorus well, as we have many times ventured along Johnnie Cope Road on the way to the rail station.By the road is Bankton House, once the home of Colonel Gardiner, who did not run but stood his ground, and paid the ultimate price with brutal death.There is a small doorsquocot by the house, and inside you will find a free but almost secret visitor centre created with the support of the Battle of Prestonpans Heritage Trust.The doorsquocot can only be reached via a walkway through the wood from the rail station during the day, and inside lsquoAuld Archiersquo tells the tale of the battle, and the le and death of Colonel Gardiner. On the wall is a model map of how the area looked at the time of the battle, with the route taken by Johnnie Cope clearly marked.Itrsquos all fascinating stuff which had been unexpectedly brought to my mind by the visit to Lauder to see old friends.But it was the emotions rather than the events that I reflected on most. The hatred caused by this civil war , the loss, suffering and misery of conflict which is so often hidden by a cloak of romanticism.Adam Watters, a Panner who lives and breathes local history, and re-enacts it for children and visitors alike, is clear on this. It is a fascinating period to study, and to have the history on our doorstep brings it alive. But as Adam has said, letrsquos enjoy that sense of history on our doorstep and have fun with it, but let us not glory battle, rather learn from it.I think Johnnie Cope, even though he was a military man, may well have agreed with Adam."},{"url":null,"title":"east-lothian-council-cockenzie-revised-plan","story":"Inch Cape Offshore Ltd has been given approval to site the building ndash which will bring energy ashore from an offshore wind farm ndash on land at the former Cockenzie Power Station by Scottish Ministers.A planning application was initially lodged with East Lothian Council but was called in by the Scottish Government before a decision was made.That decision sparked anger after it was announced as First Minister Nicola Sturgeon was on an official visit to China, where she met representatives of Chinese state owned Red Rock, which owns Inch Cape.Now the company has presented a revised plan of the space it intends to use to Cockenzie and Port Seton Community Council.The community council posted the new design on social media and revealed plans were under way for Inch Cape to host workshops in the local communities in the coming months.The image shows the substation on about a third of the original .-hectare footprint applied for.One of the biggest concerns raised by communities and the local authority, which owns the land, was that a substation dominating the old power station site would make it a no-go area for other developments.The new plans were welcomed by many on the community councilrsquos Facebook page, with one person saying: ldquoGood news, less sterilisation of the site.Ian Johnson, Inch Capersquos project manager, said: ldquoWe are continuing to engage with East Lothian Council and local community councils on options to signicantly reduce the footprint of the onshore transmission works and moving this to the west of the site.ldquoWhile this detailed design plan is subject to further technical assessments, consultation and approval from the council, we are taking steps to ensure remaining land is available for other developments."},{"url":null,"title":"east-lothian-school-pupils-to-take-part-in-strike-against-climate-change","story":"The NBHS Eco Committee have encouraged students to travel by public transport to attend the rally campaigning for stronger government action to combat climate change.The Edinburgh protest is one of many around the world that are happening tomorrow morning, where school children are walking out of classes to protest climate change.The protest starts at am outside the Scottish Parliament.An East Lothian Council spokesperson said: ldquoWe want to support our young people as global citizens to have their voice and to be able to express their views on important matters such as climate change.\"The safety and wellbeing of our young people is of paramount importance to us.

He has noted that department protocol says internal memos explaining charging decisions should not be released.During his confirmation hearing, Mr Barr said he would draft, after Mr Mueller turned in his report, a second one for the chairman and ranking members of the House and Senate Judiciary committees. But the regulations provide little guidance for what such a report would say.The Attorney General is required only to say the investigation has concluded and describe or explain any times when he or Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein decided an action Mr Mueller proposed ldquowas so inappropriate or unwarranted that it should not be pursued.In a letter Mr Barr sent on Friday to the four members of the two Judiciary committees, he said there were ldquono such instances. He also said he may be in a position to advise them of Mr Muellerrsquos conclusions ldquoas soon as this weekend.Mr Barr indicated that he expects to use his report to share the results of Mr Muellerrsquos investigation with the public, which the regulations allow him to do. But he has hedged on specics and said his plans could change after speaking with Mr Mueller and Mr Rosenstein.Will Donald Trump be able to see the report It is unclear whether Donald Trump will ask to see the report and under what circumstances he or his attorneys might be able to view it, especially because the document is meant to be confidential for Justice Department leadership.Mr Mueller reports to the Justice Department, not the White House.Mr Barr said at his confirmation hearing that he would not permit White House interference in the investigation. But he has also voiced an expansive view of executive power in which the president s as the countryrsquos chief law enforcement officer and has wide latitude in giving directives to the FBI and Justice Department.Democrats could seize on any disclosure to the president to argue that the report is not confidential and should be immediately provided to them as well.Can Democrats in Congress subpoena Mr Mueller and his report Yes. The chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, Representative Jerrold Nadler, has said as much.ldquoWe could subpoena the final report. We could subpoena Mueller and ask him in front of the committee what was in your final report.

That novel was widely lambasted for its so-called profanity, which so shocked one judge, Rabbi Julia Neuberger, she stormed out of the meeting. ldquoOver my dead body was the mildest of her comments.About a year ago, Kelman finished a new novel which, he revealed, has still to find a publisher. After a long period with Secker  Warburg and Hamish Hamilton, he moved to Canongate with his last two books, That Was a Shiver, and Dirt Road, both of which were well received. But this new manuscript languishes, untouched and apparently unloved. Nobody, it seems, even in his own heath, is willing to make a decent offer for it.With some writers, you could understand. Thanks to technology that registers every sale, publisherscan see exactly how bankable their books are. When approached by a writer, they can track their performance at the click of a mouse. If this is healthy, they are far more likely to pounce on them thanthe novelistrsquos sales have not even covered their advance, leaving a publisher effectively in the red.This does not, of course, mean the novelist is no good. Sometimes it indicates the reverse. Literary fiction is a highly raried taste ndash as it always was. Only the most fortunate of such writers make a good living from the proceeds of books alone. For most it is a struggle to get by, hence the number finding shelter teaching on creative writing courses. Kelman himself went down that route for a time, but you can be fairly sure thathis books had sold like airport bestsellers, there would have been no need to find a financial cushion.In what you can only call the good old days, a young writer like Graham Greene would be given considerable leeway with his early books by a publisher confident that one day he would reward their patience. Today, there is no slack in the system, no time to nurture or take the long view. You are only as good as your last book. And in the case of someone like Kelman, whose readership is a mere fraction of those interested in serious fiction, that spells trouble.Why do most of those who leap on every title by Julian Barnes or Rose Tremain often not bother with Kelman  Undoubtedly, the furore over his Booker winner damaged his reputation, not only in the rest of the UK, but also here. Kelman, however, suspects there is a more fundamental and disturbing reason. He believes that English publishers are ldquokeeping a lid on Scottish writers, by dismissing them as a genre. They would rather publish mediocre English novelists, he says, than good Scottish ones.Read more: Kelman: British establishment is keeping a lid on Scottish writingThere are enough excellent Scottish novelists reaching print to argue that point, but for me this is a distraction from the main issue. EvenKelman is right and there is anti-Scottish bias among literary publishers, that still does not explain why no Scottish publisher is willing to take him on.Could his new book be too dficult, or tricky  It would seem strangethat were the case, given his long and distinguished backlist in which there is rarely a misfire. The answer is far more likely to be about money, and the state of the book trade in general. In other words, there is no publisher able or prepared to offer a fee commensurate with what a Kelman book is worth. Thatrsquos worth in artistic terms, you understand, not sales. I do not doubt it would be a better investment to publish Diana Gabaldonfilling the coffers is the main objective.But while the kind of books Kelman writes are unlikely to shower a publisher in gold, they would add immeasurably to its lustre. Here is a novelist who has been shortlisted for the Man Booker International Prize, and is a worthy Nobel contender. Indeed, consider this my official plea to the Nobel Prize Literature Committee to read everything Kelman has written and tell us his oeuvre does not equal or surpass many of their laureates.Yet, nobody on his doorstep wants to take his new book. Itrsquos hard to think of another country where its foremost living writer would be treated like this. The only conclusion you can come to is that the world of books has lost it.

forget.A -hour ldquomarathon of dance and memory is being staged in Findhorn, Moray, between the hours of midday and midnight in the first ever performance of its kind.Wallflower is a production from Manchester-based performance company Quarantine, which sees dancers share their personal recollections of music, fashion, culture, politics and love, from their own le experiences through the form of dance, whether dancing alone in a nightclub, dancing at the Paris Opera Ballet or dancing with a dog across a beach.First staged in Wales four years ago, the production, which features a live DJ, has toured to Canada, the Netherlands, Sweden, Ireland and England in - minute and five-hour forms.Todayrsquos half-day debut in Scotland is the longest version of the show ever mounted, with amateur and

Still,you want to offer reassurance that yoursquore well-intentioned and plain-dealing, it doesnrsquot seem sensible to branch out as a bogus psychic, one of the few lines of work that people distrust even more. Yet that was the Prime Ministerrsquos strategy on Wednesday evening, when she revealed herself in a public address as Mystic May, Mindreader.Like the late Doris Stokes communing with the aether and askingthe name Chris rings a bell with anyone in the audience, Mrs May revealed a series of revelations and occult certainties that had presumably been ulged to her by Higher Powers. MPs, she disclosed, are unworthy of your trust. ldquoAll [they] have been willing to say, she explained, ldquois what they do not want. She, by contrast, is ldquoabsolutely sure: You, the public, have had enough. Shersquos also had a ine revelation that what we donrsquot want is a second referendum, or a long delay in leaving.Some of us, blessed with extensive experience reading the newspapers, watching Sir John Curtice on the telly, and talking to people in pubs, have a dim sense that the matter is a little more complicated. Even the election of these MPs, after all, was an exercise in trying to find out what the public wants their inability to agree ndash in many cases, even with people in their own party ndash is a fair indication that the public does not possess a single view of Brexit that just happens to be identical to that of Mrs May, seer and Sybil. If you cast your mind back to the referendum, you may recall that there was a dference of opinion on whether we should leave or remain.Mrs Mayrsquos speech was, in at least one respect, illuminating. It presented in their shining glory all the characteristics that have made her one of the worst Prime Ministers ever. As well as the delusional psychic powers, it illustrated her intransigence, her authoritarian tendencies, her utter contempt for her Parliamentary colleagues, a naked populism that Pierre Poujade would have thought de trop, and total disdain for trivial obstacles such as objective reality or telling the truth.Read more: Alison Rowat: Mother of Parliaments is unfitIt may be true that therersquos precious little popular or parliamentary appetite, and no majority, for the Withdrawal Agreement, no deal, y delay, a second referendum or reversing the vote. But it is a flat lie to say MPs have been willing to say only what they donrsquot want. Theyrsquove been clamouring to say just that, and attempting to get indicative votes that might narrow the options down to what might actually get through the Commons. But theyrsquove been constantly frustrated by Mrs Mayrsquos refusal to acknowledge that anything other than her proposals should be considered.Mrs May said that she was elected to deliver what the people had decided on in the referendum. But she wasnrsquot actually elected , having thrown away the majority she inherited in what must be the most inept campaign ever staged. Only the fact that Jeremy Corbyn is even more useless than she is kept her in the job, with a majorityof precisely zero. But leave that aside.The more puzzling question is why she, a Remain voter, should think she possesses unique insight into what those who voted to leave the EU want. The options, which she refused to let anyone, evenher own Brexit secretaries, discuss or explore, were legion. Many of those who campaigned for Leave wanted, for instance, to remain in the single market ndash pointing to the Efta countries, such as Norway, or to Switzerland, with its comprehensive free trade and movement arrangements. The fact that some may now have hardened their position to argue that that is not ldquoreal Brexit is irrelevant itrsquos still leaving the EU.Instead of giving this any consideration, Mrs May set out a series of ldquored lines plucked from her own imagination, though we are now apparently expected to regard them as something along the lines of the golden tablets and rock spectacles delivered to the prophet Joseph Smith.Unsurprisingly, these did not correspond with the views of most Leave voters, who ndash despite attempts to characterise them as unormly bigoted and xenophobic ndash never once listed immigration as their first priority in any poll conducted before or after the referendum. They did, however, resemble Mrs Mayrsquos track record at the Home Office, when she was responsible for such measures as the ldquoHostile Environment and attempted to deport members of the Windrush generation who were perfectly entitled to live in the UK.Another of her priorities was the European arrest warrant and security co-operation, though she seems not to have considered the security implications for the Irish border, despite it having been the single greatest security issue for the UK for the past half-century.She has given no evidence that she understood the opportunities Brexit afforded for free trade, something which should have been given a high priority,only because of the possibility of a no-deal Brexit. Indeed, on trade issues the only impulse she has demonstrated is a willingness to cave in to rent-seekers amongst the large corporations and special interest groups.But then that is of a piece with Mrs Mayrsquos political philosophy, profoundly illiberal when it comes to regulation, immigration and human rights, and essentially left-wing on economic issues.She is a disastrous failure, not just as a Prime Minister, but as a Conservative leader. Her efforts to keep the party together have left it split more than at any time since the arguments over the repeal of the Corn Laws. Her professed Unionism has threatened both Ireland and Scotlandrsquos future in the UK.The tragedy is that,her deal goes through, it will be worse than all the other possible outcomes, andshe resigns because it fails to go through, the damage will already have been done. She may yet go down in history as an even worse PM than Lord North, who lost America. She could lose not just Europe, but the UK."},{"url":null,"title":"is-o2-down-mobile-network-investigate-uk-service-outages","story":"\"Were aware of an issue,\" the companys coverage status page reads.\"Our technical teams are investigating.

If it succeeds, then a debate and vote on finding a way forward to break the Brexit deadlock would take place on Wednesday.It is suggested that as many as  ministers, including several Cabinet ministers, are prepared to defy Mrs May and leave the Governmentshe tries to block them from participating in a free vote on other options. The ministers are said to include Amber Rudd, David Mundell, Greg Clark and David Gauke, who rebelled against the PM by abstaining in last weekrsquos whipped vote to reject a bid to rule out a no-deal Brexit.Read more:Article  petition: Three million back calls to stop BrexitThe options on an alternative would include: Labourrsquos customs union plan a Norway-style withdrawal a Peoplersquos Vote second referendum a no-deal and revoking Article , that is, scrapping Brexit altogether.Mr Benn, who chairs the Commons Brexit Committee, said: \"We need to open up this process because we have rejected her deal, weve rejected no-deal, the EU has decided to give us a little more time and weve really got to get on with it.\"Tory MP Nick Boles, who is pushing for a softer, Norway-style Brexit, said: \"Frankly, at this point MPs need to start taking responsibility for the national interest and ignoring the whipthe whip is one that is profoundly contrary to the national interest.\"I hope that many of my colleagues, both in and out of Government, will actually look at the proposals we present to them on Monday and then on Wednesday and decide whether they believe in good conscience they can oppose them and I hope that many of them will conclude whatever the whip says they need to vote for them.\"Following the European Council when, after hours of wrangling, the EU took control of the Brexit timetable offering two options to the UK: agree the PMrsquos deal next week and have an extension until May  fail to agree and have an extension until April , the legal deadline by which Britain will have to decideit wants to participate in the May European elections.If, as is still expected, MPs reject the PMrsquos plan, then the Commons will have until April  to agree on an alternative. If they do, then the EU will offer an extended extension in which to get a new deal and Britain will take part in the Euro pollthey do not, then the country will leave the EU without a deal in three weeksrsquo time.Following herfrom the EU summit, Downing Street insisted the PM was \"absolutely determined\" to end the uncertainty over Brexit.Mrs May has already been talking to ministers to try to garner enough support for a last-ditch bid to get her deal through the Commons next week.\"There is now a clear point of decision, declared her spokesman. ldquoIf we are able to have a successful vote next week, then we can pass the necessary legislation for ratying the agreement and we can, as a country, be outside the European Union two months today.ldquoThe Prime Minister is absolutely determined to try to end the uncertainty and deliver clarity for the country and for employers.\"Mrs May said at a late-night press conference in Brussels that she would be bringing back her Brexit deal for a third \"meaningful vote\" next week. But No  has not said on which day the vote would take place but her spokesman said it was important there was a \"realistic prospect of success\".Tory backbencher Michael Fabricant expressed disappointment that the UK was not leaving the EU on March , saying: \"Even the Bank of England now say that a no-deal Brexit is workable given the tranche of legislation that has been passed since November on both sides of the Channel.\"He added: \"At this dficult time we need a Churchill, not a Chamberlain.\"His Conservative colleague Steve Double claimed Mrs May was now \"isolated\" within the party and called on her to consider her position.\"Although she has been clearly let down and undermined by a number of her Cabinet, ultimately the main responsibility for where we are today is hers.\"Mr Double said Mrs May was unable to maintain collective responsibility after two-thirds of \"her own parliamentary party voted against a motion [on extending Article ] that she put to the House\".ldquoIt is quite clear that she is not leading her party. She is isolated, sadly, from a majority of the parliamentary party now. We need to find a way forward and that requires new leadership.\"I know that many people feel that next week is a defining moment and I would very much hope that she would reflect on her position. We have got to, as a party, reunite and I dont think we can do that around her leadership. I will be among many in the parliamentary party giving her a very clear message,\" he added.One senior Conservative backbencher said the PMrsquos chances of getting her deal through next week were slim.\"Its very unlikely that shell get her deal through next week. I dont think theres a majority for it. Unless she pulls a rabbit out of the hat over the weekend and secures the support of  or  Labour MPs, I dont see how she can get it through.He questioned whether replacing the PM was practical at this stage of the Brexit process. \"I have no particular desire to see Theresa May step down, partly because I am by no means convinced that her stepping down is going to have any positive impact at all, because we need to find a replacement.\"It wouldnt be a replacement from six leisurely weeks of a Conservative Party leadership election, it would have to be one the following morning where is that going to come from  he asked."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/9610133.jpg?type=article-full","title":"mp-calls-on-prime-minister-to-act-over-clydeside-toxic-land","story":"Ged Killen,has called on the UK Government to give a commitment that EU funding used by regeneration agency Clyde Gateway to remediate and redevelop contaminated land in areas of Rutherglen and Cambuslang will be protected post-Brexit.Officials have long known massive concentrations of cancer-causing Chromium-VI - the poison made famous by the Hollywood movie Erin Brockovich - were buried under Glasgow and South Lanarkshire.In a briefing to MPs, MSPs and councillors, executives at regeneration agency Clyde Gateway have confirmed the deposits are leaching in to the west of Scotlandrsquos river system ldquowhenever it rains.They stressed, ldquothe nature of the contamination poses immediate or long-term risks to human health and the environment through land, surface water or groundwater pollution..bc-player-iAIgYhFQ_default .vjs-tech .bc-player-iAIgYhFQ_default .vjs-playlist-description .vjs-big-play-button .vjs-mouse.vjs-playlist .vjs-playlist cite .vjs-mouse.vjs-playlist time cite.vjs-playlist-name .story-credits #liveMultiHide .vjs-dock-description .vjs-playlist-thumbnail  * Style the overlay *  * Hide the overlay * -countdown display: none-overlay display: none * Style the overlay * .vjs-overlay,.vjs-overlay.vjs-overlay-top position: absolutetop: pxleft: px.vjs-overlay p width: pxbackground-color: #color: #fffpadding: pxpadding-left: px !importantmargin: margin-left:  !importantmargin-bottom: border-radius: pxtext-align: left.popout-player position: relativewidth: pxmargin-bottom: pxtransition-property: alltransition-duration: mstransition-timing-: ease-in-out.bc-outer position: relative.bc-inner left: %top: %transform: translateposition: absolutewidth: pxheight: pxcolor: blackdisplay: blockbackground-color: whiteopacity: .font-family: VideoJStext-align: center.bc-inner:hover cursor: pointeropacity: ..bc-inner-font font-size: px width\"%\"data-account\"\"data-player\"iAIgYhFQ\"data-embed\"default\"data-popout\"\"data-autoplay\"\"data-multimedia-block\"\"data-video-id\"\"class\"video-js\"playsinlinedata-random-id\"\" mutedcontrolsIt came after an entire stream, the Polmadie Burn, turned bright green last month in a tell tale symptom of toxic pollution from waste containing chromium-VI or chromium ore processing residue, Clyde Gateway has been working in the area for  years and so far has received pound million in EU funding as well as support from the Scottish Government and South Lanarkshire Council.Mr Killen, the MPfor Rutherglen and Hamilton West has called for action at Prime Ministerrsquos Questions wanted Theresa May to guarantee that the UK government will replace any EU funding that may be lost as a result of the UK leaving the European Union.He said: ldquoThe historic issue of chromium contamination caused by JJ Whitersquos Chemical Factory across Rutherglen and Cambuslang is not a new, but it does still pose a serious public health risk and we need assurances that every effort will be made to complete remediation work as soon as possible.Water running green in March .

Will she use her office to ensure that the potential for marine renewable energy generation is fully recognised when that white paper comes to publication #Responding on behalf of the government the energy minister, Claire Perry MP, said: “I don’t want to pre-empt the white paper, but one of the things we will show in that is how the ongoing attempts to be technology neutral to try and work across the piece to generate low cost, low carbon and highly competitive technologies will be part of that. We remain interested in marine and tidal as the Rt. Hon. Gentleman knows. Of course we need to discuss with the Treasury any support mechanisms, but I do want to continue to engage with the sector on a long term basis.#Speaking after the exchange, Mr Carmichael added: “White papers outline government’s thinking on policy areas, and are a key stage in influencing decisions made by ministers. Getting something in the white paper on support for the wave and tidal energy would be a huge coup for the industry which is big in the Northern Isles.“The marine energy industry is an innovative area of research, with the potential to add even more to our ability to export renewable energy to mainland Scotland. If the minister is committed to what she said about the policy now being ‘technology neutral’ then marine renewables should get a fair chance to be heard.“With a little more understanding and investment from central government, I believe we will soon reach a point where this industry can support itself, and provide stable, well paid and skilled jobs for many in Orkney and Shetland.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

In the s, his predecessors in the conservative government then regarded our fishermen as expendable. It is beginning to look like this government has taken the same attitude towards our farmers.”Responding on behalf of the government parliamentary under-secretary of state for exiting the European Union, Chris Heaton-Harris MP, replied: “I disagree entirely. The tarf schedule is designed to protect every sector of the economy including agriculture. He then went on to talk about standards, and we are not dropping standards of what we expect in agricultural goods.”Speaking after the exchange, Mr Carmichael added: “The minister can disagree with me all he wants, but he can’t dismiss the views of our farmers and crofters. They know what they are talking about and have genuine concerns about whether food standards will be eroded as a result of cheaper imports. The government must start listening to the experts in this area, and the unions who work on their behalf otherwise we risk undermining an important part of our rural economy.“With only nine days left before we could find ourselves falling into a no deal scenario, the government have got to fix these tarf schedules before they do irreparable damage to our agriculture industry.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

However, Prospect has indicated that this would not be its members’ preferred option and it does not believe it would address their underlying pay issues.“As it stands the claim from the trade union remains a minimum of a double-digit increase effective from April , . A report compiled jointly between HIAL and Prospect on air traffic controller pay at non-HIAL airports found no evidence of a signicant pay dferential with other comparable airports.“At this point, it has not been possible to reach an agreement with the trade union on their pay dispute. Therefore, HIAL and Prospect have agreed to refer the matter to ACAS in a bid to resolve the matter.”However, David Avery, Prospect negotiations officer replied: #Members demands are reasonable and they need to be addressed. They are not seeking parity with Heathrow or Gatwick but other smaller airports.#“They have received a decade of below inflation pay rises while the rest of the industry, in response to a global shortage of controllers, has moved ahead. The company already struggles to recruit controllers and this is having an impact on services at some airports.“By asking for support from ACAS we hope to find a way forward in these talks.

He set out that, between -, tourism numbers have increased by an impressive  per cent to almost , people with an estimated value of nearly £m.Mr McArthur warned that this success could not be taken for granted and presented its own challenges. As well as urging ministers to resolve the stand-off over RET and provide support for the replacement Orkney’s ageing internal ferry fleet, the Orkney MSP also repeated his call for Orkney’s world-class heritage sites to be backed by world-class infrastructure.Speaking after the debate, he said: #Tourism is one of the few sectors that touches almost every part of the country and it is one where Orkney has been punching above its weight over recent years.#With the natural assets we have and a lot of hard work by those involved in all aspects of the tourism sector locally, Orkney has seen visitor numbers and income increase signicantly over recent years. This success has brought awards and recognition, but it also brings with it challenges.#Everyone knows that Orkney’s reputation for quality requires the tourist experience to be managed carefully. This will involve taking pressure off key sites as well as making more of what Orkney has to offer.#It also needs Scottish Government to step up to the plate, not least when it comes to transport links. The long-overdue introduction of RET would help Orkney remain competitive as a destination, while replacement of the ageing internal ferry fleet is not only vital for the islands they serve but a means of encouraging visitors to explore more widely once they get here.“Ministers also have a role to play, through Historic Environment Scotland, in helping ensure that Orkney’s world-class heritage sites are supported by high-quality infrastructure. Local partners, including Destination Orkney and the Council, must be closely involved but investment through HES is crucial to making this happen.“There is good reason to believe that Orkney can continue playing to its strengths when it comes to tourism and there will be plenty of opportunities over the years ahead showcase our islands.  However, we cannot be complacent about what it will take to maintain and enhance Orkney’s reputation for good quality”.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The partial-asset value of Scottish natural capital was estimated to be £ billion –  per cent of the UK as a whole – in .The study found renewable energy is the fastest-growing natural resource consumed in Scotland, while oil and gas production has halved in less than two decades. Electricity generated from renewable sources was five times higher in  than at the turn of the millennium and now accounts for more than half of all the country’s energy production. Wind is the largest producer of electricity from renewable sources, overtaking hydropower as the main source of renewable energy in . It accounted for  per cent of the electricity generated from renewables up to .Oil and gas production has steadily fallen since , dropping  per cent in less than two decades. In , combined oil and gas production in Scotland was \u2028. million tonnes of oil equivalent, down from \u2028. million tonnes.The Scottish Natural Capital Accounts report said: “The benefits we receive from nature are predominantly hidden, partial or missing from the nation’s balance sheet.

But when the guy propping up the bar is Theresa May’s top Europe advisor, Olly Robbins – the architect of her strategy in Brussels and the ERG’s favourite hate figure – you should safely be able to draw your Brexit roadmap from it.When ITV reported a second-hand overheard conversation in a Brussels bar where Robbins described how MPs would end up being presented with the option of May’s Brexit deal or a long delay, it seemed to offer a key that would unlock the whole process of leaving the EU.After MPs voted against no-deal last week and for an extension to Article , events appeared to be following Robbins’ script perfectly. The Government had hoped to bring the deal back for a third vote this week, with the threat of ­staying in the EU for anywhere between nine and  months looming over Brexiteers, forcing them to fall into line. Personally, I admit to breathing a sigh of relief at the end of last week’s chaos, thinking that a plan was coming together.But nothing has been more corrosive over the past three years than the illusion of government ­control, and some forces are beyond even Robbins’ reckoning. The fact that his plan was so dramatically derailed this week means that a no-deal Brexit – always the legal default – could now happen by ­accident, unless there is an even ­bigger twist in the week ahead.Rather than taking back control, the events of the past week put May’s fate in the hands of either the EU, or pro-EU Tories who could oust her to defeat her Brexit vision.: No-deal Brexit would place food banks in ‘dangerous position’, warns Ian BlackfordNo one in Government predicted John Bercow’s intervention ­ruling out a third vote on the Brexit deal unless there was a signicant change in content or circumstances. That in itself is worrying – the convention that motions can’t be voted on twice in the parliamentary session isn’t an obscure one. No one needs more evidence that Downing Street is floundering, but there it is.His critics say Bercow’s intervention was an attempt to block Brexit and allow the second EU referendum he really wants, or at least rule out a no-deal scenario. By ruling out a vote before yesterday’s EU Council summit, the ­Commons Speaker certainly denied the ­Government its best chance of ­getting the deal through.Bercow’s statement forced the EU Commission’s chief Brexit ­negotiator Michel Barnier to come out the following day and say a long extension needed a “clear purpose”. It also gave time for ­Brexiteers in the Cabinet to ambush May and force her to take a request for a long extension off the table.The spectre aimed at scaring Brexiteers was vanquished, ­leaving opposition MPs as the only pool of votes to pass the deal. May’s extraordinary statement in Downing Street, shting the blame onto parliament, burnt that bridge, too.With ious extension plans being discussed during intense talks in Brussels last night, EU leaders appear to have come to the conclusion that May, and her deal, are finished.If she isn’t in control, to avoid a no-deal Brexit the UK is now in the hands of two groups: Remainers in the Cabinet, and the  governments of the EU.A group of pro-EU Cabinet ­ministers have insisted they would do whatever it takes to stop no-deal. They may now have the time to show they mean it.Both Barnier and French president Emmanuel Macron have said there is a way back,the UK is ready for “deep political change”.This could be a general election or a second EU referendum, but what the EU really wants to hear is that the red lines that have made a deal so dficultare going to be jettisoned, either by May, or her successor.The Remain group in Cabinet includes Scottish Secretary David Mundell, who joined Amber Rudd, Greg Clarke and David Gauke in breaking a three-line whip to abstain on a motion to extend Article  last week. With so little time left, resignation isn’t enough. They would have to become the ‘men and women in grey suits’, insisting the Prime Minister abandons her red lines, or ushering her out of ­Downing Street.The likes of David Lidington would need to lead a government of national unity in all but name, getting a Brexit deal through with Labour and SNP votes that keeps the UK in the single market and customs union. It would likely mean the end of the Conservative Party as we know it at the very least, it would leave it to the next Tory leader to put its surviving pieces back together.: Jeremy Corbyn won’t rule out stopping Brexit as PM arrives in BrusselsEven in Brexit Britain, a week can’t possibly hold that much drama, but a longer extension offers the opportunity.Still, EU leaders can’t give the UK something it isn’t prepared to ask for itself. Conservative MPs lost the chance to push May from office when they failed to do the job before Christmas. The UK’s venerable ­parliamentary democracy has shown itself not to be nimble enough for the last-minute pivot needed, and evenit could, its leaders command too little confidence to bring the public along with them.In EU capitals, an election or a new EU referendum looks like a leap into more uncertainty, which the ­continent scarcely needs. Leaders and officials gathered in Brussels spoke openly about the “crisis” in the UK, and don’t want their fragile politics infected by the febrile mood around Westminster.A no deal Brexit could still happen by accident. The only thing that’s certain is that Bercow and the EU have called time on Robbins’ pub blueprint.©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"why scotland s roads aren t ready for electric scooters alastair dalton","story":"Electric scooters are common in parts of Europe and the US and the UK Government is considering whether to allow them on British roads. Alastair Dalton explains why that would be a mistake.They offer a potentially attractive new way of getting about – but also threaten chaos on Scotland’s car-centric road networks.Electric scooters are commonplace in some European countries and US states, and the UK Government is now considering whether to allow them here too.Ministers announced this week they will “consider options for appropriate testing regimes to ensure any such vehicles on the road are safe and fit for purpose”, which could be followed by localised trials.On the face of it, being able to hop on and effortlessly zip about our towns and cities has obvious appeal – especially to non-cyclists.It is hardly “active travel”, like walking and cycling, but could encourage some to switch from cars or taxis on short journeys.Anything electrically powered, which has no emissions on the street, also has to be a positive as part of efforts to cut urban air pollution.However, letting loose a new form of transport on roads still woefully unsuited for cycles could just make things worse for everyone.That’s not to say there’s not a case for them – but the radical redrawing of road space away from the car should be accelerated first.The brave would take their chances scooting among other traffic, though many are likely to be deterred from sharing roads with lorries, buses and taxis, let alone the cars who already pass cyclists intimidatingly close.: Electric scooters on British roads would create ‘dangerous cocktail’There’s also the small matter of scooters’ in wheels not being pothole friendly, causing discomfortnot danger, as shared transport group Comouk has highlighted.Most who scoot are likely to want to stick to the relative safety of pavements and cycle lanes –that is permitted. But here, a dferent risk is created, of scooters colliding with pedestrians.There are far too few cycle lanes they could use, on roads or pavements, and even fewer segregated lanes, albeit cities like Glasgow are adding more.In addition, there is already potential conflict between walkers and cyclists on shared paths, some of which would struggle to cope with more riders, let alone scooters too.Another concern is street clutter. Recent visitors to Berlin and Brussels tell me of large numbers of scooters strewn across pavements.Technology may now enable scooters to be left “dockless”, but this has caused a big problem in places like San Diego.It’s bad enough trying to negotiate pavements already littered with advertising A-boards, so this could cause another hazard.Karen Millhouse, a resident of the Calornian city, emailed me this week: “I think we have more than , dockless scooters in our fair city, and they just keep coming. It is a nightmare, especially for pedestrians and the disabled.”She said Disability Rights Calornia had even filed a class action against scooters blocking pavements.: Alastair Dalton: The ‘electric-bike smile’ is now officialA better plan for Scotland – and the UK – would be to focus on electric bikes first. The main rental schemes in Edinburgh and Glasgow are due to add them later this year, along with other parts of Scotland such as Stirling.Electric bikes are equally effortless to ride, but unlike scooters provide nearly as much exercise as traditional cycling, so have much more to commend them.They also encourage people to cycle further, and have a similar topspeed – mph – as has been proposed for scooters.©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"brexit how the flextension deal was reached and what happens now","story":"Sorry, were having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...EU leaders stepped in to tell Theresa May what would happenher own MPs voted against her Brexit deal, explains Paris Gourtsoyannis. But what happens next is still up in the airThe UK may have just taken part in its last EU Council summit, and the symbolism was inflicted on the British press pack. Its usual seats at the heart of the summit press hall were snapped up by Chinese journalists in Brussels as Xi Jinping tours Europe. The EU wanted to talk about its bright future - those writing about the awkward present were shunted into a hot, stuffy side room.Right up to the moment Theresa May sat down to ask them for a Brexit extension, EU leaders had talked tough: any delay would have conditions, and would be final. Take it or leave it - we’re washing our hands.But during a  minute grilling, the Prime Minister failed to convince them she had any clear plan of what to doher deal was voted down by MPs again next week. So EU leaders stepped in and wrote one for her.: Brexit: Theresa May’s ‘job on the line’ as Tories lose patienceThe EU took another five hours to hammer out the ‘flextension’ agreed late on Thursday night, with leaders tearing up their own proposal and getting stuck into the drafting of a new one. In the back and forth, several dferent suggestions leaked out over the course of the evening.In the end, it was Brexit that pushed China off the agenda, with talks over dinner replaced by more wrangling about Article . May had been due to eat with fellow leaders instead, summit organisers offered to send the menu of lentil and langoustine terrine and roasted duckling over for her to eat alone.The UK’s future was set without its Prime Minister in the room, not because EU bureaucrats wanted it that way, but because its own government offered no alternative.A no deal Brexit remains a strong possibility, and the EU has designed a scheme that seeks to leave it out of the blame game that would follow. It gives pro-EU forces in parliament two extra weeks to mobilise, and left the door open to a long delaythey can agree on a clear alternative to the Prime Minister’s deal.One of the most signicant things to emerge overnight was how open EU Council President Donald Tusk was about his desire to see the UK change its mind on Brexit.“I am very satisfied, especially that we still have so many options open,” he said in a midnight press conference, adding with a smile: “You know what my personal view is on this.” He later went even further in a briefing with Polish media, saying he wanted the UK to “consider all possible options” - which include revoking Article .The question now is what parliament does with its two week window. Next week, MPs will mount yet another bid to take control of the order paper, so that they can finally vote on alternatives to the government’s Brexit deal. A softer exit inside the single market and customs union, and a second EU referendum are likely to feature. The government will try to bring back its deal, but few have any expectation it will succeed.Meanwhile at Westminster, calls from her own party for the Prime Minister to step aside continue to grow. It may have only been Theresa May’s last Brussels summit.©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"traitor to england ian blackford harassed by brexit supporters in london","story":"Sorry, were having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...The SNP#s Westminster leader Ian Blackford was harassed by a group of Brexit supporters who shouted abuse at him as he walked down Whitehall.Mr Blackford and fellow SNP MP Stephen Gethins were leaving the Cabinet Office shortly after pm following a meeting to discuss Brexit with minister David Lidington.window.twttr : Brexit: EU leaders open door to long delay as May fails to set out plan B.\u2028A group of around a dozen people followed Mr Blackford, shouting “traitor to England” and “leave means leave”.Media interviews that were scheduled to take place outside the Cabinet Office had to be abandoned.

There were reports that  pro-EU ministers, including Scottish Secretary David Mundell, were prepared to quit“indicative votes” are not held.MPs were expected to try and force a series of votes on Brexit alternatives next week, but two ministers said they expected the government to offer Parliament a say.And in meetings with opposition figures including the SNP’s Westminster leader Ian Blackford, the Prime Minister’s deputy, Cabinet Office minister David Lidington, is understood to have set out plans for votes on up to seven dferent options for Brexit. Mrs May agreed an extension to Article  of at least two weeks in late-night talks in Brussels on Thursday, opening the door for MPs to demand a change of course.Brexit minister Kwasi Kwarteng said he would “be surprised”the government did not allow MPs a free voteindicative votes are brought forward. And the Business Secretary Greg Clarke said the government would “facilitate” votes to allow “Parliament to express a majority of what it would approve”.Former Brexit minister Steve Baker said indicative votes meant “national humiliation is imminent”, while fellow Tory Brexiteer Mark Francois said: “If there is no government position on any of those issues about the future of our country, then there isn’t really a government.”Tory MP Nick Boles, who quit his local party to avoid probable deselection over his campaign for a soft Brexit, suggested colleagues should ignore the government’s orders about how to votethey were “not in the national interest”.There were reports that the chairman of the backbench  Committee, Sir Graham Brady, visited Mrs May in No  on Monday to warn of growing discontent after being “bombarded” with texts from MPs calling for her to quit.Downing Street would not be drawn on when the Prime Minister intends to bring her deal back to the Commons for a third vote next week.The DUP appeared to end any hopes of the deal passing in a damning statement from the party’s Westminster leader, Nigel Dodds, who said Mrs May had been “far too willing to capitulate before securing the necessary changes which would get an agreement through the House of Commons”. He said: “The Prime Minister missed an opportunity at the EU Council to put forward proposals which could have improved the prospects of an acceptable withdrawal agreement. That failure is all the more inexcusable given the clear isions which became evident amongst EU member states when faced with outcomes they don’t like.”Having agreed an extension that leaves the door open to the UK staying in the EU for longer, European leaders warned they were still prepared to let the UK crash out without a deal. French president Emmanuel Macron said the EU will “not remain hostage to Brexit”. He also renewed attacks on Brexit campaigners, saying: “They told the people, ‘It’ll be easy, it’ll be quick! There were a lot of lies.”©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"royal mile treasure trove of mary queen of scots documents found","story":"Sorry, were having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...A treasure trove of documents signed by Mary Queen of Scots and revealing the #everyday reality of ruling the country# in the th century has been unearthed in a council storage facility on the Royal Mile.A haul of handwritten papers is said to show the doomed monarch “carefully managing the busy commercial le of Edinburgh”, as well as authorising the building of new defences for the city in Leith.The documents, which are set to be the centrepiece of a new exhibition in Edinburgh on Mary’s short-lived rule, have already been conserved and digitised to allow them to be viewed publicly on the council’s online archive. They were discovered by staff in a store at the Museum of Edinburgh, just a few hundred yards away from the Palace of Holyroodhouse, where Mary ruled for six years after ing from France in . The  documents, which are inidually dated, numbered and signed, relate to the rights of deacons and tradesmen in the city, the selling of meat at the Tolbooth and the making of salt in Newhaven.Early conservation work on the documents, which were recently discovered in the Museum of Edinburgh’s own storage facility off the Canongate, has revealed watermarks – one of a goat and another of a flower – which can only been seen when held up to light.It is thought the papers entered the archives of the local authority in the s, but were then “lost” before being rediscovered nearly a century later during conservation work. Intriguingly, some of the documents signed by Mary date from when she was still in France.Experts in the council’s museums and galleries service, which is responsible for the official archives of the city, said the recently unearthed documents revealed an “often overlooked “ aspect of her le.History curator Vicky Garrington said: “Together, the documents shed light on a key part of Scotland’s past. We all know the tragic story of Mary Queen of Scots, her eventful le and eventual execution in , but in these documents we see a dferent side to Mary.“Here, she can be seen carefully managing the everyday affairs of Edinburgh, both from France and Scotland. It’s fascinating to think of her reading through these official papers before carefully applying her signature.“They are staying in storage at the museum for now. But we hope to have them assessed by a conservator and for further research to be done on them by experts on Mary, after which we hope to exhibit them, which will be hugely exciting.”Museums and galleries manager Frank Little said: “We’re constantly reviewing, caring for and researching our collections, and look forward to sharing more of the city’s rich heritage with residents and visitors through our programme of exhibitions and online activities.” Council culture convener Donald Wilson said: “Our museums and galleries hold thousands of historic treasures, many of which are on display in our venues.

They then went on to highlight some of the key tenets underpinning the debate such as trade agreements, law and immigration, before making their concluding statements.In the opening gambit for the pro-Brexit team, S pupil Abbi Morgan argued that leaving the EU #would be a hugely positive thing for the UK# and would allow the country to #take control of borders and create worldwide trade agreements#.She went on to add that it would put the UK in a position to #take back its sovereignty# and make its own decisions on important matters. She stated that as a net contributor to the EU, the UK would be better off by £. billion.In the opening address for the pro-EU team, Lois Langlandssaid that #history and past experience as a member of the EU# gave the UK a more secure position for the future and that, in leaving the European Union, the UK would #enter the unknown# and #walk into the future blindfolded#.She said that outside the EU the UK was a #small fish in a big pond# and asked why any country would be interested in providing a free trade agreement with the UK.#The EU as an organisation is extremely wasteful#, he said. #Every  days the European Parliament moves from Brussels to Strasbourg, where it sits for four days # this is estimated to cost nearly £ million a year.#Touching on the issues of freedom of movement as part of the remain team, Chiara MacLeansaid: #Once the UK leaves the EU, British citizens will become third-party nationals, with no automatic right of admission.# She added that, through the new European travel information and authorisation system, all UK nationals over  years of age #would have to pay money to go somewhere they had a free right to go now#.Seth Bennettook up the reins for the pro-Brexit side, arguing that in terms of laws and immigration the EU could pass any laws they wanted and in by doing so #strip Britain of its sovereignty# # which he described as #one of its driving forces#.He believed that Brexit would offer the UK the chance to #increase its spending in education and housing# which could perhaps lead to a #revival of the nation#s once-thriving industries#.Speaking for the pro-EU team, Gracie Buchan said that leaving the European Union would lead to a trade deficit and result in a shortage of daily supplies such as fruit and vegetables.#Keeping food shop shelves full and prices down will be one of the biggest challenges when Brexit comes around,# she said. #Failure to reach some sort of an agreement could see retailers face an average increase of  per cent, particularly in dairy, meat, veg, and fruit.#Closing for the Brexit side, S pupil Joseph Moller said the EU favoured its own agenda and that in terms of per head of population Maltese citizens had  times more representation than UK nationals.He added that, rather than the , jobs that were cited as potentially being lost due to Brexit, the level of employment had in fact risen by one per cent since the referendum and unemployment was at its lowest level since the s.Summing up for remain, S pupil Innes MacNeil said: #Latest reports suggest that deals have been struck with just seven out of  countries, we have gained a lot more than we have spent on the EU, and multinational companies are threatening to relocate overseas, affecting jobs and investments.#Exiting in less than  days# time without any sound withdrawal agreement and just a few trade relationships will result in uncertainty and chaos.#The judges said they were impressed by how confident and informed the pupils were. They also felt the pupils were cohesive as a team and said that they saw some future MSPs and MPs.In the end, the judges awarded the team speaking against Brexit  points while the side advocating Brexit received  to claim victory.Skye, Lochaber, and Badenoch MSP Kate Forbes and Highland and Islands MSP Edward Mountain both fielded questions on Brexit after the debate and were quick to praise the pupils for their efforts.Ms Forbes said: #I certainly think they could have resolved Brexit faster than some of the politicians today # an absolutely fantastic debate based on fact, evidence, respect for each other, lots of confidence. I think I have left with a few top tips for my next debate in parliament!#Mr Mountain added: #I thought it was quite excellent # there#s obviously a lot of research gone into it.

From pizzas to lasagne and pasta, there looked to be something for everyone, with gluten-free options also available.Before we had made our choice, we were presented with a large plate of Italian antipasti – basically a mixture of famous Italian nibbles. Much to my surprise, this is a complimentary touch from the Balmoral on the Italian night, designed to delve you into the full authentic Italian experience straight away.I gazed excitedly at my partner across the table. Where would we start  There were sticks of garlic bread, doughballs, pepperoni, olives and a pasta salad. Add in some jalapenos, peppers with a mouth-watering vinaigrette and mozzarella, it was a sublime clash of flavours which made me feel right in… well Italy! It reminded me much like a version of Spanish Tapas or Chinese Dim Sum which allows for iety and quantity of dferent options. With quality too, the night was off to a flyer with this beautul antipasti starter.On to the main course and after the wonderful starter, me and my partner could not wait for it to arrive. We both went for pizza, and to be honest it would be hard not to given the mouth-watering choices on the menu. A superb handcrafted gourmet pizza range, inidually designed with the finest ingredients for your own authentic taste of Italy – it was simply a no-brainer.After much deliberation, I opted for the BBQ Pizza, which consisted of a BBQ sauce base, mozzarella, chorizo, peri-peri chicken, jalapenos, onions and sweetcorn. Drizzled with just amount the peri-peri sauce, it was a concoction of flavours. A thin-base is always a must for me in order to properly enjoy what is actually on the pizza, instead of having to chew excessive amounts of pizza dough and again this pizza ticked all the right boxes. A BBQ-base and chicken on a pizza is nothing out of the ordinary on a pizza menu but this one was unique, given the intense flavour from the peri-peri sauce. This pizza would put some “Italian” pizza takeaways to shame, quite frankly. It was that good.Across the table, my partner, who is a vegetarian is no stranger to a good old pizza, after all it is entirely possible to enjoy the classic Italian dish without any meat at all. The menu includes a fantastic make-your-own option from an ingredient list with everything you can think of on it, allowing you to be as adventurous as you like. She went for a classic tomato base complete with mozzarella and a generous helping of sweetcorn, peppers and jalapenos. The pizza looked like a veggie’s delight and again it could not be faulted. Not too heavy on the stomach and full of flavour, it was little surprise she deliberately wanted to keep a few slices to take home.The pizzas also allow for additional sides, and it wouldn’t be an Italian night without some Garlic Bread. I simply adore anything garlic and this was what garlic bread should be like – oozing with garlic butter as it was torn apart, you could tell it was handcrafted and homemade to perfection. Our additional side of garlic potatoes also trumped the other side options of skinny fries or a tossed salad. It was a carbs heaven evening overall but worth it for the quality and taste of the food we enjoyed.A packed Tuesday night in the Lady Anne Bistro could only mean other diners, like ourselves, were enjoying the authentic Italian-themed menu on offer. It was something very unique and to their credit, the wonderful team of chefs and staff at the Balmoral are pulling it off to perfection. Most of the pizzas are priced around the £ mark which is more than worth it, just think how expensive it can be to order a takeaway from some well-known establishments. The Balmoral Hotel is excelling and the Italian-themed night is just the latest incentive to what is a fantastic establishment. Warm and friendly staff, quality food and best of all, it’s right on your doorstep. I could not recommend the Italian night anymore. Go and check it out for yourself and tell me you don’t feel like you have been to Italy for the night. I cannot wait to plan my next Tuesday nightvisit.Balmoral Hotel,Blacks Road, Dunmurry, Belfast BT NFTel:    balmoralhotelbelfast.co.u"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"butsy was larger than life and loved by many","story":"BORN on September   the late Pat ‘Butsy’ Butler has been described as a “larger than le figure” and“someone who was known and loved by many”.Pat, who passed away on December  , was educated at St Teresa’s Primary School on the Glen Road, before moving to St Malachy’s College where he completed his secondary education. The Glen Road man’s first job was as a compositor printer with Pitman’s University Press. However, during these early working days, he undertook voluntary youth work within the greater West Belfast area and soon realised that this was where his future lay. Eventually Pat left Belfast for Leicester University where he achieved his degree in youth and social care, following this up with a Master’s degree from the Ulster University. Pat eventually became a youth worker in charge at St Michael’s Youth Club, Finaghy Road North, where he spent many happy years. During this time, Pat managed a number of the youth football teams, with home games being played at Woodlands playing fields. Pat’s brothers commented that to say he was “vocerous” in his coaching would be an “understatement”. “In fact the story goes that at this time, house prices in Orchardville depreciated by  per cent!”At a time when West Belfast was often in turmoil, the youth club was a haven for young people a place where parents knew their children would be safe. Pat took this onboard and enabled the young people in his care to reach their full potential. Pat developed an insatiable love for sport from a very early age. He joined Davitt’s GAC for a short time before transferring to St Agnes’ where he spent many happy years as both a player and manager. In the course of his time with the ‘Aggies’ Pat, along with many of the players, made those never to be forgotten trips to the continent and of course Shannon events that proved to be hugely enjoyable and deeply spitural ventures. A serious arm break when he was  curtailed Pat’s playing career but he had much success in his managerial roles. Pat, affectionately known as Butsy, also loved soccer and had a long and enjoyable time playing for and supporting Dominic Savio. During the ’s, Pat embraced the basketball scene and in particular St Gall’s basketball club. Pat was committed totally to this new undertaking. In fact, his brother Gerard remembers ing back to Denewood one day and discovering a very large American making himself a cup of tea. Of course Pat had not told Gerard that ‘Soupy’ Campbell would be staying for a few days – a bit of a shock. As a commentator and administrator Pat gave  per cent to this new venture. His famous commentary during lives games in the Andersonstown Leisure Centre is still talked about.On the sporting front, Pat finally finished up as a member of Falls Bowling Club where he spent many happy years as a player, administrator and advisor to the long suffering groundsman. Pat eventually became the club president, something of which he was particular proud of. He also became president of the private greens – a role which again Pat embraced with diligence and total commitment. A spokesperson for Falls Bowling Club described Pat, their th President, as someone with a personality that “could fill the Waterfront Hall”. “His passing has left a gap that we will not attempt to fill.”Married to Shelia since August  , Pat lived le to the full, had a hugely positive influence on many and ultimately made a dference. He will be sorely missed by all who knew him."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"history man joes lifetime in community","story":"HAVING been involved in community development for the best part of three decades, Joe Baker is a familiar face to many in North Belfast, but he is probably most recognised as one of the city’s leading resident historians.Joe has been involved with the Ashton Community Trust virtually since its inception in the early-s and now sits on its board. It was also during that time that he became involved in the Belfast History Project.Throughout his career, Joe has written, and published, books, magazines and newspaper articles for a range of media outlets during his career but, unlike some historians, his expertise grew outside the confines of traditional academia.By his own admission, he didn’t do too well at school, often “forgetting” to get off the bus at the gate. However, after ing to education at the Belfast College of Business Studies in the late s, he enrolled in history classes, which he would go on to utilise with the fledgling Belfast History Project.“I came back from college and started to get people involved in learning about the history of the area,” he explained.“From that, we discussed a number of dferent ideas. One idea we had worked on before that was cleaning up Clton Street Cemetery – which was where we used to drink our cider. It was all overgrown and wrecked at the time, but we all got together to fix it up. We tied in with people like Enterprise Ulster, and then Belfast City Council took it over and a number of volunteers came on board. Through that we developed this interest in local history.“Once the ball started rolling that was it. We started doing dferent educational projects. One of the things we started to discuss was putting a magazine together, which sounds very easy, but at that time there was this new thing coming out called a computer that you had to learn to use. Then you had to learn the computer programmes, which in those days was Pagemaker. Then you had to learn about printing and all the rest of it. Once we go up and running everything just fell into place.”The Belfast History Project has been exemplary in its endeavours, setting up groundbreaking publications and establishing history tours in long-unexplored areas of the city.“One of the good things is that when you look in Belfast city centre now and you see all the tours done here and there – blue badge this, white badge that – we get to look at it and say we did it first,” said Joe with a smile.“We did a walking tour in the Half Bap area and one of the very first tours was cancelled because of a bomb scare – not many tour operators can claim that.”The end of the conflict has ushered in a new age of competition as ious operators compete to sell tours of the ever-developing city of Belfast. While Joe believes the growing interest in local history is “brilliant” he insists branding and profits have often got in the way of fact.“People are trying to put these brands on things,” he said.“At my last count Belfast has nine-quarters. When I was at school,I was asked how many quarters there were andI had said nine I know what would’ve happened.“There is a lot of  stuff like this Tribeca development, which is a lot of nonsense.“They should do the names to reflect the history of the area. It annoys me when people try to put a  history on an area or say things that just aren’t true. We’ve always argued thatyou’re going to do history you should tell the truth. I love to see the tourism industry grow and change, but as long as they stick to a principle of truth.”Having started as a small local initiative, the Belfast History Project has flourished over the years, and now provides tours all over Europe, with their Russian tours booked up for nearly two years in advance. However, with all of its wider triumphs, the Belfast History Project remains a social enterprise, whose key aim is to give back to the community. Local tours and events still run regularly, such as the highly successful historical photographic exhibiton, which recently appeared in the New Lodge – and, as Joe explained, “It’s all about education”.“If we get people into history we can get them into education and guide them along their own path,” he said.“For example, we had a group of kids studying the history of the New Lodge, which grew to Belfast, Ireland and then Europe. They might be kids at the time, and they’ll mess about, but about tenyears later they’ll come back to us and say ‘That was the best project I was ever part of’ and that gives us a buzz.”Joe continued: “I remember years ago that the Barrack area in the New Lodge was just called the Barrack, but younger people didn’t know why it was called that. If you ask them now they’ll tell you it’s because there used to be an army barracks there.“Whenever you do a photographic exhibition and people are learning about their own area, then that’s the start of an educational journey.“As we always say, there is no more fruitful form of education than to raise the interest of people in their own surroundings.“Once you do that it can open up countless other opportunities.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"priceless 1916 artefacts to go on show at opening of new james","story":"AN ORIGINAL  Proclamation along with the printing blocks used to create the document are among the historically invaluable artacts to go on display for the first time ever together when Áras Uí Chonghaile opens its doors next month. The Gaeltacht Quarter-based £. million three-storey building is set to welcome tourists and visitors from Saturday, April  when the centre opens to offer an interactive exhibition, study area, a fascinating library of Connolly’s writings, café and conference facility. The opening of Áras Uí Chonghaile comes three years after a statue of James Connolly was unveiled outside the Falls Community Council to commemorate the th year of the Easter Rising. The bronze statue was unveiled by a great-grandson of the  hero, James Connolly Heron, who described West Belfast as Connolly’s “spiritual home”.The ambitious project, led by Fáilte Feirste Thiar, will host a pageant parade on April , Good Friday, and will leave from Conway Mill, a site where James Connolly organised mill workers during the time he made West Belfast his home. “Aras Uí Chonghaile is designed to celebrate everything James Connolly contributed to Belfast, Ireland and beyond,” explained Fáilte Feirste Director Harry Connolly. “There are five core elements to the centre, starting with the ground floor, world-class visitor exhibition. The first floor of the centre will house the Connolly Library and will consist of the world’s finest collection of writings including books we have secured from when James Connolly spent his time in Kilmainham Gaol. The fourth element of the centre will be an event and conference space, with all the first class facilities you would expect.”Harry told the Andersonstown News that a year-long events programme has also been planned with folk sessions, film club meetings held once a month in conjunction with Sean Murray’s Respect film company, and a series of seminars and lectures.“We are also delighted to announce that Hatch Café will take up residence in the centre as our hospitality partners and will be open to the public,” he said. Áras Uí Chonghaile centre manger Séanna Walsh spoke of how the centre will host a programme of events that will try to emphasise that “It’s not just about Connolly the Irish rebel, it’s as much about Connolly the trade unionist, the guy who organised the mill workers in Conway Street, the guy who went to the States and organised several trade unions there, who all take their lineage right back that far.” Séanna continued: “There will be a major educational element to the centre, we want schools, colleges, universities coming to see the project.“It’s ground-breaking the things we will have on display for the first time: an original Proclamation and also a half Proclamation which was actually produced by the British to use in evidence during the court martial.“Having the seven signatories at the bottom was all they needed, those along with the original printing blocks will be displayed for the first time ever together. “At the end of the day, the centre has to be Connolly in the round. Not the one-dimensional Connolly – the Irish rebel. It’s important to the legacy of the man this centre is seen as a resource by the trade unions right across the island.”Harry said that there is no doubt Áras Uí Chonghaile will become a key part of the city’s tourism trail. “We want to thank our funders Belfast City Council and the wide range of sponsoring trade unions from the States that have pledged and delivered key financial resources which haveallowed the centre to become a reality.” "},{"url":null,"title":"alevel northern ireland school league table","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsLocal Elections NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday Guide March Spring EditionCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

It could be bare-bones.Justice Department regulations require only that Mr Mueller give the Attorney General a confidential report that explains the decisions to pursue or decline prosecutions. That could be as simple as a bullet point list or as fulsome as a report running hundreds of pages.What will the Attorney General do William Barr said he envisions two reports, and only one for congressional and public consumption.Mr Barr has said he takes seriously the “shall be confidential” part of the regulations governing Mr Mueller’s report. He has noted that department protocol says internal memos explaining charging decisions should not be released.During his confirmation hearing, Mr Barr said he would draft, after Mr Mueller turned in his report, a second one for the chairman and ranking members of the House and Senate Judiciary committees. But the regulations provide little guidance for what such a report would say.The Attorney General is required only to say the investigation has concluded and describe or explain any times when he or Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein decided an action Mr Mueller proposed “was so inappropriate or unwarranted” that it should not be pursued.In a letter Mr Barr sent on Friday to the four members of the two Judiciary committees, he said there were “no such instances”. He also said he may be in a position to advise them of Mr Mueller’s conclusions “as soon as this weekend”.Mr Barr indicated that he expects to use his report to share the results of Mr Mueller’s investigation with the public, which the regulations allow him to do. But he has hedged on specics and said his plans could change after speaking with Mr Mueller and Mr Rosenstein.Will Donald Trump be able to see the report \" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  It is not yet clear whether Donald Trump will get to see the report It is unclear whether Donald Trump will ask to see the report and under what circumstances he or his attorneys might be able to view it, especially because the document is meant to be confidential for Justice Department leadership.Mr Mueller reports to the Justice Department, not the White House.Mr Barr said at his confirmation hearing that he would not permit White House interference in the investigation. But he has also voiced an expansive view of executive power in which the president s as the country’s chief law enforcement officer and has wide latitude in giving directives to the FBI and Justice Department.Democrats could seize on any disclosure to the president to argue that the report is not confidential and should be immediately provided to them as well.Can Democrats in Congress subpoena Mr Mueller and his report Yes. The chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, Representative Jerrold Nadler, has said as much.“We could subpoena the final report. We could subpoena Mueller and ask him in front of the committee what was in your final report. Those are things we could do,” Mr Nadler told ABC’s This Week in October.But Mr Trump, as the leader of the executive branch, could direct the Justice Department to defy the subpoena, setting the stage for a court fight that would almost certainly go to the Supreme Court."},{"url":null,"title":"dungiven family returns screens week","story":"Rare Breed - A Farming Year s to our screens on Thursday at .pm on UTV, and so too does Dungiven family, the McGilligan’s.It’s September, and despite some bad weather, the farmers are keeping busy with sales, competitions and new arrivals.Viewers will see the McGilligan’s make their annual trip to the sheep sales in Armoy.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refreshThere’s a signicant role for -year-old Cahir, as well as helping dad Sean and granddad Harry, he’s showing the sheep in the sales ring and hoping the buyers will bid on the sheep.UTV’s Mark McFadden narrates the series, sponsored by Dale Farm, Rare Breed – A Farming Year continues on Thursday  st March  at .pm on UTV."},{"url":null,"title":"green light 100m investment new","story":"The largest private residential investment in the North West is set to be approved by Derry City and Strabane District Council planning committee next week.The £m investment by South Bank Square Ltd proposes a  home neighbourhood development at Ballyoan adjacent to Crescent Link and Clooney Road.

plannersrsquo recommendation to refuse permission to develop Northern Irelandrsquos first woodland graveyard outside Downpatrick.The decision to allow those behind the controversial proposal for a -acre site at Loughmoney more time to provide additional information was taken at last weekrsquos meeting of Newry, Mourne and Down Councilsrsquo Planning Committee.Plans for the graveyard, which has split public opinion, were unveiled in September  by Down to Earth Ltd, which hosted a series of public consultation meetings to outline the detail of its proposal.Those behind the lsquogreen graveyardrsquo project, which would be sited off the Ballyculter Road and contain parking provision for  cars, say they are confident that the proposal would have a low environmental impact and offer an alternative to those seeking an environmentally-friendly approach to burial.They argue there are no designations that would preclude a development of this nature and that the proposal will enhance the location by creating and enhancing shared space, supporting good design and improving the built and natural environment.Supporters of the project also contend that the project will ldquopreserve restore and enhance ecosystems, turning an arable field into a nature reserve.In papers submitted ahead of last weekrsquos meeting, planners confirmed they had representations in support and opposition to the proposal, with the planned burial site having no headstones, with all burials recorded on a map.Signicantly, planners confirmed that while there can be no objections in principle to the proposal, those behind the project had not provided the requested additional information.They revealed that while extra time was allowed to comply with the request, no further extension was being afforded with the recommendation to refuse the application now being made.Planners added: ldquoWhile it is considered that the proposal will not create any unacceptable visual or residential impact due to its nature, it is considered further information is required for the consultees which also encompasses a number of concerns raised from interested parties.Planners confirmed Environment and Rivers Agencies are among those who still require further information to enable them to fully assess the planning application and provide detailed comment.Planners had described the information they required as ldquocrucial and pertinent to the application and that it was most unfortunate that it has not been provided.They said while there may be no objection in principle to the proposal ldquoit is not possible to fully consider the merits of the case at this time..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Down in pole position

at Pairc Esler would be enough to send Down into a Division  final at Croke Park at the end of the month and secure promotion back into Division .However, Down left it extremely late before securing the spoils and it took a point in added time from Donal OrsquoHare to kill off a game Carlow offering in a controversial conclusion to the game.Three minutes injury-time had been played when Diarmuid Walshe converted a free to tie the game for the home side.With the home fans waiting on the final whistle, play was allowed to continue and OrsquoHare was again Downrsquos saviour with a last-gasp winner.The game was far from being a classic with referee, James Bermingham, booking five Carlow players and seven from Down before issuing red to Shane Redmond from the home county and Kevin McKiernan and Paul Devlin from Down.Carlow led - to - at the interval with Darragh Foley using the wind well in the half landing six points from placed balls.Down used the elements to their advantage after the break and points from Paul Devlin, Conor Poland, Darren OrsquoHagan and OrsquoHare had the visitors in the ascendancy.Carlow then hit back with Eoghan Ruth pouncing on a loose ball in the square before beating an exposed Rory Burns up breaking ball in the big square and eased the ball home to level at - to -.Caolan Mooney restored Downrsquos lead with a point, but Carlow refused to go away. Devlin picked up his red card after a second yellow and Diarmuid Walsh levelled with a free three minutes into added time.That seemed to be it, but the referee let play continue and OrsquoHare showed great composure to send the winning point over the bar from quite a way out.Carlow: Robert Sansom, Chris Crowley, Shane Redmond, Conor Lawlor, Benny Kavanagh, Eoghan Ruth , Ciaran Moran, Brendan Murphy , Sean Murphy, Jordan Morrissey , Sean Gannon, Darragh OrsquoBrien, Conor Crowley, Darragh Foley , Daniel St Ledger.

He is also receiving a gelatin diet, full of calcium, vitamins and minerals, which is important for the development of his shell.ldquoAs JC has taken well to rehabilitation we have decided that it is best for him to be moved to a larger space as he will have more room to swim and e.ldquoLuckily he has responded well to treatment and is currently settling in to his new home where visitors to the aquarium will be able to get a glimpse of the vulnerable species as he continues to recover.The future is looking bright for JC as the team at Exploris will continue to monitor his weight over the coming months. They plan to release him back to his natural environment when he has fully recovered.Loggerhead turtles like JC can live to about  years of age in the wild and usually reach about three feet in shell .Mr Williams says the ultimate goal is to release the reptile back into the wild in warmer waters.This is not the first time Exploris has tried to nurse a lost loggerhead turtle back to health.In January , another loggerhead was found washed up on a Co Donegal beach and was also taken to Exploris suffering from hypothermia.Staff named that male turtle Columba, but sadly it died a short time later, making JCrsquos recovery all the more remarkable..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"McKinstry is on the mark at Jimmy’s 10  ","story":"THE Beast from the East was well and truly caged this year as the day dawned bright and sunny, although with a noticeable frosty nip to awaken unsuspecting toes and fingers of the small army of East Down clubmen and their cons which descended on the sleeping streets of the county town on Jimmyrsquos Ten Sunday.Their mission was to display the necessary Kilometre markers and warning signs around the soon to be crowded route.Time was of the essence as upwards of , runners and walkers had signed up for the biggest participation sporting event in the district and with the start brought forward to am, to facilitate the festival paradersquos new start time of pm, it was going to be a tight run affair to have all in place before the runners took over.But, as ever, the super team managed it with a bit to spare.It should be pointed out that at am the pathway at the Quoile was water free.

There will also be a dedicated parking area for coaches.Original plans for the new hotel described finishing the exterior of the building in stone slate, with the accommodation centred around a landscaped courtyard.

He could be shot dead.”He also claimed to have given McLoughlin’s name to two detectives while in HMP Winson Green just days after the bombings, but heard nothing more.Counsel to the coroner Peter Skelton asked: “Was it the OC of Birmingham who would take decisions about which places to target for the bombs “Yes,” Witness O replied.All the men have been named before in connection with the bombings, but never in a formal setting.Mr Reilly and Mr Hayes have always denied any involvement in the blasts, though Mr Hayes has said he took “collective responsibility” for all IRA attacks in England, including the pub bombings.Six men, known as the Birmingham Six, were jailed in  for the double bomb attacks, but their convictions were quashed by the Court of Appeal in .Their case remains one of the most infamous miscarriages of justice in English legal history.An shocked UUP Justice Spokesman, Doug Beattie, said that the events confirmed that the IRA is still active.“This is staggering,” he said. “Not only are the IRA still active and giving orders but such is their confidence that they have a deal with the UK Govt they are happy to name names.”Mr Beattie called on the PSNI, Garda and West Midlands Police to examine claims made by a witness at the inquest into the  Birmingham pub bombings.“The evidence from ‘Witness O’ was very interesting on a number of fronts,” he said.“Firstly, he said that the ‘head of the IRA’ in Dublin has given him permission to name names.“Given that numerous Sinn Fein politicians have claimed that there is no IRA, you wonder just who is in sitting Dublin, claiming to be the head of it  Bobby Storey said it had become a butterfly and flown away. So who exactly is at the head of what some claim is a ‘non-existent’ organisation “The PSNI and the Garda need to give an assessment of this claim as a matter of urgency.“Secondly,any of these people named are still alive - and I understand at least one is - then they are liable to prosecution. If Soldier F can be lined up for prosecution for alleged offences in Londonderry in  then so can alleged IRA members for alleged offences in Birmingham in . That’s what is meant by equality before the law.”DUP MP Jeffrey Donaldson also called for evidence given by ‘Witness O’ to be pursued by police.He noted that yesterday, former IRA member Kieran Conway stated that the attacks were “not sanctioned” by the IRA but that the deaths were not murder because they were “an IRA operation that went badly wrong”.Commenting on the evidence the Lagan Valley MP said: “One of the iniduals named today has previously admitted involvement in the Birmingham pub bombings. This further evidence demands a proper police investigation into his involvement in the murder of  people.“Questions were previously raised as to whether this person was in receipt of an On The Run letter. Those letters are no barrier to prosecution. He was reported as living in Dublin. There is a clear challenge for the authorities in the Republic of Ireland whether they are prepared to pursue justice for the victims of republican terrorism with the same vigour as they demand the pursuit of those who were acting on behalf of the state in Northern Ireland.”Mr Donaldson also said that evidence given to the inquest posed major questions for Sinn Fein.“There are two very clear questions which Mary Lou McDonald and the Sinn Fein leadership need to answer.“The PSNI have previously indicated that the IRA exists but is not involved in paramilitary activity. That stands in stark contrast to the assertions of Sinn Fein. Mary Lou McDonald needs to explain how the head of the IRA in Dublin can give “permission” for an inidual to be named, when she tells us the IRA doesn’t exist.“Secondly, does Sinn Fein agree with the assessment of Kieran Conway that the Birmingham pub bombings were not murder simply because the IRA were involved. Sinn Fein were very quick to jump on comments made by the Secretary of State that were later claried.“Mary Lou McDonald should step forward and state clearly whether she believes the actions of the IRA in Birmingham and where were criminal.”TUV leader Jim Allister challenged Taoiseach Leo Varadkar on what he is doing about the terror chief in Dublin who directed the naming of the bombers.The MLA added: “The naming of the Birmingham bombers today and the compelling claim that the naming was sanctioned by ‘the current head of the IRA in Dublin’, raises critical questions for both the Birmingham police and the Dublin Government and Garda.“Have the four named persons been investigated fully by the police and what further steps will now be taken And, Mr Varadkar, you who likes to mind everyone ’s business, what are you doing about the continuing operation of the IRA in your capital city under a ‘current head’  What actions have you taken, and will take,to address this issue ”try catch

That being the case, this council, like many others in Wales, is unable to continue to provide the level of subsidy to outdoor sports provision that it has in the past.ldquoExploring dferent ways of working, including the transfer of responsibilities in appropriate circumstances to community groups is a key element of the councilrsquos strategy moving forward as it addresses dficult budget priorities.ldquoFollowing the successful transfer of responsibilities for five libraries to community-based organisations and looking at a number of successful sports clubs across the Vale of Glamorgan who operate without any subsidy from the Council, it is hoped that the majority of clubs currently using council facilities will be able to continue to provide opportunities for all to participate in sports activities. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

The event ran from Saturday March  to Tuesday March .The Vale brewery Tomos and Lilford produced a special beer called ldquoCarnival - Penarth Pale Ale.Meanwhile the two Penarth butchers, Thompson Family Butchers and David Lush Butchers, both created their own special Penarth carnival sausages.The organisers estimated that more than  people took part in costume in the walk through town on Saturday, which saw the coronation of the lsquoFirst Foolrsquo at am. The procession marched from Sully Terrace through town.At .am in Penarth Library, there was a presentation of the head of Bendigeidfran, from The Mabinogion. The head was made by children from Cogan and Penygarth schools.The lsquoFirst Foolrsquo was then sent by train to the Tower of London to bring news of the Carnival to the traditional resting place of the head of Bendigeidfran, where he met the Raven Master.Long distance cyclist Dave Hann was due to cycle to Harlech, north Wales to raise money for the RNLI Penarth, and bring news to Harlech that Carnival had broken out in Penarth.Unfortunately Mr Hann only got as far as Cardigan before Storm Freya made it too dangerous to continue. Organisers have one barrel of carnival ale left and will take it to Harlech by train in the next few weeks to share it and the storybook of the carnival.On Sunday, two rugby teams took part in a ldquotug-o-sausage to decide which butcherrsquos sausage was better. Congratulations were extended to the winners, Team Thompson.Congratulations were also extended to the traders Ener-chi and Lilypad by the organisers, for having the best-dressed shop windows. Particular praise was singled out for the carnival flowers at Holm House Hotel created by Lilypad.Further nights of partying, songs and dancing were spotted in the Albion, St Faganrsquos Castle, and other pubs, bars and venues across Penarth. There were also celebrations on the Penarth Pier on Tuesday night following a Pancake Day event, while wandering bands of musicians like Wonderbrass kept spirits high.The festival culminated in a grand Mardis Gras party on Tuesday, which saw crowds of costumed residents dance the night away.Richard Parry, one of the carnival organisers, said: ldquoToday is Ash Wednesday, the beginning of Lent. Carnival finished last night on Mardi Gras.ldquoThanks to everyone who took part, contributed, encouraged, sponsored, smiled and partied, especially those people who took a carnival Bank Holiday Monday.ldquoIt was fabulous to hear your Carnival Bank Holiday stories, and to all those people who have had little private carnival moments of joy over the festival, thatrsquos what it has all been about.ldquoAnd some people have already said, lsquosee you next year!rsquoldquoThere were lots of people laughing and smiling on the sidelines, telling me they wanted to take part next year ndash just with a little more notice next time. But now itrsquos established, wersquoll be back next year and ready for even more people to join in the fun! article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

A Vale wide mph limit on all urban and residential roads would greatly increase the safety, health and well-being of residents. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentsSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a commentOrder byOldest firstNewest firstHighest scoredLowest scoredLoading comments...

Last month I met with constituents over disruption to local rail services. I know that many of you will have experienced delays and cancellations to services in the weeks following the handover of the Wales Rail Franchise. I understand and share the frustration that these delays have caused. There has been a shortage of rolling stock as a result of a large maintenance backlog following the handover of the franchise together with planned changes to rail services. This has led to a signicant reduction in services and replacement bus services. I have been in contact with the Minister for Transport and Transport for Wales to raise the concerns of constituents. I have been assured that service levels are now back to normal and they do not anticipate any restrictions to services in the coming year. I will of course maintain my interest to see that those assurances are kept. I will update residents again on future plans to deliver improved station facilities, trains and more regular services.As many of you are aware Cardf Bus has recently announced changes to bus services across Cardf and the Vale. A number of bus routes are at risk as part of these changes. The removal of bus links for work, social links and public services, including hospital routes, would have a signicant impact on my constituents.Cardf Bus are not acting to deliberately hurt our communities. Far from being an uncaring organisation Cardf Bus are stuck with a legal framework that stops them from operating on the same basis as commercial competitors. Competitors can cherry pick and target single profitable routes that undermine the wider social propose that most of us want from local bus services. Cardf Councilrsquos Labour leadership has committed to supporting at risk bus services for  years. Unless the Conservative leadership of the Vale Council agrees to Labour councillors amendments to the budget and protects local bus services in the Vale then bus routes will go. The Vale Council leadership could and should act. If they donrsquot then my constituents will suffer.In future, the regulation of buses is the answer. London was the only part of the UK that was allowed to keep a regulated bus service. It is no mistake that it has the best and most coherent service. We now have the legislative powers to regulate bus services here in Wales. The Welsh Government is currently consulting on proposals to reform bus and taxi services in Wales. More information on the consultation can be found at: https:beta.gov.wales improving-public-transport.

Irsquove recently had money for junction  of the M but I donrsquot have additional fundingfor this.Rod Harrod, chairman of the Dinas Powys Bypass Steering Group, said the bypass plans are ldquomore advanced now than at any time in the last  or even  years.Mr Harrod said improvements to the Merrie Harrier junction would benefit staff, patients, and visitors at Llandough Hospital.Councillors said there could be some competition for Welsh Government funding for the bypass from the proposed works on junction  of the M.Cllr Andrew Robertson, who represents Dinas Powys, said he couldnrsquot understand why there had to be competition for funding with the M scheme.ldquoIf the traffic situation in Dinas Powys is resolved it would benefit every community across the South Wales, Vale of Glamorgan corridor, Cllr Robertson said.Cllr Gwyn John urged the campaign to keep going despite the delays.He said: ldquoI can appreciate how frustrated people involved are with the delays.ldquo[The bypass] is a must. With all the development we have got across the Vale of Glamorgan itrsquos chocka-block. Itrsquos getting worse.ldquoDonrsquot give up, get stuck in. Itrsquos going to be a battle. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a commentOrder byOldest firstNewest firstHighest scoredLowest scoredLoading comments...

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It could be bare-bones.Justice Department regulations require only that Mr Mueller give the Attorney General a confidential report that explains the decisions to pursue or decline prosecutions. That could be as simple as a bullet point list or as fulsome as a report running hundreds of pages.What will the Attorney General do William Barr said he envisions two reports, and only one for congressional and public consumption.Mr Barr has said he takes seriously the ldquoshall be confidential part of the regulations governing Mr Muellerrsquos report. He has noted that department protocol says internal memos explaining charging decisions should not be released.During his confirmation hearing, Mr Barr said he would draft, after Mr Mueller turned in his report, a second one for the chairman and ranking members of the House and Senate Judiciary committees. But the regulations provide little guidance for what such a report would say.The Attorney General is required only to say the investigation has concluded and describe or explain any times when he or Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein decided an action Mr Mueller proposed ldquowas so inappropriate or unwarranted that it should not be pursued.In a letter Mr Barr sent on Friday to the four members of the two Judiciary committees, he said there were ldquono such instances. He also said he may be in a position to advise them of Mr Muellerrsquos conclusions ldquoas soon as this weekend.Mr Barr indicated that he expects to use his report to share the results of Mr Muellerrsquos investigation with the public, which the regulations allow him to do. But he has hedged on specics and said his plans could change after speaking with Mr Mueller and Mr Rosenstein.Will Donald Trump be able to see the report It is unclear whether Donald Trump will ask to see the report and under what circumstances he or his attorneys might be able to view it, especially because the document is meant to be confidential for Justice Department leadership.Mr Mueller reports to the Justice Department, not the White House.Mr Barr said at his confirmation hearing that he would not permit White House interference in the investigation. But he has also voiced an expansive view of executive power in which the president s as the countryrsquos chief law enforcement officer and has wide latitude in giving directives to the FBI and Justice Department.Democrats could seize on any disclosure to the president to argue that the report is not confidential and should be immediately provided to them as well.Can Democrats in Congress subpoena Mr Mueller and his report Yes. The chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, Representative Jerrold Nadler, has said as much.ldquoWe could subpoena the final report. We could subpoena Mueller and ask him in front of the committee what was in your final report. Those are things we could do, Mr Nadler told ABCrsquos This Week in October.But Mr Trump, as the leader of the executive branch, could direct the Justice Department to defy the subpoena, setting the stage for a court fight that would almost certainly go to the Supreme Court..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagaga, title: Mueller ends Russia investigation  u what happens next  article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

We will not accept any deal which poses a long-term risk to the constitutional and economic integrity of the United Kingdom, he said.Mrs May sought to soften her approach in her letter to parliamentarians, offering to hold talks with MPs and thanking those who have backed her plan previously.And she laid out the choices available to the Commons after she agreed a delay to Brexit with EU leaders in Brussels on Thursday night.The PM said the UK could revoke Article  leave without a deal ask for an extension beyond April her deal is rejected or not voted on or leave on May it is finally approved.Mrs May wrote: ldquoIf it appears that there is not sufficient support to bring the deal back next week, or the House rejects it again, we can ask for another extension before  April ndash but that will involve holding European Parliament elections.ldquoIf it appears that there is sufficient support and the Speaker permits it, we can bring the deal back next week andit is approved we can leave on  May.It came as ministers moved to try to head off an attempt by MPs to seize control of Commons business in a bid to secure a ldquosofter Brexit.A cross-party group of pro-EU MPs claimed they had the numbers to force a series of ldquoindicative votes on alternatives to Mrs Mayrsquos Brexit deal.But Business Secretary Greg Clark said the Government was prepared to enable Parliament to express a view on the ious optionsMrs Mayrsquos deal is rejected by the Commons for a third time next week.Defeat for the Government on Monday on the amendment ndash tabled by former ministers Sir Oliver Letwin and Dominic Grieve and Labour MP Hilary Benn ndash would be a further humiliation for Mrs May.A cross-party group of pro-EU MPs claim they have the numbers to force a series of ldquoindicative votes in the Commons If the amendment is passed, it would pave the way for a series of ldquoindicative votes in the House on Wednesday, effectively taking control of the Brexit process out of the hands of the Government.Elsewhere it emerged that Tory former foreign secretary Boris Johnson met Mrs May for talks twice this week, including on Friday.Mr Johnson is said to have asked the PM how she intended to change her approach, and she reportedly set out plans to restructure the Department for Exiting the European Union.Hundreds of thousands of supporters of a second referendum will march through central London on Saturday, where Labourrsquos deputy leader Tom Watson is expected to say he will vote for the PMrsquos dealit is put to the people.Meanwhile Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, who has been reluctant to throw his full weight behind a so-called Peoplersquos Vote, will be campaigning in the North West of England.As Mrs May battles to stay in Number , Prisons Minister Rory Stewart said replacing her would not help the situation.ldquoI would rather she stayed because I donrsquot believe that changing Theresa May for someone  is going to resolve this problem, he told BBC Tworsquos Newsnight.ldquoThe problems are deep in the wounds of the vote, Parliament, the European Union ndash itrsquos not about a single inidual..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagaga, title: PM admits third vote on her Brexit deal may not take place next week article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Keeping Holland and Germany off the board until the autumn, and starting the campaign at Windsor Park, gives Northern Ireland a strong chance of picking up early points and building some momentum before the tougher asks to come. On the flip side, however,Michael ONeills side cannot take the chances in front of them this week, they may find their campaign is effectively over before it has begun.Pent-up frustrationNorthern Ireland played some exciting, expansive football at times during last years Nations League, but came away with absolutely nothing to show for it. Four games, four defeats, with the final indignity being Austrias stoppage-time winner at Windsor Park in November ensuring they did not even pick up a single point. Four months may have passed but the players have not entirely forgotten, and are desperate to pick up a first competitive victory since a - World Cup qualying win over the Czech Republic in September .Developing styleFor all the Nations League failed to deliver in terms of results, it did see ONeill transform his teams tactics. Far from relying on counter-attacks and set-pieces to pick off teams, Northern Ireland became a possession-orientated team who created chances from open play, albeit failing to convert enough of them to prosper. It is a style they will be looking to repeat in this campaign. \"If you look at where weve come from as a team, were a far more possession-based team than we were in previous campaigns,\" ONeill said. \"Thats how we want to approach the games going forward. Im looking forward to it and I sense that in the players.\"Match fitnessIt is not new for a large proportion of the Northern Ireland team to struggle for regular playing time at club level, but the problem seems particularly acute at present. Captain Steven Davis left Southampton for Rangers on loan in January in the hope of playing more games but that is yet to materialise, while goalkeeper Bailey Peacock-Farrell, first choice for ONeill for the Nations League last year, has lost his place at Leeds this year.Come a long wayNorthern Ireland last faced Estonia eight years ago during the  World Cup qualying campaign, their only previous meetings with the country, and lost both home and away. Those games took place just a few months before ONeill took charge and oversaw a huge turnaround in the nations fortunes, guiding them to Euro  - their first major tournament in  years. He will hope victory against them this time can set Northern Ireland on their way to repeating that achievement.Ballymena United hit Institute for six Coremetrics  Coremetrics

The Department of the Economy’s Strategic Energy Framework, which was endorsed by the Executive in , has over the last nine years, led to some very positive changes to the energy generation and supply mix, particularly from renewable sources.However the  year framework is nearing its end and needs to be replaced. The Department is making such preparations as it can on a draft Strategic Energy Framework across the areas of heat, electricity, transport and energy efficiency which it aims to make public some time in the spring. Whether or not this region has its Assembly back to adopt such a framework will remain to be seen, but in the meantime it will ensure the subject remains live and high on the agenda.Brexit and I-SEMThe new wholesale electricity market known as the Integrated Single Electricity Marketwent live on October , . It is designed to deliver increased levels of competition which, it is hoped, will help put downward pressure on prices as well as encouraging greater levels of security of supply and transparency. While the island of Ireland is now integrated more closely with European markets, there is a risk that Brexit could halt this integration. British and Irish business groups and energy trade associations such as the CBI, IBEC, Electricity Association of Ireland, RenewableUK, British Irish Chamber of Commerce and EnergyUK all refer to the delivery of I-SEM, or to the UK’s continued access to the IEM, as post-Brexit priorities for security of supply and or consumer protection. I-SEM is clearly a priority that must be preserved.While Brexit may present challenges and continuing uncertainty, there are certainly opportunities for investment and acquisition in the electricity market as more complex, specialist expertise will be required to effectively trade power on the I-SEM. Policy barriers or inaction cannot be allowed to prevent I-SEM from realising its potential of fully integrating the market by efficiently moving energy from producer to demand.Renewable incentive schemesDespite being on track to hit its target of % of electricity generation from renewables, Northern Ireland risks being left behind. The lack of a replacement for the development support mechanism, Renewables Obligations Certicateafter its closure in April , means Northern Ireland is lagging behind Great Britain which has established the Contract for Dference regime and Ireland, which has started work on its Renewable Electricity Support Scheme . While neither scheme is perfect, doing nothing is not an option. The devolution of energy presented Northern Ireland with the opportunity to shape its own policy but without a government, will the sector and the infrastructure be able to remain fit for purpose GasWith its development over the last  years, the gas network in Northern Ireland, with its low population density, must be seen as a success story. Consumers and businesses have been offered greater choice in terms of price and security of supply. Nevertheless there are certainly further opportunities for gas distributors and suppliers to expand the natural gas network, particularly in the west of the country and east Co Down. So despite the apparent obstacles and challenges, there is opportunity for development and progress in Northern Ireland’s energy sector. The benefits for Northern Ireland will be in terms of security of supply, price and environmental sustainability. Cleaver Fulton Rankin,  Bedford Street, Belfast BT FW.

Since I took on the Northern Ireland role six years ago, we’ve doubled the workforce, become the fastest-growing UK region and are now the biggest office outside London with just over , people,” he says. “Our strategy was to be the leading provider of professional services in the Northern Ireland market but there’s no way we’d be the size we are now had we only focused on that.”Instead Paul built on the legacy of his predecessors and accelerated growth in new, technology solutions, while retaining the traditional accounting, tax and consulting services. Today PwC remains the leading provider of advisory services to the region’s family-owned and owner-managed businesses and multinationals, but has also built an impressive portfolio of cutting-edge technologies, opened the door to signicant export markets and is tackling some of society’s most challenging issues. “We’ve grown in many new areas – blockchain, cyber, cloud-based accounting services – but the single biggest impact has come from developing our distinctive ‘Operate’ ision,” Paul says. ”Operate is our service delivery business, which supports and delivers technology and people solutions to large, often regulated organisations. So instead of just advising clients how to solve their problems, we now do the heavy lting for them.”Run by Ian McConnell, a partner who’s been with the firm for  years, Operate is already attracting global attention. “Clients increasingly don’t want a consulting firm just to tell them what to do: they want a problem-solving partnership.” he says. “In its first year of operation, Operate earned over £m, now has , people and is still growing.”Reinforcing Paul’s confidence to invest in Northern Ireland as a strategic location is a  forecast from TheCityUK that it could become the second fastest-growing financial services region outside London by , helping deliver £bn of additional gross value-addedto the UK economy. But that depends on the ability to recruit the right talent, and he says the challenge now is finding and retaining the skills.That’s an issue that particularly concerns Paul as he looks ahead at the economic picture with Brexit and lack of an Assembly to the fore.“The business community wants clarity and certainty. Ideally we want to see a Brexit withdrawal agreement that then gives the scope for a trade deal that offers Northern Ireland the capacity to trade both with the EU and as part of the UK. The potential competitive advantages and ability to attract investment would be terric and the kind of economic accelerator which we have sought for years, but never managed to gain.“However I do worry about the impact of political stalemate on our long term future. Failure to invest, particularly in education and skills, will impair our competitiveness and make this a less attractive place for business.The decreasing effectiveness of health, environment and infrastructure will mean that talented people will opt to make choices to live their lives where.“In my national role, I see other parts of the country fusing partnerships in innovative and exciting ways between business,education and government. Compared to that, we are already getting left behind. We should be moving forward.”Which brings us to Merchant Square, the £m, , sq ft office development which PwC takes over in . “We have great people and one reason why we’re moving to the city centre is because that’s where they want to be. By the time we’re ready to relocate towards the end of , we will have at least , people moving in to the heart of Belfast.“That makes it important for Belfast too and not just because it’s the city’s biggest-ever private sector office deal. As we were making our decision, the whole Bank Buildings issue was at its height, and we wanted to show our support for the city and its future.” The Merchant Square relocation project is led by Kieragh Nelson, a director who joined the firm in . “We’ve got serious ambitions for Merchant Square,” she says. ”There’s a sense of ‘OK, we’ve just opened flagship offices in London, and Manchester – what more can we do in Belfast how can we make it even better ’ And the vast majority of decisions on how it will look, feel and work are made by the team here. Our goal is to create the most technologically-advanced, innovative and collaborative space for ourselves, our clients, and also for the communities around us.”Doing the right thing is a maxim often repeated in PwC, but it gets backed up. On the morning of our interview, a large group of people from the firm, including Paul, took part in one of their regular ‘Darkness Into Light’ walks to raise awareness of mental health. The firm’s commitment to social mobility has seen a number of employment programmes launched, notably the UK’s first technology degree apprenticeships, with Queen’s University one of five universities selected to run the programme. And it’s expanding its Hive Academy programme, which delivers free technology education to primary and secondary schools, to the Channel Islands.This year the firm challenged itself and created a unique charity partnership – the PwC Challenge – to create innovative suicide prevention programmes.“Our purpose is to build trust in society and solve important problems, and it really does feature in how we look at what we do. We strive to celebrate and share our knowledge widely and unselfishly with our people and communities and not be afraid to take a stand and do the right thing. And we put it at the heart of what we do every day. “Take the PwC Challenge: more people in Northern Ireland have died by suicide since the signing of the Good Friday Agreement than from the violence in the years before. This is a crisis, and it’s one which affects our people, and our communities. So we asked local charities in north and west Belfast, the worst affected areas in the UK, to collaborate and devise really innovative approaches programmes to give opportunities to young people and their families through education, technology, sports, and mental health coaching.“As well as the clubs in PwC which fundraise every year for the challenge, our own people are volunteering every week in ious projects – particularly with our Hive Academy. We want to ensure that people, who are high achievers in many dferent fields, are supported to play their fullest part in society.” For Paul, it’s all about the people. Last year PwC invested around £m on staff development here, and this year, a number of people have begun the first Masters in Operation service delivery, run by Ulster University. “It’s important to support people to develop their careers in ways they mightn’t have considered when they joined. That’s a key building block of our purpose – it drives social mobility, equality and ersity.“It’s true thatsomeone decides they want to head off and join PwC Australia or New York, they can. That’s the beauty of working for a global firm – those opportunities are there. But what I really want to make sure is that you don’t have to leave:you want to live and work in Belfast, and have global clients, work with cutting-edge technology and be part of a firm that’s engaged in society, you can do that too.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/eopen_1.jpg","title":"the open its the biggest thing since sliced bread","story":"Posted on Wednesday March  by Ulster Business With just  weeks until Northern Ireland hosts the biggest sporting event in its history, John Mulgrew speaks to the bosses tasked with organising the legendary Open Championship We’ve come a long way in just a short few years. Despite its huge golfing credentials, especially in the modern game, it had been more than  years since Northern Ireland played host to the Irish Open.That all changed in , when it ed north to Royal Portrush. And that, buoyed on a refreshed and renewed interest in both the tournament, and the sport itself.Now, in  weeks, that same links course will see more than , people flock to arguably the world’s greatest golf tournament and the largest sporting event ever hosted on these shores – The Open – transforming a small Co Antrim town for a handful of summer days.“There is a buzz with everyone at the RA,” Johnnie Cole-Hamilton tells Ulster Business. He’s executive director of championships at the RA – the ruling authority of golf throughout the world, aside from areas such as the US, and organisation responsible for organising The Open.“This will be my th Open Championship, and one reason I continue to be involved is that it’s a challenge every time.”It will see Irish golfing greats, including Open winners Rory McIlroy and Darren Clarke, Graeme McDowelland Padraig Harrington – among others – join the biggest name in sport, Tiger Woods.“One of big drivers to ing to Royal Portrush was the success of the Northern Irish and Irish golfers. They have raised the profile of golf immeasurably. “We are absolutely delighted with the response so far – % of tickets sold in  hours, and sold out within a record-breaking eight weeks.”Johnnie says the decision to choose Portrush, bringing it back to the course after a  year hiatus, was the correct one – buoyed by the support from the community, agencies and organisations. The th Open will be held at Royal Portrush from July -.“In my career, we had a similar scenario, ing to Liverpool for the first time in  years, and we had a very similar response. It ed in , and now Royal Liverpool is firmly on the rota, and I hope that Royal Portrush is similar.”Of course, aside from the golf, both the short-term and long-term economic benefits will trickle down and benefit, not on the surrounding areas, but prop Northern Ireland up on yet another global .According to Tourism NI chief executive John McGrillen that longer-term benefit could be worth up to £m for the wider economy.“There will be , tickets sold for championship days, and % of those sold to people out of state, outside Northern Ireland,” he tells Ulster Business.“It allows us to present an extremely positive image for Northern Ireland, and into key markets across the globe. We will never have experienced the opportunity to provide such a positive image of Northern Ireland. Despite what we might think, there are perception issues.“Northern Ireland has a normalised society and some of the most dramatic golf courses, scenery and landscape to see.“More specically, the fact that the Open will have been here, as one of the world’s top golf courses, will drive up the amount of spend, especially from golf tourism.”That alone makes up around % of Northern Ireland’s tourism intake. John says he wants that to grow to £m by . He says golfing visitors spend around four times that of an average tourist.Johnnie says all signs so far suggest that the Open in Portrush is “going to be an enormous” success. But the process hasn’t come without its challenges – namely theIrish Sea.“This is the first Open Championship we have hosted in my time, in which we have a body of water between our base and our contractor base. There’s getting things across water, and an enormous amount of work on the golf course – new holes, a new road system around the course and a tunnel for the players from one of the new greens to tee. You can’t do that without support from the golf club“The members have been hugely supportive, turning the course upside down, but maintaining integrity and enhancing .”He said, along with the blue light services, local authorities, council and tourism groups, the community in and around Portrush “understands that this will bring great benefits” to the area and Northern Ireland as a whole. “You can overcome dficulties with support,” he says.“Royal Portrush has never had more than , people drive to it, or get the train to it, at the same time. It’s a challenge to make sure we deliver a wonderful Open Championship and a spectator experience.”John McGrillen says the triumph in landing the Open itself was down to the success of the Irish Open in the last few years. “You had more than , people turning out at Portrush… visitor numbers had been dwindling.“That allows us to demonstrate that the course can deal with that many people. Everyoneworked very well, collectively, and that gave confidence to the RA that we would have the capacity to deliver it. The risk factors they had were eliminated because of the success of the Irish Open, and that was very critical.”As for boosting many of the hundreds of businesses in and around the area, John said: “It will do, as it’s showing off Northern Ireland… we have seen a big boost in the number of Americans playing golf. We don’t have to wait until after the event. “The visibility the Irish Open has given us. We have Royal County Down, Royal Portrush and Portstewart – that’s increased signicantly. It’s not just those courses which are benefiting – it’s being spread. People will typically stay in Belfast and travel around.”For John, the best outcome is, of course, an Irish winner. Oh, and clear skies. “A local winner would be phenomenal. It would be fantastic to see Rory win, or Tiger Woods.“If Tiger Woods won the Open in Portrush, that would remain in peoples’ memories forever. While we would love Rory or other locals to win, I would not be disappointed in Tiger winning it.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/west.jpg","title":"major ni firms in eleventh hour westminster plea to avoid no deal brexit","story":"Posted on Friday March  by John Mulgrew More than  of Northern Ireland’s biggest businesses – employing tens of thousands of workers here – have written to MPs in an eleventh hour plea to avoid a ‘no deal’ Brexit.  As Theresa May is due to bring her withdrawal deal back to Parliament next week, with less than a month to go before the March  deadline, a letter from the CBI, signed by  firms, calls on MPs to unite behind a way forward that avoids a hard border and protects peace and economic progress in Northern Ireland.  It says that “local businesses believe that the failure to approve a deal with Europe on the UK’s withdrawal from the EU will have signicant repercussions for the local economy\". “Such a scenario will both hinder indigenous and foreign direct investment, it would result in signicant job losses and will stle opportunities for the next generation across Northern Ireland.  “We therefore urge MPs across the UK to consider the damaging impact on Northern Ireland’s economy and political stability in the event of a no-deal Brexit.  “The peace and economic progress that flowed from the Belfast  Good Friday Agreement cannot be overlooked at this critical time in the UK’s history.

For some there will be little or no change to their daily lives after the UK leaves the EU. But for others, Brexit may have an impact on some aspects of their day-to-day lives. To provide as much practical information for people across Northern Ireland that is currently available, a Brexit section has been created on the nidirect website. Useful public information is being published on www.nidirect.gov.uk brexit on a regular basis. You may have also seen some of the digital advertisements across Northern Ireland or on your social media channels asking you to visit the nidirect website for the most up to date information. The nidirect Brexit section also points to information being published by the UK Government to give people as much information as possible. At this stage, it won’t answer every question that people will have. But it serves as a useful tool to get people to start thinking about what they may need to do dferently once the UK leaves the EU. Included in the www.nidirect.gov.uk brexit is a section on travelling, which includes the most up to date information for motorists. Depending on how the UK leaves the EU, motorists in Northern Ireland may need a Green Card to drive across the border. A Green Card is an international certicate of insurance issued by insurance providers in the UK, guaranteeing that the driver has the necessary third-party motor insurance cover for driving in the country being travelled to. In the event of a no deal Brexit, motorists in Northern Ireland travelling to the Republic of Ireland will need a Green Card as proof of insurance. There’s also the most up-to-date information from the Department of Health on prescriptions, medicines and medical supplies. The Department of Health has already said that there is enough medicines and medical products to meet current needs. Therefore people should not ask for longer prescriptions and should continue to follow their GP’s advice. Likewise, arrangements for the provision of specic cross border healthcare services made between the Department of Health in Northern Ireland and the Department of Health in Dublinshould not be affected by EU Exit as they are not based on EU legislation. There is also information at www.nidirect.gov.uk brexit along with links to further information for businesses, employers and EU citizens, while information on the Common Travel Areacan be found at https:www.gov.uk government publications common-travel-area-guidance You might not have heard about the CTA before, but it gives British and Irish citizens agreed rights and privileges in both jurisdictions. The CTA is not based on EU membership and is a long standing arrangements based on domestic legislation and agreements between the UK and Irish governments and deals with a range of issues. www.nidirect.gov.uk brexit will be updated as and when new information becomes clear and available.
