I’ve been doing it for three years to make sure that nobody abuses the term champagne.”The Comité Champagne is one of the organisations tasked with ensuring only sparkling wine from the Champagne region in France carries the name champagne.“He said, ‘I’ve checked out your website and your Facebook, and it looks like it’s not part of your online shop, but, if you do commercialise it, you will have to call it something separate’,” Robertson said.Robertson said rather than upsetting him, the legal warning made his day.“It was quite funny. It gave me a bit of energy for the day, that’s for sure, that in the scheme of things he would call.”The Mount Gnomon Farm usually sells its produce at farmers’ markets and to restaurants, but lost almost all its business overnight when physical distancing restrictions came in.In order to keep the farm running, Robertson has started home-delivering local produce boxes to the Penguin area.“We are busy with the Easter deliveries at the moment, but after that we were thinking of putting up a naming competition for the rhubarb champagne on Facebook … We could give away a bottle of it, maybe.“Someone suggested Rhu-bubbles, which I like,” Robertson said.He is now considering serving the drink in the farm’s restaurant when it is allowed to open again.One question remains: who dobbed in the farm to the French officials?“It must have been somebody that knew about the farm that was French,” Robertson said.“I guess some people just have too much time on their hands in quarantine.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/83b747e9f29e0111c061a9f0c16ce93e2b83adc7/0_129_3878_2328/master/3878.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=420839fdc0a5f743166de6797cec3d10","title":"perth hottest april day ever temperature 395c coronavirus beaches distancing","story":"Beaches remain open in Western Australia as police praise the public for respecting coronavirus physical distancing rulesPolice have praised West Australian beachgoers for respecting physical distancing rules as Perth sweltered through its hottest April day on record.Perth’s temperature reached 39.5C on Saturday, eclipsing the previous April record set in 1910.Authorities had been on standby to close beaches given the combination of the hot weather and the Easter break.But patrolling officers reported people were obeying the rules and practising physical distancing.“We’ve seen good behaviours generally right across our beaches, our high-contact areas where people generally congregate,” the police commissioner, Chris Dawson, said.“People are really accepting the advice and we’re not seeing many instances at all where people are grouping together.”WA recorded eight new coronavirus cases overnight, taking the state’s total to 514.All the cases were in the Perth metropolitan area and linked to either overseas travel or cruise ships, including three crew members from the Artania liner.Dawson said 12 people had faced charges related to breaching quarantine and isolation rules, and a further eight had been issued $1,000 fines.Those fined included a 65-year-old man who was turned away at a checkpoint north of Perth only to attempt to get in through back roads.Under WA’s intrastate travel bans, people must have an exemption to move between the state’s nine designated regions.WA has also implemented a hard border with the eastern states, denying entry to anyone who does not meet a narrow set of criteria.The premier, Mark McGowan, said he hoped WA would eventually be able to remove some of the restrictions within the state.“We’ve had very, very low levels of community transmission,” he told 6PR radio.“That’s a really good sign. That’s better than virtually anywhere else in the world.“What I’d like to see happen over time is watch how it develops, review it each month ... to see if any can be eased and any tightened up.“And if at the end of a month we can ease some, and hopefully get a bit more normality back without risking anyone, then that’s the sort of approach we’ll take.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3c76967fc911849ae7eb951457080f2c86f84128/1703_655_4227_2536/master/4227.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a321ff255d526e9a51bc220a9750ce7e","title":"anne tyler up close youll always see things to be optimistic about","story":"Renowned for her extraordinary insights into ordinary lives, the award-winning novelist discusses family sagas and why she thinks she was a better writer when she was youngerWhen Anne Tyler’s UK tour for her latest novel became an early victim of the coronavirus, and her publisher announced that the 78-year-old would be conducting all media interviews by phone from the safety of her home in Baltimore, Tyler felt some relief, but mainly she felt guilt. She is one of the world’s most acclaimed modern novelists, winner of both a Pulitzer (for Breathing Lessons, 1988) and the National Book Critics Circle award (for The Accidental Tourist, 1995, which was turned into an Oscar-winning film) and a finalist for the Man Booker (A Spool of Blue Thread, 2015) and the Women’s prize for fiction (Ladder of Years from 1995, and A Spool of Blue Thread). But until 2012, she maintained a silence as assiduous as that of Thomas Pynchon or JD Salinger. She never liked – and still doesn’t, but needs must in today’s world – talking about how she does what she does, because that leads to self-consciousness, which is never good for creativity.So she was “kind of relieved” when the tour was cancelled. “But I remember I used to pray the school would burn down before a math test the next day. Yet if it had actually burned down I would have felt so guilty. So now I’m thinking, ‘Oh dear, be careful what you wish for!’” she says.Phone interviews are generally frustrating, a mess of missed connections and awkward interruptions. But Tyler has a manner that is as open and engaging as her prose, her conversation punctuated by charming anachronisms such as “bestir” and “alas”, and it soon feels as if I know her as well as I know her brilliantly drawn characters. As I, too, am now working from home I start by apologising for the background noise of children and dogs. “Oh I love to hear children and dogs! That sounds good to me. I love normal life,” she says.For the past half-century, Tyler has been the pre-eminent novelist of normal life. She is famously good at summing up a character in a precise line (“She had not grown fuller or softer with age. She was like certain supermarket vegetables that turn from green to withered without ever ripening” – from Dinner at the Homesick Restaurant, 1982), but twice she tells me she is “no good at plot, as I’m sure you’ve noticed”. It’s true that no one would mistake aTyler novel for a John Grisham, but no one can match her evocation of the moments that build up a life: the awkward family meals, the day your spouse suddenly seems like a stranger, trying to make sense of how you have become the adult you are today, the conflicted gestures we make at trying to be good. “Time passing is a plot. You can’t not have something happen if the years go by,” she says.As a child, Tyler’s favourite book was the American classic The Little House by Virginia Lee Burton, about a house watching a city sprout up around it. Her fans – who have ranged from John Updike to Jacqueline Wilson to Nick Hornby – will recognise her memory of hoping the school would burn down as classic Tyler: her novels are studded with adult characters evoking childhood sensations, pleating time, revealing the truth of the adult through the child they were. In 2018’s Clock Dance, a widow compares recovering from grief to “rainy days in her childhood when she would resign herself to staying in, reading or watching daytime TV, and then in the afternoon the sun would break through unexpectedly and she would think, Oh. I guess I can go outside now. Isn’t that … a good thing, I guess.” In The Accidental Tourist, Macon Leary empathetically imagines his young son Ethan’s last moments before he was killed in a violent crime: “meekly moving to the kitchen with the others, placing his hands flat against the wall as he was ordered and no doubt bouncing slightly on the balls of his feet”.“I’m more in touch with my emotions and the visceral sensory from childhood than any other part of life. I don’t know if it helps with creativity, but I do know that when I talk to other writers they talk about their childhood in great detail,” Tyler says. (She also still has residues of that childlike belief that one can make something happen by thinking about it. Just as she used to worry she would cause the school to burn down through wishing it, when I ask how she could bear to write the scene of Ethan’s murder in The Accidental Tourist, she says she deliberately made him younger than her two daughters were then, “so I wouldn’t think as they came up to that age, ‘Oh no, what have I set in motion?’”)Her new novel, Redhead by the Side of the Road, her 23rd, features many of the usual Tyler tropes. Its protagonist, Micah, is a man, as so many of Tyler’s greatest characters are, which is partly why she has so many male fans. Writing in this paper in 2012, Mark Lawson put her cross-gender appeal down to the way “she deals sympathetically and redemptively with male fecklessness and helplessness”. Tyler grew up with three brothers and was happily married for 34 years to Taghi Mohammad Modarressi, an Iranian psychiatrist, until his death in 1997. “I am very comfortable writing as a man, and I think that’s because I had really good men in my life. They made me feel comfortable and I thought, ‘OK, they’re not so different from me,’” she says.Like many of Tyler’s male characters – Ian in Saint Maybe, Barnaby in A Patchwork Planet, Jesse in Breathing Lessons, Ezra in Dinner at the Homesick Restaurant – Micah has let his life drift past him after a youthful regret. Like Macon in The Accidental Tourist, he tries to counter the loss of control over his life by adhering to self-coined rules about when he cleans the kitchen, how he makes the bed, how he drives. “Micah” even sounds like “Macon”, but when I ask Tyler if the echo was deliberate she says no. “But I do often have fantasies about my characters ending up in the same little part of town and running into one another, so I can picture Micah and Macon doing that.”Like all of Tyler’s characters, Micah lives in Baltimore, as Tyler herself has done for more than 50 years. She has said that she’s a writer so she can live out different lives, but it seems that whatever life she imagines, she always wants to live in Baltimore. “Yes, that’s probably true. It’s a city with character, but it is also laziness on my part – by setting the book here I don’t have to do much research,” she says with easy self-deprecation. I cannot let that pass: her books are full of meticulous research, such as the accurate period details in her decades-ning family sagas, The Amateur Marriage and A Spool of Blue Thread. She meticulously writes her books out in longhand multiple times, and then reads them into a recorder and listens back to make sure the dialogue suits each character and there are no clangers. The idea that Tyler defaults to anything in her books out of laziness is nonsense – she just loves her city.“It’s true, I do love it,” she says. “It’s funny, it was a total accident that I came to the city, it was just for my husband’s job. For the first two years we were saying, ‘We made a mistake, let’s go back.’ But then you sink in, little by little.”Unlike her other novels, Redhead by the Side of the Road features multiple references to current events. Micah avoids watching the news because it’s too “depressing”, but he can’t block out the “unspeakably sad” bulletins from his clock radio: “a mass shooting in a synagogue whole families are dying in Yemen immigrant children torn from their parents will never, ever be the same, even if by some unlikely chance they are reunited tomorrow.”“I was writing the book already by the time Trump was in office and all that was going on. So I consciously felt it would be immoral to pretend life was just la la la. I don’t want to be one of those people who ties their novel to current events so it’s practically out of a newspaper, but at the same time I felt I should mention that it is an unhappy time,” she says. Her books often end optimistically, showing human kindness. But is she having trouble maintaining that optimism about humanity in the current political climate? She hesitates for a second. “Not up close, if you know what I mean. Up close you’ll always see things to be optimistic about.”Tyler grew up in Quaker communities around the south and midwest, the eldest of four children. She did not attend mainstream school until she was 11, and a common theme in her books is a character looking at the “normal” world and trying to understand how it works, such as Micah feeling bewildered by the happy couples he sees on his morning jogs, or Aaron flummoxed by marriage in The Beginner’s Goodbye: “It seemed we just never quite got the hang of being a couple the way other people did. We should have taken lessons or something that’s what I tell myself.”“One of the first things that happened when I joined the school was I was surrounded by these girls and they were asking me all these questions. One said, ‘Do you have a boyfriend?’ And I said, ‘Oh, I’m only 11.’ And she said, ‘I know, do you have a boyfriend?’ And I thought, ‘Oh, I’m in another world here.’ It was very tough to figure out, and I remember it very clearly,” Tyler says. While at university, she started to write short stories, and then published her first novel, The Tin Can Tree, when she was 23. Aside from a five-year break to raise her daughters, she has written steadily ever since.“I know the world does not need another book from me, but I have nothing else to do with myself. I have no hobbies. So then I feel guilty when I say to my agent, ‘I seem to have another book ready if you want to take a look at it …’” she says. Her ideal day would involve several hours of “good involved writing, the kind when you suddenly look up and three hours have gone by”.While liking Tyler’s books is as uncontroversial as liking chocolate, there have been some criticisms over the years, some more fair than others. Those who dismiss her as sentimental (“our foremost NutraSweet novelist”, one American critic wrote) overlook the biting humour in her work. “Repetitive” is more merited, although the familiar plots are shells for her elegant writing and characterisation, which are never boring. Yet I’ve found some of her more recent novels less satisfying than her mid-career peak of Dinner at the Homesick Restaurant, The Accidental Tourist and Breathing Lessons. The New York Times’ former book critic Michiko Kakutani put it more strongly in 2012 when she complained that instead of the “intimate knowledge of her characters’ inner lives” we get in Tyler’s earlier books, the characters in The Beginner’s Goodbye are “irritating stick figures”.But Tyler is her own best critic. She recently reread The Accidental Tourist for the first time in many years. “And one of the things I thought was, ‘I think I was a better writer when I was younger.’” What made her think that? “I was more detailed, I took more time. It’s not as if I’m in a rush now, but I trust the reader more. I don’t feel like I have to say that much about the character’s inner feelings. But then as I read The Accidental Tourist I thought, ‘Well, it’s kind of nice to see all of Macon’s inner feelings there.’” Aptly for a writer who always sees the best in her characters, Tyler’s mistake was perhaps trusting some of her readers too much.Her daughters live in Philadelphia and San Francisco, and Tyler knows she has a tendency towards self-isolation, whether there’s a global pandemic or not, “and I don’t think that’s always healthy”. So “to bring the world into me”, she has – when life is normal – regular nights at her home with friends, including a weekly friendship group she calls “Wine Therapy”. She is already working on her next book, “and once again, it’s about a family and set in Baltimore”, she says in a tone of pure self-mockery. Then with the grace that comes from a lifetime of self-knowledge, sinking in little by little, she adds, “And I love all that.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b87e426b45992d3706ec1330f25183078df530d9/0_0_5475_3285/master/5475.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0e8b0246c4d2d75fbd59686bb877e616","title":"coronavirus exposed myth british exceptionalism","story":"Boris Johnson’s first response was at odds with the rest of the world. But this virus does not respect his delusions of national characterThere is now the terrible possibility that Britain may match or even overtake Italy and Spain as the country in Europe that suffers most from the coronavirus pandemic. This tragedy has a political, as well as a biological, epidemiology. Those seeking to trace its path may look back on a telling moment – paradoxically the one at which the government finally changed course and fell into line with most of the rest of Europe. On 20 March, Boris Johnson announced the closure of pubs, clubs and restaurants. Even as he did so, however, he made it clear that this decision was an assault on the national character.“We’re taking away the ancient, inalienable right of free-born people of the United Kingdom to go the pub,” he said. “And I can understand how people feel about that.” Lest his anguish be in any doubt, he underscored the point: “To repeat, I know how difficult this is, how it seems to go against the freedom-loving instincts of the British people.” The message was – what exactly? You must not go to the pub but your right to do so is “inalienable” (which is to say absolute and irrevocable). You must stay at home but, if you so do, you will be a disgrace to your freedom-loving ancestors.The Sun reported the prime minister’s remarks rather differently: “Mr Johnson said he realised it went against what he called ‘the inalienable free-born right of people born in England to go to the pub’.” In this version, the freedom to go to the pub was conferred by genetics and history, not on the “people of the United Kingdom” or “the British people”, but on “people born in England”. It does not apply to Scots, Welsh or Northern Irish people and certainly not to the 9.4 million people living in the UK who were born abroad. It is a particular Anglo-Saxon privilege.And since we are in the terrain of the ludicrous, the Sun’s version actually made more sense. There is, of course, no ancient and absolute right to go to the pub – inns and public houses have been regulated in England at least since the 15th century. But what Johnson was really evoking was a very specific English sense of exceptionalism, a fantasy of personal freedom as a marker of ethnic and national identity.That exceptionalism is not, alas, mere rhetorical self-indulgence. It helped to shape official policy towards the Covid-19 crisis. It lies behind both the idea that there should be a distinctive British response to this global challenge, and the assumption that there was something peculiarly unnatural in expecting Brits to obey drastic restrictions. Its legacy is the globally discredited policy of “herd immunity” and the late introduction, squandering Britain’s head start, of the lockdown.The prime minister himself has long cultivated the notion that he does not just espouse this freedom-loving exceptionalism – he embodies it. In the early stages of the crisis, Johnson’s admirers could see it as his Finest Hour, the moment when his Churchillian posturing would become real and he would save his country. When the prime minister was hospitalised, his overwrought friend and fan Toby Young confessed in the Spectator to “a kind of mystical belief in Britain’s greatness and her ability to occasionally bring forth remarkable iniduals … who can serve her at critical junctures. I’ve always thought of Boris as one of those people – not just suspected it, but known it in my bones.”Being drunk on freedom is one way for the chosen people to “do their own thing”. Adopting a distinctive national approach to a global pandemic is another. The myth of a unique and defining love of personal freedom as a badge of nationhood underpinned a profound reluctance to impose life-saving restrictions on movement and social gatherings. Other people might put up with that sort of thing, but not the English. On the altar of this exceptionalism, lives have been sacrificed.This innate, genetic resistance to conformity is a myth. This is obvious from the persistence of an equal and opposite cliche of Englishness: the queue. George Orwell could rhapsodise “the gentle-mannered, undemonstrative, law-abiding English” and “the orderly behaviour of English crowds, the lack of pushing and quarrelling, the willingness to form queues”. The anthropologist Kate Fox wrote: “During the London riots in August 2011, I witnessed looters forming an orderly queue to squeeze, one at a time, through the smashed window of a shop they were looting.” Orderliness is just as prominent as waywardness in the English self-image – which suggests that neither of these truisms is ancient, inalienable or worth a damn when you are making policy in a time of plague.The exceptionalist “freedom-loving instinct” has little to do with history and much more to do with current politics, specifically the politics of Brexit. Johnson described as “magnificent” a 2014 book by the arch-Brexiter Daniel Hannan called How We Invented Freedom – “we” being the Anglo-Saxons. Hannan expressly reclaimed the idea of exceptionalism, the freedom-loving Anglo-Saxons being the exception especially to European slavishness. Brexit, as he argued, was one imperative of this dichotomy. Tragically, a notion that the UK could ignore the World Health Organization and do its own thing with the virus was another.Covid-19, as Johnson himself discovered in the most awful way, doesn’t make exceptions. The threat is universal. And the shield against it – the NHS – is cosmopolitan and global. There are 200 different nationalities represented in its ranks by 150,000 doctors, nurses and ancillary staff. One consolation in this disaster is the realisation that Britain is exceptionally lucky to have them.• Fintan O’Toole is a columnist with the "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/380e30eadbc4d6a6d66b5ab6e98a103e1a32998e/0_0_5000_3333/master/5000.jpg?width=480\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=bbf8520eef6de27649f2a85d0f6e8b11 960w","title":"so merch for all that how bernie sanders became politics least likely style icon","story":"Never has one man in inexpensive rumpled suits been so loved by the style set - but Sanders’ clothes signal an authenticity other politicians can only dream ofOf all the things we’ll miss about Bernie Sanders, now that he has dropped out of the Democratic race, his style should be the least of it.

The inconspicuousness of his geography teacher shoes are matched only by his inoffensive navy round-neck jumpers.Yet this is also a man who in 2017 received fashion’s equivalent of a knighthood when his logo was riffed on by the one of the biggest names in fashion, the Balenciaga designer Demna Gvasalia, for his autumnwinter 2017 menswear collection.He has been the subject of high-fashion meme treatment thanks to Siduations, an Instagram account that first had the industry tickled back in 2017, and his merch, emblazoned with his name and likeness, has been regularly spotted on influencers with Instagram accounts boasting 20 million-plus followers.Rarely has a politician been so loved by the fashion world, and so vocal in his – at best – ambivalence towards all things fashion. When Sanders was asked on CNN about whether he ever expected to be a muse to Balenciaga, he chuckled: “Of my many attributes, being a great dresser or a fashion maven is not one of them”.So what is it about the senator that gets fashion’s juices flowing?Despite his protestations, there is a valid case for Bernie as style icon. It has been said that, as a young man, he had “incredible podcast dude energy”. In more recent years, he has  found favour for his massive mittens. Likened to oven gloves, they have merited their own Twitter account, tag line: “Feeling the BERN not the BURN.”Sanders has inadvertently become a hero of gorpcore – a trend for all things Mountain Warehouse. Hailing from Vermont, it’s perhaps unsurprising that he has a thing for the kind of big coat that fashion loves, ideal for walks among the Norway spruces and red maples of his home state.In the world of style, which courts the carefree, his haphazardness has an undeniable appeal. “Bernie always, always turns up in rumpled clothing,” says Lauren Gambino, the ’s US political correspondent. “His jackets never fit, he always has dandruff.” As one Minneapolis-Saint Paul stylist who worked with Sanders for a shoot said of Sanders’ no-fuss style: “I lint rolled and I was out.”Even the mechanics of his dressing have won him support. In a political landscape where many politicians fail the “how much does a pint of milk cost” test, Sanders marks himself out by his relatable clothes chair. You know the one, piled high with discarded garments you have yet to rehang.He wears suits from Kohl’s, the US equivalent of Debenhams, in stark contrast to the Brioni or Armani suits hanging in Trump’s wardrobe. And he has been acing rumpled style since before Boris Johnson was out of nappies. Odes have been written to it in which he – “a rumpled wren” – is held up in stark contrast to the usual peacocks of politics. His shirts are strangers to irons and his hair has a windswept quality: a breath of fresh air in the coiffed corridors of the Capitol building.But Sanders doesn’t set his sights on dishevelment, that’s just the way he is. And it’s the bona fide nature of his tousled look that chimes with what the  columnist Jonathan Freedland says is one of the most important qualities for any politician, especially in recent years: “Authenticity: the sense that you are seeing the real person, rather than a manufactured or polished product.”In that context, Freedland says, “a politician who does not appear to have been styled by advisers … immediately conveys through their dress that they are different – that they are their own person, that they listen to their conscience rather than to spin doctors and handlers, that they are people of principle and conviction and that, perhaps, they care too deeply about serious issues to be bothered with such trivia as their personal appearance.”Gambino agrees, linking his rumpled personal style with his personality: “He is just so focused on his message that he doesn’t care about anything else.” The lines of his suit are as blunt as his policies and message are sharp. But she points out the gendered double standard – imagine if one of Hillary Clinton’s suits had not been freshly de-creased.Merch is a massive part of all politicians’ campaigns in the US – Hillary had her tote bags, Trump has his Maga cap, Obama had the Shepard Fairey “Hope” T-shirt – but Sanders particularly, according to Gambino, relied on his merch for the kind of small-dollar fundraising that turned the wheels of his campaign. “He really knows how to tap into these people who maybe don’t make a lot of money but still want to donate to the campaign.”Sanders’s official merch is largely red, white and blue – his name emblazoned on crew neck T-shirts as American as McDonald’s, but with a clearer sense of corporate responsibility. There are Pride tees that switch the colours of the stars and stripes for rainbow hues and affectionate “Tio Bernie” tees aimed at Latino voters.Sanders has also inspired his fair share of grassroots designs. The dogged proponent of universal free school meals and rent control has appeared on T-shirts that read: “Bernie is my comrade”. On others, cats hugging against zany intergalactic backdrops, and one, as spotted on the model and influencer Emily Ratajkowski as well as fashion-forward actor Chloë Sevigny, that reads “Rage Against the Machine”.“It aligns with all kinds of punk and hardcore and subculture ideology,” says Sonya Sombreuil, the artist behind the latter tee, the sales of which made more than $80,000 for Sanders’s campaign. There’s something fitting about that given his decades of railing against the establishment.Perhaps in part because of his constant “it’s not about me” message, Sanders has inspired an unusually devoted following. “He starkly lacked vanity,’” says Sombreuil, “and in that way it allowed all these different groups to interpret him and see their own vision in him.”“I’m not someone who has ever worn any political merchandise,” says the New York-based artist Nicole Ginelli, whose “Bernie Barbie” raised funds for Sanders in 2016 and 2020. “I think a lot of people who buy the Bernie shirts are that way, too. They’re not political nerds, they’ve been put off by the political system here.” It’s one thing to wear a Ramones T-shirt when you may or may not have listened to Bonzo Goes to Bitburg once, wearing a politician on your chest speaks of aligned values more directly.Having read their fair share of Slavoj Žižek, Sanders supporters may also have a natural inclination to DIY merch. “People don’t necessarily want to get their merch from huge retailers,” says Ginelli, whose T-shirts were made locally: “it’s not in line with Bernie’s values and honouring the workers in that supply chain.”The DIY aesthetic and proliferation of Bernie merch also comes down to the centrality of the youth vote. “He wins the millennials,” says Gambino. “They’re more creative and internet-savvy and so can create merchandise.” Ginelli’s design, fittingly, started as a gif on Tumblr.But it is also down to the man himself. Gambino points to Michael Bloomberg, who paid meme-ers and influencers to try to make him likable. “Bernie doesn’t have to do that, he’s naturally ironic and funny and kooky.” Kook and irony will never go out of style."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e25888d8cede096bf13edaf191f5220edfd42b53/0_1072_3724_2232/master/3724.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fe476a8f63e2386b994e80bbfb244c7d","title":"meera sodha vegan recipe asparagus thoran","story":"With homegrown asparagus now hitting the shops, here’s a novel way to make use of those glorious spearsNever has a comment been so barbed as when a dish is described as a side.

For me, however, the fun – by which I mean the simple, tasty dishes that always see people reaching for more – lies more often in the quick and easy, fresh and fast sides. Here I offer two such dishes: they’re both good to go for this weekend’s big meal or to file away until spring is fully sprung and we can all, hopefully, venture out into the sun.This understated side dish is dressed up enough to keep everyone at the table happy, but simple enough not to steal the show from the main course. It would pair really well with roast chicken or grilled seafood. You can make the sauce well in advance – just warm it through while you’re cooking the polenta – but don’t make the polenta until just before you’re about to serve, otherwise it’s likely to set.Prep 20 minCook 45 minServes 4 as a sideFor the sauce1 onion, peeled and cut into 8 wedges (150g net weight)150g datterini tomatoes, or regular cherry tomatoes4 tbsp olive oil6 garlic cloves, peeled and crushed750g vine tomatoes, core removed and finely chopped into 1cm dice (seeds and all)1 tsp caster sugar5g oregano sprigs (leaves and stalks), plus 1½ tbsp leaves extra to serve (or use basil or parsley instead)Salt and black pepperFor the polenta500ml chicken stock350ml whole milk60g unsalted butter200g quick-cook polenta150g gruyère, roughly gratedPut a large saute pan on a high heat and, once very hot, add the onion wedges and cook, turning regularly, for about six minutes, until very well charred on the outside. Transfer to a plate, then put the tomatoes in the same pan and char for another four minutes, or until nicely blistered in places. Transfer to the onion plate, but keep the two separate, and put the pan aside to cool slightly.Return the pan to a medium-high heat and add the oil and charred onion. Cook, stirring occasionally, for about two minutes, until slightly softened, then add the garlic and cook for another 30 seconds. Add the chopped vine tomatoes, sugar, oregano sprigs, 150ml water, a teaspoon of salt and plenty of pepper. Bring up to a simmer, then turn down the the heat to medium and leave to cook for about 15 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the tomatoes have started to break down. Add the charred tomatoes and cook for seven minutes more, until they’ve started to soften and the sauce has thickened. Keep warm until ready to serve.Put the stock, milk, 100ml water, half the butter, a teaspoon and a quarter of salt and a good grind of pepper in a medium saucepan on a medium-high heat. Bring to a gentle simmer, turn the heat to medium-low and pour in the polenta in a slow, steady stream, whisking continuously, until completely incorporated. Carry on whisking for two to three minutes more, or until the polenta is cooked and the mixture is still quite wet and loose.Stir in the cheese and remaining butter, then spread out the polenta on a large platter. Spoon the tomato sauce on to the polenta, gently swirling some of it in, top with the extra oregano leaves and serve warm.The natural sweetness of the peas and onions goes a long way to making this very simple dish, with very few ingredients, taste rather special.Prep 10 minCook 35 minServes 4 as a side2 tbsp unsalted butter60ml olive oil2 onions, peeled and finely choppedSalt500g frozen petit pois, defrosted10g chives, finely choppedPut the butter, two tablespoons of oil, the onions and three-quarters of a teaspoon of salt in a large saute pan on a medium heat, and cook for 16-18 minutes, stirring often, until soft and deeply golden.

I had been so astonished at an early scene in the recently released Final Fantasy VII, the video game that first demonstrated the cinematic possibilities of the medium as it shifted into three-dimensional art and design, that I had to share my amazement. (He smiled an academic’s smile, then excused himself, probably in much the same way as his father reacted on first encountering the Beach Boys, or Doctor Who.) Final Fantasy VII has subsequently become a sort of Star Wars for many of my generation: a cultural landmark we long to revisit in the hope of experiencing the same sense of childlike wonder and panoramic potential as the first time.Fully understanding the singular place Final Fantasy VII holds in both hearts and history (this was one of the first video games to be made at blockbuster scale), Tokyo-based maker Square Enix has waited for technology to sufficiently advance before attempting to rebuild the game to contemporary standards. Now, finally, nostalgic players can discover if reality matches memory, while newcomers may judge whether this seminal game warrants all the fuss.This first instalment in an as-yet undecided number of episodes returns players to the sprawling city of Midgar and the boots of protagonist Cloud Strife, a young mercenary and ex-officer from a private army run by the Shinra Electric Power Company. It seems improbable that a utility provider should have its own militia, but Shinra has a monopoly on Mako, Final Fantasy VII’s equivalent of crude oil, which has made it into a powerful entity – something like a militarised Google. Power has corrupted the company, which now draws the planet’s lifeblood at an unsustainable rate. The game opens on a bombing mission: Cloud has joined a group of eco-terrorists attempting to blow up one of Shinra’s reactors as an act of protest.The remake has been an obvious passion project for the development team, tasked with extrapolating fine detail from the rudimentary strokes of the original, while transposing the ponderous turn-based battles into an action thriller. But where 1997’s game represented an era-defining technological high point, Japan’s industry now lags behind the west in delivering cinematic pizzazz in this regard, despite a spirited attempt, Final Fantasy VII Remake falls short of semi-rival series such as Uncharted and The Witcher. Nonetheless, the game fizzes with creativity and memorable set pieces, from sword-fighting in a derelict cathedral, to teetering along scaffolding miles above the city streets, to attempting to break into a crime boss’s brothel in the Wall Market, a striking mishmash of Tokyo’s seedy Kabukichō and Kowloon’s infamous Walled City.The world is occasionally confused. One of Cloud’s love interests, Aerith Gainsborough, boasts of growing up streetwise in the slums, yet she lives with her mother in an impossibly idyllic countryside cottage a few dozen yards away from the shantytown housing that otherwise dominates the area. This is a creative team often more interested in world-drawing than world-building, the underpinning logic work that makes any fiction feel true it’s notable that the director of the remake is an artist, not a writer.At times camp, at times dated, the game is sometimes adolescent and occasionally tedious (stacking shipping containers using crane arms to pick your way through a derelict tunnel is a particularly trying section). And yet that enthralling harmony of character, story and setting, which seeded so much long-held adoration for the game, remains undiminished. In part it’s thanks to the city of Midgar, a rich and unforgettable location. But it’s also because, unlike many other games in the Final Fantasy series, the story is well-plotted, with clear stakes, distinct characters with legible motivations, and even a meaningful allegory for players who, in their millions, will play the game on electronic devices powered by fossil fuels.Praising a video game for qualities that in any other medium would be considered fundamental might seem condescending. But writing effective stories for video games is a difficult business. As Frank Lantz, director of New York University’s game studies department, once put it: “Games are basically operas made out of bridges.” Final Fantasy VII Remake is both an unfinished construction project and an unfinished opera, then. Its ultimate shape will surely depend on the success of this debut episode, but as a (substantial) taster and a statement of intent, it is a triumph.The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt(CD Projekt Red PS4, Xbox One, PC and Nintendo Switch)"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/587e470b72dea05a180d93d7c13cdfe1a1262dfb/0_94_3000_1800/master/3000..jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=39d1b3dde96b32b4c61f2923c7df4c20","title":"small talk and ready made sandwiches things i dont miss about normal life","story":"I’ve been thinking about Nora Ephron’s lists, not because I’m dying, but because normal life has, for now, died for all of usI’ve been reading a lot of Nora Ephron recently because, well, who needs a reason? Although in this case, there is one. I miss spending time with my friends – in person, that is, as opposed to through a screen. My friends are, in the vast main, funny and smart women, and in the absence of meeting up with them in the pub or park, I get into bed every night with Ephron, the smartest, funniest and most female writer of all, who wrote just as brilliantly about feminist politics as she did about her frustration that her breasts weren’t bigger. (Honestly, Nora, the breast thing? It’s overrated.)When Ephron died in 2012, obituarists were spoiled for choice about which of her writings to quote: a pithy line from Heartburn, her novel about her orce, or an irresistible bit from When Harry Met Sally, which is every single line of that film. (“A Sheldon can do your taxes. If you need a root canal, Sheldon’s your man. But humping and pumping is not Sheldon’s strong suit.” I have a condition that makes it physically impossible for me to mention WHMS without quoting it.)Yet every journalist who covered her death quoted from the then little-known lists about what she would and wouldn’t miss after she died, from her final book, I Remember Nothing, which she wrote when she and almost no one else knew she was dying. What made those lists so affecting was that they were mainly small things, both specific and entirely relatable, like all of Ephron’s writing. Bras, polls and panels on Women in Film are not currently being missed by Ephron but dinner with friends, fireworks and pie are.I’ve been thinking about those lists, not because I’m dying, but because normal life has, for now, died for all of us. I have gone through the five stages of grief: shock that I am living through a global plague fear for those I love sadness about all the cancelled plans irritation with the lack of online delivery slots delusion that I’ll spend the next three months reading Proust instead of staring at my phone. (A mix of existential terror and petty flouncing sums up my feelings during All This.)I am lucky: no one in my family is sick (yet), but I miss normal life, when I didn’t leap in terror any time someone near me coughed, like a Victorian maiden. And yet, without wishing to seek out a nonexistent silver lining, there have also been things I don’t miss. They are all small things, but it’s only by focusing on the details that life feels manageable right now. Once I start thinking about the macro (my parents, my kids) instead of the micro (cancelled holidays, postponed cinema dates), hello, 3am insomnia.Yoga classes have become much more Zen. Instead of having to schlep to a studio, internally grumping if my favourite spot in the room (front right corner) is taken and then hating the person on the next mat for being so much better, I do online lessons alone in my bedroom. I always get the best spot and I am definitely the best in the room. So much time and internalised fuming saved!When I was pregnant with my twins during a heatwave, I resented the impediments to my physical freedom. But then I realised the upside: no one could give me any grief for having an elective C-section – or hiring six gold-painted men to carry me around on a plinth, should I so desire. Self-isolation has, weirdly, brought a similar release. No longer do I have to feel guilty for not going to this or that play, as I chronically do, even though I hate the theatre because I can never figure out when to eat dinner (Sondheim musicals are the exception). Now I have all the time in the world for dinner. There is a freedom in imprisonment: the essentials take root, the flotsam floats away.Speaking of the essentials, I can exclusively confirm that it is not easy to work with three children under five running around the house. In my lower moments, I have looked at the comparative freedom of my childfree friends with the same envy with which they now look at my garden. But it is lovely to eat three meals a day with my kids, and to see how much they love it, too. Self-isolating with their parents is, I have realised, a small child’s fantasy come to life. (This is possibly less true of teenagers. Turns out my decision to wait to have kids until I was 102 really worked out for the best.)Here, then, is the official list of things I do and do not miss.What I miss The first sip of a cool drink in a dark bar bumping into a friend getting a late cab home and listening to Magic FM booking holidays, especially with friends ice-cream in a cone.What I don’t Small talk feeling guilty about not having people over for dinner cold afternoons in the playground ready-made sandwiches.Yes, small things. But Harry realised he loved Sally when he loved that it took her an hour and a half to order a sandwich. As Ephron understood better than anyone, when life feels overwhelming, it’s the insignificant details that are the most revealing."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4dde068b4186c1a94c086736f27a3bb296a748e1/0_0_1080_648/master/1080.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6753112009a990ee34d1edf2c2933044","title":"celebrities happy in their own skin dont take it at face value","story":"Hollywood stars are using time in isolation to encourage honesty, but often there is more to ‘no makeup’ than meets the eye At last Hollywood is revealing its unvarnished side. An increasing number of actresses – including Julia Roberts, Julianne Moore and Drew Barrymore – are posting makeup-free selfies while in isolation as they embrace the trend to go bare-faced.But beauty experts warn there is a degree of smoke and mirrors – and politics – at play within the concept of what constitutes “no makeup”.Bunny Kinney, editor-in-chief of magazine Dazed Beauty, said: “It’s a reassuring gesture brought upon by influential women who want to show a fearlessness, a solidarity and an encouragement of all people to celebrate the skin they live in.”But she added: “It’s so easy for audiences to compare themselves to influencers by really taking them only at face value, based on how they are presenting themselves in a highly curated and controlled way without any grasp of what is really going on behind the scenes.”And what is going on “behind the scenes” can be the creation of a bare-faced look that is just as complicated as a fully made-up one.In 2018 a fan reposted a picture of the beauty vlogger Gina Shkeda (885,000 followers) looking makeup free, alongside the hashtag #naturalbeauty. But on Twitter Shkeda rebutted this claim by saying: “Girl, I have micro-bladed brows, lash extensions in and lip injections – I don’t even look like this.”Shkeda’s revelation could have seen her taken apart by trolls and “cancelled”, but instead she was praised. “Generation Z has no time for influencers that aren’t honest and open about who they are,” said Sarah Jindal, associate director of global beauty and personal care at market researcher Mintel.The no-makeup trend, alongside the clean beauty ideology (mindfully created, toxin-free products) is part of the “emotional beauty” movement, which represents a return to the “honesty, authenticity and transparency that have been the hallmarks of Generation Z’s beauty evolution,” said Charlotte Delobelle of forecasting agency Fashion Snoops, who coined the term.The movement arguably began in 2014, when Leandra Medine Cohen wrote a post called Why I Don’t Wear Make Up for her Man Repeller site. It was a treatise of radical self-acceptance. “I am comfortable with how I look,” she wrote. “I don’t hate what I see when I look in the mirror.”When the beauty blogger Kadeeja Khan moved from standard beauty posts to bare-faced images of her struggle with cystic acne, she was praised for promoting skin positivity in all its forms.“It’s important for my audience to understand that if you don’t have the ‘perfect skin or perfect body’ that it’s normal,” she said. “There is no such thing as perfection and it’s important to share that reality with my followers.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bf33e1e669a127d8a195baaec390370776848bff/168_0_3745_2248/master/3745.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cf69c34026910028bf01b9f972bf97e7","title":"country diary glyn ceiriog clwyd quarry tramway birds","story":"Glyn Ceiriog, Clwyd: No climbers today brave Hendre’s precarious walls, and daffodils grow by the old tramwayMemory hold the door! My last spring outing before lockdown, I drove steep lanes from Llangollen to the Finger Farm on an eastern ridge of Y Berwyn, from which you look south and west along hill-enfolded Glyn Ceiriog. I’d come to walk the Ceiriog Valley tramway – an old favourite of mine.A dipper, creamy bib gleaming among ambient greys, gave its chinking flight-call as it sped upriver. Water ouzel is the old name for these tubby, hyperactive birds. It fits somehow, though they’re no relation to the ring ouzel, a rare thrush that frequents high streams of the Berwyn moorland where the Afon Ceiriog rises.Little, frilled daffodils of Wales were in flower by the old railway bridge at Pandy. I glanced across to the inn. George Borrow and his guide, John Jones, called there on the walking tour described in Wild Wales (1862) – one of the great classics of British travel writing. They pondered the case of a man who chose to walk an extra mile from home for inferior ale rather than the excellent brew provided here. In the pub parlour a drunken stonemason held forth to them – proof that the widespread quarrying in this valley was already under way in 1854. He recited poems by Huw Morys (aka Eos Ceiriog, “the Ceiriog Nightingale”, 1622-1709), who lived at nearby Pont y Meibion, his Welsh verse radically innovative, influential in its relaxed musicality.Pub closed, I carried on along the tramway, peering left into the huge chasm of Hendre quarry. In the 1960s I’d climbed there, the ledges on its 120-metre wall of granitic rock littered with precarious blocks – “deployments of falsity … sufficient almost to prop up a fascist”, as John Menlove Edwards, tragic pioneer and finest of climbing essayists, wrote in the 1930s about another appallingly loose Welsh cliff. I remember shoving mighty specimens off their resting places, hearing the ensuing thunder between the walls, the cordite smell of their splintering drifting up.

Ros Humphries, founder of the Natural Dyeworks, says: “Onion skins are rich in tannins, so a good project for beginners. Wash your chosen fabric with a pH-neutral soap. Fill a large pan with water and add two large handfuls of onion skins. Simmer for an hour, then strain through a muslin cloth or tea towel. Wet your fabric, then immerse in the dye. Bring to just below simmer and ‘cook’ for up to an hour. Leave to cool overnight for the strongest shades. Expect warm yellows from brown onions and peachy pinks from red onions.”Seedlings take up loads of room: perennial vegetables bypass the sowing stage and are low maintenance, too. Some sound exotic and aren’t so easy to get hold of, such as Egyptian walking onions and sea beet there is also the more familiar horseradish, Jerusalem artichoke and rhubarb. Some common garden perennials that are considered ornamental are also edible, including the young shoots of Centranthus ruber (red valerian) or of Hosta sieboldii, and the buds and flowers of day lilies (Hemerocallis).

Whether it’s a meal for one or a family of six, lay the table to the max.” She suggests dusting off the best china and glasses, making calligraphy place names and menu cards, and arranging inidual flower stems in bud jars down the table in little groups. “If you can’t get flowers, herbs in pots will do the job nicely. Make iced biscuits and use them as part of the place setting.”If you see a plant with umbrella-like clusters of tiny flowers that look like a landing pad, it’s probably a member of the umbellifer family, which includes cow parsley and wild carrot. Parasitoid wasps love feeding on the flowers, and these are important predators who keep down common pests such as aphids and caterpillars. Bellifers often have lacy foliage that provides spots for insects to cool off and shelter, too.

Whether you carve a design into wood, lino or a potato, block printing is a soothing activity to do alone or with children. Textile designer Molly Mahon suggests: “Start with a simple pattern, such as a star, to get you going. Another good idea, if you can get out into nature, is to draw round a leaf – this shape makes a great printing pattern.”Lavishing all your spare time on caring for houseplants is no bad thing, but don’t overdo it with the watering can.Waterlogged roots may not be visible, but yellowing leaves are an early warning sign that all is not well below the surface. Counterintuitively, wilting can also be a sign of overwatering. Take the plant out of its pot, cut away any slimy roots and repot into fresh houseplant potting mix, making sure there are plenty of drainage holes.For plants with leathery leaves such as monstera (Swiss cheese plant) and philodendrons, take a damp cloth and gently wipe the surface of each leaf: furry leaves such as African violets and spiny cacti can be cleaned gently with a dry, clean, soft makeup brush or paintbrush.

Meeting him was like being reunited with an old friend and made me want to speak to other siblings who connected later in life “I’d always wanted a brother,” says Declan Aumpu, the first time we meet. It’s April 2017, and I am 23 years old. Dec, 26, has arrived in the back of a friend’s van after a big night out. He is clearly nervous and has hardly slept. I’m anxious, too.It’s strange that we have never met, especially since so many people know we are half-brothers, and I gulp back feelings of regret and shame. We don’t look much alike, beside our smiles, which curl up on the left-hand side of our mouths, but there is an instant connection an immediate ease in each other’s company. As we embrace outside the Merlin’s Cave pub in Chalfont St Giles, south Buckinghamshire, it’s like being reunited with an old friend.Later, in the pub, Dec tells me he was “forever envious of the bond that brothers seemed to share”, a feeling that only grew when, around the age of eight, he found out about me. He also explains that this is not our first meeting: more than two decades ago, we spontaneously played together with a boules set in a pub garden in nearby Chalfont St Peter, where our parents had grown up. Dec’s mum, Tracey, beckoned him away as soon she realised who I was. I had no idea of the identity of my fleeting playmate. Dec drinks Stella mine is a Guinness. The barman asks who I am, since Dec is a regular here, and Dec proudly says that I’m his brother. Noticing the height difference between us (I’m 6ft 4in and Dec is 5ft 8in), the barman raises an eyebrow and makes a joke about me being put into a grow bag at an early age.I only learned of Dec’s existence relatively recently. When my parents first got together in 1991, my dad, Nick, then 27, told my mother, Mandy, 26, about a rumour going around that he had recently fathered a child he said it wasn’t true, and my mum believed him. Soon afterwards, they moved from Chalfont St Peter to the more affordable town of Fenny Stratford, near Milton Keynes, where they had me and my younger brother, Rory. My mum heard nothing more about this rumour until many years later, when my uncle Andy referred to my dad’s “other son” during a conversation with my aunt Judy she later told my mother.Not wanting to disrupt Rory’s GCSEs, Mum spent the next six months silently seething, before confronting Dad. Clearly regretful and contrite, he eventually told us about our half-brother as we slowly chewed paneer at an Indian buffet in July 2016. He claimed he had been warned to stay away from his baby son after his friendship with Tracey broke down, and that he had duly done so. Tracey has since said she had wanted him to be either a constant presence in Dec’s life, or not present at all, and he had conceded that he was not ready to be a father. I was, and still am, bewildered: the dad I knew had never shied away from truth and responsibility.Once the news had sunk in, I got in touch with Dec, a landscape gardener and builder, on Facebook, and we arranged to meet. We settled on the Merlin’s Cave, where he and my dad had met a handful of times since 2010, after my parents separated and my dad sent Tracey a Facebook friend request. Dec is keen to build a relationship with Dad, but neither of them are very good at texting each other back, never mind socialising or making time for enriching activities. Nor am I.Dec tells me that, growing up in Chalfont St Peter, most people viewed his connection to the Busbys as a matter not to be spoken about. Tracey struggled for money, and they spent time in a homeless hostel before moving to the next village. “I still get called ‘the bastard Busby’ down the pub,” he says. “And at school, there were these girls who would viciously bully me for not having a dad.” This prompted Tracey to tell him that his dad had another family. Then, at the age of eight, Dec was diagnosed with diabetes, and took part in a genetic study through this, he discovered our father’s name, and those of his half-siblings.Dec and I both spent large parts of our childhoods alone he is an only child, while Rory is six years younger than me, and we didn’t really connect until later in life. “If we’d been introduced when we were younger, it would have been a different experience,” Dec says now, three years after that first meeting. “But now you’re my little brother.” We may not see each other regularly, but we find comfort in keeping in touch to discuss our partners, work, family and the coronavirus. Just like brothers would.How does it feel for other siblings united in later life? Almost one in five British families have been touched by estrangement, according to research by the charity Stand Alone, and a million children across the UK have no significant contact with their father. Reenee Singh, a psychotherapist and CEO of the Association of Family Therapy, is clear about the emotional burden associated with this: “It can be very difficult for half-siblings to grow up knowing they have a family somewhere they’re not in contact with,” she says. “If their existence was a secret, it can leave them feeling confused, vulnerable, unprotected and insecure.”However, she warns against rushing into a meeting with an estranged sibling, pointing out that it is better to exchange photos, letters or messages on social media first. In my own case, she says: “You’re old enough to forge your own adult relationship and to bridge the gap between him and your father. The onus is on the siblings who have grown up with both their parents to reach out to their half-siblings.”Reunions aren’t always straightforward, as the 2018 documentary Three Identical Strangers, about triplets separated at birth, tragically showed. Although the three brothers experienced a joyful reunion, followed by fame and success, they all struggled with mental health issues. One of the siblings, Eddy, took his own life in 1995. Meanwhile, plenty of people live their lives never knowing the whole story about their families or how many siblings they have.My meeting with Dec had raised questions for us both, and made me want to speak to other people who had experienced something similar. How had they found their long-lost siblings? Had they been able to reconcile their different upbringings and move beyond pondering what might have been?Sandy, who lives in Petworth, West Sussex, was brought up in Carlisle by his grandparents. His father, Jan, disappeared shortly after he was born, and remarried twice, fathering a number of other children, including Paul. “I wasn’t close with my mum,” Sandy says. “She was more like an aunt to me. As a kid, you feel a sense of abandonment. For about two and a half years from the age of 12, I was a carer for my grandmother when my grandfather was at work.”When he was 18, Sandy visited Jan and his family in south Wales, to work out whether he should invite him to his wedding. It was during this visit that he discovered he had two younger siblings, Paul and Chantelle. But according to Paul, his parents told him that Sandy’s visit – during which he was told to stay upstairs – had been to ask for money. Further attempts to talk to his parents about his half-brother were quickly shut down. This may explain why, when Sandy tried to make contact with Paul 15 years ago, his friend request on Facebook was rejected. Paul says he simply wasn’t ready for another sibling, to share his father, or to grapple with his family’s past.Two years later, when Sandy was 40, and he and his wife were expecting their first child, he made a fresh attempt to get to know his half-siblings, first making contact with Chantelle. “We met up in Ireland and got on well,” Sandy says. Then, in 2018, when looking for other Buseks online, he happened to send a friend request to Lucy, Paul’s daughter, not realising she was his niece. “She printed a photo of me from Facebook and shoved it under his nose,” Sandy says.“My wife was gobsmacked,” Paul recalls. “I wouldn’t say we look like twins, but we are very similar. I felt driven to meet him because we clearly shared DNA.” In September 2018, Paul contacted Sandy on LinkedIn. They didn’t waste any time: three weeks later, Sandy flew to Bahrain to meet Paul, who works for a defence company in Saudi Arabia. According to Paul, the half-brothers got along “like a house on fire”, and later he and his family visited Sandy in the UK. “You don’t realise you’ve got space for another sibling, but when one turns up it’s like, ‘OK, yeah, this is great’,” Paul says.They noticed a number of coincidences. Sandy is teetotal, and Paul rarely drinks. They both enjoy luxury cars and clay pigeon shooting. Both brothers are 6ft 1in, weigh 105kg, and wear near-identical spectacles. They also have a similar fashion sense on the day they met for the first time, both were dressed in blue-and-white striped polo shirts. “We look so similar,” Paul says. “Incredibly similar bad taste, too.”“It’s spooky how many similarities there are,” Sandy agrees. “But there are differences, too: I was wrapped up in cotton wool by my grandparents, while he’s more of an alpha male after 26 years in the military.”Paul says: “I think he’s probably a nicer guy than me. He’s a bit more placid, more level-headed, but that might be the different nurturing he had from his side: I lived with our old man, he didn’t. He’s starting to see a less polished side to me as I open up.” Then he jokes: “I think he gets insanely jealous that I’m better-looking.”Although Sandy wishes he had grown up closer to his parents and half-siblings, he remains pragmatic. “I don’t sit here thinking life could’ve been so much better, but I have got some catching up to do.” This will become easier now that Paul’s family are planning a move from the Middle East to nearby Midhurst in West Sussex. “We didn’t know that part of the country, but when we visited Sandy we thought, ‘Bloody hell, we like it here’,” Paul says. “Whenever I’m back in the UK, my priority is to see my family and kids – and my brother.”Dougie grew up in Edinburgh in the 1950s, and never felt a sense of belonging. He remembers his stepfather, who had his own children, being unkind to him and his sister, not allowing them to celebrate their birthdays. When Dougie discovered his real surname at the age of 11, after it was read out from his birth certificate during his communion, he began asking questions. “But I was always told to shut up.”Then, one night, an aunt “spilled the beans”. He remembers learning that his mother had left his Irish father, Hugh, without explanation, in the early stages of her pregnancy with Dougie, not telling him she was bearing a child. “After that, it was always on my mind,” he says. “I had known from a young age there was something different about me, but if I asked it was, ‘lift the carpet, sweep it under’.”Dougie left home at 15 and moved to Ireland to work in construction in 1972. He didn’t start looking for his family in earnest until 2009, when he was made redundant. With his daughter, Katrina, Dougie began to do his research. They learned that, after the war, Hugh had worked in coal mines in Derbyshire Katrina tracked down his details from a list of workers from the period. “I was rattling, shaking, thinking, ‘What am I going to do now?’” Dougie says. By then, Hugh was seriously ill: he ignored their letters and denied the connection over the phone. Eventually he relented, asking if Katrina could send some pictures.Three months later, Hugh invited Dougie and his wife, Sally, to visit him in Derbyshire. Jo, Dougie’s half-sister, remembers opening the door to them in September 2012: “I looked at this poor, very nervous man who looked like he could have been my dad’s brother and said: ‘We couldn’t disown you,’” she says now. “He was one of us, for sure.”Dougie, who now lives in Kildare, south-west of Dublin, says he felt intense relief. “I went, ‘That’s it: mission accomplished.’ The first thing Jo told me was: ‘The apple hasn’t fallen far from the tree.’”Jo, who also lives in Ireland, had only found out about Dougie an hour before meeting him. “I was in England on work business and went to visit my dad,” she recalls. “He kept saying things like, ‘Ach, some fella from Scotland wants to come and see me.’ But just before he arrived, he said: ‘He says I could be his father.’”Dougie never found out what sparked his mother’s sudden flight. “I never asked any awkward questions,” he says. “I wasn’t going to go in bull-headedly. I set out to find him, and when I did, there was an ease there. There was no resentment.” Dougie continued to speak to his father regularly on the phone and, after he died in November 2017, kept in contact with Jo, who lives three hours north of him in Donegal. Now their families spend holidays together. “We’re brothers and sisters,” he says. “It feels like we’ve known each other for years, since birth. I couldn’t ask for anything better.” At family events, Dougie is often confused with his father. Five years ago, at a funeral, a cousin gasped in horror, thinking she had seen a ghost. Last summer, Jo arranged for Dougie and Sally to join her on a trip in their father’s home county of Donegal, to scatter Hugh’s ashes. Dougie did the honours: “I broke down,” he says. “I thought I would never get to that stage. The whole trip brought me closer to my roots.”“We’re really close now,” Jo says. “He’s definitely part of the family.” The spare room is now known as Dougie and Sally’s room, and they bought each other almost identical gifts for Christmas – shortbread biscuits in packaging featuring Highland terriers. “It’s really bizarre, the connection we have.”Peggy’s identity crisis began the moment she was born, in Brixton, south London, in 1959. Peggy is mixed race, but her mother and the man who thought he had fathered her were white. Her birth caused shockwaves, and her mother suddenly disappeared from her life when she was two weeks old. She also left behind Peggy’s half-sister, Linda, with whom she shared a cot.Peggy was put into an orphanage, and moved around the UK by the authorities, eventually ending up in a foster home at the age of 13. “Growing up, I was always told I was Jamaican,” she says. “But it was being an orphan that defined me. People would tell me I didn’t have the nose to be African-Caribbean. I felt my whole life that I didn’t belong. People had minimal expectations of me, and called me ‘half-caste’.” She went on to suffer from dissociative disorders, and struggled with drug misuse, self-harm and bulimia.She met her husband, and had two daughters with him, but Peggy says he was abusive and she continued to struggle. “Every time something happened to my daughter, if she fell down or hurt herself, my subconscious returned to how I was never cuddled when I was younger.”She remembers being in her early 30s and hearing a radio interview with John Cleese about Families And How To Survive Them, the bestselling self-help book he co-authored with therapist Robin Skynner in 1983. The interview referenced an experiment in which people who know nothing about each other have to decide who to pair up with for an activity. “The two people who have not grown up with their family always go together,” Peggy says. “I recognised myself in this: I have lots of friends, but I still keep myself slightly separated. I just started crying.”Peggy decided she needed to track down her family. Years before, on her 18th birthday, the Church of England had given her a piece of paper with her parents’ and siblings’ names on. In 1998, with the help of the Salvation Army, she found her elder half-brother Jack, who had grown up with his father, and away from their shared mother. But she could not find Linda, nor her eldest half-sister, Angela, who had been adopted. After her marriage unravelled, Peggy moved with her girls to the US in 2002, where she felt more at home. In 2009, she received a message on the family history site Ancestry from Mark, the husband of a 51-year-old Linda Sturman, asking her to confirm her name and date of birth. “He said, ‘I’m Mark, and I think I’m married to your sister.’ I cried all weekend.”The contact came after Linda’s father had unexpectedly told his family about Peggy and Angela, over Sunday lunch, before his death. “It was a shock,” Linda says. “I said I needed to go home and process everything, and then I tried to find my sisters. I looked at the birth registrations in Brixton, and found them.” Peggy describes their first meeting, over a meal in Twickenham, south-west London, as being “like two pieces of a jigsaw coming together”.Angela, now 63, and the eldest of the three sisters, was also there, thanks to Mark’s detective work. She had been adopted as a child due to her parents’ chaotic lives, and given another surname. She was living in Hastings, unaware that her family were looking for her.“I’d always thought I could be walking down the streets past my sister or my brother,” Peggy says. “But this was for real, and we just fitted. There was none of the baggage other people have – no, ‘You did this to me when we were 12’.”Peggy has stayed close to Linda. All four siblings meet up in Gorleston-on-Sea, where Linda lives, whenever Peggy is back in the UK. “Linda and I both have mild depression,” Peggy says. “We don’t carry it around like a bad energy, but stuff happens that takes you back, and we’ll give each other pep talks. We hold each other up.” Linda also had a difficult upbringing: although she remained with her birth father, she never heard from her mother again. She says her father would often leave her in the care of friends while he was away working as a lorry driver. “We have a good bond,” Linda says. “I feel as if I’ve known her for ever. We have different surnames, so it would have been impossible to find one another without modern technology.” With the help of Mark, a keen amateur genealogist who trawled old newspapers and records to build a family tree, Peggy discovered that her father, Henwood Adrian, was actually from Guyana, and that she also has Congolese and Nigerian ancestry. “It has given me an identity and a sense of pride,” Peggy says. “Being mixed race, people ask you: ‘Where are you from?’, ‘What’s your heritage?’.

Here’s what you need to knowWorkers laid off due to the coronavirus crisis and applying for universal credit for the first time may be surprised to learn how little it pays and how difficult the process can be.That was the stark warning from benefits experts this week as many people embark on their first ever benefits claim.More than 1 million people have applied for universal credit in the past month. The result has been huge waits to talk to benefits staff on the phone. So if you are about to claim for the first time, how do you do it, and what can you expect?Anna Stevenson, a welfare and benefits specialist at the financial charity Turn2Us, says the first thing new claimants need to do is to assemble all their financial data, and then use a benefits calculator – there is one on the Turn2us website – which will give a good indication of the sum payable.While people do not need a national insurance number to claim, details of rent and any outstanding earnings and mortgage costs will be required.The biggest bar to many will be the fact that anyone with savings of £16,000 or more is not eligible to make a claim. They can only apply for jobseeker’s allowance (JSA) of £74.35 a week, and will receive no help with their rent.All applicants are expected to file their claim online, or via the helpline. At the start, claimants must verify their identity – so have your passport or driving licence to hand.One of the big stumbling blocks has been that large numbers of claimants have been unable to do this online, often because they moved house recently or because some of their documents do not match up. It has lead to reports of people spending many hours on hold. The Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) said this week it aimed to have a simpler ID system in place in the next few days.Once over that hurdle, applicants must input details of any income they are yet to be paid, any savings they have, the income of other members of their household (spouse or partner plus any adult children), and their housing costs, such as rent or outstanding mortgage.Problems can arise when trying to make an appointment to have the claim processed, says Stevenson. “Universal credit claimants have to make this appointment within 30 days of completing their applications and, for the claim to be approved, the interview must happen. Previously, this took place at the jobcentre but this is now being done over the phone. Again, people have been reporting that it is impossible to get through.”The DWP accepts there have been long waiting times, and said on Thursday it was ending the need to call up. Instead, it said, its staff will be “proactively calling claimants if they need to check any of the information provided as part of the claim, as well as messaging them on their online journal to confirm details”.It is difficult to generalise as each person’s calculation is based on their household income, how much rent they pay, number of children etc – see the scenarios below.However, a single person over 25 will receive £410 a month, or about £94 a week basic benefit, provided they have no other income.An unemployed couple on universal credit will receive £594 a month. If they have two children they will be paid a further £516 a month, provided the first child was born before April 2017.Claimants are also entitled to help with their council tax, although again this will not always cover the full amount. This has to be claimed direct from your local council.Universal credit is paid monthly in arrears and there is a five- to six-week wait for the payments to start. Those needing money immediately can claim an interest-free loan called an Advance within the first month, three days after filing the claim.Local authorities can sometimes help bridge the gap between the sum offered by universal credit to pay rent and the actual rent paid, known as discretionary housing payments. There is a limited amount of money available, so councils usually give preference to applications showing the greatest need.Yes. Dan Rust, a benefits expert at Turquoise Training, says universal credit is also there to help workers whose hours and income have been reduced as a result of a partial shutdown.“If you are getting statutory sick pay because you are self-isolating, or if you are doing fewer hours at work, you should claim universal credit to top up your income,” he says.Yes, and you should, even if you expect help to come from the government’s self-employed scheme. The government has also removed the floor on earnings that it previously used to limit payouts to those earning below the minimum wage from their self-employment.Family with both parents working, but one has lost incomeA manager is laid off after the owner shut his restaurant. He is 35 and married to a nurse who earns £24,000 a year. They have two children, aged nine and seven, and a £600-per-month mortgage. They have savings of £8,000.The nurse will still receive her net pay of £1,663, while he will get universal credit payments of £351 per month, or £81 a week. But any help with the mortgage will come only after nine months of not working. Self-employed freelance worker, lost nearly all earningsA freelance (self-employed) camera operator who used to make films at Pinewood Studios still receives £150 a month in royalties, but all other work has dried up. He lives alone in a rented two-bedroom house in St Albans, for which he pays £1,400 a month.He will receive only £798 towards his housing costs and a total universal credit payment of £1,058 per month. But this leaves him with a total income significantly less than his rent.Self-employed consultant, 55, lost all earnings but has savingsA self-employed management consultant now has no work. He has paid off his mortgage and he and his wife have Isa savings of £60,000.Unfortunately, he is not entitled to any help. Their savings are too high to apply for universal credit, and he is not eligible for JSA, because he is self-employed. Had he been an employee, he would have got £74.35 a week JSA.Single person, 22, lost pub job and has moved back in with parentsThis person had a short-term contract but has been laid off from his job in a pub, and has no income. He does not pay rent to his parents, so will receive the basic £343 a month.He has no work, while she earns £1,100 a month net. They have three children aged six, nine and 11. They pay rent of £1,500 a month in Manchester.They will receive only £723 a month towards their rent, meaning he will receive a total universal credit payment of £1,561 per month, a little over their rent commitments.An estate agent who used to earn £50,000Again, he is not eligible for universal credit as their joint savings are too high. With two years of NI contributions, all he can claim is the new-style JSA of £74.35 per week, for 26 weeks. Once their savings fall below £16,000 he can claim universal credit.Single person over 25 who lives in a shared flat in east London.He has been laid off so there is no income. He pays £450 a month in rent, inclusive of all bills and council tax, for his flatshare. He has savings of £2,000, which is dwindling fast.He will be eligible for the shared accommodation rate for housing costs, which is up to £591 per month, and in total will receive £860 per month.Figures supplied by Dan Rust, a benefits expert at Turquoise Training.

The English-Italian artist (surname Pappalardo) has sung on Hot Chip’s return-to-form album, last year’s A Bath Full of Ecstasy, and done backup with lo-fi disco dude Kindness on tour, as well as contributing to rapper Kano’s 2019 album Hoodies All Summer. Her breakthrough moment was in 2011 on Joe Goddard’s big electro-pop summer heater, Gabriel. But instead of turning into a dance music a, Valentina released 2013’s Wolves EP, a pack of ghostly, Kate Bush-leaning songs.Now she’s back, with a gauzy electronic-pop sound that suggests Arthur Russell, Tirzah and Jamie xx, and feels more than fitting for the current moment. Her new EP, You Know Where My Happiness Went, is self-produced – she took on the role after breaking up with all the boyfriends who used to do it for her, apparently – and has the undone peculiarity that can only come from having to make it up as you go along. Valentina wrote it while couch-surfing, following the end of a five-year relationship, and, with no equipment, recorded her vocals directly into her laptop, which gives them a submerged quality.In fact, much of the EP sounds as if she is coming to life after self-imposed quarantine. Like most DIY musicians, what’s next for 2020 remains up in the air, but Valentina is one step further ahead than most: she says that her EP’s title track is about “learning to be alone” and “getting to know and like yourself”, something we all could do with facing up to right now.You Know Where My Happiness Went is out now"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/691adb7fe1edf017c552fae78ab21d2f4c5387fd/0_389_5184_3110/master/5184.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b374fc19eba72328472d74baebd1a607","title":"call for super rich to donate more to tackle coronavirus pandemic","story":"While some billionaires have pledged vast chunks of their wealth others have been criticised for not giving enough, or even at allThe world’s richest people are being urged to urgently donate big chunks of their fortunes to the global effort to tackle the coronavirus pandemic, and help millions of people across the globe whose lives have been thrown into crisis by Covid-19.Some billionaires – including Microsoft founder Bill Gates and Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey – have committed huge amounts of their money to fund solutions to the unfolding crisis.But other members of the wealthy elite have been criticised for pledging only small fractions – if any - of their fortunes to address the worst-ever global health emergency, which is set to trigger an economic crisis on the scale of the 1930s Great Depression.Jeff Bezos, the founder of Amazon and the world’s richest person, has donated $100m (£80m) to food bank charity Feeding America. The charity, which runs a network of about 200 food banks, said Bezos’s donation was the biggest it had ever received, and “countless lives will be changed because of his generosity”.Amazon is also pumping $25m into an “Amazon Relief Fund” to support delivery drivers and “seasonal employees under financial distress”.Fran Perrin, a daughter of supermarket heir and philanthropist Lord Sainsbury, said now was the time for billionaires such as Bezos to start “giving back to society in the biggest way possible”.“Why wouldn’t you want to give more,” Perrin said of other very wealthy people. “I think people in a position to be able to, should give as much as they can. I think that’s perfectly reasonable.”Perrin, who has committed to giving away all of the Sainsbury’s fortune she inherited, this week pledged £2.5m emergency funding to help people struggling with the economic fallout of the lockdown. The extra money has been provided via her Indigo Trust charity, to which she had already donated £10m.“We are currently in a national emergency to which charities and wealthy iniduals need to immediately respond and play their part,” Perrin said. “There is a huge, huge need for funds to support people and demand will only grow. It’s a perfect storm.”Luke Hildyard, who campaigns against excessive executive remuneration at the High Pay Centre, said all donations should be welcome, but he added: “Very generous inidual grants can obscure the fact that on the whole, wealthy people’s charitable giving is pretty minimal. Indeed, studies show that poor people donate more than rich, as a proportion of their income.”Perrin said she would like to tell reluctant billionaires that helping to solve the world’s problems could be “the most rewarding challenge you’ve ever faced”.Her message, she said, would be: “You have a skillset that has made all this money. Now imagine what you could do if you turned those skills to solving the world’s problems. This may be the biggest contribution you can make to the world. Give yourself the gift of knowing you did everything you could.”The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation has pledged an immediate $100m towards detection, isolation and vaccine development. Gates has said he is prepared to spend billions in the longer term to develop and produce a vaccine. “It’ll be a few billion dollars we’ll waste on manufacturing for the constructs that don’t get picked because something else is better,” Gates said on The Daily Show. “But a few billion in this, the situation we’re in, where there’s trillions of dollars ... being lost economically, it is worth it.”Mark Zuckerberg, the Facebook founder, has committed $30m to the Gates Foundation and Wellcome Trust’s joint research project, the Covid-19 Therapeutics Accelerator. Zuckerberg has an estimated $67bn fortune.Jack Ma, China’s richest person, has pledged 100m yuan ($14.5m) to “support the development of a coronavirus vaccine”. Ma has an estimated $44bn fortune.Hans Rausing, grandson of the Swedish founder of Tetra Pak, has donated £16.5m to charities and other groups supporting the NHS.George Soros, the multibillionaire former hedge fund manager and philanthropist, has pledged €2m to support the “unprecedented emergency” in Milan and his native Hungary. “I was born in Budapest, in the middle of the Great Depression,” Soros said in a statement. “I lived through world war two, the Arrow Cross rule, and the siege in the city. I remember what it is like to live in extreme circumstances.”Madonna has donated $1m to the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, to help in the creation of a vaccine.George and Amal Clooney have pledged $1m (£803,000) to six coronavirus causes including the NHS, relief charities in the Lombardy region of Italy and Lebanese food banks."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8af2641ab90761fd30bd1d95dd2569f85bea02ea/0_192_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=81ccb50f395ce8a1fc9072e718704d00","title":"matt hancock urges public not to overuse ppe","story":"Health secretary says protective equipment should be treated like ‘precious resource’ The health secretary, Matt Hancock, has urged NHS staff not to overuse personal protective equipment, sparking criticism from doctors’ and nurses’ leaders.“We need everyone to treat PPE like the precious resource it is,” he said on Friday. “Everyone should use the equipment they clinically need, in line with the guidelines: no more and no less.”After weeks of criticism over the lack of vital equipment, Hancock told the daily Downing Street briefing a “herculean effort” was under way to ensure every health and social care worker dealing with coronavirus has the equipment they need.The government does not recommend the general use of protective face masks to slow the spread of disease, and Hancock warned the public against overusing protective equipment.He reiterated that hand washing, social distancing and staying at home are the best ways to avoid infection. “A front door is better than any face mask”, he said.Hancock and the chief nursing officer, Ruth May, declined to give a figure for how many healthcare staff have died after contracting the virus.The health secretary said a nationwide delivery system had been set up, with the help of the armed forces, to distribute masks, aprons and other equipment to 58,000 healthcare providers.He said: “We’ve had to create a whole new logistics network, essentially from scratch.” Within a week, every NHS hospital would be receiving daily deliveries, he added.The shadow health secretary, Jon Ashworth, welcomed the promise that more PPE would reach the frontline but pressed Hancock to ensure his target was met.Ashworth said: “This isn’t the first time ministers have given NHS and social care staff big promises on PPE. But there has been a mismatch between statements at Downing Street press conferences and the realities facing health and care staff on the ground.“Staff have been raising the lack of PPE for weeks. We hope the government’s plans today deliver the adequate supplies of PPE our brave healthcare staff deserve.”Doctors’ and nurses’ leaders criticised Hancock’s plan as inadequate, given the growing death toll of NHS staff from coronavirus. The British Medical Association said PPE shortages could spell “real disaster” for doctors. It also took issue with Hancock’s insistence that the NHS has enough PPE to go round but needs frontline staff to use “no more and no less” than they clinically require.Dr Chaand Nagpaul, the BMA’s chair, said: “We are dealing with an unknown, highly infectious, and potentially deadly virus that has already claimed the lives of several healthcare workers, including 11 doctors in the UK.“It is absurd that the people trained to treat this disease are the ones who are not being appropriately protected – and without them, we face real disaster.“We note the government’s announcement this afternoon … However, PPE should not be a ‘precious resource’ and for NHS staff facing shortages of protection they need today, they don’t want to hear of a plan, but that this vital equipment is made available to the frontline now.”Susan Masters, director of nursing at the Royal College of Nursing, also voiced scepticism that Hancock’s pledges would end the supply problems that are causing alarm among staff, and denied nurses were misusing PPE. Masters said: “These figures on deliveries are only impressive when nursing staff stop contacting me to say what they need to use wasn’t available. The calls are still coming through – people are petrified. They have seen colleagues die already.“Things have improved in recent days and I credit the government with that. But the safety of nurses and care staff must not be compromised. They are pretty clear about what they need to do to stay safe and they will be angered by any suggestion they cause shortages by misusing kit.”As well as promising to tackle what he acknowledged was the “enormous challenge” of ensuring PPE reaches those who need it, Hancock said lab capacity had been increased sufficiently to allow any health or social care worker who needs it, to be tested.He visited a newly opened “mega-lab” in Milton Keynes on Thursday and said 15 drive-through testing centres were available.He stressed the complexities of meeting demand for PPE against the background of rocketing global demand, and without a significant domestic supply sector.Diplomatic staff around the world have been pressed into service trying to source equipment, Hancock said, with Whitehall officials in London trying to organise transporting it to the UK.He praised firms, including Burberry and Rolls-Royce, which have turned their facilities to manufacturing PPE – and urged others to do so, based on requirements published by the government. “If you’ve got production facilities, and you can meet our published specifications, we want to hear from you,” he said.Appearing alongside Hancock, May underlined the toll, both physical and mental, that treating the virus is having on her frontline colleagues. But she said they were heartened by the public’s support. “The rainbows and NHS signs in the windows lift me, and they lift my colleagues,” she said.She and Hancock emphasised the importance of the public continuing to use the NHS for conditions unrelated to the coronavirus."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/11e0e462eb7d7be3da4c5c7971a27ba7733b36f6/0_401_5732_3439/master/5732.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=02b7aeb4463c9ea4f9ed9a0ed461bf73","title":"alice powell w series interview thought year not racing gutting","story":"Twelve months ago Alice Powell described her return to motor racing as a new lease of life. After four years without a drive she grasped her chance in the all-female W Series with unbridled verve. However, with her career resurgent the opportunity to build on her success has been wrenched away by the coronavirus-induced sporting shutdown. It has struck Powell as a body blow. “The thought of having another year not racing is pretty gutting,” she says bluntly.Powell fears there may be no racing this year but is emphatic that if that is necessary to defeat the virus, then every sport must take it on the chin. “My other half thinks that we might not go racing at all,” she says. “I say: ‘Don’t be silly,’ but in the back of my mind I think he could be right. That is really upsetting because last year was my time back racing after being out for a long time.”After lack of funding forced her out of racing to the extent that she believed her career was all but over, last year Powell finished the inaugural W Series on a high. The 27-year-old from Oxford won the final round at Brands Hatch and was third in the championship. Her performances caught the attention, new seats opened up and another season in the W Series beckoned. But the promise of 2020 lies in tatters and the outbreak may yet finish it off.It has clearly been a major disappointment and she admits to finding the situation depressing, but there is no pause as Powell immediately acknowledges the bigger picture. “If it means we can fight the virus, stop it from spreading, prevent illness and deaths then of course we should not go racing,” she says.“People’s health is much more important. Clearly, there are far more important things in the world than us getting back in a car.“When races started to get cancelled it really hit home. But it is absolutely the right decision. You can put so many lives at risk and we need to stop this spreading. The number of people at a racetrack, hundreds and thousands of people, you can’t keep social distance at a racetrack. So it is the right thing to do.”The W Series is no exception to the sporting lockdown. The DTM – the German touring car championship – to which it is a support series has postponed its opening three meetings and discussions are continuing on if and when they may begin racing. Two W Series rounds were due to take place at Formula One meetings this year, in the US and Mexico, a real step forward that is now in jeopardy.Last year’s inaugural season offered female drivers the chance to compete in F3 cars for a championship where the series covered all the costs, the intent being to promote their talent and help their careers move forward. For Powell it worked handsomely: she became one of several competitors whose subsequent success comprehensively proved the series is making a difference.Before the end of the season Powell was offered a drive in the US in the IMSA sports car championship. That was followed by a contract for a full-time seat in the Jaguar I-pace eTrophy series that supports Formula E meetings. Before its calendar also came to halt Powell had made her mark, with two podium finishes helping her to third in the standings, while in February she was given a shot in the Formula E rookie test for Envision Virgin Racing.“My name wasn’t out there, when I wasn’t racing,” she says. “People started to forget about me, I hadn’t been around, then the W Series came along and the attraction of interest from around the world was incredible. That surely had to help. Without the W Series I probably wouldn’t have had the drives.”Powell has been racing since she was eight. Her talent was recognised early yet despite success across a range of championships including GP3, she did not receive backing and as the money dried up so did the opportunities for her to compete.She continued as a racing coach but was working with her father in house renovations when the W Series offered her a second chance. It was a life-changing moment, brought home recently in a moment of quiet reflection during the lockdown. “I was looking back through photos on my phone,” she says. “I have lots of photos of my dog and that kind of stuff and then it hit January last year and it’s just all racing.”Powell is as engaging and enthusiastic as she is sharp and competitive on the track. That racing is everything to her is unmistakable: it is a passion to which she is wholly committed. She feels its absence almost as a physical loss, yet accepts with an admirably calm stoicism that under the current circumstances even another year out would be a small price to pay.“We love our sport so much,” she says. “That I don’t know when I will next be in a car again brings me back to when I was not racing and that sinking feeling inside that I don’t know when it is next going to be, its horrible.“But the health of everybody is far more important. More important than racing. More important than sport.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/492dd60e27404b1519a9c84338ac47a54e7f8ebc/0_169_2036_1221/master/2036.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7d6036abfcf8f1cdaef4a310acd8ba27","title":"my favourite game australia v england fifth ashes test sydney 2003","story":" The Test was a dead rubber but it was cricket at its most compelling and signified England’s greatness to comeThe dead-rubber England victory was something of a ritual during Australia’s long Ashes supremacy from 1989-2005, a feelgood finale signifying little. Think Phil Tufnell at the Oval in 1997, or Dean Headley at the MCG 16 months later – jaunty cameos with no wider meaning.Sydney 2003 was different. Not just because it was Test cricket at its most compelling - close, fluctuating, full of subplots - but also because it signified a stirring in England’s cricketing mood, among us travelling thousands and in a team performance portending greater things to come. The road to 2005 began here. The bare facts are that England won the fifth Test by 225 runs, denying Australia a historic 5-0 whitewash and salvaging something from another catastrophic Ashes tour. But they don’t indicate just how tight this match was until its closing stages, nor how important it felt. Australia’s fans were desperate for the hitherto elusive 5-0, England’s – who had spent the preceding weeks revelling in noisy self-deprecation – yearning for some reward from a long, expensive trip. And to attend all five days of such a match is to lose yourself totally in the game’s rhythms and dramas.Sydney 2003 was about two batsmen above all: Michael Vaughan and Steve Waugh – one the coming man, the other a legend in his final Ashes Test. First Waugh: when the Australia captain came to the crease on the second afternoon, his side were in bother – 56 for three in response to a rare decent England first-innings total of 362, adorned by a hundred from Mark Butcher and handy half-centuries from Nasser Hussain and Alec Stewart. England were up for this.But so was Waugh, under pressure after an indifferent personal run. From the start he batted as if a century was predestined, playing with a style and swagger more reminiscent of his brother, Mark, than his usual nuggety self. A style and swagger reminiscent, in fact, of his very first Ashes innings - a big hundred at Headingley in 1989. He reprised that style for his last.Day two had its fairytale ending after Waugh had motored to 98 before the final ball of the day, Gilchrist at the other end having joined him at 150 for five for a swashbuckling partnership worth 83 at that point. The off-spinner Richard Dawson delivered it, outside off stump, and Waugh clobbered it square on the offside to the boundary, provoking frenzied celebrations from the home supporters who remained in the ground after stumps, chanting his name.The following day it was Vaughan’s turn. The match was deliciously poised after Australia were bowled out for 363 to lead by one run. Vaughan was enjoying perhaps the most stellar run of form of any England batsman this century, having compiled four daddy Test hundreds in the past five months. His fifth, here, was the pick of them all, albeit against an Australian attack shorn of Shane Warne and Glenn McGrath through injury. Few players of his generation could drive so beautifully as Vaughan in his prime and he took victory away from Australia in one afternoon. He eventually fell for 183 the following day to a dubious lbw, comfortably the top-scorer of the series.Their tails up, England got into Australia from the start as the hosts chased 451, fourth-innings specialist Andy Caddick leading the charge, taking two of three early wickets. But Australia rallied to 91 for three at the close, leaving victory by no means a given.Our fears were unfounded. Caddick zipped into life again, ending with seven wickets as Australia were skittled for 225.Caddick didn’t play for England again other key contributors here – Hussain, Butcher and Stewart – never played another Ashes Test. But Vaughan had made himself the inevitable choice to replace Hussain as captain the following summer and the seeds of recovery symbolised by Sydney bloomed under his leadership. As we filed out of the SCG that afternoon, a dead rubber had never seemed so full of life."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7e4cc98a8b7bb4248172b689b3e36c6673e948d4/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ef87416d4639999e5a24573b9a62fd4b","title":"vacuum month sport that never was barney ronay","story":"In the weeks since sport came to an abrupt ending, its only significant story has been its own cancellationThe best way to annoy a group of scholarly historians, if you ever have an urgent need to annoy scholarly historians – perhaps in some kind of emergency situation – is to propose a counterfactual analysis of events.You know the kind of thing. What if Winston Churchill had died of a heart attack in 1941? What if skiffle, rather than the music of the Beatles, had seized the imagination of the world in 1963?This is an inflammatory line of reasoning, interesting to readers of alarming pulp novels about the Third Reich taking over the world, but likely to cause an outbreak of pipe-chewing, tweed-flapping rage within the common rooms of Big History. It is also an interesting dynamic when applied to sports writing and sports analysis. Most of it would collapse if the counterfactual analysis were outlawed.What is Expected Goals, or the Expected Points Table, or a counterintuitive stats-based gallery of the leading creative left-backs in Europe (No 5 will surprise you!) if not the type of “unhistorical shit” that so enraged the 20th-century historian EP Thompson? What is a revisionist colour sidebar take on the managerial achievements of José Mourinho, but the kind of counterfactual “parlour game” EH Carr, chronicler of the early Soviet Union, would have raged against?And yet right now counter-facts are all sport has. In the ’s pages this week you will have seen detailed analysis of a significant staging point: 100 days since coronavirus took hold and changed the world. This has mainly been a business of hard facts, sifted out from an overload of actual real-world news.But not in sport. It is a month now since the first cancelled Premier League Saturday, a month since sport basically stopped. And this is the one significant event sport has to offer, its own cancellation. The story didn’t happen. That’s the story. It feels like counterfactual history in action. The best way to understand what happened in sport between March and April 2020, is to understand what didn’t happen.At which point wind chimes tinkle, the screen starts to dissolve, and we’re back in the undoctored timeline, the one where sport still exists, where the talk of an illness in China remained talk of an illness in China, and where the wheels of Big Sport have continued to grind on.In counterfactual April 2020 more than 300 unplayed professional men’s and women’s football fixtures have been played in the last four weeks. Close to £1bn in revenue has still been raked in.In the Premier League Liverpool stuttered a little, then romped across the line, clinching the title with victory at Manchester City on 5 April, a moment that confirmed once again in its sheer operatic sweep that Premier League football is, and always will be, the most important thing currently happening to human civilisation.Pep Guardiola declared himself “so very, very happy”, albeit in a murderous, glassy-eyed sarcastic whisper. The Liverpool board announced that the title win was “vindication for a community club where finances take second place to our football family – and let’s face it nothing’s ever likely to test this idea so there you go.”Elsewhere news of Cristiano Ronaldo’s agreement to sign for Manchester United on a world record weekly wage led to questions in parliament over footballers’ salaries. “We have always backed the right of the market to decide how much iniduals earn, this is all good for Britain,” Matt Hancock, MP for West Suffolk, announced, to cheers from the benches.England’s cricketers continued to rebuild the Test team along strict attritional lines, battling out all 10 days of the two-match series in Sri Lanka to seal a triumphant 0-0 series draw. At home the ECB continued to plan for the Hundred, the nonexistent tournament involving nonexistent teams played out in front of nonexistent fans, which actually doesn’t sound such a weird idea these days.Meanwhile, in the one really astonishing turn of the non-Covid timeline, Formula One announced that it would cease to function with immediate effect, having re-evaluated its place in human society, renounced its role as a carbon-fed playground for the mega-rich, and apologised in particular for the last decade of watching the best car win in dubiously-framed locations around the world. So congratulations, there, Formula One.Away from all this the real business of sport didn’t un continue. It was announced that a combined one million miles would not go un-run in the postponed London Marathon, and £50m of charity donations not be deferred in the process. Around the country 350,000 amateur cricketers would not miss their final winter nets, and continue to look forward to another endless summer.The FA would not cancel completely the seasons of at least 100 leagues in men’s and women’s non-league football. Similarly the results of the entire sub-pyramid of the amateur game – hundreds of leagues, thousands of clubs – were not declared null and void and scrubbed from the record.In the wider world hundreds of thousands of coaches, teachers and volunteers did not stop working away at grassroots sport and the shared health of the nation. A combined two million people from the age of four upwards didn’t fail to participate in cancelled parkruns. And beyond this an unquantifiable mass did not fail to take their first step into sport or to come back to some kind of a more active life.This, then, is the counterfactual history of sport March-April 2020, a month of urgent unhappenings and eventful nonevents. There will be quite a bit more of this to come from here. The important part, when it all starts up again, will be to remember which of those absences seemed to matter the most."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c9268bbaf07368817b86df4c06e1ba2df4d045cd/1_0_2601_1562/master/2601..jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e25184c2d9aaa983a5f5acd01cc4a4b8","title":"dont let a weak bladder stop you doing the things you love","story":"Avoiding playing vigorous sports? Sex life gone from G-spot to pee spot? The London Clinic’s Jane Simpson explains what we can do to tackle incontinence – including kegel exercises that you can do wherever you are As a continence nurse specialist, I’ve seen firsthand how overwhelming and upsetting incontinence can be. Patients visit me when things have gone too far – their behaviours change and they’re suddenly avoiding activities such as playing tennis, having sex or even going to the cinema because they’re worried about having to race to the toilet. When you start avoiding things you enjoy, it’s time to take action.Of course, leakage can be troubling at any moment, but during sex it’s particularly distressing (it tends to happen during an orgasm or because of the physical pressure). But the good news is, it doesn’t mean the end of your sex life. In fact, patients always say they wish they’d sought treatment sooner. Even if you don’t experience leakage, sexual sensation and satisfaction can be improved, too – and who wouldn’t want that? As well as increasing blood supply to the vagina and penis, pelvic floor muscle training (or “kegels”, as they’re also known), can improve muscle tone and maintain nerve activity, meaning better sex.When it comes to treatment for accidental leakage, it depends on the type of incontinence people are dealing with. “Stress incontinence” is when we suffer leakage while doing things such as sneezing, coughing or laughing, and it’s common for women to experience this after having a baby, when the pelvic floor is weakest. Leaking during sports or sex falls under this category, due to weakened pelvic floor muscles. The other common type is an overactive bladder, or “urge incontinence”, which feels like you have to urinate suddenly and often.Pelvic floor exercises can help in both instances, but it’s really important to make sure you’re doing them properly – speak to a women’s health physiotherapist or a continence specialist if unsure. They’re simple – just squeeze, lift and hold the anus and vagina, count to five and repeat five times. Improvement is fast – you’ll notice a change in six weeks if you do them regularly. There’s also a brilliant app called MyPFF, which reminds you to do your exercises.If an overactive bladder is the problem, lifestyle changes are key – symptoms can be worsened by too much caffeine, alcohol, fizzy drinks, spicy foods and stress, for example. Certain medications can also play a part, as well as conditions such as constipation, urinary tract infections and vaginal atrophy. Bladder retraining is great – when you have an urge to pee, you teach yourself to hang on, which slowly expands your bladder capacity. It might also be worth avoiding high-impact sports until your pelvic floor is stronger, since too much exercise can make things worse. Medication and surgery could be considered with a specialist, too.I definitely sense a change coming in the way we discuss women’s health issues and incontinence, and it’s great the conversation is becoming more open. There shouldn’t be any shame or stigma around it any more – this sort of condition affects so many of us. I hope people realise improvement is possible and that once the issue is tackled, it really can be life-changing. Recently, a woman visited me in my clinic and said that just having a treatment plan in place has made her feel better. It really is the very least we deserve.As incontinence affects one in three women over 35, we should all be having more open conversations about this everyday condition that impacts women of all ages.

It implies it’s a time of things “winding down”, “ending”, “drying up”.Well, most things. Because often, along with menopause, comes bladder weakness. And for many women that means that things get decidedly less dry.Unlike when a girl starts her period, which in many cultures is celebrated, and in the UK is now respected with a government campaign to provide sanitary products in schools, when a woman’s periods begin to end, it’s seen as a change towards old age, towards a body that’s “done”. And even for those going through menopause, it has often felt pretty taboo to talk about the daily problems – especially bladder weakness.“Don’t make me laugh, I’ll wet myself!” might seem like an age-old joke, but it’s one that’s true for menopausal women. And when it comes to our sex lives, it’s no laughing matter. There’s fear and shame and women shut down, choosing not to be intimate for fear of leaking urine during a passionate moment.After all, when do you slip “I’d love to have an early night but I’m worried I’ll wet the bed!” into the conversation, whether you’re with a long-term partner or someone new?The good news is this conversation is being reclaimed by women in the spotlight, who are starting to talk about the final menopause taboo of bladder weakness. Well, we talk so much about starting our periods – why would we not talk about stopping them, and how this affects your love life?It seems there has been a realisation that no matter whether you grace the red carpet and TV screens or you’re on the school run with grandchildren or off to the office, menopause will happen to every woman. Take Gwyneth Paltrow, for example, who released a video for her wellbeing site Goop, saying: “I think menopause gets a really bad rap, and needs a bit of rebranding.” Her video Madame Ovary spoke about mood swings and sweats, while British actress Emma Thompson has joked how hot sweats mean she’s not cold on the red carpet.OK, so the conversation is shifting – just like we can now see a tampon string in a TV ad (thanks to Sport England’s This Girl Can campaign), women are no longer sitting quietly while they deal with the side effects of menopause. But there is one subject that still has to work hard to find its way into our vocabulary – bladder weakness.We can talk hot flushes, night sweats, mood swings – all with increasing honesty. But then there’s Nadia Sawalha, who struggled with incontinence in silence. The usually outspoken TV presenter kept quiet about bladder weakness until she was forced to speak about it after having an accident on national TV.Why is it the one part of menopause women can’t talk about? Well, leaking during the day is one thing – the embarrassment of needing to find some alternative underwear, for example – but when it comes to sex, it’s a different matter altogether. Women who have bladder weakness and might have an accident during sex are likely to close off to their partner, so worried they’ll spoil the intimacy that they don’t have sex and even make up excuses, or “blame” menopause. Intimacy is not synonymous with leakage.After all, when you’re not sure whether you might lose control of your bladder, being intimate isn’t always top of the list. Talk about mixed messages! Women are encouraged to embrace their ageing, to love who they are and how they look – to go grey with glamour and grace, or to wear a bikini with pride. Just don’t mention the bladder weakness, right?!As periods end and change, we have to adjust. The problem is, the world doesn’t seem to adjust with us. And women are left in a strange quagmire of going through something so natural and even primal in silence and, often, shame.And with two-thirds of women over 40 affected with bladder weakness, and many revealing it has affected their mental health, it’s time we became more open and honest about how bladder weakness affects us.Meg Matthews, who has been campaigning about the menopause and runs megsmenopause, says: “Bladder weakness, also called bladder incontinence, is a very common consequence of menopause. It’s not easy to talk about this topic, and, because women don’t always feel confident talking about it, they can feel alone. We need to understand that having bladder weakness is OK. This is the message we need to spread.”But just like when we’re younger, confidence can come back when we use the right products. Once a girl knows she can use a tampon or pad, she’s less worried about her period affecting her day-to-day life. And for women with bladder issues, it’s about a pad that can help you forget there’s even a problem. Then you’ll feel freer to have those more difficult intimacy conversations that you’ve been putting off – and perhaps that early night …As incontinence affects one in three women over 35, we should all be having more open conversations about this everyday condition that impacts women of all ages.

About 60 people, almost all of them African Americans or Latinos from the surrounding area of New York City, all displaying classic symptoms of Covid-19, were gasping on stretchers everywhere he looked.“Every nook and cranny of the emergency department was full of patients attached to portable oxygen tanks, people so sick they needed beds. The stretchers filled the room and spilled down the corridors, 10 patients in just one hallway,” he said.The dreadful sounds of sickness filled the room. “It’s like a chorus, a cacophony of coughing.”Petty, a pediatric emergency nurse who now spends much of his time caring for adults with coronavirus, could not help envisaging the thousands of contagious micro-droplets being expelled into the air with all that coughing. “I felt like I was walking into a cloud of poison,” he said.Petty is on the frontline of the frontline: New York City. The metropolis has become the focus of the worldwide coronavirus pandemic, just as in 2001 it became the focus of the worldwide al-Qaida terrorist threat on 911.Day by day, the statistics tell their own grim story. On Tuesday, the New York City death toll overtook that of 911 and now stands at 3,602 (2,753 died in the city in the 2001 terrorist attacks). On Wednesday, it was announced that New York had suffered its highest number of fatalities in a 24-hour period – 806 lives snuffed out in just one day.Even that was almost certainly an undercount, as those New Yorkers who die at home are not being included in the figures.The attack is coming in waves – not just on one sunny morning in September as when the Twin Towers came down, but over days and relentless weeks. There are Ground Zeros dotted throughout the city, like Jacobi, one of 11 major public hospitals that are all now pushed to, and beyond, the limit.As the crisis thickens, a picture of how the virus is ravaging the city has come into view carrying with it a sobering realization. Coronavirus may not in itself discriminate, but its outcomes certainly do. It has inflicted its terrible toll not so much on New York City, but on the two cities it contains.“Coronavirus has exposed New York’s two societies,” Jumaane Williams, the public advocate who acts as the official watchdog for New Yorkers, told the . “One society was able to run away to the Hamptons or work from home and have food delivered to their door the other society was deemed ‘essential workers’ and made to go out to work with no protection.”Different boroughs, even different neighborhoods within each borough, are experiencing coronavirus almost as though it were two different contagions. In wealthier white areas the residential streets are empty parking spots that are fought over in normal times now stand vacant following an exodus to out-of-town weekend homes or Airbnbs.If you superimpose a map of where frontline workers live within New York over a map of the 76,876 confirmed cases in the city, the two are virtually identical. In Queens, the most intense concentration of Covid-19 infections are in precisely those neighborhoods with large numbers of essential workers.“We put people out there and said you got to go to work, but we didn’t give them protective gear or additional testing to keep them safe. It was almost as though these groups were expendable to keep the city moving,” Williams said.This week a tiger tested positive at Bronx Zoo. It generated plenty of headlines, but few media articles made the point that Williams highlighted.“A tiger tests positive – that’s good to know. If we have enough diagnostic test kits for tigers, shouldn’t we have enough for our own frontline humans?”Most of the adult Covid patients he cares for are also wrestling with underlying health conditions that make them far more vulnerable to the disease.“Our patients are coming in with all of the comorbidities associated with poverty and racism – diabetes, asthma, hypertension. We have patients who are sicker and more likely to die because their lives have been conditioned by these chronic illnesses.”Reliable data has been hard to come by, as both city and state authorities resisted for several weeks releasing official figures on the grounds that the subject of disparities was less important than keeping hospitals afloat. Journalists at the independent not-for-profit news site the City were driven to do their own analysis of NYC department of health data and found that in the Bronx people are dying at twice the rate of New Yorkers as a whole.On Wednesday, Mayor Bill de Blasio finally caved to pressure and posted preliminary findings that unambiguously underline the racial breakdown of coronavirus’s deadly toll. Black and Latino New Yorkers are dying at double the rate of white and Asian New Yorkers, following precisely the public advocate’s narrative of two societies.“There are clear inequalities, clear disparities in how this disease is affecting the people of our city,” De Blasio said.In recent days Andrew Cuomo, the governor of New York state, has tentatively suggested that the crisis may already have reached its apex and could be plateauing as the curves for new cases, hospitalizations and ICU admissions all show signs of flattening.If there are indications that the city may be starting to prevail against the disease, it certainly doesn’t feel like that to Sean Petty. When he looks out of the window of the staff room during shift breaks he sees the refrigerated truck lined up to receive the bodies of Covid victims – one of 80 parked outside hospitals around the city.“There is no good news story here,” he said.Already Jacobi has lost two frontline health workers, an educator in the psychiatric department and a nurse’s aide. On top of what he sees as preventable tragedies, Petty said what rattled him most was when a Jacobi emergency room resident aged 27 was admitted into intensive care.“That was a huge wake-up call for me. To see a 27-year-old person sent to ICU who was working a hundred yards from me, that shook me.”Petty said he has never felt as angry towards the US healthcare system and towards government – the Trump administration as well as city and state leaders – for failing to protect the city’s frontline workers. Through his union, the New York State Nurses Association, he has had to fight every step of the way to secure basic personal protective equipment (PPE) to keep him and his colleagues safe.As the virus claims more victims, the city is having to think the unthinkable. Rikers Island, the notorious New York jail complex that is fighting its own Covid-19 outbreak and saw the first death of a detainee on Sunday, has been paying prisoners $6 an hour to dig mass graves on a nearby island in the Bronx though recently they switched to contract labourers.This week a New York city council member revealed in a tweet that has since been deleted that mass burials were being considered in local parks, 10 caskets per grave. He later backtracked and said it was a “contingency plan”.Political leaders, from De Blasio locally, to Cuomo regionally and Donald Trump nationally, have all tried to calm emotions by pointing to high-profile initiatives intended to provide some relief for hospitals pushed to the edge. The Javits Convention Center has been turned into a military-run hospital the USNS Comfort, a naval hospital ship, is also now docked in the Hudson River.But so far these headline-grabbing schemes have been full of sound and fury, delivering very little. Between them, the Javits and Comfort have treated just over 100 patients.A far less glamorous but much more substantial pattern of events is unfolding in the outer boroughs where most Covid victims live, away from the cameras and the political grandstanding. Here doctors and nurses are working far longer hours, at greater pace, than ever before, and with less protective equipment.Ventilator shortages mean making phone calls across the wards to see if other units can share. Patients are transferred between hospitals when one is running out of space. And health workers who normally wouldn’t work in an ER or intensive care have been reassigned to fill the need.Across the city, the practice of medicine has been turned on its head. A physician working at Bellevue hospital in Manhattan said he tries to see patients from outside the room window to minimize exposure, often guiding them to adjust their oxygen levels themselves.“We’re having to be innovative,” he said. “But it’s not necessarily comfortable.” Dozens of health workers have become sick on his unit, he said, but most have recovered quickly and returned to work.A physician at Elmhurst hospital, which like Jacobi is in the thick of the crisis, and treats many low-income and immigrant populations, said he is now having conversations with patients and their families about end-of-life care six or seven times a day, instead of once every two weeks.“These discussions are intensely personal and very emotional,” he said. And now that he can’t invite the family into the patient room, or hold the patient’s hand, “there’s a degree of detachment and depersonalization”.With such heartbreaking conversations now being held across the city, racial disparities continue to distort everything. Uché Blackstock, an urgent care physician, has witnessed the gulf in experiences of the virus in central Brooklyn where she works across several clinics.When she goes to work at a site in an African American or Latino neighborhood she knows she will be inundated with patients with Covid-like symptoms. In higher-income white neighborhoods the demand for health services has actually declined since the start of the crisis, to the extent that several clinics in these areas have been closed.“This pandemic is laying bare the inequities that have always existed in New York city,” she said. “We don’t invest in people, we don’t invest in neighborhoods, and this is what we get.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ae8d8c50ffcfbbb42e8802c0e9c0850a2e25c10e/0_0_4000_2400/master/4000..jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ded9dca7368f3f620bcdfa6f5cd4b0b2","title":"the cluster effect how social gatherings were rocket fuel for coronavirus","story":"Holding hands, kissing, sharing drinks from the same glass all helped spread the virusOn 15 February, a merry crowd wearing clown wigs and jester hats gathered in the town hall of Gangelt, a small western German municipality nestled by the Dutch border, to ring in the peak of the carnival season.Beer and wine flowed aplenty as approximately 350 adults in fancy dress locked arms on long wooden benches and swayed to the rhythm of music provided by a live band.During an interval in the programme, guests got up to mingle with friends and relatives at other tables, greeting each other as Rhineland tradition commands, with a Bützchen, or peck on the cheek.A carnival committee of 11 men in red-and-white uniforms compered the four-hour event and gave speeches on topical issues. Covid-19, the virus that had been detected on German soil for the first time two weeks earlier, was not among them.Yet the coronavirus is the single reason why the carnival session in Gangelt is now drawing close attention from scientists from around the world: seven people who walked out of the event later tested positive for the virus. A 47-year-old man who performed in the “male ballet” at the Gangelt carnival was the first person in Germany admitted to intensive care with the infection.Gangelt is in the Heinsberg district, which is home to 42,000 people and has since had 1,442 infections and 43 fatalities, more than any other administrative district in the country. The national media has started to refer to it as “Germany’s Wuhan”.A hundred days after a Chinese government website announced the discovery of a “pneumonia of unknown cause”, it has become clearer that the dynamics behind the virus’s rapid expansion across the globe has relied heavily on such “cluster effects”.Each of the countries most heavily hit by the pandemic has reported similar stories of social, cultural or religious gatherings where large numbers spent numerous hours in close company – holding hands, kissing, sharing drinks from the same glass – which then turbo-charged the spread of the pandemic.“One pattern we are seeing across the globe is that wherever there was singing and dancing, the virus spread more rapidly,” said Prof Hendrik Streeck, a virologist at the University of Bonn whose team of researchers has spent the last week carrying out the first “Covid-19 case cluster study” in Heinsberg.“Most infections didn’t take place in supermarkets or restaurants,” Streeck said of his preliminary findings. In Heinsberg, his team of coronavirus detectives could find scant evidence of the virus being transmitted via the surfaces of door handles, smart phones or other objects.Early theories that the virus at the carnival party in Gangelt could have been transmitted through the dishwater in the kitchen turned out to be a red herring: most guests drank their beer from bottles.Instead, he said, transmission took place at “events where people spent a length of time in each others’ close company”, such as apres ski parties in the Austrian resort of Ischgl, the Trompete nightclub in Berlin and a football match in northern Italy.“Mass events are a perfect opportunity for the virus, as people meet total strangers,” said Niki Popper, a mathematician at Vienna’s Technical University whose team has been developing a simulation that could help governments predict the development of the pandemic more accurately.Instead of merely multiplying the number of daily cases by a certain factor, Popper’s example tries to account for what he calls the starting point of “local epidemic networks”.“If you have 100 or 200 people spend enough time in a room with a person carrying the virus, then for example 20 might walk out with the new infection and, after a few days’ incubation time, pass it on to their families and workmates, let’s assume 10 more people each. Within a few days, the virus can thus multiply 200 times with only one new incident - and then continue.”Large parties played a key role in the pandemic’s rapid expansion not just in central Europe, but also in the US and Australia. New York may now be the centre of the US outbreak, but the traditional festivities around Mardi Gras is thought to have been a catalyst for a large outbreak in New Orleans.On 25 February the entire city, with almost 400,000 residents, and an estimated tourist crowd of 1.4 million people from all over the world were swallowed up in a tide of music, floats, extravagant costumes, cocktails and revelry for the climax of carnival.As is traditional in this Louisiana city on the Mississippi, gatherings and parades had begun weeks before, from 6 January onwards. Many people flung the doors of their houses open and crammed in friends, family, neighbours, strangers – all jostling, dancing, hugging, eating and drinking together.There were no social restrictions during carnival. Only weeks later, on 20 March did the mayor of New Orleans issue a stay-at-home order for the city, with Louisiana ordering statewide restrictions two days later, closing schools and all non-essential businesses. “Mardi Gras was the perfect storm, it provided the perfect conditions for the spread of this virus,” said Rebekah Gee, head of Louisiana State University’s healthcare services ision. For health authorities that were still trying to track and contain inidual infections at this stage of the pandemic, party clusters represented a particular challenge since revellers would often travel from and return to other regions, other countries or even other continents.In Australia, for example, at least 30 people including backpackers became infected after attending a crowded dance party at Bondi Beach’s Bucket List pavilion on 15 March. The party took place the night before restrictions came into force on gatherings of more than 500 people, during a weekend of mixed messages from the authorities. Australia’s prime minister was urging people not to gather in large numbers, but also saying he would go to a football game.Many of those who attended the “Back to Boogie Wonderland – Tropicana” event, which told people to release their “inner Caribbean dancer”, later retired to local backpacker hostels with dorm rooms and shared facilities.The Waverley council area, which encompasses Bondi and its backpacker community, has now become a hotspot for Covid-19, with many of its 140 cases linked to bars, clubs and restaurants, including the Bucket List.In many countries, partygoers and organisers have found themselves on the receiving end of a backlash. In Australia, the Bucket List’s Facebook page is full of livid comments condemning “idiots” who gathered to party. In Germany, cars with Heinsberg number plates have had their windows smashed and have been jeered as “corona spreaders”.But the novel coronavirus did not require social gatherings to have an overtly hedonistic character to flourish. In the week of 17 to 21 February, around 2,500 worshippers gathered at the Porte Ouverte Christian church in the Bourtzwiller district of Mulhouse, in Alsace, eastern France, for one of the most anticipated events in the evangelical calendar.They came from far and wide including from France’s overseas territories and Corsica, for a week of fasting and prayer – held annually for the last 25 years.“During the five days, the worshippers greeted each other, pecked each other on the cheeks, and held hands, sometimes while praying during the services,” Nathalie Schnoebelen, spokesperson for the church said afterwards.At the time, nobody thought more of it it would be almost a month before France went into a national lockdown. A small cluster of coronavirus cases had broken out in the unfortunately named Contamines ski resort in the Alps, but most coronavirus cases were still confined to China.“Contrary to what certain politicians have said, we didn’t ignore the basic rules because at the time there were not any,” Schnoebelen said.It was only after the congregation at the Porte Ouverte had dispersed and several worshippers tested positive for the coronavirus that concerns were raised. Among those who tested positive were the church’s main pastor, Samuel Peterschmitt (son of Jean Peterschmitt, who founded the Porte Ouverte church in 1966).In total 18 people from the Peterschmitt family tested positive for Covid-19. Samuel Peterschmitt’s son Jonathan admitted that worshippers had been in close confines for a week in “conditions relatively ideal if a virus wants to develop”.By the time it had been identified as a cradle for the virus, church worshippers had unwittingly passed it on to others. A nurse who had been at the Porte Ouverte is believed to have originated a cluster that contaminated 250 colleagues at Strasbourg University hospital, where she worked.Two retired worshippers returned to their home in the Ajaccio region of the Mediterranean island of Corsica. There are now at least 263 positive cases and 21 deaths on the island.A delegation of five church-goers from French Guiana, led by their evangelical pastor Gilles Sax, returned to the French overseas territory on the north-east coast of South America, on 25 February. Sax said he felt ill and was “trembling like a leaf” as soon as he returned..Other worshippers returned to cities and towns across France - Orléans, Besançon, Saint-Lô, Belfort, Dijon, Mâcon, Briançon, Paris. By 8 March, around 100 coronavirus cases had been linked to the church prayer week.Today, Mulhouse is one of the worst-hit areas in France with local hospitals overwhelmed by patients with the coronavirus.Christophe Lannelongue, until yesterday director general of the regional health authority, said: “It was a kind of atomic bomb that fell on us at the end of February and we didn’t notice it.”In Italy, which has recorded the highest number of deaths as a result of the virus, a Champions League football match between Atalanta and Spanish team Valencia on 19 February in Milan has been described as the “biological bomb” that turned the north of the country into the centre of the country’s outbreak.But scientists like Massimo Galli, the head of the infectious disease unit at the Sacco hospital in Milan, believe the spread is more likely to have accelerated in smaller clusters in the valleys around Bergamo.“We know Covid-19 is particularly efficient at transmitting within familial groups,” Galli told the . “In osterias crowded with elderly people, it would have found a perfect environment.”A similar gathering that brought together older and younger citizens preceded an outbreak of the virus in Italy’s south-east. On 3 March, hundreds of people gathered to pay their last respects at the funeral in San Marco in Lamis, a small city of 13,000. The 74-year-old man being buried had died after complications of what seemed to be a case of seasonal flu.Until that day, there had been seven cases of coronavirus infection in Puglia, the heel of Italy’s boot. The photos of patients in the red zones of northern Italy, and the first fatalities in Lombardy, seemed unimaginable, much like the national lockdown that was extended a few days later across the entire country.However, soon after the funeral, the man’s wife, who had just begun mourning the death of her husband, received a call informing her that her husband had tested positive for coronavirus.According to Ludovico Vaccaro, head of the public prosecutor’s office in Foggia, “a postmortem revealed the man was infected with Covid-19, but the result came out only after his body was released to the family for the funeral. They should have waited for the result of the test before handing over the man’s body.”Authorities said that, a few days earlier, the man had travelled to Cremona, in the north of Italy, to visit his daughter. Upon returning, he began to experience flu-like symptoms.According to doctors and investigators, the man had infected his daughter and wife before he died. At the funeral, they then came into contact with dozens of relatives and friends who gave their condolences to the family with handshakes and hugs, opening a gateway for one of the first clusters in southern Italy. As a result, 110 people were quarantined, dozens of whom tested positive for coronavirus. Two have died.The prosecutor’s office in Foggia has begun an investigation into what the governor of Puglia has called a “catastrophic error”. Behind one of the most dramatic cases of the virus’s spread is human error: if doctors had waited for the test results before handing over the body to family members, perhaps dozens of people could have avoided infection.Thinking of the coronavirus pandemic as a process that can speed up dramatically through human clusters also affects the considerations of policymakers who are plotting a route out of the current lockdown. When governments start to relax the current social distancing measures, can they also afford to allow large social, cultural or religious gatherings to go ahead?“The image of the Covid-19 epidemic as a curve has taken hold in the collective imagination, but my fear is that we are actually dealing with a loop,” said mathematician Popper. “As soon as restrictions are loosened, there could be new clusters that allow the spread to accelerate again.”The story of the pandemic in Vietnam serves as a cautionary tale.The south-east Asian country recorded its first cases of coronavirus on 23 January, a development that prompted swift action from officials. Vietnam kept many schools closed following the traditional lunar new year holiday late in January, and banned flights to and from China on 1 February. It also became the first country outside China to introduce a mass quarantine, when, on 12 February, officials isolated villages about 25 miles (40km) from Hanoi that were home to 10,000 people.Vietnam had detected no new cases for three weeks when a flight from London touched down at Hanoi’s Noi Bai international airport on 2 March. Among the hundreds of passengers onboard was a 27-year-old Vietnamese woman returning after a trip to attend exclusive fashion week events in Europe. Along with her sister, she had sat among guests at a Gucci show in Milan, and watched Yves Saint Laurent in Paris, documenting her travels on Instagram.The woman later told the New York Times that she had flown to Milan on 18 February and that, at the time, “no one was talking about the virus”. She travelled to Paris on 25 February, she added, and said she felt fine when she flew home that week.Days after arriving back in Vietnam, she developed a cough and tested positive for coronavirus, becoming the country’s “patient 17”. As of 7 April, Vietnam has 245 confirmed infections. The effort to trace and contain the virus has to start all over again.• This article was amended on 9 April 2020.

Situated close to the town of Grindavík and the popular Blue Lagoon tourist attraction, and only nine miles (15km) from Iceland’s international airport, the region last erupted about 800 years ago (though there have been more recent eruptions offshore). Geological evidence shows the area is fed by five volcanic systems, which seem to come to life in a coordinated way roughly every 1,000 years.The last period of volcanic activity on the peninsula began in the 10th century and continued until the 13th. Unlike typical Icelandic volcanoes, which tend to wake for a few years and then die down, when this region gets going it appears to splutter on and off for up to 300 years, producing eruptive episodes (locally known as “fires”) lasting a few decades. Long thin cracks known as fissures extend up to five miles (8km), producing fountains of lava, usually without large amounts of ash or explosive activity.The most recent “fires” occurred between 1210 and 1240 and covered about 50 sq km of land in lava. At least six separate eruptions occurred, each lasting weeks to months, interspersed with gaps of up to 12 years with no activity. Volcanic rock fragments and particles were carried tens of kilometres by the wind and written sources report the rockfall causing problems for livestock in the area.If a similar series of eruptions occurred today, the Iceland GeoSurvey calculates that runways at Keflavík airport could be coated in 2cm of ash, temporarily halting all flights.“Wind direction during times of ash production is critical – anything with a slight northerly aspect is going to cause problems for the international airport and the metropolitan area of Reykjavík,” said McGarvie.“The worst-case scenario is if lava flows towards the town of Grindavík,” said Kristín Jónsdóttir from the Icelandic Meteorological Office. “There is also other important infrastructure in the vicinity including a geothermal power plant. Hot and cold water supply may be at risk, along with roads, including the road between Reykjavík and Keflavík airport.”Icelanders are rarely fazed by volcanic activity, but they will be keeping a close eye on the Reykjanes peninsula. Because the eruptions are likely to be relatively small and occasional they will be easier to cope with than massive and sudden outpourings of lava like the 1783-84 Laki eruption, but if the pattern is indeed about to repeat, it will present a new kind of challenge for Icelanders.“People on the Reykjanes peninsula, and their descendants for several generations, may have to be on their guard and ready to evacuate every so often,” said McGarvie."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c4a879b5b777ed05ea4f1750756bf84b8bb9b5b9/256_0_3306_1984/master/3306.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=267d5b0ae0318b76cd59d5dbb4bf37e7","title":"coronavirus good news upside blessings covid positive","story":"Though our blessings may be well disguised in this pandemic, we must still count them“Everything bad in life is eventually a blessing.”I’m not sure where I read this – it may well have been in this wonderful novel by Taffy Brodesser-Akner.

A breakdown, a miscarriage, a job lost – they all led to better things.The phrase reminds me of something Winston Churchill supposedly said on losing the 1945 election. His wife apparently told him that defeat may well have been a blessing in disguise. “Madame, if this is a blessing, it is indeed well disguised,” he replied.And yet a blessing it was. Britain got Attlee, the welfare state, the NHS. Churchill got a rest, and then his swansong six years later. The rest is history.And so to the present.

Its earliest findings suggest younger children (aged four to 10) are more worried than those in the 11-16 age group. According to parents’ perceptions, their older children are significantly less worried, though researchers point out it can be hard for parents to know what their adolescent children are feeling, in contrast with younger children who may express their fears more openly to their parents.“But one of the things we can see here is that the majority of children are not worrying excessively about it, but seem to be taking it in their stride. There are, however, a significant sub-group who are reporting high levels of worry.”“Research has provided valuable information about how parents and carers can support their children’s mental health in general,” said Creswell. “However, at this point, we know very little about what might be most effective in the current context of Covid-19. We hope to have more than 10,000 parents and carers across the UK complete the new online survey. Their responses will help us really understand how families are coping and what support could make all the difference to children, young people and their families at this time.”Wendy Minhinnett, who leads a support group for parents of young people who struggle with mental health difficulties, said many parents were struggling. “People are feeling really, really isolated and alone. When you are supporting a child with mental health issues, that puts extra pressure on you.”She said families where grandparents normally played a key role but no longer could because of the lockdown had been severely affected, as had families with children diagnosed with autism whose routines had been entirely disrupted.“One parent said, ‘My son will not let me go anywhere because he is so frightened of me catching something’. People are really, really anxious about it.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/48b0f66b158280333567af408302a7db7fcd3b15/0_7_3000_1801/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7e0833b5b2080b3acfe2e9dd8b76a287","title":"lisa nandy seeks urgent meeting with dominic raab over covid 19 repatriations","story":"Shadow foreign secretary wants to know why thousands remain stranded a fortnight after £75m rescue mission was announcedThe shadow foreign secretary, Lisa Nandy, is demanding an immediate meeting with the head of the Foreign Office as thousands of British nationals remain stranded abroad two weeks after Dominic Raab unveiled his £75m coronavirus rescue mission.Nandy’s office has let the foreign secretary know they are seeking a meeting with the permanent secretary “as an absolute matter of urgency”, a spokesman said after a conference call with 70 MPs and staff to discuss the continuing repatriation crisis.MPs expressed concern about Britons stranded in India, Pakistan, Australia and New Zealand, which closed its borders two weeks ago.They also expressed frustration that 11 new rescue flights were being laid on for India while none were being planned for Pakistan, where it emerged there could be as many as 20,000 stranded Britons.During the call there were also complaints that the Foreign Office was fobbing off politicians who were making representations about their constituents with stock emails and an “auto-response” saying emails were not being monitored.Planes organised by the government have already been organised for Peru, Ghana, Algeria, India, Nepal and South Africa, with Ecuador and Bolivia also on the list. There have also been calls for charter flights to be laid on to Argentina.A retired GP, Adrienne Newton, who has been stranded for weeks in Córdoba, 700km (435 miles) from Buenos Aires, said the embassy, had sent details at 1am on the day of a potential Air France flight from Buenos Aires.After protesting on Twitter that there were no connections to the capital because of the lockdown, the embassy tweeted details of a transport company “that has worked with other embassies, good luck!”, she said.“If other countries are contracting companies to transport its nationals to airports for flights home, why isn’t ours? Clearly it’s not a logistical issue. The flight yesterday with KLM left Buenos Aires half empty. I am starting to think this is not just a question of inefficiency,” she added.Meanwhile, the Foreign Office says that as long as the Pakistani government allows the national airline, PIA, to continue repatriation flights to London, there is no need to charter flights.It says it has already repatriated 4,000 of 6,000 people stranded in that country and was confident it could get thousands more home on PIA flights.However, in a conference call between the government’s South Asia minister, Lord Ahmad, the UK high commissioner in Pakistan and 10 MPs with large numbers of constituents stranded, it emerged there could be tens of thousands of Britons stuck in the country.Sam Tarry, the Labour MP for South Ilford, who was on the call, said: “I know the British high commission has been working very hard on this. They said that there’s going to be a series of more flights. They’re saying there are up to 20,000 people who want to come home.”He added that MPs on the call raised the issue of the “lack of faith” in PIA to deliver further flights after constituents paid out thousands of pounds for tickets on flights that were cancelled. But he was told that charter flights would be difficult. “They felt the issues were going to be that the Pakistan government were not going to open the international airspace to obviously allow charter flights to take place. So they were saying essentially the only option is PIA.”Afzal Khan, the shadow deputy leader of the House of Commons, said that British nationals in Pakistan were “still having to pay for the chaotic mismanagement of PIA and the British repatriation effort”, in a letter to Raab.​A spokesperson for the FCO said Lord Ahmad and the high commission were “in close contact with their Pakistani counterparts as well as PIA, the national carrier, to ensure that commercial flight routes are kept open between our two countries.”It added that there had been 17 flights between Pakistan for the UK since 4 April, “returning in excess of 6000 people to the UK”. It said it was working hard with the local authorities to keep flights “operational in the coming days.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/37f49628e3071361a7028e1ca26a26087cd30107/0_21_2144_1286/master/2144.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ca29798b78a0faec80f9f6ae530271ac","title":"newsround cbbc kids tv is responding to the coronavirus","story":"Shows such as CBBC’s Newsround are trying to alleviate anxieties children have about the pandemicChildren’s TV and radio presenters are finding new ways to stop their audiences feeling stressed, following reports that young children are become increasingly anxious about the coronavirus pandemic.The BBC’s long-running Newsround programme has seen its audience rise substantially for its three daily broadcasts on the CBBC channel and its dedicated website, with its reporters trying to find ways to provide optimistic takes on the news without sugarcoating the situation.“So many kids now have anxiety issues,” said Ricky Boleto, a presenter on the programme. “We’re letting kids know that we focus on what’s happening in their homes and gardens without making them feel they have to sort out the world’s problems … They’re sending questions such as ‘Is my grandmother going to die’? We’ve been trying to put them at ease.”He said children “have a very good moral compass, probably better than most adults” and Newsround aims to cover stories without patronising audiences: “The most important thing for us is to tell stories in a way that doesn’t presume knowledge, doesn’t patronise, and makes young people feel that this is their programme.”The programme has seen an increased emphasis on asking children to submit their own material on how they are dealing with the lockdown while schools are closed: “There’s scary headlines elsewhere but Newsround is a safe space for kids to turn to while coronavirus changes everything about our lives. We try to be a positive platform as well and focus on what good is being done.”Other changes are having to be made to children’s output. Amid the ongoing travel restrictions, the CBBC broom cupboard – the location where presenters introduce the next programme on the kids’ channel – has been transferred to presenters’ homes for the first time in 44 years. The BBC is also preparing to launch an enormous range of educational programmes from 20 April onwards.Matt Deegan, who runs the independent national children’s radio station Fun Kids, said he has had to change the station’s output to reflect the new reality: “Our presenters refer to the fact that they’re broadcasting from home and talk about the positives and sometimes the negatives.”He has also launched a daily children’s podcast called Stuck at Home, which has suggestions like using what’s in the recycling bin as as source for collages or creating Zoom quizzes for other family members. It has also become the first piece of content from a commercial radio station to be made available on BBC Sounds.Deegan said young children pick up on the severity of the situation: “I think there’s an awareness by them that parents think it’s serious and their sporadic anxiousness often gets eye rolls. The sheer volume of news drives parents to discuss things more openly than perhaps they normally would.”Boleto, the Newsround host, said explaining the news in simple terms for children was a real challenge: “Nick Robinson and Evan Davis have said that writing scripts for Newsround is harder than their day jobs. You have to go from the start, not presume any knowledge, and tell the story.”However, there is still space for some lightness on the show amid the pandemic gloom. He said: “We do still throw in the odd skateboarding dog and panda birth.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3640c2cb134a1236e456d2136a5a5d0d0621148e/0_240_6454_3873/master/6454.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=acb89a2f7e1d245d6387b18cdca32183","title":"tech giants struggle stem infodemic false coronavirus claims","story":"Critics say efforts are too little, too late as research reveals vast majority of false claims appear onlineClick over to Google, type in “coronavirus”, and press enter.The results you see will bear little resemblance to any other search.There are no ads, no product recommendations, and no links to websites that have figured out how to win the search engine optimisation game. Government, NGO and mainstream media sources dominate.Algorithms and user-generated content are out gatekeepers and fact checking are in.Silicon Valley has responded to the “infodemic” with aggressive intervention and an embrace of official sources and traditional media outlets.Across the social web – on Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, Reddit, Instagram and Pinterest – search results related to Covid-19 are similarly predetermined.Instagram delivers a pop-up urging US users to go to the website for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) – or UK users to the NHS – rather than look at the memes and pictures tagged with #coronavirus.On Facebook, a dedicated “Information Center” includes a mix of curated information and official medical advice. On Pinterest, the only infographics and memes to be found on topics such as “Covid-19” or “hydroxychloroquine” are those made by internationally recognised health organisations, such as the WHO.It is a stark contrast to how social media platforms have dealt with misinformation in the past.US-based platforms, shaped by Silicon Valley’s libertarian ethos and protected by the first amendment, have long been reluctant to take a proactive editorial role or censor speech that could be considered political.They have had to be pushed, prodded, cajoled, protested, and shamed into addressing hate speech, anti-vaxx propaganda and the harassment of victims of mass shootings.On coronavirus, they have competed to be responsible and reliable sources of information. Yet still misinformation continues to adapt and spread, largely on social media.A conspiracy theory falsely linking 5G to the coronavirus pandemic has led to real-world consequences, including threats and harassment against telecom engineers and petrol bomb attacks on telephone poles.Carl Bergstrom, a University of Washington professor of biology who also studies and has written a book about misinformation, says the efforts of the social media companies are too little, too late.“They’ve built this whole ecosystem that is all about engagement, allows viral spread, and hasn’t ever put any currency on accuracy,” he said. “Now all of a sudden we have a serious global crisis, and they want to put some Band-Aids on it. It’s better than not acting, but praising them for doing it is like praising Philip Morris for putting filters on cigarettes.”Some of the more radical steps taken by tech companies include Twitter’s new policy to remove misinformation that contradicts official public health advice, such as tweets encouraging people not to follow physical distancing guidelines, and WhatsApp’s strict new limits on message forwarding.The platforms feel they can be much more aggressive on coronavirus misinformation than they have been on political misinformation, said Claire Wardle of the non-profit organisation First Draft.“There are no two sides with coronavirus, so they don’t have people on the other side saying: ‘We want this,’ the way you do with anti-vaxxers or political misinformation,” said Wardle. “They are freer to act.”It is also relatively simple and straightforward for the platforms to select trusted sources of authoritative information – the WHO, NHS, CDC, etc – without appearing politically biased.Wardle faulted the tech companies for not being better prepared for the crisis, however. Facebook has long ignored the conspiracy communities that organise using Facebook groups, such as anti-vaxxers, followers of QAnon, and people who believe 5G is harmful. Coronavirus misinformation is rampant in those communities.And while the scientific nature of the crisis may lessen some of the external political pressures over how to moderate speech, it also brings with it a slew of challenges. The coronavirus is brand new, and the scientific understanding of it changes daily.Bergstrom described this conundrum as an “uncertainty vacuum”. “Any reasonable authority will not give you a straight answer” to certain questions about the pandemic, “not because they’re trying to mislead you, but because they don’t know yet,” he said. Another complicating factor is that normally trustworthy sources are not providing reliable information.“We’ve seen the US government, particularly the White House, becoming a significant purveyor of misinformation around the virus,” Bergstrom said.Facebook and Twitter have removed posts by prominent and powerful people over coronavirus misinformation, including the Brazilian president, Jair Bolsonaro, but the real test of their resolve will be whether they ever take action against misinformation by Trump.“We planned for years for this pandemic, but we never realised that we would be fighting a war on two fronts,” said Bergstrom. “One against the pandemic, and one against all the disinformation and hate and fear that is being amped up and enflamed by political opportunists.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a5f62b64ffe5550738eeb72485c039400a35c26c/0_92_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=668e778840bb4ee1d25df1dd462ccf13","title":"uk curator criticises misleading reports about looted items","story":"British Museum expert rejects claim that Europe is flooded with recently stolen artefactsReporting of the illegal trade in antiquities from Iraq and Syria is leading to a false impression that the European market is flooded with looted items, according to a British Museum curator.“There’s a very strong tendency to say that all objects without provenance are the produce of recent looting,” he said. “But some objects have been circulating for decades, if not longer. It’s a case of assessing each item on its own merits.”Simpson said that in his role as an adviser for UK law enforcement on items that have been seized on exit or entry into the country, there has yet to be a proven case of a recently looted item from Syria being discovered in Britain.He said: “I think the really telling statistic is that over the last eight years of the Syrian civil war we have yet to prove any objects have come into Britain that demonstrably come from looting in Syria,” he said. “We are investigating cases at the moment but that is a remarkable figure.”In March, a UN-backed report stated Germany had become an international destination for trafficking illegal antiquities from the eastern Mediterranean, including Iraq and Syria, with almost half of the 6,000 examined items coming from the two countries.Markus Hilgert, general secretary of the foundation, said the report’s findings were shocking, especially in light of EU trade restrictions in place for both Iraq and Syria. “In view of the ongoing, extensive destruction and looting of archaeological cultural assets in Iraq and Syria, this is an alarming finding,” Hilgert added.Simpson said in Syria there had been “ad-hoc and opportunistic looting” but the picture painted by the German foundation’s study was down to “rather simplistic” reporting. “Put it this way,” he said. “I would like see every one of those objects personally to be confident that they are from recent looting rather than older items or fakes.”The curator said the situation in the UK is completely different from the 1990s, when large numbers of looted Iraqi items were sold. He called for “caution and curatorial intelligence” to be used when deciding when and where items originated.“Some of these objects floating around on the western market could actually come not from recent looting, they’re probably coming from 1990s or 2003 looting,” he added.The British Museum recently launched the Circulating Artefacts project, to “counteract looting and trafficking of cultural artefacts”. It created a database of objects designed to help curb the trade in illicit objects from Sudan and Egypt.But it has also been criticised for items in its collection that were acquired by looting, such as the Benin Bronzes, which were taken in a “punitive expedition” led by British troops in 1897.Senegalese academic Felwine Sarr co-authored a report that recommended a restitution programme to transfer hundreds of items from European institutions to Africa.

Both the deleted pages were accessed from online caches.Prof Steve Tsang, director of the SOAS China Institute in London, said the Chinese government had had a heavy focus on how the evolution and management of the virus is perceived since the early days of the outbreak.“In terms of priority, controlling the narrative is more important than the public health or the economic fallout,” he said. “It doesn’t mean the economy and public health aren’t important. But the narrative is paramount.”With the virus having infected more than a million people worldwide and caused heavy casualties particularly across Europe and the US, details about its origin and the first weeks of the pandemic – when there was a cover-up by local officials – may be considered particularly sensitive.“If these documents are authentic it would suggest the government really wants to control the narrative about the origins of Covid-19 very tightly,” said Tsang of the reports of new regulations.China University of Geosciences (Wuhan) appears to have published and then deleted new requirements that academic papers dealing with the origins of the virus be approved by China’s ministry of science and technology before publication.The university’s academic committee was expected to first go through the research “with an emphasis on checking the accuracy of the thesis, as well as whether it is suitable for publication,” the regulation said.Despite its name, the geosciences university announced elsewhere on its website that it was carrying out coronavirus research.A separate document obtained by the , which could not be independently verified, appears to be from the Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University and also said publication of research into the origins of Covid-19 would need approval from the science and technology ministry.Another notice, which appears to have been published on 9 April by the school of information science and technology at Fudan University in Shanghai, called for “strict and serious” management of papers investigating the source of the outbreak.Papers could only be submitted for publication after being approved by a special office. Email, names and phone numbers provided on the notice suggested that office was part of China’s ministry of education.A source who alerted the  to cached versions of the websites, and who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said they were concerned by what appeared to be an attempt by Chinese authorities to intervene in the independence of the scientific process.The person said researchers submitting academic papers on other medical topics did not have to vet their work with government ministries before seeking publication.A technical analysis of the cached websites indicated that the posts were published on verified university websites before they were removed.  could not independently verify that they reflected a new government policy.The notices appear to be part of a broader push to manage research on the virus. The science and technology ministry said on 3 April that ongoing clinical research on the coronavirus must be reported to authorities within three days or be halted.In March China’s president, Xi Jinping, published an essay that included “tracing the origin of the virus” on a list of national priorities. It was referenced by the science and technology ministry shortly before the universities posted their orders. The Chinese government did not reply to a request for comment sent by the  to the Chinese embassy in Washington.While the exact origin of the pandemic is still not certain, one commonly held hypothesis is that it began following an interaction between a human and an animal at the Huanan seafood “wet market” in Wuhan.Scientists have said the virus probably originated in bats and then passed through an intermediary animal before infecting the first human.Scientists believe the transmission was similar to that in the 2002 outbreak of Sars. Some criticism of China has focused on why the government did not shut down wet markets after the previous outbreaks of coronaviruses.Kevin Carrico, a senior research fellow of Chinese studies at Monash University, said he was not aware of any specific recent change to rules for academic research in China in connection to Covid-19, but the documents were generally consistent with efforts by China to control the narrative of the pandemic.“They are seeking to transform it from a massive disaster to one where the government did everything right and gave the rest of the world time to prepare,” Carrico said. Carrico said those efforts had been evident in communications ranging from government pronouncements at the highest level to public sentiment on social media.“There is a desire to a degree to deny realities that are staring at us in the face … that this is a massive pandemic that originated in a place that the Chinese government really should have cleaned up after Sars,” he said.Around a month ago senior Chinese diplomats, officials and state media all publicly encouraged speculation that the new coronavirus could have come from outside the country. The foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian suggested without evidence that the US military might have brought the virus to Wuhan.

Refusing to share debt across the eurozone threatens the union’s futureEurope suffered a historic defeat on Thursday night. After weeks of impasse, the Eurogroup gathering of finance ministers, whose countries share the euro, reached a decision on their collective response to the coronavirus pandemic’s economic impact. Besides constituting an epic dereliction of duty, the Eurogroup’s decision dealt a decisive blow to the foundations of the European Union – much to the delight of Europe’s critics and enemies.Most of continental Europe using the euro is in lockdown. The economic shockwaves caused by a lockdown do not care what currency we use. Just as in the United Kingdom, the United States or Japan, the precipitous falls in private incomes must be counterbalanced by substantial increases in public expenditure. If governments fail in this, the sum of private and public expenditure (which equals aggregate income) will crash even faster, bankruptcies will burgeon and government tax revenues will collapse further in the medium turn.The challenge facing the 19 countries of the eurozone is unique. The massive boost in public debt that is now so necessary is hampered by the quaint arrangement of sharing a central bank that, on the one hand, has no common treasury to lean against and, on the other, is banned from backing directly the 19 treasuries that must borrow in euros to fight the crisis. The euro crisis that began in 2010 stretched this monetary architecture to its limits. The coronavirus recession is now pushing it beyond them.With the countries worst hit by Covid-19, such as Italy, being the most indebted and thus the least able to shoulder the necessary new debt, an impossible conundrum emerges: the new debt needed to revive the private sector will push the state into default, so destroying the banks whose capital is mostly government debt and, in short order, the rest of the private sector. The only way out of this trap is for the new debt not to fall on the weak shoulders of the most indebted eurozone countries but to be shared across the eurozone. Except that this debt-sharing is banned by the treaties that created the eurozone, at the insistence of the northern european countries running a trade surplus with the rest.Before the Eurogroup met, hope was in the air that Europe would, at last, change its rules to save its greatest creation: the European Union. Unlike in 2015, when I was alone in the Eurogroup in demanding a common instrument for restructuring public debt, in the past few weeks the governments of eight southern states, plus France, demanded a rethink on debt-sharing without which the eurozone will remain an iron cage of austerity for most and a source of economic stagnation for everyone. Belatedly, but correctly, they demanded a so-called “eurobond”: a common debt instrument that allows total long-term debt to shrink by transferring a portion of it from member states, which have a lot of debt, to the eurozone, which has none.This debate is now dead in the water, killed off by the Eurogroup’s decision to rely almost entirely on new debts falling squarely on the member states’ weakened shoulders. The only concession to the nine governments suggesting debt-sharing was that the new ESM loans will have no strings attached to them. This is, alas, a red herring as the conditions will come later, once the eurozone’s fiscal rules bite again.The message today to Italians, Spaniards and Greeks is: your government can borrow large amounts from Europe’s bailout fund. No conditions. You will also receive help to pay for unemployment benefits from countries where employment holds up better. But, within a year or two, as your economies are recovering, huge new austerity measures will be demanded to bring your government’s finances back into line, including the repayment of the monies spent on your unemployment benefits. This is equivalent to helping the fallen get up but striking them over the head as they begin to rise.The EU is, of course, a lot more than a monetary area. It is a peace project, a realm of shared culture, a source of identity and an opportunity to stem toxic nationalism. Nonetheless, if its economic foundation buckles, powerful centrifugal forces already in play are ready to tear the union apart. Thursday’s Eurogroup verdict, besides being macroeconomically insignificant, was politically irresponsible and a fantastic boon for Eurosceptics in Europe, the UK and indeed in the White House.• Yanis Varoufakis is the co-founder of DiEM25 (Democracy in Europe Movement) and former finance minister of Greece"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/10390413e0494f666c9eb180aec86d9824d7ae3b/1257_646_5463_3278/master/5463.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=314af9802cfbd0976dd4006d273dfa53","title":"the uk coronavirus lockdown by guardian and observer photographers","story":"From an unusually quiet Millennium bridge to dawn swimmers on Portobello beach, the sights and ambience of lockdown"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9d4a6172bb5e6113fdb61453cd17bc9e3682e3a1/0_0_1000_600/master/1000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a4272a7f1c314b592cbec4cc4c2d70a2","title":"how coronavirus spread across the globe visualised","story":"From early beginnings in China, the Covid-19 pandemic has spread rapidly across the globeSince New Year’s Eve the world has lived through 100 days of Covid-19. There have been over 1.3m confirmed cases, and over 75,000 deaths. Billions of people are confined to their homes and stock markets have plummeted. Here is how the crisis unfolded. Note: Data for the first 20 days is reconstructed from early WHO situation reports and the later progress of the disease. The case counts for the remaining days comes from the open source Johns Hopkins data repository.There are some tentative indications that “the curve is flattening” in Italy and Spain, as the number of new cases each day falls. But the UK and the US have so far seemed to be about two weeks behind Italy in the progress of the disease, so their worst days may well be yet to come. Similarly, although the Chinese city of Wuhan is gradually reopening after two months of lockdown, it is by no means clear when or how other countries will begin to return to normal. In the meantime, scientists are working on several fronts to develop treatments and possibly vaccines some of those trials may start to show results in the next month or so, but a viable vaccine could still be 18 months away.Data caveatsThe case counts come from data compiled by Johns Hopkins University, one of the most reliable sources. The figures reflect the available data at the time this article was first published. Occasionally there are differences in the case counts between the Johns Hopkins website dashboard and the open source data repository used here. For the first 20 days, the evolution of cases is reconstructed from early WHO situation reports and the later progress of the disease. But the data should be treated with caution throughout as countries take different approaches to testing, and scientists believe many people may have been infected with the disease without suffering symptoms."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4225130.1586441705!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"are you due a covid 19 refund on health insurance school fees travel card or gym","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe Government has taken  over the facilities of 19 private hospitals.

Photograph: Leon FarrellPoolEPA. The HSE expects to clear the backlog of coronavirus tests by next week, Minister for Health Simon Harris has said.Mr Harris said about 7,000 samples can now be tested per day with GPs currently referring about 2,000 cases for a test daily.About 25,000 samples have been sent to Germany for testing and 16,000 of those have now returned, he said, with the remainder expected back this week, by which point the backlog will be cleared.The Minister said more tests may be sent to Germany in the future but that these would be processed much more quickly. Some testing centres lay idle this week because there was not enough demand for them, he said.According to the most recent figures about 60,000 tests for coronavirus, which causes the disease Covid-19, have been completed to date.Mr Harris said the Government’s goal is to increase testing to 15,000 or more a day and to be able to turn around a test within 48 hours.Ireland is the sixth highest in the EU for testing, Mr Harris said. “We’re a leader, but we want to do more.”He said the “next big challenge” will be to widen testing criteria so that, when restrictions are lifted, anyone with symptoms will be able to get a test quickly.RestrictionsDetails were also released of a letter the National Public Health Emergency Team sent Government on Friday recommending a three week extension to movement restrictions. Taoiseach Leo Varadkar announced the extension, which will run until May 5th, on Friday. The emergency team said the efforts of Irish people to contain the virus have had a “profound impact” on the trajectory of its spread and that there are “encouraging signs” of reduction. However, it said Ireland is at a “delicate and critical point” in terms of how to proceed.“The Irish people have saved many lives and will save many more,” Mr Harris said. “But it would not take much to go backwards.”Before considering lifting the current restrictions, the daily increase in new cases needs to come down below 5 per cent, the Minister said. It is currently just under 10 per cent, down from 30 per cent a few weeks ago.He said he would also like to see a stable number of about 100 people being treated for the disease in intensive care units. The current figure is about 150.The current figure for the number of people each infected person passes the virus onto is now at around one, down from more than four at the start of the crisis. Mr Harris said when it drops below one the virus will start to slowly die off.Creep upHe said the Government has the benefit of watching how other countries who confirmed cases of the virus before Ireland are lifting restrictions. He said it may be a case that some restrictions will be lifted but then reimposed if infections rates start to creep up again.The Government has also announced a new mental health initiative to support people struggling with the impact of the virus and the restrictions. A list of supports has been compiled on a government website and an extra €1 million has been allocated to the HSE for online counselling.“People in our country are really, really hurting,” Mr Harris said. “We need people to know it’s ok not to feel ok”He said a recent survey found seven out of 10 people are now consistently “very worried”, which is the level of worry someone feels when going through a highly stressful event such as losing their job.Four out of five people are worried about their family and friends and about the same number are worried about the economy, he said.

I am travelling to take up a care baton from my sister, who has been with vulnerable family members for almost a fortnight.“Essential Travel Only,” read some motorway signs I pass.Most of the other traffic on the M50 with me are trucks there are very few cars.At the first checkpoint, I explain why I am travelling, and am waved through at once and wished well. The second checkpoint comes as I exit the motorway to Mountrath, Co Laois. This time I explain I am a journalist on assignment, and although I offer to show my official letter from my employer, the garda doesn’t want to see it. It is a low-key policing approach one that is clearly dependent on respectful co-operation from the public to be truthful about the reason for their essential journey.At Mountrath the bunting from St Patrick’s Day still flies over the town’s streets, as do Tricolours. The town is buzzing with local traffic, and parking is difficult to find. Johnny Purcell, who owns Purcell’s Bar on the Main Square, is sitting out on a bench, talking to a friend. His bar is in a building more than 300 years old.“A lot of small bars like mine won’t open up again when this is over,” he says. “They might own their premises, as I do, and not have to pay rent, but there are still rates and electricity bills to pay. We have a lot of customers who are older people living out in the country. When will they ever come back into town again?”Seán Sharkey, owner of Conroy’s Pharmacy, says: “Who would have thought two months ago that we’d have a glass screen up between us and customers, and only one person allowed in the the shop at a time?”Michael Keegan, who owns a butchers shop, praises the support of local people for their continued custom. “But all the big orders are gone that I’d had from hotels and restaurants. One weekly order alone was for €1,500. At the moment I am just trying to keep the doors open.”Newly unemployedMother and daughter Margaret and Clodagh Nolan are waiting to use an ATM. They have both lost their jobs due to Covid-19.“I worked at the toll plaza and was let go last week, because there is so little traffic,” Clodagh says. “There is only one lane in three open now, and that’s automatic.”“I clean houses for older people, and my work stopped two weeks ago,” Margaret says.Unless the many groups of people gathered together chatting on the streets of Mountrath are all sharing the same household, it seems social distancing is not being routinely practised.Alcohol appears to be a common purchase. One man exits Centra carrying just a case of beer. Another has a case of cider. “We are all drinking much more now at home, and much more often,” says one woman in Centra with several bottles of wine in her basket who does not want to be named.In Nenagh, Co Tipperary, the signs in the windows of closed businesses tell their own stories of the inidual toll on people’s lives.“Due to fatigue and staff shortages, I am unable to continue business for the next few days,” reads a sign in Denis’s Butchers.“It is with a heavy heart that we have decided to temporarily close the bookshop,” reads a sign at Ryan’s Independent Bookshop.“These are unknown times for us all, so the main thing is to pull together for now and follow all the advice,” reads a sign at A Sportsman’s Dream.Philip Talbot’s menswear and protective clothing shop has been operating since 1947. He took over from his father in 1976, and runs the shop by himself. “Apart from Christmas, I have never closed longer than three days,” he says. “I have never, ever had a time like this. It’s unbelievable. I am the only staff, and I own the property, so costs are low, but there is no turnover.”Postage\u0026nbsppaidTalbot shows me an ad he placed this week in the local paper, the Nenagh . “Stuck at home?” it reads. “I will post (free of charge) any necessary items wanted, eg pyjamas, bedroom slippers, bed linen or Wellingtons, safety boots or rainwear or anything needed from my shop.”“I wanted to do something for my customers,” he says. “And I have had three calls already.” The day before he posted a pair of trousers to a customer. “She wanted to pay the postage, or go halves on it, but I insisted.” He paid the €9 postage himself.Jacqueline Redmond is out shopping, wearing a mask and gloves. “I am wiping everything,” she says. “I even wipe the letterbox after the post arrives.” She has lost her job as a cleaner at a local school.At Nenagh Fruit and Veg, Mark Counihan says: “I haven’t had time to bless myself.” There is a sign for duck eggs for sale, and one on a shelf of home-made jam that asks customers to return the jars. The shop is offering a free home delivery on Fridays for orders over €20. “Business here is up 50 per cent since all this started,” Counihan says. “People are still panic buying.”Back on the motorway heading west, there is virtually no traffic. I drive for almost 20 minutes and see fewer than half a dozen vehicles travelling in either direction.The toll plaza in Limerick is down to one automated lane. There is another checkpoint a few kilometres beyond the plaza, on to the M18 leading to Clare and Galway. I explain I am travelling for family reasons. “Mind yourself, and safe journey,” the garda says, and waves me on.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our Morning Briefing and Lunchtime Latest newsletters"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4227083.1586604949!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"coronavirus release of well known belfast lawyer from icu","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tNiall Murphy (43) gave a thumbs-up in video footage of him being wheeled from an intensive care unit (ICU) on Friday night.

The proper one from Mullingar Cathedral. Although as it turned out, it was the perfect warm-up to get everyone in the mood for an extra programme which was broadcast live directly afterwards from Government Buildings. We tuned in with barely bated breath. All over Isolation Nation, people knew in their hearts and souls what was coming. Would there be a big bank holiday weekend rollover jackpot? The Taoiseach didn’t keep his audience in suspense. He strode on to the platform in the government media centre accompanied by his glamorous assistants (Minister for Health Simon Harris and Minister for Education Joe McHugh) and the most famous chief medical officer in the history of Irish chief medical officers, Tony Holohan. Straight in with the grim news. The word according to Leo.“Good afternoon everyone. Throughout our history, Good Friday has had a special meaning. It is a day associated with suffering, and sacrifice, and sorrow . . .”Oh, goodnight. So that would be a no, then. No rollover idend this week, after a fortnight of hoping for the best. The Taoiseach tried to soften the blow by following up with words of hope about new beginnings, rebirth, renewal and better days to come. He had nothing but praise and gratitude for the people of Ireland who have come together magnificently to halt the spread of the vicious Covid-19 virus. ‘Feeling frustrated’It is difficult, but by observing the instructions to stay at home and observing social distancing, many lives have and will be saved. It’s a pain, Leo Varadkar acknowledged, but it’s for the greater good. “I know many people are feeling frustrated, and I know the fine weather makes it even harder. We want to be outside, we want to be with friends and family, and we want to feel like we can go anywhere. We want to be free.”But it cannot be. “Today’s message is that we cannot be complacent and we cannot lose focus. What we are doing is difficult, but it is making a difference, so we have to keep going. We need to persevere and we need to maintain our discipline and resolve.”And with that, the Taoiseach, on the advice of the experts, announced a three-week rollover period, holding out the enticing prospect of a restriction-ending jackpot at the next bank holiday weekend in May. At which point it will be “our fervent hope” that the Government can begin to “unwind” the measures. And parents can get used to not being so used to their children again. Which is where Joe McHugh came in. He brought the good news that schools are to remain closed for “the foreseeable future”, bringing unspeakable joy to all those parents enjoying the delights of homeschooling and monster choruses of OMG!! to Leaving Cert students facing delayed exams.Then back to the Minister for Health, who echoed the Taoiseach’s galvanising words to the public. The 33-year-old Minister, known now to legions of the soft-hearted as Simon “aah God, would you look at him” Harris, rowed in behind the Taoiseach’s galvanising words.Dark circlesDoes the chap ever sleep? He has dark circles over his dark circles and his quiff is getting more Morticia Addams by the day. He underscored the message, telling people their actions are making “a real and meaningful difference”. He outlined the encouraging figures. “You are doing this, you are making this happen, you are flattening the curve . . . You are saving so many lives. Isn’t that an incredible thing to say?”Just in case anyone was in doubt, Harris confirmed he is extending the legal regulations curtailing public activity during the Covid-19 crisis. Or the “Emergency”, with a capital E, as it is routinely described now in government dispatches. They need public buy-in above all else. But two weeks, we have all discovered, is a long time in pandemic prevention. “Doctors can save hundreds of lives during this pandemic, but you can save thousands,” said the Minister.Stirring words from Government Buildings in this critical “Keep Her Goin’ Patsy” stage in the war against Covid-19. “All we can do is take one day at a time. To think of others. And to choose hope and solidarity over self-interest and fear,” said the Taoiseach. “Thank you. Thank you for your forbearance and for the sacrifices you have made so far.” But the Taoiseach must also be told that patience is running thin. There is only so much forbearance. Only so much the people can take before they snap. Twice – twice – Leo Varadkar quoted Seamus Heaney in his speech. At the beginning and at the end. And this, after all the other times he has wantonly quoted Seamus Heaney. It’s too much.This poetry pandemic, this silent literary cliche, respects no political borders. The virus was once rampant in international speechwriting circles but the curve has since flattened to manageable proportions in nearly every part of the world apart from the USA around St Patrick’s Day. And in Ireland, where the Taoiseach has succumbed completely to the Heaney bug and is now a super-spreader.Do we have no other poets – alive or dead – worth quoting? Does the Taoiseach have no other volumes to plunder? Can somebody stage an intervention and shred his Heaney buke?Because this thing is infectious.“Between my finger and my thumbI’ll dig lumps out of Leo with it"},{"url":null,"title":"asia","story":"Move is likely to be part of attempt to control the narrative surrounding the pandemicDelayed response to coronavirus outbreak had consequences for Chinese city and the worldChina\u0026rsquos appointment like making \u0026lsquopyromaniac the town fire chief\u0026rsquo, says watchdogVirus lockdown lifted on Wuhan but imposed on Suifenhe on Russian frontierSurge in new cases in city-state and Hong Kong leads to tough new restrictionsCleric (78) to be freed from jail after Australian court quashes child abuse convictionsAuthorities work to stave off second wave amid struggle with ongoing outbreaks in WuhanScientists say survey shows damage more widespread than any preceding eventsMaha Vajiralongkorn was given permission to self-isolate with a 20-member harem in BavariaTokyo at centre of outbreak that has seen cases nearly double over past weekHospitals and morgues full as hundreds of deaths reported in city of GuayaquilDay of mourning sees country suspend all entertainment, observe three-minute silenceMove in Shenzhen after Beijing banned wildlife trade over outbreak\u0026rsquos link to Wuhan market\u0026lsquoWe must not be afraid to hold this regime to account,\u0026rsquo writes Cardinal Charles BoAs cases rise, experts warn that hands-off approach to containing outbreak is failingPrivileged and middle-classes continue to live comfortably in larger towns and citiesObservers sceptical of Pyongyang\u0026rsquos claim that country has had no cases of Covid-19Video adds to Taiwan\u0026rsquos grievances, including accusations health body ignored its early virus warningsCoronavirus crisis drives many poor workers to walk hundreds of kilometres to villagesLaunch described as \u0026lsquocrucial work of very great significance\u0026rsquo for national defenceStay on top of the latest news with our Morning Briefing and Lunchtime Latest newsletters"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4227106.1586610913!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"deleted pages suggest china clamping down on coronavirus research","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tepa08356906 Workers wearing protective face masks walk at Leishenshan Hospital, in Wuhan, China. Photograph: Roman PilipeyEPAChina is cracking down on publication of academic research about the origins of coronavirus, in what is likely to be part of a wider attempt to control the narrative surrounding the pandemic, documents published online by Chinese universities appear to show.Two websites for leading Chinese universities appear to have recently published and then removed pages that reference a new policy requiring academic papers dealing with coronavirus, also known as Covid-19, to undergo extra vetting before they are submitted for publication.Research on the origins of the virus is particularly sensitive and subject to checks by government officials, the notices posted on the websites of Fudan University and the China University of Geosciences (Wuhan) said. Both the deleted pages were accessed from online caches.Prof Steve Tsang, director of the SOAS China Institute in London, said the Chinese government had had a heavy focus on how the evolution and management of the virus is perceived since the early days of the outbreak.“In terms of priority, controlling the narrative is more important than the public health or the economic fallout,” he said. “It doesn’t mean the economy and public health aren’t important. But the narrative is paramount.”With the virus having infected more than a million people worldwide and caused heavy casualties particularly across Europe and the US, details about its origin and the first weeks of the pandemic – when there was a cover-up by local officials – may be considered particularly sensitive.“If these documents are authentic it would suggest the government really wants to control the narrative about the origins of Covid-19 very tightly,” said Mr Tsang of the reports of new regulations.PublishedChina University of Geosciences (Wuhan) appears to have published and then deleted new requirements that academic papers dealing with the origins of the virus be approved by China’s ministry of science and technology before publication.The university’s academic committee was expected to first go through the research “with an emphasis on checking the accuracy of the thesis, as well as whether it is suitable for publication,” the regulation said.Despite its name, the geosciences university announced elsewhere on its website that it was carrying out coronavirus research.A separate document obtained by the , which could not be independently verified, appears to be from the Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University and also said publication of research into the origins of Covid-19 would need approval from the science and technology ministry.Another notice, which appears to have been published on April 9th by the school of information science and technology at Fudan University in Shanghai, called for “strict and serious” management of papers investigating the source of the outbreak.Papers could only be submitted for publication after being approved by a special office. Email, names and phone numbers provided on the notice suggested that office was part of China’s ministry of education.Cached versionsA source who alerted the  to cached versions of the websites, and who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said they were concerned by what appeared to be an attempt by Chinese authorities to intervene in the independence of the scientific process.The person said researchers submitting academic papers on other medical topics did not have to vet their work with government ministries before seeking publication.A technical analysis of the cached websites indicated that the posts were published on verified university websites before they were removed.  could not independently verify that they reflected a new government policy.The notices appear to be part of a broader push to manage research on the virus. The science and technology ministry said on 3 April that ongoing clinical research on the coronavirus must be reported to authorities within three days or be halted.In March China’s president, Xi Jinping, published an essay that included “tracing the origin of the virus” on a list of national priorities. It was referenced by the science and technology ministry shortly before the universities posted their orders. The Chinese government did not reply to a request for comment sent by the  to the Chinese embassy in Washington.While the exact origin of the pandemic is still not certain, one commonly held hypothesis is that it began following an interaction between a human and an animal at the Huanan seafood “wet market” in Wuhan.Scientists have said the virus probably originated in bats and then passed through an intermediary animal before infecting the first human.Related: How did coronavirus start and where did it come from? Was it really Wuhan’s animal market?TransmissionScientists believe the transmission was similar to that in the 2002 outbreak of Sars. Some criticism of China has focused on why the government did not shut down wet markets after the previous outbreaks of coronaviruses.Kevin Carrico, a senior research fellow of Chinese studies at Monash University, said he was not aware of any specific recent change to rules for academic research in China in connection to Covid-19, but the documents were generally consistent with efforts by China to control the narrative of the pandemic.“They are seeking to transform it from a massive disaster to one where the government did everything right and gave the rest of the world time to prepare,” Mr Carrico said. Mr Carrico said those efforts had been evident in communications ranging from government pronouncements at the highest level to public sentiment on social media.“There is a desire to a degree to deny realities that are staring at us in the face ? that this is a massive pandemic that originated in a place that the Chinese government really should have cleaned up after Sars,” he said.Around a month ago senior Chinese diplomats, officials and state media all publicly encouraged speculation that the new coronavirus could have come from outside the country. The foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian suggested without evidence that the US military might have brought the virus to Wuhan. – Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our Morning Briefing and Lunchtime Latest newsletters"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4206213.1584564281!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"eu sets out proposals for close uk ties after brexit talks","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tEuropean Union chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier and the British prime minister’s Europe adviser David Frost in Brussels on March 2nd.

This includes a free trade agreement with annexes, as well as agreements on aviation safety and air transport, and a civil nuclear agreement.“We are sharing ours in confidence as a negotiating document, as part of the ongoing negotiating process,” a government spokesman said.“Teams will now analyse each other’s texts and we expect further conversations between the teams next week.“We will keep under review which documents it is appropriate to publish during the course of negotiations and whether it is useful to make them availablle more widely.”Though Britain has left the EU it is is currently in a transition period, continuing to adhere to prior norms pending the agreement of a deal on the future relationship. If none can be agreed, it will automatically begin trading on World Trade Organisation terms from January 1st, 2021, with potentially severe effects on the Irish economy.The government of prime minister Boris Johnson has until July to request an extension to the transition period, but has insisted it will not do so even as the Coronavirus pandemic delayed talks this week.Both sides said they were examining options such as using video conferencing in place of face-to face talks.“The negotiations can still proceed given all of the logistical arrangements that have been put in place,” British foreign secretary Dominic Raab said on Tuesday.“We’re confident that we can get this done and, actually, I don’t think delaying Brexit negotiations would give anyone the certainty on either side of the Channel that they need.”Stay on top of the latest news with our Morning Briefing and Lunchtime Latest newsletters"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4226276.1586545824!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"germany lifts ban on foreign workers to salvage harvest","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tSeasonal workers heading to Germany wait outside Cluj airport, Romania. Photograph. Photograph: Raul StefInquam Photos via ReutersGermany has launched special flights to bring in tens of thousands of seasonal workers from eastern Europe amid fears that travel restrictions imposed to fight the coronavirus pandemic could badly disrupt farming and affect food supplies.Hundreds of Romanians were on board the first such flights on Thursday and Friday, and daily services are scheduled from Romanian airports to several German cities throughout April and May.Germany hopes to attract 80,000 farmhands from Romania and nearby countries, having lifted a ban on the arrival of workers from abroad over concerns for the imminent asparagus harvest and other produce that will soon be ripe.About 300,000 foreign workers usually pick fruit and vegetables in the German season, and farmers warned that a labour shortage caused by the Covid-19 outbreak could lead to a smaller harvest, higher food prices and planting delays.“This is important and good news for our farmers because the harvest does not wait. Sowing cannot be postponed,” said federal agriculture minister Julia Klöckner.“To provide consumers with sufficient and high-quality local food even during the coronavirus pandemic, farmers have to rely on the help of seasonal workers from abroad – these are specialists in their field.”The BOGK association of German fruit and vegetable processors had warned: “What is not harvested cannot be processed ... supplies for the population would no longer be secure from summer 2020.”“We certainly need our specialist workers from countries such as Bulgaria, Romania and other countries,” the group added.Harvest helpersAn online system has been created to match foreign workers with German farmers, and the Eurowings airline – a subsidiary of Lufthansa – has a “harvest helper” page on its website where Romanians can register for flights.Officials in Germany say foreign farmhands will undergo health checks and work separately from other employees for the first fortnight, and they will be expected to observe distancing rules at all times. Their accommodation has been adapted to provide more space for all occupants.Ms Klöckner called it “a pragmatic and goal-oriented solution which meets two justified requirements: protection from infection on one side and securing the harvest on the other side.”The first workers’ flights from Cluj airport to Germany on Thursday saw up to 2,000 people cram into the airport car park before being allowed into the terminal, in what Romanian prime minister Ludovic Orban called an “unacceptable” breach of current health guidelines.“What should we do?

This tragedy has a political, as well as a biological, epidemiology. Those seeking to trace its path may look back on a telling moment – paradoxically the one at which the government finally changed course and fell into line with most of the rest of Europe.On March 20th, Boris Johnson announced the closure of pubs, clubs and restaurants. Even as he did so, however, he made it clear that this decision was an assault on the national character.“We’re taking away the ancient, inalienable right of free-born people of the United Kingdom to go the pub,” he said. “And I can understand how people feel about that.” Lest his anguish be in any doubt, he underscored the point: “To repeat, I know how difficult this is, how it seems to go against the freedom-loving instincts of the British people.” The message was – what exactly? You must not go to the pub but your right to do so is “inalienable” (which is to say absolute and irrevocable). You must stay at home but, if you so do, you will be a disgrace to your freedom-loving ancestors.The Sun reported the prime minister’s remarks rather differently: “Mr Johnson said he realised it went against what he called ‘the inalienable free-born right of people born in England to go to the pub’.” In this version, the freedom to go to the pub was conferred by genetics and history, not on the “people of the United Kingdom” or “the British people”, but on “people born in England”. It does not apply to Scots, Welsh or Northern Irish people and certainly not to the 9.4 million people living in the UK who were born abroad. It is a particular Anglo-Saxon privilege.LudicrousAnd since we are in the terrain of the ludicrous, the Sun’s version actually made more sense. There is, of course, no ancient and absolute right to go to the pub – inns and public houses have been regulated in England at least since the 15th century. But what Johnson was really evoking was a very specific English sense of exceptionalism, a fantasy of personal freedom as a marker of ethnic and national identity.That exceptionalism is not, alas, mere rhetorical self-indulgence. It helped to shape official policy towards the Covid-19 crisis. It lies behind both the idea that there should be a distinctive British response to this global challenge, and the assumption that there was something peculiarly unnatural in expecting Brits to obey drastic restrictions. Its legacy is the globally discredited policy of “herd immunity” and the late introduction, squandering Britain’s head start, of the lockdown.NotionThe prime minister himself has long cultivated the notion that he does not just espouse this freedom-loving exceptionalism – he embodies it. In the early stages of the crisis, Johnson’s admirers could see it as his Finest Hour, the moment when his Churchillian posturing would become real and he would save his country. When the prime minister was hospitalised, his overwrought friend and fan Toby Young confessed in the Spectator to “a kind of mystical belief in Britain’s greatness and her ability to occasionally bring forth remarkable iniduals, who can serve her at critical junctures. I’ve always thought of Boris as one of those people – not just suspected it, but known it in my bones.”FreedomBeing drunk on freedom is one way for the chosen people to “do their own thing”. Adopting a distinctive national approach to a global pandemic is another. The myth of a unique and defining love of personal freedom as a badge of nationhood underpinned a profound reluctance to impose life-saving restrictions on movement and social gatherings. Other people might put up with that sort of thing, but not the English. On the altar of this exceptionalism, lives have been sacrificed.This innate, genetic resistance to conformity is a myth. This is obvious from the persistence of an equal and opposite cliche of Englishness: the queue. George Orwell could rhapsodise “the gentle-mannered, undemonstrative, law-abiding English” and “the orderly behaviour of English crowds, the lack of pushing and quarrelling, the willingness to form queues”.The anthropologist Kate Fox wrote: “During the London riots in August 2011, I witnessed looters forming an orderly queue to squeeze, one at a time, through the smashed window of a shop they were looting.” Orderliness is just as prominent as waywardness in the English self-image – which suggests that neither of these truisms is ancient, inalienable or worth a damn when you are making policy in a time of plague.ExceptionalistThe exceptionalist “freedom-loving instinct” has little to do with history and much more to do with current politics, specifically the politics of Brexit. Johnson described as “magnificent” a 2014 book by the arch-Brexiter Daniel Hannan called How We Invented Freedom – “we” being the Anglo-Saxons. Hannan expressly reclaimed the idea of exceptionalism, the freedom-loving Anglo-Saxons being the exception especially to European slavishness. Brexit, as he argued, was one imperative of this dichotomy. Tragically, a notion that the UK could ignore the World Health Organisation and do its own thing with the virus was another.Covid-19, as Johnson himself discovered in the most awful way, doesn’t make exceptions. The threat is universal. And the shield against it – the NHS – is cosmopolitan and global. There are 200 different nationalities represented in its ranks by 150,000 doctors, nurses and ancillary staff. One consolation in this disaster is the realisation that Britain is exceptionally lucky to have them. – Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our Morning Briefing and Lunchtime Latest newsletters"},{"url":null,"title":"matt cartoons april 2020","story":"Sign up for our exclusive, subscriber-only Matt newsletter - and get an unseen Matt  each week. www.telegraphmatt-nlOrder The Best of Matt 2019 by visiting books.telegraph or call 0844 871 1514.  ​To order a fine art print, signed or unsigned of this, or any Matt cartoon, go to https:telegraph.newsprints or call 0191 603 0178Coronavirus latest news: Boris Johnson \u0026#39continues to make good progress\u0026#39, Downing Street saysWatch: Can you get coronavirus twice?Meet the disease detectives fighting to stop the US turning into New YorkDoctors create pioneering reusable facemasks to solve PPE shortageGermany freed me from the burden of the Holocaust, says woman whose life inspired Netflix seriesUK firm and UCL professor develop spit test which can replace swabs and be done at homeWhat are ventilators - and how can they help tackle the coronavirus outbreak?

His team simulated 89 school drop off and pick up trips in Guilford, Surrey and walked just over 1.2 miles during morning and afternoon school runs.The research published in Environment International journal did offer a solution to parents as it found pushchair covers reduced concentration of small-sized particles by as much as 39 per cent.Prof Kumar added: There is cause for some optimism, as our study confirms that pushchair covers and upping the buggy heights appears to have shielded children from an appreciable amount of pollution under certain conditions.Previous research conducted by the university last year found toddlers are typically exposed to 60 per cent more toxic particles than their parents when travelling in low-slung buggies, because doing so \u0027puts them closer to the level of exhaust pipes\u0027.Researchers warned at the time that persistent exposure can potentially damage the brain’s frontal lobe, which they said could impact on cognitive ability and neurological development.More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/health-fitness/2019/10/18/TELEMMGLPICT000036058117_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqqVzuuqpFlyLIwiB6NTmJwRMWbYwzrg_3PLcMwCu9G8U.jpeg?i","title":"might cost buy british right now farmers need","story":"The author tucks into some British roast lamb Mid-morning this Sunday, a great swathe of British people will be engaging in a tradition that no virus or plague could possibly stop. The lamb will be out, a leg perhaps. Sticklers for good cooking practice will be bringing it to room temperature, before reaching for a sprig of rosemary, some garlic, olive oil and even a few little anchovies to pop into small cuts made in the flesh. Then into the oven it goes and in due course the kitchen will fill with the glorious scent of fat, oil and herbs as the meat starts to cook.But before you slam in that lamb, let me ask you a delicate question. Where is it from?In these trying times, some may think it churlish, preachy – pompous, even – to raise an eyebrow about provenance. Surely returning from the shops virus-free and providing for one’s family right now is the top priority.Except that now more than ever we should be supporting British farmers.Appalling stories are emerging of millions of pints of milk being poured down drains, of crops rotting in fields, beef going to waste. These issues are being caused by disruptions in logistics, staff shortages, lack of business agility and bureaucracy. The NFU president, Minette Batters, says, the situation is becoming “untenable”.Part of the problem, of course, is convenience and price. Look again at that label you just put in the bin. Can you spot the words “New Zealand”? If so, you may have paid less for your leg, but at what cost? As one (British) sheep farmer friend seethed: “Freezing lamb, putting it on a ship and sending it on a 12,000-mile journey to a country that produces the best lamb in the world is simply ridiculous.”Supermarkets would retort that they stock the best cuts, when in season – which suggests there is not enough British lamb currently available. The real problem is that they don’t want to pay British farmers a decent amount for their meat, as they don’t think consumers would stomach the price.Breeds such as the Dorset, for example, can lamb in November, but a lack of grass in winter makes the meat more expensive as farmers have to pay for feed. By failing to invest properly in farmers in this country rearing these types of animals in favour of cheaper meat from, say, New Zealand, the supermarkets are causing a vicious circle: there’s less British lamb available out there, so demand remains low and prices stay high.But, since you’re not eating out these days, may I humbly suggest that you can fork out a bit more for British produce? Buy your Easter roast from a farm shop that supports local producers, or do some label research on your supermarket shop?Yes, a British leg of lamb might be more pricey, but it’s better-reared, fed on better grass and tastes better. Not only that, but by buying it you’d be supporting our farmers – and they sure as hell need it right now.The  values your comments but kindly requests all posts are on topic, constructive and respectful.

On the BBC Radio 4 Today programme yesterday – Good Friday – Hylton Murray-Philipson was interviewed by Nick Robinson. Mr Murray-Philipson, who is 61, had just been clapped out of the ward in Leicester Royal Infirmary having recovered, after six days in intensive care, from Covid-19. The “guard of honour” was a tribute in part to the fact that Mr Murray-Philipson’s mother and sister had also been ill with the disease, and that having been on the verge of death himself, he had not been able to attend his own father’s funeral.Robinson asked him about his time in intensive care. Mr Murray-Philipson said: “One of the very powerful images I had was the image of Jesus calming the storm on the Sea of Galilee and that just came to me and I like to think that it was Jesus Christ coming to me and helping me in my hour of need.”Robinson retorted that this was “partly because of the drugs you have to be on on a ventilator machine which plays tricks with your mind, doesn’t it, really?”This seemed a strange rebuke to a sane and serious man who had just had such a powerful vision so close to death. Mischievously, an image came into my mind of Nick Robinson in a tempest-tossed boat on the Sea of Galilee cross-questioning Jesus (“I’ll have to hurry you, I’m afraid”) on his disciples’ preposterous demand that he still the waters – and then falling silent as Jesus does exactly that.You would not, after all, have to share Mr Murray-Philipson’s religious beliefs to recognise the importance of such experiences. We all know that enduring extreme illness requires not only medical care, but also understanding, courage and love. Billions of people find those qualities in the God they worship – and even, in many cases, in a God to whom they have not previously paid much attention. It is as well to respect this, not least because it can save lives.One of the worst horrors of this virus is that you die alone (even, in some cases, when it is something else that is killing you). The knowledge that you will do so can itself be fatal. A doctor friend who is working in a hospice tells me that when the patients are isolated from the people they love they go downhill extremely fast. The same applies to those deprived of prayer and of the sacraments.This week, the rector of St Bartholomew the Great in London wrote a moving article about how the clergy can, with protective clothing, safely minister to the sick and dying, but that this was being discouraged by the Church authorities. It is part of the aim of a Christian to “make a good death”. This must be bitterly hard to do unaided.In less acute form, this sense of being cut off from the ine goes way beyond the hospital wards this Easter. The Passion story told yesterday and the Resurrection one told tomorrow is the deepest account ever given of the pain of death and the victory of life, and of how the one relates to the other. Yet in 2020, for the first time since St Augustine reached Kent in 597, we shall not be allowed to listen to that story in church on Easter Sunday.Obviously churches cannot be exempt from public-health needs. They are gathering places and, as such, dangerous at this time. But it has been a little depressing to see the eagerness with which Church leaders have shut up shop. They told their clergy not to conduct services in their churches, even if alone, but to stay at home, though there was no government order to do this. An impressive exception has been the Bishop of London, Sarah Mullaly, who was herself the chief nursing officer for England. She has urged her clergy to enter their churches, if there is a safe means of doing so, and live-stream their services from there.It is also reasonable to question whether it is always necessary to keep churches shut at all times for the duration of the virus. Surely arrangements could be made in some of them so that people can pray there alone, or with their households. Most country churches, for example, are visited by very few people each day: the risk of them passing on Covid-19 must be trivial compared with that in Sainsbury’s or Tesco.My wife is a churchwarden in our village. As such, it is her duty to check the church to make sure that all is in order and no birds are trapped inside. Since we do not have to distance from each other, I accompanied her yesterday. She unlocked the door and we entered. It was extraordinary to feel almost furtive in a church in England. I suppose it is a bit like what millions felt in eastern Europe under communism and still feel in independent churches in communist China today.There were no stray birds to deal with. We sat in the chancel and my wife read out the Book of Common Prayer collects for the day, one of which prays that the ministers of the Church “may truly and godly serve thee”. Then she read out the Epistle (Hebrews 10.1), which says “Let us hold fast to the profession of our faith … not forsaking the assembly of ourselves together” and last the Gospel in which St John tells how Jesus was killed because the crowd called for it and Pilate, who represented the civil power, let it happen, though he knew it was wrong.Tomorrow, the Easter Day service says: “For since by man came death: by man also came the resurrection of the dead”, but no one will be there to hear it.It is certainly hard to know how best Christian leadership can be given at this time, though Boris Johnson – by accident of his illness and by his cheerfulness – has embodied the ancient Judaeo-Christian idea of leading through suffering.We have been lucky that such leadership has come from the Queen. Her message last Sunday was not explicitly Christian (indeed, I felt the one good word missing from it was “Easter”), but it worked better than a sermon.What the Queen does, in these rare public pronouncements, is to put herself in the right place. It may seem banal to express sympathy for victims of a disaster such as this virus, but if you think of her words as a prayer, they make a deeper sense. She is remembering everything which should be remembered, setting out, in some detail, who should be consoled, who should be thanked and what blessings can be counted (“the opportunity to slow down, pause and reflect”, and to pray, which comes with self-isolation). Then she seeks what can unite all of us (our “national spirit”) and how we can come through it (“self-discipline …quiet, good-humoured resolve …fellow-feeling”).Finally – and this is the leadership bit – the Queen gently establishes her authority to help. I first spoke to you 80 years ago, she says, when we were at war, and I was a girl. She was speaking then to comfort children evacuated from their homes. Today, in a different way, there is again “a painful sense of separation”. Now that she is an old lady who has seen it all, she can comfort us, with modest confidence: “We will be with our friends again we will be with our families again we will meet again”. All shall be well.The  values your comments but kindly requests all posts are on topic, constructive and respectful.

Scientists believe the disease jumped into humans from one of the creatures at Wuhan Market.The second type ‘B’ - which is most common in mainland China - is derived from ‘A’, and separated by two mutations, while ‘C’ is in turn a ‘daughter’ of ‘B’.But interestingly it is type ‘C’ that initially infected Britain and Europe and that variant is not found in mainland China at all. In fact, it is most common in Hong Kong, Singapore, South Korea suggesting that it spread to Europe from those regions. One English case also came directly from Australia.Geneticist Dr Peter Forster, the lead author from the University of Cambridge, said: “You have the ‘C’ type, which is not directly from China associated with Singapore and offshore East Asia and that’s where English cases come from. We know of an engineer visiting a Singapore conference and then returning via a chalet in The Alps, so that comes up in the network.“We usually use this analysis in tracing prehistoric human migrations, to allow you to see when they left Africa and populated the rest of the world, but nobody had thought to use it with a virus.“The viral network we have detailed is a snapshot of the early stages of an epidemic, before the evolutionary paths of Covid-19 become obscured by vast numbers of mutations. It’s like catching an incipient supernova in the act.”The technique has confirmed the importance of known infection routes, such as businessman Steve Walsh - the 53-year-old Brighton super-spreader who travelled to Britain from Singapore via The Alps in early February.Surprisingly, it appears that the countries who now seem to be doing the best at controlling the spread of the virus inside their own borders, are the ones from which the disease spread initially.Both Singapore and Hong Kong are yet to have a localised pandemic and are hopeful one might not happen. They have achieved containment through rigorous testing, contact tracing and localised quarantines. Likewise, despite recording more than 110,000 cases, Germany has seen just 2,349 deaths. But the new study shows that Singapore and Germany may have sparked the devastating outbreak in Italy, which has since spread to Britain.The analysis suggests that one of the earliest introductions of the virus into Italy came via the first documented German infection on January 27, and that another early Italian infection route was related to a “Singapore cluster”.Cases in Mexico, also appear to have spread from Italy, and in turn from the first German cluster in Munich - known as the Webasto case - which until now was believed to have been contained by German quarantine measures.After the first wave of infections from east Asia in Britain, a large number of new cases were imported by people who had been to ski resorts in Northern Italy during the half-term break. Northern Italy appears to have also been initially seeded by the German cluster.In contrast to Europe, the initial US outbreaks were of the ancestral ‘A’ variant.  Mutated versions of ‘A’ were seen in Americans reported to have lived in Wuhan, and a large number of A-type viruses were found in patients from the US and Australia.The A strain is largely absent across the Atlantic.The team used data from 160 virus genomes sampled from across the world between 24 December 2019 and 4 March 2020. Further work that has not yet been peer-reviewed using the analysis, suggests that the first infection occurred in humans somewhere between mid-September and early December. The research also shows that mutations in the virus appear to have sped up as it swept across the globe. The major Wuhan ‘B’ strain has not mutated much, which could mean it is immunologically or environmentally adapted to a large section of the East Asian population. In contrast, the other types appear to have speeded up the mutation rate, perhaps to adapt to changing populations.“If the virus wishes to infect someone from the US or Europe, these people have a different immunological response so you have predominantly type A and the English C type, so these are potentially to evade the immune response,” he said.“If you are in a very localised part of China then will meet with a homogeneous population who have come through a similar disease progression, but once you get outside then Europeans have gone through a different disease history and also possibly there is a more erse genetically erse population, so you get more mutations.”The team is keen to find out if certain strains are more aggressive than others, which could explain why some countries have much lower death rates. However researchers are struggling because countries like Spain and Germany have only sequenced a few dozen virus genomes and Italy fewer than 10.Dr Forster added: At the moment there are no clinical outcomes associated with the genomic sequences so we don’t know if the mutations are making some variants more lethal.“Phylogenetic network analysis has the potential to help identify undocumented COVID-19 infection sources, which can then be quarantined to contain further spread of the disease worldwide,” added Dr Forster.The study was published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS). More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"us evangelical megachurches open easter sunday satan doesnt","story":"Some American evangelical Christian pastors are planning to defy stay-at-home orders and open their churches for Easter Sunday services.In the latest sign of increasing frustrations over coronavirus lockdowns several megachurch leaders argued that their rights to religious liberty under the US Constitution were being trampled on.Anti-government militant leader Ammon Bundy said he was prepared to provide defence against arrest for anyone attending an Easter religious gathering of up to 1,000 people in Idaho.He told supporters: We will perform an active political defence for you. And we will also, if necessary, provide a physical defence for you, so that you can continue in your rights.It came as a forecasting model used by the White House predicted that Easter Sunday - April 12 - would see the peak of coronavirus deaths in the United States.Donald Trump, who has widespread evangelical support, previously indicated his aspiration to have the country open by Easter, although he later backtracked.Some leading evangelicals have been sceptical of virus lockdowns all along.In Virginia classes continue at Liberty University, one of the largest evangelical colleges in the world.Its leader Jerry Falwell Jr., a friend of Mr Trump, had initially closed the university, which has 45,000 undergraduates.But it has already partially reopened and students have poured back in, some saying they were better off on campus than at home infecting their families.Jahquez Durham, a senior, in a video recorded in his dorm, said: I\u0027m one of 10 siblings and I don\u0027t want to affect anybody else.The university dismissed reports that a dozen students had subsequently fallen ill as fake news.Further south in Florida, pastor Dr Rodney Howard-Browne, who prayed over Mr Trump in the Oval Office in 2017, was recently arrested after bussing in hundreds of worshippers to his megachurch, The River at Tampa Bay Church.The only time the church will close is when the Rapture is taking place, he said in a sermon.Sheriff Chad Chronister, the local police chief who arrested Dr Howard-Browne, said: Shame on this pastor. His reckless disregard for human life put hundreds at risk.Florida state prosecutor Andrew Warren added: I\u0027d remind the good pastor of Mark 12:31...love thy neighbour as thyself. Loving your neighbour is protecting them, not exposing them to this deadly virus.Dr Howard-Browne accused the sheriff\u0027s office of violating his constitutional right to the free exercise of religion.In Baton Rouge, Louisiana pastor Tony Spell of the Life Tabernacle Church, was charged with violating a government order on large gatherings, and could face up to 90 days in jail, but vowed to carry on for Easter Sunday.He said: The first amendment says Congress shall make no law prohibiting the exercise of religion. We will continue to have church. This is a government overreach. The church is the last force resisting the Antichrist.Another defiant pastor, Kelly Burton of Lone Star Baptist Church in Lone Star, Texas, wrote on Facebook: Satan is trying to keep us apart, he\u0027s trying to keep us from worshipping together. But we\u0027re not going to let him win.In the state of Kansas Republican political leaders overturned an order by the Democrat governor Laura Kelly limiting religious gatherings to 10 people.That will allow church services to go ahead on Easter Sunday. The governor said it would cost lives.Several pastors in Kentucky also vowed to hold Easter Sunday services in violation of orders.Kentucky\u0027s governor Andy Beshear said: People are going to die as a result.More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus diary postcard wuhanwhat really happened","story":"The guard at the station eyes my ticket: Beijing to Wuhan, the locked-down ground zero of the coronavirus pandemic.“You sure? No mistake?” he asks. “No mistake,” I say.My colleague and I disinfect our seats with a wad of wipes the minute we get on the five-hour high-speed train.I worry coming to Wuhan will change my “green” health code – a contagion risk profile, which determines the difference between going out to dinner or government quarantine. When I get there, traffic is sparse, though busier than I expected. I chat with people in a park, out for their first strolls after nearly three months indoors.I walk by Huanan seafood market (pictured below), where experts think the virus emerged, and find it sealed with sheets of corrugated metal, wrapped in police tape, and patrolled by officers. At the end of the day, I check my health code again: Still green. Whew.Exiting my room, I bid good morning to a hotel cleaner in a hazmat suit and head out.Cai Yao, 34, tells me his mother’s symptoms appearing in late January worsened quickly she only returned home two weeks ago.“For a whole week, she couldn’t eat. She coughed up blood, and her nose would bleed,” he said. “It really looked like she was on her deathbed.”Hospitals were full, so they drove daily across town for outpatient treatment, waiting 10 hours in line with many others. Mr Cai doesn’t know what shots were administered, but is grateful she recovered. Many families weren’t so fortunate. At the peak, there were 5,000 bodies waiting to be scorched into ash at one of Wuhan’s eight crematoriums, a worker tells me – a far cry from two dozen per day before the pandemic. His shifts began at 5:30am and ended after dark. Such accounts cast doubt over China’s reported death toll of about 3,300, especially as fatalities in Italy, Spain, France, the UK, US, and Iran exceed that figure. Virus deaths are so sensitive that at a cemetery – which grieving families haven’t been allowed to visit – a phalanx of uniformed officers and plainclothes minders surround me and my colleague. When I try to leave, they grab my bag, drag me backward, and snatch my phone.“What if you report about this incident?” one sneers, when I ask for it back. They accuse us of sneaking in and staying hours to take photos. Actually, we’d walked in the front gate, registered our details after a temperature check – as per usual in coronavirus China – and roamed for half an hour.After threatening (“can’t leave until the ‘investigation’ is over”) and berating us (“stupid imbeciles”) for about an hour, they let us go upon taking photos of our ID documents. Our driver says the police also harassed him and recorded his details.This is the same “welcome” treatment I’ve gotten investigating human rights violations in China – Xinjiang concentration camps, Muslim cleansing in Ningxia, the 30th anniversary of the Tiananmen Square massacre. Residents have told me they don’t think they’ll ever learn the truth of what happened. All this leads me to ponder what the authorities are trying to hide – even as China crows success. Freedom! Sort of. Lockdowns lift today in Wuhan. But things are far from normal.Transport links start coming back online, and major roads are unsealed. Cars started lining up at city limits before midnight.But quotas have been imposed – for instance, only 1,000 a day are allowed to enter Beijing from Wuhan. Even then, people need to be approved after showing a clean bill of health. Some housing compounds continue barring residents from going out, or limiting them to two hours a day. Barriers made of corrugated metal sheets have yet to all come down. Same with cement road blocks. I spy a man in a hazmat clamber over and sneak away!Disinfecting tents continue to dot the city. Getting in and out of my hotel still requires being sprayed with medical-grade alcohol: Traffic is much noisier today, though nobody seems fussed by a sign that life is resuming.Requirements to depart Wuhan apply to me, so I head to the city’s No. 7 hospital to get my throat swabbed for a nucleic acid test to determine whether I’ve been infected with the coronavirus. I don’t feel ill, though asymptomatic cases are now being discovered. Hopefully, I’m not one of them…At the hospital entrance, a thermal facial recognition camera takes my temperature. Amazingly, this works with a face mask. I don goggles and feel even more claustrophobic.Medical staff have protective suits, shoe covers, face shields one spritzes sanitiser over his latex gloves. It\u0027s haunting to be inside. So many people died here, staff say.Doors are sealed in the fever clinic, dozens of oxygen tanks sit outside, and an extra CT machine is in a trailer out front.Next step: Registering via a mobile app to be approved for return and quarantine confirmation by Beijing authorities. There\u0027s a long queue – at least 11,000 have already applied, and there’s a daily departure limit.I feel glad to pass an open wine shop. I stock up might be here a while. Tons of virus origin rumours floating around. Scientists are working on this, too, and have found genetically similar coronaviruses in bats and pangolins.A seafood vendor tells me she heard patient zero was a man in his seventies selling wild ducks at the now-closed Huanan market.Others deny any Huanan link, and tell me unspecified foreigners brought it during the World Military Games last October, held in Wuhan. Wu Jianming, 29, a glassworker says: “Bats are impossible – when I was a child, we often played with them.”By far the most prevalent theory is that the Americans brought the virus. One man says the severity of infections is evidence the virus emerged in the US.“It’s so bad there,” he said. “Do you think this is still the Wuhan flu?” The idea was seeded by a Chinese official, who suggested the US military brought the virus. Beijing has been busy reframing the narrative to ert public anger from government missteps over the outbreak, stoking nationalism by portraying China as the world leader in virus response and buying the world time.Some, including officials and politicians in the US and UK, see it differently – that a botched initial response exacerbated global spread.We bundle into a van with other foreign media for a government-arranged trip to Leishenshan Hospital, a temporary field hospital.Hospital officials say thousands have recovered, and only 15 patients remain. We’re shown an empty virus ward with sealed rooms waiting to be disinfected. Many medical staff have transferred out.“All data are reliable please rest assured,” they say, when asked whether China’s reported figures accurately represent the outbreak. Doubts persist over the numbers. Hospitals were immediately overwhelmed there were multiple revisions to confirming cases and those not tested – despite having what doctors strongly hinted was the virus – weren’t included in the death toll.With so many curbs still in place, it’s clear authorities remain concerned. Even as Wuhan has begun reporting zero deaths, the hospital won’t be dismantled until next year. I get my virus results back.

I was an occasional reader online, but never a subscriber, so I am probably part of the problem.Still, financial problems didn’t prevent the Chronicle or the News from exposing and shaming the Labour Party for becoming Britain’s premier safe haven for anti-Semites under Mr Corbyn.Both papers reported assiduously on Labour’s moral decline, revealing and tracking the phenomenal range of incidents as they emerged, loudly holding the party to account, highlighting its failure to act and voicing the community’s growing fears. Their stories were frequently picked up by the national press. It is hard to imagine how it would all have played out without either of them there.Now, unless a rescuer appears, there will be no established Jewish media around to report on the Equality and Human Rights Commission’s investigation into Labour anti-Semitism. Not only will Mr Corbyn have managed to scuttle back under his rock before facing the music the Labour Party will also escape scrutiny from its two fiercest media critics.Sir Keir has promised action to match his words. What a shame that the country’s main Jewish media outlets won’t be around to hold him to his pledge.The coronavirus and China’s disastrous cover-up in the early stages have prompted some soul-searching over whether the UK has got its policy right on China. The short answer is no.To that end, it is surely worth revisiting the question of whether it is prudent to continue with the Government’s strategy of merely “mitigating” the security threat posed by Huawei, the telecoms giant, rather than avoiding it entirely by barring the company from our 5G network development.Last year, the Huawei Cyber Security Evaluation Centre, a government body – though funded by Huawei – that assesses the security of the company’s products, stated in its annual report that it had identified “concerning issues” in the company’s software that pose “significantly increased risk” for UK telecoms. Despite the HCSEC having flagged the exact same issues a year before and Huawei promising to throw $2 billion (£1.6 billion) at fixing them, it reported that the company had made “no material progress” and that the HCSEC “has not yet seen anything to give confidence” that it can do so. The agency declared, therefore, that it could “provide only limited assurance that the long-term security risks can be managed”. The Government ignored this warning and, since it was published, has given the go-ahead for Huawei’s flawed technology to become further integrated in the nation’s critical infrastructure.Read more | Huawei 5G stormIn the meantime, the company has embarked upon a global campaign donating tens of thousands face masks to virus-hit countries. Huawei, remember, vociferously denies close links with the Chinese state, which rather begs the question of how and why it is sitting on enormous stocks of spare face masks. All of this is extremely puzzling.At some point, Parliament will vote on legislation that will implement the 5G decision. The House of Commons Defence Select Committee has said it will conduct an inquiry into the issue. It would surely be helpful, therefore, for the HCSEC to update its report. Has there been any progress? Can the agency provide any more reassurance, as the Government seems to think it can? The Cabinet Ofice promises the report will emerge “in due course”. While older updates came out in July, last year’s evaluation was published in March. Given its political and commercial relevance, most of the work should surely have been done before the lockdown. Yet there is nothing. Are the poor techies worried about embarrassing their political masters?For corporate high achievers stuck on back-to-back conference calls during the lockdown, the Financial Times has helpfully published a feature on the “urgent” need to “look and sound good” on video chats. Its main advice is to avoid wearing pyjamas and to imagine you are on TV (the latter seems more likely to irritate colleagues than “own the room”). There is no mention of workers’ increasingly urgent need for a haircut. But its best suggestion, among the cod science and cited “psychological studies” is this: skip the video calls and use a phone.The  values your comments but kindly requests all posts are on topic, constructive and respectful.

Knowing the man, that will be as soon as is physically possible. But even if he is not working in the full sense, his presence will be felt and his views will be communicated. We can give thanks for that.But in truth, there never was a crisis of governance. The overhyped melodrama of cabinet dissension and uncertain leadership was not going to produce – as it might well have done in more excitable nations – a breakdown of civil authority. For a brief moment we might have gone on to vacuous autopilot in the understandable confusion and shock. But this is a very grown-up, stable country with an extremely competent, assured administrative class. Nobody was going to run amok and everybody with any degree of responsibility was going to behave well.There has been gossip about disagreement and power machinations within the Cabinet and some speculation about paralysis as a consequence of this argy-bargy. Most of it can be ignored: a few supposedly well-connected sources mouthing off to journalists whose business it is to make politics seem as exciting as possible. (For “exciting”, read “vicious”.) Of course Cabinet ministers disagree with one another. That’s what politicians do. You would not want to live in the kind of society where there was no possibility of disagreement among those in power.But this situation is not, perhaps inconveniently for my own trade, a political problem. It is a medical emergency that carries enormous economic implications. The questions that need to be asked are factual (what will work?), and moral in the highest sense (how much risk to life is acceptable?) rather than strictly political (who should be in charge?).On the last of these – how to decide who should be running the government – there has also been some rather pointless controversy. Much has been made by commentators stuck at home with too much time on their hands, of the lack of any specific provisions in Britain’s constitutional arrangements. When American friends ask me who is the designated successor to Boris Johnson, I have to explain that the prime minister, not being elected to his office by the population at large but by his party, is simply the first among equals, blah-blah.Total Covid-19 vaccines in developmentHere at home, the US Constitution, with its legally rigorous rules for succession is being commended as superior to our rather rackety ad hoc solutions. Be careful what you wish for. The vice president, who automatically steps up, has often been chosen as the presidential candidate’s running mate for crassly opportunistic reasons: because he or she “balanced the ticket” or was expected to haul in a difficult cohort of voters.Add to that the fact that the third in line to the presidency is none other than the Speaker of the House of Representatives who is, as often as not, from the opposition party. Not only does the country lose the president it voted for, but it ends up being governed by a party it rejected. So there is a lot to be said for impromptu agreements especially when there is a general understanding that those who govern will behave reasonably – as there is, in this very fortunate polity.If much of the political chatter at the moment is contrived and phoney, it might be because there is a desperate need to talk about what is happening in some way that is comprehensible to our modern consciousness.Having left the Middle Ages behind (I hope), we have no language for describing this phenomenon: the evil spirits, the demonic forces that would once have filled this role in the popular imagination are not available. So the metaphors are of war or terrorism: of an “invisible enemy” that must be defeated or destroyed by superior tactics.This is absurd of course, and ultimately unhelpful. The virus is not malevolent. It is not calculating. It has no plan and no intention. It is not a sentient being that can be outwitted or an army that can be outmanoeuvred. This is just a more contemporary form of superstition.The three strains of Covid-19 and where they originatedThe corona virus is a brainless organism whose only imperative, like all life forms, is to survive and replicate. It does that by attaching itself to human cells. We have to find a way of preventing that. Nobody knows, as yet, what the best way of doing it is, but all the attempts are being made with the best and most honest of intentions. It helps no one to suggest otherwise.The real enemy now is hopelessness: “no end in sight” is not the right message.The task seems to be peculiarly difficult because of the bizarre nature of an illness which causes symptoms so mild in many (perhaps even most) of the people it infects while killing a significant number of others quite rapidly.In the midst of the desperate search for a way to put an end to this thing are questions which only post hoc historical analysis has a hope of answering – about genetic links or lifestyle effects. These are strictly empirical matters which, in the blessed time after the present emergency has ended, will be explored.In the meantime, we can legitimately debate the moral issue on which everyone has a right to an opinion. How much should the potential damage to our economic future weigh in this? There are those who talk as if taking the economic consequences into account was a heartless contest between money and lives when, in fact, the collapse of the economy would destroy all public services (including the NHS) and thus cost huge numbers of lives while undermining the quality of life of the great majority of the population.The argument has to go on but it must be conducted with humility – nobody yet has a definitive answer. This is, I think, in sympathy with the mood of the country which has willingly complied with government advice to a degree that has taken its scientific advisors by surprise. Here is the national character at its recognisable best: a quiet decency and generosity that makes authoritarianism seem absurd.We will get through this.The  values your comments but kindly requests all posts are on topic, constructive and respectful.

Just a couple of days later came a blast and the words that would shock and fascinate the world:\u0026nbspOK, Houston, we\u0027ve had a problem here.Nasa is marking the anniversary of the mission it refers to as a successful failure, which represents one of its most high-profile disasters and its most famous miracles. It is a part of space history that is celebrated even today, with the story of the mission continuing to captivate the world.It was 11 April\u0026nbspthat marked the day the astronauts blasted off on their way to the Moon, and 13 April that an oxygen tank explosion started the mission to save the astronauts from being stuck in space.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesOn 17 April, nearly exactly six days after the mission began, the astronauts fell back through the Earth\u0027s atmsosphere and arrived safely back on Earth. It was an unlikely end to an unlucky mission.While it is now remembered as one of the most important moments in Nasa\u0027s history, the mission began in relative obscurity for a trip to the Moon. Apollo 11 had already managed to get to the lunar surface, and so what just a couple of years before was regarded as a near-impossibility was by that time relatively unexciting.Astronauts on screen from The Right Stuff to Apollo 13 and GravityBut hours later, television stations around the world were giving rolling updates on the mission\u0027s status, following closely as the astronauts and Nasa engineers back on Earth tried to save them from disaster.As well as being a relatively unwatched mission, the first couple of days of the journey were almost tediously straightforward. After two days of flight, one of the Nasa staff in mission control joked the astronauts that the spacecraft was in such good shape that they were bored to tears.Problems began on Apollo 13 when the astronauts were nearing the Moon and heard a bang and felt a shudder through their spacecraft. During what should have been a routine stir, one of the oxygen tanks on the spacecraft had burst and exploded.(After the mission was over, the explosion was traced back to overheating while the spacecraft was being tested on the ground, but there was no way to know that at the time.)The explosion also knocked out the fuel cells that should have been powering the spacecraft, and sent voltage in its circuits plunging. Engineers watching the mission from Mission Control saw the pressure in the damaged oxygen tank drop instantly.OK, Houston, we\u0027ve had a problem here, said\u0026nbspJack\u0026nbspSwigert, the command module pilot who had actually joined the mission as a last-minute substitute for a colleague who had become sick just before the mission took off.Houston, we\u0027ve had a problem, said Jim Lovell, the commander of Apollo 13.Almost immediately, it became clear that the astronauts would not be landing on the Moon, as planned. But that was a relatively unimportant challenge compared with the more pressing job of staying alive.In many ways, the explosion happened at the best possible time, and the astronauts would later say they considered themselves lucky. If it had happened earlier, they would have run out of power later, and the blast could have happened in lunar orbit or on the surface of the Moon.Created with Sketch.Nasa\u0027s groundbreaking decade of space exploration: In pictures Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Mystic Mountain, a pillar of gas and dust standing at three-light-years tall, bursting with jets of gas flom fledgling stars buried within, was captured by Nasa\u0027s Hubble Space Telelscope in February 2010The first ever selfie taken on an alien planet, captured by Nasa\u0027s Curiosity Rover in the early days of its mission to explore Mars in 2012Death of a star: This image from Nasa\u0027s Chandra X-ray telescope shows the supernova of Tycho, a star in our Milky Way galaxyArrokoth, the most distant object ever explored, pictured here on 1 January 2019 by a camera on Nasa\u0027s New Horizons spaceraft at a distance of 4.1 billion miles from EarthAn image of the Large Magellanic Cloud galaxy seen in infrared light by the Herschel Space Observatory in January 2012.

It would require them to slingshot around the Moon – coming frustratingly close to the surface they were supposed to land on – and then whip back around and float back home to Earth.In the meantime, mission control got to work putting together a rescue plan while the astronauts on board attempted to put out of their mind just how likely it was they would now die in space, something they say they never discussed.Flight controllers told the astronauts to shut down their command module and climb into Aquarius. That module was supposed to be the box that took the astronauts down to the lunar surface – but was refashioned into a lifeboat in an attempt to conserve power.Because it was never meant for so many people for so long, the lander was low on space. It was also filled with carbon dioxide, as the astronauts breathed inside their new, tiny spacecraft.One of the most famous breakthroughs came as engineers tried to find a way to fix that problem, by using the air purifiers from the now abandoned capsule in the lander. The two were the wrong shape to fit together – they were literally trying to fit a square canister into a round hole – but engineers back on Earth came up with a way of using various pieces of spacecraft to push the two together.Even once that was fixed, conditions inside the lander were miserable, without the energy for heating or other improvements to their conditions. They were stuck inside of a frigid box that was never meant to hold them, stuck\u0026nbspfor days with little to do but wait and see if the various last-minute solutions to their desperate situation would actually work.(The astronauts have said they didn\u0027t argue during this time, despite the miserable conditions, and didn\u0027t talk about the possibility of getting stuck floating in space and waiting to die either Lovell wrote in his autobiography that they were too busy struggling for survival. He also denied that they had poison pills hidden away in case of becoming lost.)Eventually they arrived back near home for what is traditionally one of the most perilous parts of the journey: dropping back through Earth\u0027s atmosphere to come home. They had enough power to switch on the command module and wait as they went through the gruelling, hot ordeal of slamming back down to Earth.As they did, the communications blackout that comes from the extreme conditions of the Earth\u0027s atmosphere lingered for much longer than usual, leaving flight controllers in the dark as to whether the three astronauts and their hacked-together spacecraft had survived.But eventually they appeared in the air, the spacecraft being cradled by three parachutes as it fell through the sky and down to Earth. They were picked up and all three completed a journey whose legacy – one of inventiveness and luck that became mission control\u0027s greatest achievement – is still celebrated by Nasa today.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

About half of applicants were seeking work after losing their livelihoods due to Covid-19, Concordia said.When can we really expect coronavirus to end?Everything you need to know on supermarket delivery slotsThe dirty truth about washing your handsWhich countries around the world has coronavirus spread to?Listen to the latest episode of The Independent Coronavirus PodcastThe latest round of jobs will start from the beginning of May when the UK’s soft fruit season begins with harvests of strawberries, raspberries and other summer fruits.Recruitment website Totaljobs has reported a record 50,000 searches for farm jobs last week. Searches for “fruit picker” and “farm worker” rose 330 per cent and 107 per cent respectively.The site has seen an 83 per cent jump in job applications for agricultural work over the past month.Steve Warnham of Totaljobs said he had noticed “a trend of workers who have been temporarily displaced due to Covid-19 who are now looking for roles they can take on in other sectors to keep Britain moving.”Other jobs designated as key by the government, including healthcare and logistics, have also seen a surge in interest.Mark Bridgeman, president of the Country Land and Business Association,\u0026nbspsaid it was “wonderful news” that tens of thousands of people had come forward but warned that many more were needed.“We all know this is a deeply concerning period and we are all determined to do all we can to help the country through it.

This is why we are calling for a ‘land army’ of workers to support farmers in feeding the country.”The campaign comes in the midst of one of the sharpest rises in unemployment on record, with more than 1 million new universal credit claims registered over the past three weeks despite government efforts to keep people in jobs by paying wages.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

About half of applicants were seeking work after losing their livelihoods due to Covid-19, Concordia said.When can we really expect coronavirus to end?Everything you need to know on supermarket delivery slotsThe dirty truth about washing your handsWhich countries around the world has coronavirus spread to?Listen to the latest episode of The Independent Coronavirus PodcastThe latest round of jobs will start from the beginning of May when the UK’s soft fruit season begins with harvests of strawberries, raspberries and other summer fruits.Recruitment website Totaljobs has reported a record 50,000 searches for farm jobs last week. Searches for “fruit picker” and “farm worker” rose 330 per cent and 107 per cent respectively.The site has seen an 83 per cent jump in job applications for agricultural work over the past month.Steve Warnham of Totaljobs said he had noticed “a trend of workers who have been temporarily displaced due to Covid-19 who are now looking for roles they can take on in other sectors to keep Britain moving.”Other jobs designated as key by the government, including healthcare and logistics, have also seen a surge in interest.Mark Bridgeman, president of the Country Land and Business Association,\u0026nbspsaid it was “wonderful news” that tens of thousands of people had come forward but warned that many more were needed.“We all know this is a deeply concerning period and we are all determined to do all we can to help the country through it. In order to do so, we must recognise that farmers’\u0026nbspsupply of labour is in jeopardy,” he said.“A shortage of 80,000 workers is something we have never seen before. This is why we are calling for a ‘land army’ of workers to support farmers in feeding the country.”The campaign comes in the midst of one of the sharpest rises in unemployment on record, with more than 1 million new universal credit claims registered over the past three weeks despite government efforts to keep people in jobs by paying wages.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

think about what you are putting online, and who could potentially see this information.Over time this adds up, and you may find that you have placed much more information about yourself online than you first thought.It comes amid a spate of scams linked to the pandemic, as criminals seek to capitalise on people\u0027s fears.Created with Sketch.Coronavirus culture from rooftops, windows and balconies Show all 15Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.A rose is delivered by drone to a woman on Mother\u0027s Day in Jounieh, LebanonWomen dance on their balcony as a radio station plays music for a flash mob to raise spirits in RomeA skeleton stands on a balcony in Frankfurt, GermanyThe film Le ragazze di Piazza di Spagna is projected on a building in RomeA woman uses a basket tied to a rope to pull a delivery of groceries up to her balcony in Naples, ItalyDJ Francesco Cellini plays for his neighbours from the rooftop terrace of his flat block in RomeA woman gestures from her balcony in BarcelonaCellist Karina Nunez performs for her neighbours at the balcony of her flat in Panama CityDJ Nash Petrovic live streams a set from his roof in BrooklynPeople applaud medical workers from their balconies in Modiin, IsraelA Brooklyn resident relaxes in a hammock hung on their balconyResidents toast during a safe distance aperitif time between neighbours in Anderlecht, BelgiumMusician Adam Moser plays for neighbours from his balcony in Budapest, HungaryA man and his son on their balcony in BrooklynA man sits alone on a roof terrace in RomeA rose is delivered by drone to a woman on Mother\u0027s Day in Jounieh, LebanonWomen dance on their balcony as a radio station plays music for a flash mob to raise spirits in RomeA skeleton stands on a balcony in Frankfurt, GermanyThe film Le ragazze di Piazza di Spagna is projected on a building in RomeA woman uses a basket tied to a rope to pull a delivery of groceries up to her balcony in Naples, ItalyDJ Francesco Cellini plays for his neighbours from the rooftop terrace of his flat block in RomeA woman gestures from her balcony in BarcelonaCellist Karina Nunez performs for her neighbours at the balcony of her flat in Panama CityDJ Nash Petrovic live streams a set from his roof in BrooklynPeople applaud medical workers from their balconies in Modiin, IsraelA Brooklyn resident relaxes in a hammock hung on their balconyResidents toast during a safe distance aperitif time between neighbours in Anderlecht, BelgiumMusician Adam Moser plays for neighbours from his balcony in Budapest, HungaryA man and his son on their balcony in BrooklynA man sits alone on a roof terrace in RomeFake food shopping vouchers and a bogus text telling iniduals they have been fined for going out during lockdown are among them.The Covid-19 pandemic has led to a surge in all kinds of scams, ranging from the doorstep to email, telephone and social media and everyone should be extra cautious of what they communicate online at this unprecedented time, added Leon Livermore, chief executive of the CTSI.Additional reporting by agenciesBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Here’s how to take the perfect picture of it:Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesUse a landmark to get perspectiveEveryone will be taking pictures of the supermoon by itself, but some of the best pictures show the moon next to a land mark or trees and houses, which is what helps to give the picture “a sense of place”, says Nasa’s senior photographer, Bill Ingalls. “Think of how to be creative – that means tying it into some land-based object. It can be a local landmark or anything to give your photo a sense of place.”Created with Sketch.9 best images of the 2016 supermoon Show all 9Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.The moon rises over the O2 Arena in south-east LondonA commerical jet flies in front of the moon on its approach to Heathrow airport in west London on November 13, 2016.A super moon rises over the Statue of Freedom on the Capitol dome in Washington, DC November 13, 2016.The supermoon, the closest the moon comes to Earth since 1948, rises over the Power and Light building in downtown Kansas City, Missouri, U.S., November 13, 2016A woman sits on the rooftop terrace of a house during the supermoon in Port-au-Prince, Haiti, November 13, 2016The moon rises behind the eagle sculpture high atop LeVeque Tower in Columbus, Ohio, Sunday, Nov. 13, 2016The moon rises beyond the Arch in St. Louis as seen from the Compton Hill Water Tower on Sunday, Nov. 13, 2016The moon rises behind Reunion Tower in downtown Dallas, Sunday evening, Nov. 13, 2016.The moon rises over the harbor of the costal town of Lambert\u0027s Bay, South Africa, Monday, Nov. 14, 2016The moon rises over the O2 Arena in south-east LondonA commerical jet flies in front of the moon on its approach to Heathrow airport in west London on November 13, 2016.A super moon rises over the Statue of Freedom on the Capitol dome in Washington, DC November 13, 2016.The supermoon, the closest the moon comes to Earth since 1948, rises over the Power and Light building in downtown Kansas City, Missouri, U.S., November 13, 2016A woman sits on the rooftop terrace of a house during the supermoon in Port-au-Prince, Haiti, November 13, 2016The moon rises behind the eagle sculpture high atop LeVeque Tower in Columbus, Ohio, Sunday, Nov. 13, 2016The moon rises beyond the Arch in St. Louis as seen from the Compton Hill Water Tower on Sunday, Nov. 13, 2016The moon rises behind Reunion Tower in downtown Dallas, Sunday evening, Nov. 13, 2016.The moon rises over the harbor of the costal town of Lambert\u0027s Bay, South Africa, Monday, Nov. 14, 2016Pick the best spotLocation isn’t everything, but it can definitely help with getting a perfect picture of the supermoon if you have time to plan it. You can look up the best monuments or statues in your area to photograph the image of the moon against, like Mr Ingalls does in Washington D.C., where he lives. “It means doing a lot of homework. I use Google Maps and other apps – even a compass – to plan where to get just the right angle at the right time,” he told Nasa.Use an app to find the moonUnless you\u0027re an astronomer, the best way to know where the moon will rise or set is to use a app on your smartphone to locate it. There are several free or cheap options you can choose from, each using your phone\u0027s inbuilt accelerometer to know which way you\u0027re facing.The apps can also tell you what phase the moon is in, while some even give other celestial details, like the location of planets and star constellations. Decent options for iOS and Android devices include Star Chart, Sky Safari and Skyview.Get the right exposureIf you’re taking a picture on your camera, control the light balance by first tapping the screen where the moon appears to get the camera to focus on the object before dragging your finger up and down to play with the exposure. “You’ll usually want to drag it down for underexposure to be sure you have all the highlight detail,” National Geographic photographer Michael Christopher Brown said.Use a tripod for your camera or rest your phone on a solid surfaceDavid Reneke, an astronomer and writer for Australian science magazine told ABC.net that if you’re using an SLR or DSLR then it’s important to play with aperture settings on your camera to photograph the supermoon, but that using a tripod is essential.It’s worth using a tripod for taking pictures with a smartphone too, as any camera shake can compromise the quality of the pictures – but if you don’t have one to hand you can simply rest your phone on a window ledge.For older smartphones that use a digital zoom rather than an optical zoom, it’s generally best not to use the zoom as it could compromise the quality of the image.

It’s not just a hunch and as every week goes by we have more data to look at.”Tracking the coronavirus outbreak around the world in maps and chartsWhen can we really expect coronavirus to end?Everything you need to know on supermarket delivery slotsThe dirty truth about washing your handsListen to the latest episode of The Independent Coronavirus PodcastMost experts have said a coronavirus vaccine could take up to 18 months to be developed and distributed globally, but Professor Gilbert wants to accelerate the clinical trial process by letting volunteers become infected naturally as soon as possible.She said volunteers from places that have no imposed lockdown measures would produce more efficient results.“If one of those (places) turns out to have a high rate of virus transmission then we will get our efficacy results very quickly, so that is one strategy for reducing the time.“Total lockdowns do make it harder,” she admitted. “But we don’t want herd immunity either. We want them to be susceptible and exposed for the trials purely to test the efficacy.”Developing a working vaccine by September was “just about possible if everything goes perfectly”, added Professor Gilbert, but she warned that nobody could promise it would work.The government is poised to spend tens of millions of pounds for a viable vaccine to have it ready for use and the team is in talks with the government about starting production of the vaccine before the final results become available.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

A strong vacine candidate available by September would not be surprising.However, Professor Brendan warned that because the UK lacks manufacture capabilities, it\u0026nbspmight be at the back of the queue if it depends on other countries with manufacturing capacity, such as Germany, Belgium and France.Desperate times require desperate measures, so upscaling and manufacture would be justified before data is fully known, he said.Even if the vaccine didn\u0027t prove effective this would be a useful trial run for the manufacture of alternative Covid-19 vacines and vaccines against other viral and bacterial diseases.London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Some 1.5 million people reported not eating for a whole day during the first three weeks of\u0026nbsplockdown, according to a\u0026nbspYouGov\u0026nbsppoll for The Food Foundation.The Independent’s Help The Hungry campaign has been supporting\u0026nbspwork going on across the country to ensure that everyone has enough to eat during the outbreak, backed by figures such as London mayor\u0026nbspSadiq Khan, Labour MP\u0026nbspJess Phillips\u0026nbspand TV cook\u0026nbspNigella Lawson.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesWhile several food banks have told us they have been forced to close their doors, many of them are attempting to switch gears and move into the home delivery of emergency of food packages.Bassetlaw Food Bank in Nottinghamshire was forced to “temporarily suspend” normal\u0026nbspoperations at the beginning of April, after it lost more than two-thirds of its mainly older volunteers having to self-isolate or follow NHS shielding guidance.How to support our campaignAdministrator Mark\u0026nbspBagguley\u0026nbspis part of a skeleton team now working with\u0026nbspBassetlaw\u0026nbspCouncil Voluntary Service (BCVS) to make sure the most vulnerable people in the area get food parcels dropped at their door.“You just have to find a different way of doing things,” he said. “We’re trying to work others as best we can. It’s very difficult to say whether the local need is being met, now that everything has been thrown on its head. You just have to help as many people as you can.”Despite food donations left in supermarket collection points “dwindling significantly”, Mr Bagguley is making sure the produce gets taken to the BCVS’s central hub, where drivers deliver to people struggling with job losses, cuts in income or difficultly getting outside for health reasons.The Welcome Centre, an independent food bank in Huddersfield, has lost 50 per cent of its volunteers since the\u0026nbsplockdown\u0026nbspbegan. Yet demand for help has roughly doubled in the past few weeks.\u0026nbspKirklees\u0026nbspCouncil has sent two members of full-time staff to help the charity carry on by making home deliveries across the West Yorkshire town.“We normally help about 300 people in a month,” said Emma Greenough, one of The Welcome Centre’s managers. “It’s likely we’re helping around 600 people at the moment – although it’s guesswork at the moment because things are changing so fast.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

If the government could suspend the five-week wait for Universal Credit, it would be a big help to people.”Both the Trussell Trust, Britain’s largest network of food banks, and the Independent Food Aid\u0026nbspNetwork (IFAN) are calling on the Department for Work and Pension to end the five week-wait on new claimants receiving their first universal credit payment.“Unless the government gets a grip on the problem of people’s lack of income, the level of need will simply overwhelm an already fragile system,” said Sabine Goodwin, coordinator at IFAN.Ms\u0026nbspGoodwin said some of the independent food banks that closed a few weeks ago have already been able to re-emerge in a different form. “At the beginning of the coronavius outbreak at least 12 of our member organisations closed. Since then, three of them have reopened because they have been able to adapt and put new processes in place.”The DENS Food Bank in Hemel Hempstead, part of the Trussell Trust network, is relying on extra help so it can continue to operate. Demand for food parcels has gone up 75 per cent in the past few weeks, at a time the food bank is struggling with a drop-off in volunteers. It has forged an alliance\u0026nbspwith another local charity called the South Hill Centre, allowing volunteer drivers to make home deliveries to people asking for help.“A lot of people have seen their income drop and they don’t have savings to cover them,” said Wendy Lewington, DENS Food Bank’s CEO. “For the self-employed, the government help that might be there in a couple of months isn’t there immediately so they’re struggling to afford the basics.”Both the Welcome Centre and DENS Decorum Food Bank are looking for financial donations and non-perishable items such as UHT milk, soups, tinned meat and fish – proving harder for many food banks to buy in bulk at the supermarkets.Despite the difficulties faced by small, local food banks, some of the larger food surplus charities – rescuing\u0026nbspunwanted or short-dated stock from restaurants, retailers and\u0026nbspmanufacturers\u0026nbsp– are stepping up to fill\u0026nbspsome of the gaps.The Independent’s Help The Hungry campaign is supporting the work of our key partner The Felix Project – which has teamed with two other large organisations\u0026nbspin London to forge the London Food Alliance.The London Food Alliance is now co-ordinating with all 32 London boroughs to make sure the new, council-run community hubs are well-stocked with supplies, and also providing meals for\u0026nbspNHS staff.The Independent\u0026nbspis also encouraging readers to help groups that are trying to feed the hungry across the country – find out how you can help\u0026nbsphere.

We have teamed up with The Felix Project – a start-up charity we helped launch in 2016 – to deliver produce to community hubs in London boroughs.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe Independent is also asking food charities across Britain to contact helpthehungry@ to tell us about your project and help build a directory of ways that our readers can help the hungry in their area – through money, volunteering and food donations. Food banks, which were already struggling to meet the need for emergency food parcels, have seen a huge surge in demand in recent weeks, while at the same time coping with dwindling donations, supermarket rationing systems, and a loss of many volunteers to self-isolation – yet none of the government’s rescue money goes to them.British households have stored more than £1bn worth of goods in their homes in response to the pandemic, creating shortages for food banks as shoppers ignore assurances that supply chains are robust.How to support our campaignJess Phillips, the Labour MP who recently ran for party leader, has backed our campaign, saying: “Nobody should be in the position of not being able to get enough food. In my constituency, London and in places all around the UK the coronavirus pandemic is placing extra stress on a system that was already straining.“We should all do what we can to help food and other essentials get to those that need it. That is why I’m backing the Help the Hungry campaign – please give if you are able.”Pastor Obi Onyeabor, the manager at Barking Foodbank, part of The Trussell Trust’s national network, said his pool of around 50 volunteers has been reduced by a dozen or so people currently self-isolating at home. Yet he and his team have kept their two church hall food banks open, and are now making home deliveries on Tuesdays and Thursdays to make sure the most vulnerable get supplies.“We have been scrambling for the past couple of weeks, doing all that we can – but we’re appealing for more people to come and help,” he said. “Out of fear people have been buying for themselves and their families, but I’ve seen some real generosity too.“I hope that if we can get past the panic buying stage, more people will want to give money, food or some of their time too.”No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailIn London, charities like The Felix Project donate 10 tons of food – or 22,000 meals – to the needy every day. But funding has dropped since the outbreak of Covid-19, limiting their capacity to carry out vital work at a time when it is more important than ever. As part of the London Food Alliance, along with FareShare and City Harvest, The Felix Project will coordinate deliveries in London boroughs in order to distribute surplus food to the elderly, poor and vulnerable. The charities will deliver food to the hubs, where local volunteers will package up parcels and arrange “last-mile” deliveries to the homes of the vulnerable.Sadiq Khan, the mayor of London, has backed our campaign to help in the capital in partnership with our sister title the Evening Standard. He said: “In a city as prosperous as London, everyone should have enough food to feed themselves and their families – but unfortunately the coronavirus outbreak means some Londoners are facing even greater difficulties. It’s commendable these organisations are joining forces to help ensure surplus food isn’t wasted and instead reaches those who need it most. I urge Londoners to support this crucial initiative.”Mark Curtin, CEO of The Felix Project, said: “Our role is to pick up large volumes of nutritious surplus food from the commercial sector and deliver it to community hubs to ensure there is enough food for vulnerable people for as long as this health crisis ensues. We will be working all hours doing our bit – and it would be wonderful if your readers can get behind us so we can do this job for London.”Emma Revie, chief executive of The Trussell Trust, which supports 1,200 food banks, appealed for help from the public to get vital food to people who cannot afford the basics, and to boost volunteer numbers in areas where they are needed.“Our main priority as coronavirus unfolds is ensuring the safety of everyone who comes to a food bank – whether it’s someone needing help, someone volunteering their time, or someone making a donation,” said Ms Revie. “Until we are confident that adequate government protection against poverty is in place, food banks provide an essential community service to people unable to afford food. But this should not fall to food banks.“Our benefits system could be the life raft people need now. That’s why it’s more important than ever that we end the five-week wait for universal credit. While incredible food bank volunteers continue to help people unable to afford the basics, we would ask our government to take this essential step and end the five-week wait now. It’s five weeks too long.”Sabine Goodwin, coordinator of the Independent Food Aid Network UK, which oversees 834 independent food banks, said the charitable services were “struggling to stay above water” in the current climate and accused the government of so far “failing to act” to prevent an ever-increasing number of people falling into poverty.“Food bank use was rising before the coronavirus outbreak and the impact of job losses can only make matters far worse. But this catastrophe in the making is avoidable,” she said. “We’re calling for an income-based solution to this crisis which would mean that the Herculean efforts by volunteers across the country wouldn’t be needed.“FareShare, the UK’s biggest food redistribution charity, is also calling for more volunteers to help with packing and making van deliveries. The organisation takes food from the food manufacturers that can’t be sold in shops, either because of packaging errors or overproduction, and gets it out to food banks, hospices, homeless hostels and other charities.Commercial director Alyson Walsh estimates around 1,200 people have got in touch over the past week. “We have quite a lot of older volunteers who have had to stay at home, but we are now seeing a wave of interest in new people willing to fill in.”Ms Walsh added: “We know we have the capacity to do more – we have the warehouse\u0026nbspspace and the chillers. But the government needs to help the food industry do more in terms of all the bagging and boxing and delivery of food that needs to be done.”Help the hungry\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

The £1m you have donated will help us help The Felix Project feed NHS workers, care workers, the poor and the vulnerable. Thank you.How to support our campaign“But I have to report that I have been out delivering food with Felix today and they are seeing unprecedented demand from people who cannot afford or access food.“I went to two homeless charities, The Marylebone Project and Rhythms of Life, where our deliveries are preventing deep distress. I accompanied one of 22 Felix vans that set off across the capital, filled to the brim, to ferry over 20 tons of nutritious food to three of the giant community hubs established in Barnet, Islington and Haringey, and to more than 75 charities and schools.“That’s more than double the 10 tons a day Felix were supplying in normal times.”Mr Lebedev added: “Within days, this picture is set to change dramatically yet again. Felix say\u0026nbspthey expect another 11 community hubs in another 11 boroughs to open their doors to hungry Londoners – and with it, Felix’s output will need to double again.“That is why we at The Independent\u0026nbspare committing our resources to raise another million pounds to prevent food insecurity to people already anxious about their health and that of loved ones. That is why we say: £1m raised, £1m to go. Let’s finish the job and keep vulnerable Londoners healthy and fed.”The deliveries are part of our food appeal’s support for the charities in the London Homeless Collective, the umbrella organisation of London homeless charities that The Independent\u0026nbspis working with through our Homeless Fund. Felix is delivering to other homeless organisations, as well as The Marylebone Project, including Centrepoint.Des Scott, CEO of the Church Army, which runs The Marylebone Project and provides 112 beds to homeless women under the Edgware flyover, said: “Being able to get fresh vegetables is one of the key things we can do to keep these women healthy.”No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

So it’s still too early to lift the measures that we put in place.“We must stick to the plan and we must continue to be guided by the science.”Mr Raab, who chaired\u0026nbspa meeting of the government’s emergency Cobra committee on Thursday,\u0026nbspthanked everyone for staying indoors but urged the public\u0026nbspto keep sticking to the rules.Early signs suggest the lockdown\u0026nbspmeasures are having an impact but “it’s too early to say that conclusively”,\u0026nbspMr Raab said.

The former New York mayor skipped the first caucus in Iowa and instead campaigned in California on 3 FebruaryHe added: “The worst crime he committed, in the eyes of the establishment, is not the policy he’s proposing it’s the fact that he was able to inspire popular movements, which had already been developing — Occupy, Black Lives Matter, many others — and turn them into an activist movement, which doesn’t just show up every couple years to push a leader and then go home, but applies constant pressure, constant activism and so on.”Many commentators have pointed out that because of Mr Sanders’s success and the way he especially inspired young voters – he won the primaries in Iowa, New Hampshire and Nevada – visually every Democratic candidate was obliged to have their own policies on topics such as climate change, greater accessibly to healthcare, and criminal justice reform.As it, Mr Sanders has said his name will remain on the ballot in the primaries remaining and he will continue to collect and accrue. He said this was a deliberate tactic to try and put pressure on the committee that agrees the party’s official policy platform this summer.Mr Chomsky said if Donald Trump\u0026nbspwere elected it would be an “indescribable disaster”.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

I just mentioned the Lancet figures. It will get worse. What this means for the environment or the threat of nuclear war, which no one is talking about but is extremely serious, is indescribable.”He said he assumed a Biden presidency would be a continuation of former president Barack Obama’s administration “nothing very great, but at least not totally destructive, and opportunities for an organised public to change what is being done, to impose pressures”.Israel intervention in US election greater than Russia’s, says ChomskyNoam Chomsky says antifa is gift to far right and US state repressionChomsky says Trump brought Doomsday Clock alarmingly close to midnightNoam Chomsky argues Antifa is a ‘major gift to the right’He said if Mr Biden, 77, were elected Mr Sanders and his supporters could continue to seek to put that pressure on him.Aware that he will need the backing and votes on Mr Sanders’s supporters if he is to defeat Mr Trump in November, Mr Biden immediately paid tribute to the senator after he suspended his campaign. In a statement directed at those who had so vigorously supported the veteran democratic socialist, he also said: “I see you, I hear you.”On Thursday, in what was seen as another nod to the progressives he need to win over, he unveiled two new proposals he said would help ease the “economic burden on working people”.These were a proposed lowering of the age eligibility for Medicare from 65 to 60 and eliminating student debt for some lower-income families.“In our nation’s 244 years, we have never weathered a crisis that we did not emerge from stronger,” Mr Biden wrote. “This one will be no different.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Singapore is also seeing a rise in local transmissions, with more than 400 new cases in the past week that have been linked to migrant worker dormitories.The first confirmed cases in all three places were connected to people who had travelled to Wuhan, China, where the pandemic began, followed by small clusters of cases among residents with no travel history. Despite their proximity to mainland China, however, they had all managed to keep their case counts low for weeks, through vigilant monitoring and early intervention.None of these places had a single day with more than 10 new cases until March, even as the coronavirus spread around the world.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThat changed in the past two weeks, as both Hong Kong and Singapore saw new cases in the double digits for consecutive days, with the bulk attributed to those who have travelled from abroad. Singapore’s numbers are now triple digits, with large clusters of cases linked to dorms for migrant workers.Taiwan was hit with a surge of new cases, the vast majority of which were imported from other countries, while the number of locally transmitted infections remained low.Tracking the coronavirus outbreak around the world in maps and chartsWhen can we really expect coronavirus to end?Everything you need to know on supermarket delivery slotsThe dirty truth about washing your handsListen to the latest episode of The Independent Coronavirus PodcastStudents or expatriates returning from Europe or the United States account for a large share of the imported cases.

China claims Taiwan as part of its sovereign territory, though the island is practically run by its own democratically elected government.Tracking the coronavirus outbreak around the world in maps and chartsWhen can we really expect coronavirus to end?Everything you need to know on supermarket delivery slotsThe dirty truth about washing your handsListen to the latest episode of The Independent Coronavirus PodcastOn Thursday and Friday, messages started to emerge on social media purporting to be from Taiwanese people expressing remorse for the abuse of Tedros and the WHO. Most had similar wording, along the lines of: “As a Taiwanese, I feel extremely ashamed that we attacked Tedros in such a malicious way. I apologise to Tedros on behalf of the Taiwanese and beg for his forgiveness.”In a statement, Taiwan’s justice ministry said the posts actually appeared to be a coordinated campaign from the mainland, designed to drive a wedge further between the WHO and Taiwan.At a briefing, the ministry’s investigations team said the posts were suspicious because of the similarity of their wording, and the fact that they mainly feature the simplified Chinese characters more common to the mainland.“There is a concern it is a deliberate operation by overseas forces,” the ministry said. “Falsely claiming to be Taiwanese, and openly admitting to racist attacks on WHO director general Tedros and begging forgiveness, seriously damages our country’s international reputation.”Also on Friday, Taiwan’s president, Tsai Ing-wen, issued a “strong protest” against Tedros’s suggestion that the abuse he had been receiving came from Taiwan.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Donald Trump threatened this week to withdraw US funding from the agency, calling its approach “China-centric”.“They’ve been wrong about a lot of things,” he told a daily briefing, where he suggested the WHO was influenced by Beijing in downplaying the severity of the outbreak when it first began. “They missed the call. They could have called it months earlier. They would have known and they should have known and they probably did know,” Mr Trump said.Other countries, like India, have erged from WHO recommendations in a number of ways, formulating their own strategies for dealing with the virus. While Tedros said “test, test, test” was the best policy, India instead aggressively shut down first international travel and then movement within the country, while testing remained at minimal levels.In Taiwan, some internet users have used the WHO row to draw attention back to the positive ways it is seen as having responded to the coronavirus pandemic.Thanks to an early and effective prevention strategy – Taiwan was one of the places to start screening passengers from Wuhan in January – the island has reported just 382 cases of the virus to date, and on Friday confirmed its sixth death, an elderly patient with underlying health conditions.Under the English hashtag #ThisAttackComesFromTaiwan, Twitter users wrote about all the good things that come from the island, including its democratic system and being the first place in Asia to legalise same-sex marriage.And using the hashtag alongside pictures of medical supplies being offloaded from an aircraft, foreign minister Joseph Wu tweeted: “Our assistance to allies in Central America has arrived safely. The people of Taiwan are proud to help friends in time of need.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Stella was at the front - the star of todays show.It was a joyful scene, but as I shouted Say cheese!, Stella suddenly threw herself onto the floor, pulled off her knickers, pointed her legs upwards and parted them to face the camera.Shocked, Lloyd instantly put down the camera and looked at me.I felt my face crumple, as I blinked back tears.Though we had never seen anything like this before - and there was nothing in Stellas placement file about sexual abuse - we knew what it must mean: shed been sexually exploited.It was a devastating realisation - and one we promptly reported to social workers.Yet it was only one of several signs hinting at our foster daughters horrendous past.Before coming to us, I learned, Stella had stripped off in her first PE lesson at school. She had stood completely naked in front of her classmates, with bruises visible on her upper arms.Then, months into her placement with us, I found Stella had been drawing men with spiky teeth in her sketchbook. One picture showed three smiling men with big, erect penises. Another was of a man with a huge, rounders bat-style arm, reaching down towards her genital area.It was a childs gallery of abuse.Another time, I offered Stella a Lion Bar - only for her to recoil in horror.Though she looked at some foods - like lasagne - as though they had arrived from outer space, she had experienced many new things with us and enjoyed snacks as much as any child.But one glimpse at the Lion Bar and she fled to the end of the garden.It was strange behaviour, yet at the time, we could never have guessed the meaning behind it.That would come from a police investigation - sparked by our reports - which found that Stella had been exploited by a highly-organised, systematic paedophile ring, likely involving her own parents.Barely of school age, she had been photographed naked and passed around paedophiles, while her mum Shannon allegedly used a Lion Bar to control her. It was so, so warped and wrong.Though we will never know the full horror of what Stella endured, we do know she was dumped as a baby by Shannon - then a struggling -year-old mum - and left in her grandmothers care.Her dad Terry, in his late s, was in prison at the time - and when he came out, he took Stella back to live with him in his dingy flat, while Shannon carved a new le for herself where.But unbeknown to Terrys relatives, he had allegedly become involved in child sex abuse images behind bars. Now, alone with Stella, he was perfectly placed to find a child for vile purposes.Later, neighbours would notice a stream of men going in and out of the property.Yet even when Stella was discovered abandoned in the freezing flat years on - surrounded by empty beer cars, her own faeces and her dads pit bull terrier, Sharky - the abuse didnt stop.Instead, she was taken back in by Shannon - whom police believe also became involved in the abuse herself. Eager to make cash, the mum allegedly took Stella on trips to her fathers to be exploited.This will be a living hell for some, she tells Sun Online.I feel for all the women in domestic situations who are being beaten. I feel for the children who are witnessing that. I feel for the children who are being abused right now.There will be a lot of abuse going on.She also says the ageing fostering community is at risk of COVID-, which has already killed more than , people in the UK.I know foster carers that have died of the virus, she tells us.You have to factor in were an ageing workforce. They cant recruit foster carers, sadly, and a lot of foster carers are in their s and s.Louise, a best-selling author and artist who grew up in the care system in Oxford, is currently caring for two foster children.Yet while she says her own experience of lockdown is going smoothly, she acknowledges other foster families will be struggling.Ive looked after children who are deeply violent, she says.I can think of children I have looked after where,they were in lockdown with me, it would be the equivalent of domestic abuse. Weve been held hostage in our own home by an eight-year-old!There will be foster families and regular families who are going to be in a place of hell right now. Exploitation means a betrayal of innocence. It is a sullying of that clean, fresh time of being a ‘child’. There is no way to take that away again - as I know all too well myself.I was also abused as a child: my adopted mother repeatedly starved and beat me. So I know Stella will probably spend much of her le trying to recall, forget, understand and find answers.Her anguish was clear to us the day she finally used her voice.After Lily accidentally dropped some of her belongings, Stella screamed a string of shocking and violent expletives.It was like a scene from Fight Club, but with worse language.Abused children in the care system, like Stella, need to be approached inidually and sensitively.But unfortunately, they are often simply stuck in front of a therapist or another trained professional in the well-intentioned but mistaken belief it will somehow fix them.I have seen rushed psychologists try to assess kids in just a single hour.Its always budgets versus what is actually best - and budgets usually win.In Stellas case, neither of her parents were convicted over the paedophile ring - her mum vanished during the police investigation and there was deemed insufficient evidence anyway.Today, Stella has many physical scars. The abuse she suffered was so severe shes had to undergo operations - with more lying ahead of her - and will never go through pregnancy herself.But despite what shes been through, shes found happiness - both at my house, and with her adopted dad, Danny, whom shes been living with for years and lovingly calls Dad.They are so lucky to have found each other.Stella brought such joy into our house during her months with us.This week, countless other children like her will be suffering abuse under the radar.To their abusers, the coronavirus lockdown must seem like the perfect opportunity for manipulation and control. Who can help their victims at this time of crisis  Who can hear them When this is over, I think there will be a real need for many, many more foster placements.And like tens of thousands of others across the UK, Lloyd and myself, , will be there, ready to welcome a new precious child into our own blended family for days, weeks, months or even years.In , I have no doubt well receive yet more joy, laughter and happy memories.The NSPCC has more information and advice about child sexual abuse - which affects one in  children in the UK - on its website.If you are concerned about your own thoughts or behaviour towards children, you can phone Stop It Now! in confidence on    or email help@stopitnow.org.uk.If you are a child and someone is sexually abusing you, you can get help and advice from ChildLine – phone  , calls are free and confidential.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Get it on now.”So there it sits, Monday to Friday at pm. The Steph Show, hosted by the former BBC Breakfast presenter, from her Yorkshire home, with nothing for company but a mission statement: “It’s a power hour of positivity.”An easy thing to claim, an impossible thing to deliver without ideas, creativity, content or anything other than secondhand clips and the same old guestsyou’ve seen clogging up every other show recently.The Steph Show has one thing and one thing only in its favour, though. Honesty.She promised viewers it “might be a bit rough around the edges”, and has been utterly faithful to her word, starting last Monday, when Steph went hurtling round her house to show off the remote cameras and then spent the next ten minutes gasping for air.Over the following  minutes, Skype links maled, mobile phones went off and an attempt to kick off a feature about weird dreams, with Keith Lemon, was shut down as quickly as it started.“What did you ask Michael Hutchence in your dream ”“Things he did romantically with Kylie Minogue that . . . ” “OK, let’s move on.”Had you thought day two was going to improve things, you probably banished those thoughts when Steph began with her own epitaph: “If you tuned in yesterday, you’ll know this is the show that isn’t meant to be on yet.”Or any other day for that matter, although Tuesday’s episode was a technical cracker and climaxed when someone rang Steph’s doorbell, mid-episode. We never did find out who, but I’m willing to bet good money it wasn’t Bafta.And so this hypnotic mess continued throughout the week.Thursday, however, was the day the edice really crumbled, as Steph attempted to lead a mass, safe-distance dancing demonstration, from a car-park in Bristol.Until it transpired the choreographer was at such a safe distance from her CD player it’d be another minute or so before it could start.Honestly, you’ve never heard a silence so awkward or so deafening and it was hard not to have a measure of sympathy for Steph and her production team, who’ve clearly been thrown under a bus by Channel .I say a measure of sympathy, because professional northerner Steph is hardly the underdog she’d have you believe.Her close friend, Sinead Rocks, is MD for the regions at Channel ’s Leeds HQ and, while there’s no suggestion she had anything to do with her recruitment, there’s always an assumption Steph McGovern is “a good thing”.Having never concentrated on her work before I’m going to assume this is for box-ticking, rather than professional, reasons, because, based on her performance here, she’s not a good presenter.For a start, she chunters for Britain, has a knack for saying exactly the wrong thingand crunches the gears during an interview like Jack Grealish heading back to lockdown.: “Provided the last laugh in Germany, did you  What are your tips for attracting wildle ” Eh  There’s more than a hint of The Fast Show about her as well.Absolutely everything is “brilliant”, especially when it’s not. It’s her habit of thinking out loud that could be the death of The Steph Show, though.“Hey! Let’s have our own talent show.

Series two begins with a new owner, Stewart Donald, arriving at The Stadium Of Light along with public schoolboy executive director Charlie Methven, very much the David Brent of the piece, who understands only two things, attendance figures and metaphors and should’ve been ridden out of town the moment he turned up wearing pink corduroy trousers.Improbably, Sunderland also seem to have found a brilliant striker, Josh Maja, who you absolutely know is on the first stage out of Dodge the moment he arrives to turn on Sunderland’s Christmas lights and promises: “I’ll be here next year.”From that point on, disaster’s guaranteed but has to be spelt out to Charlie and Stewart by Graham at the Roker Rapport podcast: “If Will Grigg was the manager’s signing, how come he can’t find a way to play him ”“Um . . . ”BEFORE Friday night, I was convinced a mixture of resolution and good humour would see us through this crisis.No bad thing, but they also need to ditch the host, two guestsand Paul Merton and Ian Hislop, who all appeared, via Skype and remote cameras, in front of their own chosen back-grounds, on Friday.An open invitation to reveal the inner tosspot, they weren’t ever going to refuse.Hislop had a vast library behind him, as befits the intellectual colossus he imagines himself to be, while feminist author Helen Lewis was carefully positioned in front of her new book, exploiting a global pandemic for commercial gain in a manner that seems to be perfectly acceptable to the BBC, so long as you’re left-wing.If your stomach wasn’t already turned enough, the following half hour probably did the job as the four lists and host Steph McGovern cackled demonically at the brilliance of their own route-one puns.“Hasn’t Boris got his Churchill moment now ”Hislop: “Yes. Churchill the dog!

For those of you who say this virus is nothing out of the ordinary, a big fuss about nothing – how often do we have a Prime Minister in intensive care We all wish Boris a swt recovery. The country needs a strong leader at a time like this and Boris has proved, in three short months, he is that leader.There have been calls for a national unity government. All the parties coming together to see us through this crisis. It’s happened before, of course — most famously during World War Two, when we had a coalition government led by Boris’s hero, Sir Winston Churchill. We had one during the Napoleonic Wars back in , too, when that short French tosser was causing havoc in Europe.But do we need one now I think not. The only reason people are raising the issue now is because the Labour Party at last has a leader who isn’t actually certiable.Nobody would seriously think that giving power to an oaf like Jeremy Corbyn would help us through this crisis.But there are plenty of other reasons to object. First of all, we kind of already have a unity government.The Conservatives have a whopping -seat majority. In the last opinion poll Boris had  per cent of the country behind him, thinking he was doing a good job. That’s about as close to unanimous as you will ever get in a democracy. The Government, then, has a free hand.Perhapsthis virus had struck back in October last year, there might have been a point. Then we had a paralysed government with no working majority.Battling this virus would have been nigh on impossible in such a position. But the December General Election changed all that.But then there’s this. Unity governments are usually convened when we are threatened by a foreign power — as happened in World Wars One and Two and indeed the Napoleonic Wars. There have been brief exceptions.But by and large we have a unity government to show the foreign power that the whole country is united. The virus isn’t a ­foreign power. It is an insentient microscopic parasite. It doesn’t give a monkey’s who is running the country.But the most important objection is this. We are a democracy. And democracy is no less important during times of crisis than at other times. And we need a competent opposition to hold the Government to account. Boris and co haven’t done a bad job, so far. But there are plenty of questions that could be asked. Did the Government react too slowly  Why do our frontline medical staff not have adequate protection against the virus  Why did we allow planes to land from China, back in March, when the danger was apparent.OK, you may think some of those questions unfair. And asked with the benefit of hindsight. But it is the job of the Opposition to ask dficult questions, to challenge policies and highlight incompetency.I would argue that is more vital now than at any time in the last  years.Labour’s new leader, Sir Keir Starmer appears to be a sensible bloke.He is generally behind the Government in its fight against this pandemic.But he must be allowed to question, in public, the Government’s policies.We are no less unied when dficult questions are asked of politicians.The more those dficult questions are asked, the quicker this virus will be beaten.The Sun has launched an appeal to raise £MILLION for NHS workers.The Who Cares Wins Appeal aims to get vital support to staff in their hour of need.We have teamed up with NHS Charities Together in their urgent Covid- Appeal to ensure the money gets to exactly who needs it.The Sun is donating £, and we would like YOU to help us raise a million pounds, to help THEM.No matter how little you can spare, please donate today herewww.thesun whocareswinsappealLIFE will never be the same again.

Keep us chuckl­ing during these dark days.DONALD Trump has turned his guns on the World Health Organisation.He’s threatened to cut off its funding. He reckons the WHO has handled the virus pandemic very badly.The WHO told Trump he was wrong to ban flights from China at the start of the outbreak because it “wasn’t necessary”.He said: “The WHO receives vast amounts of money from the United States and we pay for a majority, the biggest portion of their money, and they actually criticised and disagreed with my travel ban at the time I did it.“And they were wrong. They’ve been wrong about a lot of things.”He may look like a morbidly obese Belisha beacon in a badly fitting wig.He may sometimes talk out of his a***hole.

No Brits were on board.A police source told the BFM news outlet: They had planned to come and have a good time on the Riviera despite the coronavirus epidemic.Everything had been planned by the organiser of the trip...starting with the London-Marseille trip in a private jet that he had rented on the other side of the Channel.He then booked a luxury villa in Cannes. To get there, the man had reserved three helicopters from a company which provides private connections for privileged customers.Commercial flights are greatly reduced at airports across Europe at the moment, and the authorities are trying to stop private jets breaking restrictions.The source reported that police guarding the borders of Marseille-Provence airport asked the private jet not to come and land on its tarmac.But the plane still landed anyway, and the passengers were not allowed to leave the aircraft.The private jet used by the groups was an Embraer Legacy - a Brazilian made luxury business jet.Controlled by the border police and the gendarmerie of air transport, none had valid reasons for traveling, said the source.Crossing borders is only allowed with a legitimate or compelling reason.As well as Croatian, the other travellers were German, French, Romanian and Ukrainian, said the source.They initially argued with police, and expressed anger when three helicopters waiting for them were ordered to leave empty, and their pilots fined for breaking lockdown restrictions.The source said the Croatian had paid for everything, including the villa and plane, was  looking forward to the break, with his friends and young female escorts.When confronted by police, he offered them cash, saying: ‘I have money, let’s talk,’ said the police source.The source added: He said they all go to the villa, and lockdown there, and that there would be no problem.But it was obviously a recreational trip, and under the containment measures these are strictly prohibited.’The only fines issued were to the three French helicopter pilots.None of those on board have yet been identied by police.Nine members of the holiday party ed to London by the private jet on Saturday evening, while the tenth went back to Germany.France has been in lockdown since March  in a bid to slow the spread of the pandemic, with only essential trips allowed that must be justied with a signed piece of paper.Health director Jérôme Salomon said the lockdown was working: ‘Thanks to these measures, we are in the process of putting the brakes on the epidemic.’The lockdown, which was supposed to run until April , will be extended beyond that date, it was announced on Wednesday.President Emmanuel Macron will discuss the coronavirus situation in a live TV address to the nation on Monday.     Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

My body ached severely, I felt so heavy and was sweating with a fever.Doctors have warned that a loss of taste or smell could also be a sign of coronavirus.The British Association of Otorhinolaryngology, which represents experts in ear, nose and throat medicine, explained that an eye infection conjunctivitis may also be another sign.In a statement, the docs said: Evidence from other countries that the entry point for the coronavirus is often in the eyes, nose and throat areas.A study published in JAMA Ophthalmology found that . per cent of  patients with COVID- at a hospital in the Hubei province had eye-related symptoms - although further studies are needed on a larger scale.A number of people who go on to have coronavirus first report losing their sense of smell or tasteIts thought that losing the ability to smell or taste could be due to the virus destroying cells in the nose and throat.Experts say its something people can commonly experience after having other types of coronaviruses - such as the common cold.Prof Carl Philpott, of the Norwich Medical School at UEA, said: Coronaviruses have previously been associated with what we refer to as post-viral olfactory loss– this is smell loss that persists after a cold.There are many respiratory viruses that can potentially cause problems with the smell receptors.So far with Covid-, the smell loss appears to be transient but only as time elapses will we know how many people have a more permanent loss.Ryan Van Waterschoot ended up in hospital for  days with coronavirus, and losing his sense of smell and taste were the first few symptoms.Just a day after losing the two senses, he went from feeling tired to not being able to move in just one day, before his temperature soared and he was rushed to hospital, where he was given oxygen for five days.The -year-old said: I didn’t think I was going to make it out of the hospital. I thought it was the end of the road for me.Some people may experience brain fog, also known as mental fatigue, as another symptom of coronavirus.Its not been officially looked into as a symptom but its another indicator that those who have experienced the illness have reported experiencing.Thea Jourdan, , said she didnt experience a cough or fever - instead her introduction to Covid- began with a tickle in her throat and a dull headache,.The mum-of-three, from Hampshire, says she then started to experience brain fog.She told the Daily Mail: Initially I felt exhausted, asI was dragging myself through treacle and had no choice but to go to my bed. I had no meaningful cough and I wasn’t running a fever.But I had a peculiar sensation of something settling deep within my lungs, almost like breathing in talcum powder.I also had brain fog. I was unable even to fill out forms from the children’s schools. I just wanted to sleep.Another woman, who had recently recovered from Covid-, told the Huffington Post that she too had experienced the unusual mental block before her symptoms worsened.Christy, from Seattle, had a similar feeing of brain fog - she said her illness started with a multi-day fever that progressed into sinus congestion and a headache following it.She added: “It’s not just a cold. I’m pretty healthy and not old , and it kicked my a**.”Another symptom that coronavirus patients have reported is feeling extremely tired before symptoms develop.According to a report in the Journal of the American Medical Association, up to  per cent of those hospitalised with Covid- reported exhaustion and fatigue.Linda Carr, , from Hethersett, Norfolk, told the Mail: I felt very sick and terribly fatigued. But I didn’t have a temperature or a cough.Within two days I could barely stand. I didn’t have the energy to lt one foot in front of the other.But she knew it was more serious than a flu when she developed a tightness in her chest that left her short of breath.After visiting her GP, she was sent straight to hospital where she was kept for five days after testing positive.Linda says she is still feeling weak and remains in isolation at home.Those who develop minor symptoms such as a high temperature or continuous cough should self-isolate for seven days.If you live with others, you should also stay at home for  days from the day the first person started showing symptoms.Anyone with suspected coronavirus who becomes seriously ill should call  and in a medical emergency always call .Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

our schools is one of the key issues the nation will face when it steps carefully away from this Covid- lockdown.Based on the evidence, I believe that re-opening schools should be considered early in the exit strategy because it appears they play a relatively small role in transmissions.We tend to see children as excellent spreaders of bugs, and therefore ­closing schools seems to make sense.Yet research published earlier this week shows that this isn’t necessarily true for the Covid- virus.Almost everything we know about closing schools to stop disease outbreaks comes from influenza.Flu is a very dferent virus to coronavirus, and children drive much of influenza’s transmission.Coronavirus is less likely to affect children and young people.They rarely get very sick, and they mostly get very mild symptoms or show no ­symptoms at all.During the  epidemic caused by Sars — a cousin of Covid- — the data showed that schools and schoolchildren played no role in transmitting the virus.To

getting some online teaching  —  my -year-old had brilliant support from his school before the holidays.But we know that some schools are offering much less, and I worry that it is particularly the poorest children who are ­missing out.Children also benefit from school through contact with friends and adults outside their family.Plus there is support for mental health and even in the food that they might not get at home.School closures also force children together with parents at home for weeks on end.This can be a source of great bonding, but we know that, particularly for teens, being cut off from peer groups and other adults is not good for their development or mental health.The issue of forcing key worker parents to stay home has been largely solved during the pandemic by keeping some schools open just for their ­children.But for parents who are not key workers, being forced to look after ­children for weeks at home can prevent them earning an income.Closing schools has in the past been shown to increase social contacts between children outside school, and between children and adults looking after them, particularly grandparents, who are most vulnerable to this virus.Currently, those over  should be self- isolating away from children.But there are many grandparents who are under .Andschools stay closed while we allow adults to exit lockdown first, we risk an increase in contact between children and grandparents.One of the problems is that we tend to think of schools as being entirely closed or open.Our research showed that there are a range of potential options.It would mean a partial or staged re-opening with social distancing built in.The point of social distancing for schools is to reduce the number of children in contact at any one time.Ensuring that dferent school years don’t meet would be a useful start.So have half the school attend in the morning and half in the afternoon, close the playgrounds and stagger year-group start, end and break times so that ­dferent years never meet.Then ensure that dferent classes don’t meet.This could mean staggering start times by class or alternating the ways that classes enter and leave school, and ­keeping students in form classes for all their lessons.Schools could also look at how feasible social distancing is within classes.True, most British classrooms could not fit a metre between desks.However,only half of the school is attending at any one time, classes could spread out across more than one classroom.We also need very clear rules on when not to come to school with any ­symptoms, and the need for self-isolation at homeothers in the family had been ill will be required.Teachers need to be protected, as we protect those who ­continue to drive buses, man shopping centres and work in our health ­system.And teachers should be early in the queue for testing.This may all sound too dficult.However, we owe it to our ­children to examine all of these options.It could be done more easilywe had sufficient testing to know which children or teachers had had Covid-.But we may need to proceed ­without that, given what we are currently told about antibody-testing timescales.As mentioned, our schools are already ­partially open — for the children of key workers and vulnerable children.Let’s gradually increase that “partially” in a way that’s guided by

Some  workers have no guaranteed weekly minimum hours - while peers can claim £ for each day they turn up. The number of these iable hours contracts has risen from  since . SNP MP Chris Stephens, who has led a backbench Bill aiming to ban zero-hour contracts, told the Mirror: “There’s no excuse for anybody to be in a zero hour contract in parliament or not.“There shouldn’t be any need at all for anything other than guaranteed hours contracts.” Almost a million workers in the UK are on zero-hour contracts.  The number in the Lords was disclosed following a Freedom of Information request by the Mirror. As of February ,  catering and retail staff and  Hansard reporters, who record debates in the Lords chamber, were on “iable hours contracts”. Officials said this meant they have no minimum weekly hours, though when they do work a sht, they are booked for a guaranteed minimum number of hours for that day. Asked the same question, the House of Commons said it had no directly-employed zero-hours staff - though authorities could not comment on any agency staff or contractors. A Lords spokesman defended the deals, saying the workers were used instead of casual staff and receive pension, holiday, sick pay and at least the London Living Wage of £. an hour. They can also turn down shts without the threat of losing further work in future.  But Mr Stephens said: “People need to organise their lives. They will have transport costs, childcare costs. “We want to see seven days’ notice for people to come in andit changes within those seven days they should get double time.”Lords officials have pledged the zero-hour workers will continue to be paid during the coronavirus pandemic.They will receive their average weekly earnings over the four weeks to March , as long as they have worked a sht since September."},{"url":null,"title":"brazen couple ignore coronavirus lockdown","story":"NewsBrazen couple ignore coronavirus lockdown to camp in the centre of village greenFurious residents in Bidston, Birkenhead, gave the pair a frosty welcome after they pitched a six-man tent despite the UK being in the midst of the coronavirus pandemic.ShareCommentsByLottie GibbonsLorraine-Marion King:,  APR Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news video public-urged-stay-home-despite-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror News , options :,prebidWithConsentFix:,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,navWithArticle.enabled:true,codesplit:,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,nocodesplit:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,newsletterSiteName:Mirror,mvtTests:[ UJ- ],webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,lotameLightningTagV:true,prebid.sendAllBids:true,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,ozoneAllowedKeys:oz_gmpd_crid,oz_gmpd,oz_gmpd_adid,oz_winner,oz_gmpd_adomain,oz_gmpd_pb_r,oz_gmpd_adv,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,webPushNotications.pushDisplayService:airship,GDPRConsentEnabled:,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,prebidWithoutConsentFix:true,video.suppressDates:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror News , options :,prebidWithConsentFix:,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,navWithArticle.enabled:true,codesplit:,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,nocodesplit:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,newsletterSiteName:Mirror,mvtTests:[ UJ- ],webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,lotameLightningTagV:true,prebid.sendAllBids:true,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,ozoneAllowedKeys:oz_gmpd_crid,oz_gmpd,oz_gmpd_adid,oz_winner,oz_gmpd_adomain,oz_gmpd_pb_r,oz_gmpd_adv,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,webPushNotications.pushDisplayService:airship,GDPRConsentEnabled:,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,prebidWithoutConsentFix:true,video.suppressDates:true,parentUrl:https:www.mirror news uk-news brazen-couple-ignore-coronavirus-lockdown-\"\" to FREE email alerts from Mirror - The Coronavirus BriefingSubscribeWe will use your email address to send you newsletters.

I tried to learn how to cook something new to add to the one dish a week I make, but my paella stuck to the pan and I lashed it into the bin when one of the kids laughed and askedit was called a paella crap. I grew a beard, which I thought made me look a bit like Al Pacino in Serpico, only for my we to tell me I looked like Jon Pertwee in Worzel Gummidge. I decided to put a coat of nish on the rotting garden furniture but the three paint brushes I had were glued together with old paint, and when I drove to BQ, they turned me away because I hadn’t worked out how to click and collect from them. I never will. So I turned to Netflix, hoping to get hooked on a new American drama or documentary series and got so bored I ended up scouring US news channels to find a Donald Trump press conference for some mental stimulation.  And then a week ago I did something that finally beat the lockdown blues. I dug out my old DVD box sets and started to re-watch comedy classics. I devoured The Office, delighting again at Ricky Gervais’s glorious anti-PC creation David Brent. I stuck on Fawlty Towers and remembered how funny John Cleese used to be before he became a real-le whining malcontent. Watching the greatest political satire ever, The Thick Of It, left me marvelling at the master of the four-lettered insult Malcolm Tucker."},{"url":null,"title":"britains lockdown babies pictured mums","story":"NewsBritains lockdown babies pictured as mums give birth during UK coronavirus pandemicMums across Britain have spoken of the joy and drama of giving birth during the pandemic.

Thankfully, NHS staff have been at hand to battle the disease and letting midwives get on with the job of delivering babies. The world might seem a dark place at the moment, but these amazing babies would put a smile on anyone’s face… Jodie Mills and Rosie “From the moment we were put in lockdown, I was anxious about going into hospital and giving birth in the current situation,” says Jodie. “It was my second child and when my contractions started at am on April , my sister drove over to look after our son, Reggie,  months, and my husband, David, , drove me to Darlington Memorial Hospital. “My contractions were coming thick and fast.”  The -year-old from Catterick Garrison, North Yorks, added: “We quickly made our way up to the maternity ward on the sixth floor. However, the baby didn’t want to wait – she was halfway out when we were in the lt! “All the staff had gloves on and I managed to hold her in until we got to the double doors of the maternity ward. My husband was frantically buzzing the bell for assistance before a midwe appeared. “She ran out and quickly took off her cardigan and delivered our baby in the corridor. “Our daughter, Rosie, was born at :am. She weighed lb oz. I was very nervous because of the pandemic but the care we received at both the labour and maternity ward was second to none, they were professional, friendly and reassured you. “My husband was allowed in the labour ward, but was only allowed to stay a short while. We had to stay  hours to be monitored and then partners weren’t allowed in to collect us, so a nurse helped walk me down to the car. “I can’t thank all the staff enough – especially the midwe that took her cardigan off to catch Rosie!” Laura Gillham and baby Rudy “My labour was really quite good considering everything that is going on,” says Laura, .  “I gave birth to my first child at Darlington Memorial Hospital and the staff and midwives were amazing! “At first I had planned on having two birthing partners, my boyfriend Brad, , and my mam, Sharon. But two weeks before my due date I found out that because of the pandemic the rules had been changed so that I could only have one birthing partner. Learning that my mam couldn’t be there was slightly upsetting but understandable. “On April , I was in labour and Brad was allowed with me. After seven hours our son, Rudy, was born at :pm, weighing lb. “Brad was with me the whole time and didn’t miss a thing, he was even allowed to cut the cord. The whole experience was amazing!” Laura, from Darlington, Co Durham, added: “Mam hasn’t got to meet him yet, only through the window. She can’t wait to meet him in person for a proper cuddle!” Zoe Green and Joss “I gave birth to my seventh baby on March . I’d already been self-isolating for two weeks due to being pregnant and having bad asthma,” explains Zoe.  “When I started having contractions I went to Colchester General Hospital. “But then the contractions stopped. “I was about to be sent home when a matron came on the ward to speak to everyone and explained that from that point onwards the pandemic meant that no visitors would be allowed on the wards any more and partners would only be allowed at the birth.” The -year-old from Colchester, Essex, added: “I went home feeling a bit sad but on a mission to get my labour going before the hospital got any worse.  “The next day I did a YouTube inducing-labour exercise video, bounced on my ball every chance I got, went for a long walk and then had pineapple and to finish the day, ordered myself a hot curry and had a lavender bath... and then went to bed with my fingers crossed. I got my wish as I heard my waters pop in my sleep at .am. “I was booked in for an elective C-section and they didn’t want me going into full-blown labour. “I grabbed my bag and notes, and headed to the hospital where my baby’s dad, Dan, met me. “There was also another lady in the other room for the exact same thing so the poor midwives were going from room to room washing their hands coming in and when they left. “Our baby boy, Joss Henry Craig Green, was born at :am weighing lb oz. “All the staff we met were absolutely amazing and so lovely and reassuring.”  Angela Ahmed and Twins Trent and Tallulah “I was  weeks pregnant with twins and already had two other sons, Jamal, , and Kia, , when on March  I started suffering with cramps,” says Angela,  from Bromsgrove. “I went to Royal Worcester Hospital and I expected to be sent home with paracetamol, instead I was  centimetres dilated and they were ready to be born at just  weeks.  “Scared, I called my partner, Chris Kerr, , and he came in within two hours. Trent came out at .pm weighing lb oz and Tallulah was born at .pm at only lb oz. “We are allowed to see the babies separately and I’ve been isolated. Me and Chris can only have contact from a distance as he’s isolated at home with my other two sons. “The staff are amazing and can’t do enough for me and my babies. I would love to give them my appreciation.

Now is the time we can start to see mammals and their newborns pop their heads above ground. Today Chris Packham and zoologist Megan McCubbin talk about their favourite British mammals to keep your eyes peeled for in April and May. Badgers  Badgers are active throughout the course of the year and would’ve given birth in February or March, so in the next couple of weeks the young might be coming above ground for the first time. But they’ve very shy. They live in setts in the middle of the large territory that belongs to the whole family. The main sett is where the badgers live for most of the year and where they rear their babies but they also have smaller setts which they use in the Spring, Summer and Autumn so they can sleep near to where they find food.  A family of badgers can have a really big territory - each badger terrirtory might have up to six smaller setts. They’re sociable animals and like living with each other and love to play. And they’re really good at knowing which territory is theirs by their latrines - badgers have really distinct smelling faeces which they put at the edge of their territories so other families know they shouldn’t enter. It’s quite a sophisticated set up and is essential to their survival. Bats  We have  species of bat in the UK,  of which are known to be breeding here - that’s almost a quarter of our mammal species. They’re emerging this time of year and you can see them in all areas - urban or rural. But bats are always betteryou’ve got water near you. Soyou’re near a pond, reservoir, anything like that, you’ll see they’re beginning to emerge regularly. Bat populations have suffered severe declines during the past century. Deer  We had a muntjac deer near us the other day. You can tell the dference between male and female because the males have two very distinctive dark lines down the forehead and have very short antlers. The females are slightly paler. Muntjac have these amazing curved bottoms like rabbits. They are quite pig like with very sticky legs and are one of my favourites. They’re not native to the UK and were brought here in  to Woburn Safari Park. Some of them escaped, which is why they’re quite common across woodlands in the south of England. They’re very shy and secretive animals, soyou get a glimpse make the most of it. They’re fascinating, you can see them on roadsides nibbling at the verges. But they aren’t too popular with gardeners because they go for all the tasty parts of your plants - they love rosebuds. Also just be waryyou’re out walking your dog in an area where they might be and keep your animal on a lead. Foxes  April is the time we would expect start to see our fox cubs and they start to move around out of their den. If people are lucky enough to have a den in their garden shed, this is when they’ll first see the fox cubs. They’re very unfoxy when you first see them, they have quite blunt faces with short ears. They look quite cat-like, like kittens the nose hasn’t grown down yet and they’re chocolate brown in colour, they’re not red yet. Wobbling about with their skinny tails, they try to find their balance. We’ve already had reports of that cubs have been sighted as early as Christmas and January. This is really early, which is a sign of climate change. Fellow Springwatch presenter, Iolo Williams, told me he saw very young fox cubs and that was just before or after Christmas. That’s quite unusual. Otters  Pre s, where a lot of chemicals were put into our waterways, many of them were devoid of le and it damaged the eco systems. Everything at the top of the food chain disappeared. Otters only really occurred on the western side of the UK, in Wales, Cornwall and Devon. When I was a kid in the s, otters were a rather rare animal they were dficult to see and it didn’t occur in Hampshire where I grew up. Now they have recovered their range and have been found in every UK county, all the way across from the west and now including Kent. But they have not recovered their numbers, so there’s still scope for more otters to exist in our environment, particularly now our waterways have been cleaned up. We can’t be complacent about otter conservation just because they’re back everywhere - they’re not back in numbers they were, but it’s great to see them turning up. In urban areas they have even been turning up and you can see them in daytime from footpaths. Otters were almost an enigma and now are mostly accessible. The Sainsbury’s supermarket in Andover has a path that runs alongside the river and while you’re pushing your trolley you can look over the side and see them. How to make a hedgehog house and highway  Hedgehogs are a favourite this time of year - everyone loves hedgehogs. It’s mild and now’s the time they’re coming out into the garden soyou have a trap camera, now is the time to set it up. You can also make a little hedgehog house which is really simple. Get a bucket, put some hay or straw, grass, any long organic matter, inside the bucket, just something the hedgehog can hide in. Lie the bucket on its side and keep it steady with something so it doesn’t roll. Put it under a hedge or somewhere not exposed – they’re very secretive and shy things and are much more comfortable when they feel secure.

She has now moved to LA with husband Prince Harry and son Archie, and the family are getting to grips with their new, non-royal lives. Everything will change for the couple as they embark on the next chapter of their lives, and Christine Ross, the editor of the Meghanaposs Mirror blog, believes weaposll see a dramatic change in Meghanaposs fashion. Speaking to the Mirroraposs royal podcast Pod Save the Queen, she said: When Meghan married into the Royal Family, she took on a new job.Itaposs literally likewe got a new career role - you know, you go from being a teacher to a manager or something like that - your wardrobe is going to change. When she married into the Royal Family, her wardrobe changed to suit her new job. Now that her new job is going to be something completely dferent, I think weaposll see herto her pre-marriage style. Weaposll probably see a lot more ripped jeans again because thataposs something she loves to rock - a pair of ripped skinny jeans.  There was a lot of speculation that that wasnapost appropriate for a royal, although we did still see them from time to time, especially in her off-duty looks. I really think that weaposre going to see a casual Meghan, weaposre going to see a lot more affordable style, weaposre going to see a lot more jeans and boots rather than fascinators and high heels. Itaposs really a reflection of her new lestyle and the new role that sheaposs going to play.  But Christine still hopes weaposll get to see a glam Meghan when they attend formal events. While we wonapost see them at royal parties, the coupleaposs new Hollywood connections may mean we see them on the red carpet. Christine  said: I expect we will still see Meghan and Harry at some high-profile events, maybe some more glamorous events. Depending on the work they do, maybe thereaposs a red carpet, and Iaposm hoping Meghan will bring the capes out.  She knows how fierce and fabulous she looks in them. Christine is quick to praise Meghanaposs royal style, and chatted about some of her highlights over the past two years. She said: I think she did such a great job of wearing that royal unorm but adding her own style to it. I think we all would have loved to see her in a tiara again, and I donapost know that we will.

Britons are facing an unprecedented Easter bank holiday weekend thanks to the Covid- pandemic and a lockdown that is now in its third week and set to be extended. Have you been affected by coronavirus  Email webnews@mirror. A Twitter user in West Sussex wrote: @Tesco Iaposve just been speaking to someone who has just finished a  hour sht on a Covid ward. She is in a -hour queue to get into your Crawley store. She is not allowed to jump the queue. How is that OK A Tesco worker replied: Although we ask our security to stick to the rules, we would also expect them to use common sense in times like these and let them through. I will contact the storeyou let me know which one it is. A man in Birmingham wrote: Queues at the supermarkets this weekend are giving me anxiety!  Looked like - hour+ queues at Asda and Sainsbury’s near me. Hope it’s just for Easter weekend and normal service resumes shortly. A woman in London wrote: Thank goodness I donapost need any more shopping now until next week.  Itaposs literally taken  hours to get a few essential bits in my local Sainsburyaposs and Waitrose. The last time I saw queues that long, I was outside Madame Tussauds during the school holidays. And another added: Waited in a queue at the butchers for way over an hour, all because I wanted lamb for Easter.A woman in Scotland tweeted: Well folk seem determined to aposovershotapos for Easter. The queue is all the way round our local Tesco’s very large car park #GoodsFriday. Photos posted on social media showed queues stretching well into car parks where barriers were set up to keep things orderly. In Cwmbran in South Wales, a man who posted a photo of shoppers waiting to enter an Aldi wrote: Queue for Aldi is insane mind.  Pictures showed shoppers queing in a car park outside an Asda in Brighton, East Sussex, long lines outside a Morrisons in Seaburn, South Tyneside, and similar scenes at a Sainsburyaposs store in Heaton, Newcastle. Shoppers told to expect long queues Families have been warned that queues to get into supermarkets might be even longer than usual on Saturday, as a result of Sunday trading laws. Shops in England and Wales - but not Scotland - have to shut their doors on Easter Sunday and Christmas daytheyaposre over  square metres in size.  And these rules apply coronavirus or not - meaning even more families than usual will need to stock up on essentials this Saturday. To make matters even worse, Friday and Monday count as Sundays thanks to their bank holiday status over Easter - meaning big shops are operating reduced hours on those days too. Throw coronavirus restrictions on the number of people allowed into shops at once and you have a recipe for the mother of all queues.  On a normal Sunday big shops can open for six hours, between am and pm. This weekend, those restrictions apply to Friday and Monday, while shops over a certain size must close entirely on Sunday. Then there are additional hours reductions as a result of coronavirus. Some shops are closing earlier so staff have more time to restock shelves. Police face criticism for patrolling supermarkets A police force is facing criticism after its officers patrolled a Tesco and found that the non-essential aisles were empty. Cambridgeshire Police officers visited the supermarket just a day after Northamptonshireaposs chief constable faced a backlash for suggesting officers could search shopping trolleyspeople kept flouting social distancing rules. Home Secretary Priti Patel hit back and said checking supermarket trolleys is not appropriate.

Grandmother Lynne Limbert was killed by coronavirus at the age of  after beating bowel cancer just the previous year. Her son Phil Limbert said his mum was tough and it was asshe knew she was dying, reports the Liverpool Echo. Phil said: My mum and dad had a long standing joke between them. My mum would go to the caravan in Wales at weekends, she loved going to the caravan. She would say to my dad, aposright, see you laterapos. He would say aposI love youapos and she would roll her eyes and say aposdittoapos. He knew she loved him, it was just a bit of a joke. But in the hospital they had to put her on a ventilator and she needed sedating. Before they did, she got one of the staff and said apostell my husband I love himapos. Itaposs a bit like she knew. She was not soft my mum. Lynne, a retired nurse, from Broadgreen in Liverpool, had beaten bowel cancer last year and was healthy and active, spending her days doting on her two grandsons and enjoying a busy social le.  But after a few days of feeling under the weather, Lynne was rushed to hospital where her lungs were unable to recover and she died on Tuesday afternoon.Administrator Phil said he was forced to say goodbye to his unconscious mum, who he described as his hero, in full protective gear. Through tears, Phil said staff at the Royal Liverpool Hospital, where he also works, were absolutely amazing, holding her hand so she was not alone and making sure she did not feel any pain. Phil, , said: She was in hospital for a total of  nights. I saw her a few days before she went in and she was complaining that she was just a bit cold. She was just like aposclose the door, Iaposm a bit chillyapos, and it just sort of came on from there. We used to message quite a lot on Facebook, and over the next few days she was still upbeat but she was saying her head was pounding and she felt like she had been hit by a train. Phil says his mum seemed to improve and remained in good spirits. However around two weeks before her death her devoted husband, Philaposs dad Paul Limbert, rang the NHS  number for advice - and based on her symptoms an ambulance was immediately dispatched. Lynne was fully aware, but by that point was so breathless she could hardly string a sentence together and was kept in the back of the ambulance for around an hour while paramedics provided her with oxygen.  That was the last Philaposs dad saw of his we. Phil, his older brother Chris Limbert and their dad Paul were then faced with the tortuous experience of waiting to seeLynne would recover while not being able to visit due to strict infection controls at the Royal. Phil says the family were kept up to speed with regular phone calls from the hospital, but after  days he received the worst possible news - all treatment options had been exhausted. He said: Then it was like wow, this is so real. We had not been able to see her, we were not there to see how it was developing. You just donapost believe it.  Phil was allowed to pay a final visit to his mum with PPE protection, but his dadaposs health conditions meant he was too high risk and Chris could not face seeing his mum attached to tubes and wires. He said: I didnapost want to stay for the turning off of the machine, I didnapost want to remember her that way and I didnapost want to see her go, although they did give me that option and said you can take as long as you need. I got to say goodbye to her and hold her hand. I had messages from all the family saying how much they missed her and how much she was loved. I told her she was going to see my grandad and nan, and that she was not in pain anymore. Lynne had no health problems, said Phil, and she loved going for walks as part of a walking group, as well as enjoying a drink with her sister Christine who lived opposite. Phil said she was devoted to her grandchildren, his three-year-old son Oscar and Chrisaposs -year-old son Zak, and would do anything for anyone. Lynne spent her working le as a nurse in Broadgreen Hospital, before doing a short stint in the Royal and then moving on to Liverpool Womenaposs Hospital. Although Phil has been able to see his dad since Lynneaposs death, they have observed social distancing so he has not even been able to hug him. He said: We observed social distancing rules but before this I was one of those people who would watch the news and think aposoh it will all blow over in a couple of weeksapos.

Eric Roberts was visiting land near Aberffraw, Wales, and realised another vehicle was heading his way despite the lane to the beach at Porth Cwyfan, Anglesey  - despite it being closed The beauty spot is famous for its medieval church which sits on an island off the coast. Villager Eric Roberts, , explained he was checking on his sheep when he spotted a blue car parked on a hill above the beach this morning. He said: “There’s been a ‘Road Closed’ sign and cones on the lane for a few days now. The guy had obviously moved them to get to the beach.“I waited around a few minutes and watched as he loaded his kayak into the car. Then he came driving up the lane and had to move the sign and bollards again to continue his journey. “I decided to politely confront him and explain calmly why he shouldn’t have been there.” Eric filmed the stand-off in a video which has been shared almost , times and had , views on Facebook. The grey haired man - wearing shorts and sandals - is seen climbing out of his blue -plate Jaguar. Eric asks him to replace the cones and sign to prevent other accessing the beach, before telling him: “You shouldn’t be here in the first place.” The man replies: “The rules were set for big towns and cities. Here in the rural environment it’s a completely dferent kettle of fish. “I’ve done contamination control. I know what I’m talking about.” Eric tells him: “The government says essential travel only. With a kayak  Do you think that’s essential ” He replies: “No, but I am working away from other people.” The man says he lives in nearby Menai Bridge, where the tidal waters of the Menai Straits separate Anglesey from mainland Wales, and Eric asks why he hasn’t chosen to canoe closer to home. “What’s wrong with the Straits to go with that plastic thing you’ve got in the car  Nothing.” Eric says. “Why come here ” The man replies: “The current in the Straits is quite strong.”  Eric says: “Good - you’ll get a good paddle, it’ll give you good muscles.” The confrontation ends with the man ing to reassemble the roadblock. Eric said afterwards: “It’s a popular little spot in summer, we might see eight cars parked up at a time. “But there’s no reason to be down there now unless you live in the village. I couldn’t believe my ears when he tried to claim the rules only applied to towns and cities.

Sources reveal the Duchess of Sussex has been offered the massive sum to dish the dirt on her and Prince Harryaposs tumultuous split from the Royals. The stunning move would have echoes of Princess Dianaaposs infamous  warts-and-all interview with Martin Bashir about her failed marriage to Prince Charles. And it is understood that US telly powerhouse Oprah Winfrey is the favourite in the running to bag what could be the biggest interview of the decade. Meghan is in talks with several US TV networks about a “tell-all” interview, Daily Star reports.The interview, coming as it would once the coronavirus lockdown is over, is likely to be screened across the globe as millions tune to hear Meghan break her ­silence about the coupleaposs split from “the firm”. Meghan is believed to be “extremely serious” about trying to “win back the public” with the TV spectacular and Harry is said to be giving “serious consideration” to the proposal. Meghan is thought to favour allowing cameras to film their home and family le, which is a common theme in blockbuster US TV interviews, such as when Bashir famously interviewed Michael Jackson in . A source close to the couple revealed that Meghanaposs interview would be “the most anticipated global TV interview event since Diana’s famous ­tell-all chat with Martin Bashir.” The source added: “Meghan wants to donate all the money to charity – probably the NHS after the incredible efforts of all the frontline workers.  “When she was part of the Royal Family it would have been unthinkable for her to do a solo interview with anyone about her le and how being a princess has changed her world. But now she’s very much her own boss and it has put her under pressure feeling that the public have lost their ‘love’ for her and Harry ­after they took the big step of­ ­going on their own”.

Mr Larcombe said Prince Harry may even be feeling helpless as he watches the Royal Family try to boost the UKaposs morale during the coronavirus lockdown.He added the Duke may even struggle to find a suitable role for himself as he hasnapost had much work experience other than being in the army and charity work.

Some MPs have warned that the resulting economic downturn could have greater human consequences and lead to a higher number of deaths than the virus itself.  Former Conservative leader Sir Iain Duncan Smith has said it will “not be feasible for us to be locked down to May.” It comes as the number of daily deaths from coronavirus passed the peaks in Spain and Italy for the first time.

Restaurants, pubs and theatres are now closed, along with schools, and people are being told to only leave their homes when they have to get essential supplies, like medicine and food, or for exercise daily. Group gatherings are now totally banned with people being told to stay six feet away from others at all times. The elderly, who are especially at risk to infection from coronavirus, are among the group of the most vulnerable who have been told they must self-isolate for  weeks in a bid to keep them safe. But this can be an incredibly lonely experience for OAPs, who are unable to spend time with their loved ones or socialise.And now  people living with dementia who are separated from their families in the Coronavirus lockdown have explained how music has become a leline in keeping them connected.Moyra Tourlamain, , lives at home with her husband John, , who was diagnosed with dementia in . They have had to stay away from family and friends but have found solace in online music sessions via the Music for Dementia  campaign. Moyra said: John and I have always been into music – in fact one of the reasons I married him was for his record collection! It’s played a big part in our le and still does. Before the Covid- pandemic they would attend music classes designed to help people with dementia in their local area near Cambridge. But although John has missed out on the face-to-face connection, his symptoms – which have been heightened recently due to the isolation – have been alleviated by attending online versions of the sessions. Former BBC bureaucrat Moyra said: As Hans Christian Andersen famously said, aposwhere words fail, music speaksapos. The online sessions have been a leline not just for John but for me. They are a landmark in what are very long weeks. I think it’s really important for our general wellbeing. It’s also a whole new experience and the engagement with the computer is important for John. It’s really good to see everybody, to connect and make the music together. There are hundreds of thousands of people who are in the same boat as us who might feel lonely and isolated and their conditions may have got worse as a result. We’d urge them to go onto the Music for Dementia  website and find out how to make the most of music during this time.  Music for Dementia  – a campaign backed by broadcaster Lauren Laverne to get more access to music for the , people living with dementia in the UK – has launched a new Musical Guide for those experiencing heightened anxiety during the lockdown. And more and more people are now using Music for Dementia ’s Musical Map, which gives information about online services for those with dementia, as well as taking advantage of Dementia Discos and live streamed events. It comes amid reports that UK care homes are in danger of being overwhelmed by the coronavirus with staff warning they are at “breaking point”. Lauren Laverne said: We’ve already seen how music has played a vital role in keeping people’s spirits up across the world during isolation. It echoes exactly what the Music for Dementia  campaign has been saying - although the feeling of isolation is an ongoing situation for people with this condition. For people living with dementia, music is a leline to connect in a way that nothing  can. Don Leitch, , of Royston, Hertfordshire, has been living with dementia for seven years and has been separated from his daughter, Caroline, due to the coronavirus. Caroline, , would see her dad at least once a week before the lockdown and pick him up from his home to accompany him to weekly music sessions run by a local group Together In Sound. She said: Music therapy is one of the very few positive things added to his le since being diagnosed with dementia. My dad has lost a lot but this one positive thing that has been added, and brought us closer together. In the car on the way there, I’ll play the music he likes listening to. He loves The Shadows. Caroline explained they are join each other and other people living with dementia for online sessions – which have been just as much of a relief to her as it has to her dad. Many music organisations have already made their services available digitally and these are being added to Music for Dementia ’s digital Musical Map, an advice hub of virtual events and activities that people living with dementia can participate in. Examples of online music events include The London Symphony Orchestra, now streaming online-concerts and The Sofa Singers, a new weekly online event which sees  people come together for a -minute rehearsal where they learn a classic song and sing it together. Music for Dementia  is urging music services that are moving online to get in touch, so they can be added to Musical Map.

It also warns that many of these workers are ineligible for Government wage subsidy schemes, and could be forced onto benefits unless a bigger safety net is created.Speaking to the Sun, the thinktankaposs head of economics Alfie Stirling said: “Despite the Government’s interventions to protect jobs and pay, millions could face the prospect of relying on benefits for the first time. “But Universal Credit payments are insufficient to meet basic living costs. Having made welcome moves to prevent job losses, government must now turn to strengthening the UK’s safety net as well. Follow the latest coronavirus updates here“If not, we risk consigning millions to the poverty trap through no fault of their own — a trap that many may struggle to break out of.” A new report by the NEF has identied four groups of workers who are at the highest risk of ending up jobless. They include those on fixed-term contracts, zero-hours contracts, part-time workers and the self-employed. Although Chancellor Rishi Sunik has announced a multibillion pound package of support for self-employed workers, which will pay a grant worth % of earnings, this money will not be available until June. It is feared that this will come too late for many smaller businesses and freelance workers. Of the .m employees at risk of ending up jobless, some .m work in industries that have been forced to close due to social distancing rules, such as restaurants and shops. The NEF has urged the Chancellor to guarantee a minimum income of £ for all working-age adults, rather than forcing millions to apply for Universal Credit. It comes as separate research has found that coronavirus has wiped out any hope of “levelling up” the UK, with the crisis set to hit the north hardest economically. Analysis from the Learning and Work Institute suggests that the gains of five years of jobs growth – during which employment increased to a record high – have been reversed in just one month. The thinktank’s report warns that despite the measures put in place by government to protect jobs, unemployment is set to rise further and faster than during any recession on record.

The -year-old, who is currently residing in Windsor Castle, also receives a royal red box each day - except on Christmas Day and Easter Sunday - full of crucial documents, which she meticulously analyses.The box contains all the latest information about what is happening in Parliament and around the world, including updates on the coronavirus pandemic. And before social distancing came into force, the Queen met Prime Minister Boris Johnson every week to find out what is going on in government.Now with Mr Johnson recovering from coronavirus, having been in intensive care, the Queen is still kept in the loop thanks to three senior civil servants who are known as the aposGolden Triangleapos, according to her former Communications Secretary. Simon Lewis OBE said the trio are made up of Sir Mark Sedwill, the Cabinet Secretary, Peter Hill, the Prime Ministeraposs Principal Private Secretary and Sir Edward Young, who is the Private Secretary to the Queen. Mr Lewis, who was also Downing Streetaposs Director of Communications for a year when Gordon Brown was Prime Minister, told the BBC the Queen will be in regular contact with her aposGolden Triangleapos who keep her abreast of Mr Johnsonaposs health and progress. Explaining how the communication works he said: We donapost have a presidential system, we have a system of collective government - Itaposs a really important distinction. Iaposm sure Buckingham Palace will want to be kept informed during this period, but they wouldnapost wish to get involved in any decisions around the politics clearly. But that golden triangle, as it is called, the Cabinet Secretary, The Prime Ministeraposs principal Private Secretary and the Private Secretary to the Queen, will be in constant touch.  Thataposs really important because that is a very key lexis in the constitution and frankly we donapost have a written constitution. So none of this is codied, itaposs all on the basis precedent and whataposs gone on before, which is okay. But I think there is an argument for codying some of these issues as we go forward because this is new ground that is being broken. Iaposm sure that regular contact between the palace and number  is ongoing.  Meanwhile, the Queenaposs TV address on Sunday was only the fth time she has done a televised broadcast outside of Christmas. She delivered her message in Windsor Castleaposs White Drawing Room, with just one camera operator who was dressed in full protective equipment. She praised the NHS and other key workers for all they are doing at this dficult time, and thanked people who are staying home and not seeing their loved ones in a bid to stop the spread.

Her Majesty is keen to ensure Princess Charlotte and Prince Louis, the youngest children of Kate Middleton and Prince William, donapost miss out during the Covid- lockdown. Louis will turn two on April , while Charlotte will celebrate her fth birthday on May . And it is believed the Queen, , who is said to have become rather tech-savvy of late, is planning to celebrate their special days using video conferencing. It comes as the country is in the midst of a coronavirus lockdown, with no end seemingly in sight, so by the time the two youngstersapos birthdays arrive the Royals will probably still be unable to see each other. The youngsters, as well as big brother Prince George, have already been sending aposchatty videosapos to keep in touch with their grandad Prince Charles, as well as the Queen, who they affectionately call aposGan Ganapos. Royal expert Angela Mollard told the ROYALS podcast: So little Prince Louis is turning two on April . Then Charlotte turns five on May .  So, within a week and a bit of each other two of them will be having birthdays. Obviously, they won’t be able to have friends over. Knowing Kate, she would have a whole schedule of party type things to do.  She continued: Remember her parents run a party planning company. I imagine Carole Middleton, because she can’t see the children, has got all these things sorted. Of course, they still have plenty of staff to make birthday cakes and help construct party poppers.  I don’t think the poor Cambridge children will be doing without. They just obviously will not have their friends.

Most pupils have not been allowed toto schools which were closed on March  - with the exception of those with key worker parents. But Whitehall officials are now hoping that students in key years groups couldto lessons in early summer, according to reports. A senior Government source told Theyesterday: “It would be betterthey could come back after the half-term break in the summer, but of course that does have to be led by the science. “Eventhey did come back you would need to have social distancing, and that is hard to do in a class of . That would mean you couldn’t have everyone back at the same time. “You would need to focus on the key year groups, such as Year  and Year .” Experts advising the government have said that social distancing measures, such as working from home, may need to stay in place indefinitely to prevent new waves of infections after the current lockdown is relaxed.Officials have said that Brits may not be able toto normal le until a coronavirus vaccine is available next year.Patrick Roach, the new general secretary of the NASUWT, said a number of teachers on the front line are calling for access to PPE and Covid- testing as they are concerned about the health of their families. He said Government advice suggesting that teachers do not need personal protective equipmentwhen working in schools during the Covid- outbreak is dodgy and unhelpful.  He also urged the Government not to rush to reopen schools to all pupils until teachers had been properly consulted on the process as he warned that learning could be compromised.

Her team is one of dozens worldwide who have been racing to find a way to immunise people against the devastating flu-like virus.Health experts believe that coronavirus mutates at a slower rate than other respiratory viruses, particularly flu.This has led to hopes that once a jab is widely available it will provide protection against the highly contagious Covid- and any further strains which develop, for several years.

The measures, which prevent people from leaving home in all but limited circumstances, were due to expire on Easter Sunday. But Leo Varadkar said the advice from Irelandaposs national public health emergency team was to extend the restrictions until Tuesday May . He said the Government had accepted that advice and added nobody knows for certain when the lockdown could be brought to an end. Mr Varadkar thanked Irish people for the their forbearance and said every sacrice they were making was saving lives. Because the vast majority of people have heeded the advice of the experts we have been able to interrupt the spread of the virus, we have been able to shelter the most vulnerable and protect them, he said. Your sacrices are making a dference, we have slowed the spread of the virus considerably but unfortunately we have not stopped its spread. Mr Varadkar added: We all know people who are suffering and grieving at this time, too many have died and sadly more will die and get sick before this is over. So todayaposs message is that we cannot be complacent and we cannot lose focus. What weaposre doing is dficult, but it is making a dference and we have to keep going. We need to persevere and we need to maintain our discipline and resolve.  The restrictions we introduced two weeks ago were set to expire on Sunday. Today, the expert recommendation is to extend them for a further three weeks until Tuesday May . The Government has accepted this recommendation.As of Thursday, the coronavirus death toll in Ireland stood at , with , confirmed cases of the virus since the outbreak began.The current restrictions were ordered by the Government on March . They were initially in place for a two-week period ending on Easter Sunday. Experts have credited the social distancing measures with signicantly flattening the curve of the virusaposs spread. The day-on-day growth rate of Covid- has dropped from more than % to %.  The reproductive rate, the number of people infected by each infected person, had also fallen signicantly, from around four at the beginning of the outbreak to close to one. Under the restrictions, people have been ordered to remain in their homes in all but a limited set of specic circumstances. The circumstances include travelling to or from work deemed to be essential, food shopping, medical appointments, brief exercise, farming activity and vital family reasons. People who do leave their homes for exercise are prevented from travelling beyond a km radius from their homes. All people over the age of , and other people considered vulnerable to the disease, have been told to cocoon and not leave home at all. All non-essential surgery, health procedures and other non-essential health services have been postponed.  All public and private gatherings of any number of people outside a single household or living unit have been prohibited for the last two weeks and social visits to relatives beyond the family unit at home have not been allowed. The Taoiseach continued: I know many of us would like to know when things will go back to normal and le will be as it was. We are working towards that time. The Taoiseach continued: I know many of us would like to know when things will go back to normal and le will be as it was. We are working towards that time.

I willto the stage and you will listen until I am finished.’“They did exactly as he said. No-one exited to go the toilet or asked for the bar during his performance.”The overwhelming majority of audience members at comedy shows are courteous and they have certainly been spoiled for choice at the Caird in the last  years.Home-grown favourite Frankie Boyle, Have I Got News for You star Paul Merton and Irish funnyman Dara O’Briain would be among the dozens to bring headline shows to the city centre in the st century.In , Sarah Millican made history, as she became the first female stand-up to headline a show at the Caird.That year would also mark a bittersweet moment for Susan as Billy Connolly gave his Dundee swansong.But as Susan recalls, the Big Yin managed to steal the show  hours before he was due to bow out.She added: “The night before his show, Jake Bugg was appearing and Billy came along with his daughter.“I got them discreetly seated in the balcony, got back downstairs and the fire alarm was activated. It was full evacuation.“By the time I got back to the balcony for Billy, the house lights were up full and instead of leaving the building the standing stalls audience were applauding Billy.“It was so lovely but we had to move quickly.”The following year would mark another milestone for comedy.Kevin Bridges would storm his way into Caird Hall folklore in  by selling out five shows in a row, a record run for the iconic venue.Almost  years have passed since Bob Hope first strode onto the Caird’s floorboards and set the standard for the stellar quality of comics to follow.The acts that have passed through the doors since would make up a hall of fame of stand-up comedy.A gut-busting night of hilarity seems a distant prospect in the midst of the current pandemic.Rest assured, the Caird Hall will be there to bring back the sounds of laughter.

This has been dficult to accept.“The SPFL board and executive freely admit that they focused on the sporting merit of the proposal and did not take into consideration any financial fall out to their member clubs.“Fundamentally, we believe that in these exceptional and uncertain times, no member club should be worse off as a result of this proposal than they are today.“The current proposal will see member clubs cumulatively have in the region of £.-£ million pounds of lost revenue.“Amongst the member clubs there have been numerous discussions of the SPFL’s offer as well as viable, equitable proposed alternatives that could see, potentially, a neutral outcome for all clubs involvedthe season cannot be finished.“In all cases, current placement monies could be distributed to the member clubs in very short order while maintaining all SPFL obligations.“Make no mistake we would have to work quickly and diligently to ensure that members’ current needs are met and that the democratic process is followed, but it is achievable.”An SPFL spokesperson added: “It is very important that clubs consider carefully the resolution and we are grateful to those clubs who have voted already.“With the Ladbrokes Premiership and Ladbrokes Leagues One and Two isions each having approved the resolution, we await the voting slip from the one Ladbrokes Championship club that has yet to vote.“We will provide an update as soon as we are in a position to do so.”The SPFL set an initial deadline of pm for clubs to vote.However it is understood league rules give members  days to vote on resolutions – and Dundee are keen to weigh up their options.It is believed Partick Thistle and Inverness Caley Thistle were the two Championship sides to vote against the plan.As a result, Dundee appear to be in a position to set whichever agenda they please in negotiations with the SPFL.🔵 In these troubled times, when many people are struggling to get out for their paper, we are pledging to help readers by providing a FREE digital edition of the Eveningfor three months.

I was free to talk to clubs.“I spoke to Mark McGhee at Motherwell and Gus MacPherson at St Mirren.“The chance to go to England and play for that club [Coventry] came up and it was a no-brainer really.“My agent and I sat down…we didn’t need to think about it.“There were other reasons why it was more beneficial for me – you’re trying to make a living in your career.“I had three top-flight teams up here who I had the chance to go to.“Lee Wilkie was at Dundee United at the time.

I was desperate to just get in and experience it.“But it got to the point that Michael O’Neill heard I could play with Northern Ireland [through a Coleraine-born grandparent].“He called Allan Preston [football agent] and Alan called me.“I said, ‘Can you ask Craig what the chances with Scotland would be ’ To be fair to Craig, he said, ‘I’d never say it’s a definite no buthe’s got the chance to play international football then I’d take it’.“Without saying ‘definitely no’, he definitely did say no!“I’ve still got mixed emotions about it. My dad wasn’t too sure, he didn’t want me to do it.“Other people advised me to do it and I had some great trips. I got one cap but I was in the squad seven or eight times.“Getting to train with people like Jonny Evans, Steven Davis…I loved the training and I loved the trips.“I would’ve liked to get more game time but it was causing a problem to my back and ultimately that’s why I stopped.”He made his Northern Ireland debut in a - hammering at the hands of the Netherlands on June , , just weeks after his Hibs side were beaten - by Hearts in the Scottish Cup Final.McPake – who came up against Dutch stars Arjen Robben, Wesley Sneijder and Robin van Persie – said: “It wasn’t like a normal friendly, it was mayhem.“The Amsterdam Arena was packed. I’m looking at it and going, ‘Wow’.“I think in that two weeks, with the Scottish Cup Final and then that game, I got beat - on aggregate.“I had a week in Dubai between that so I suppose that makes up for it.”McPake is approaching six years at Dens Park, after initially joining as a player in May , and he didn’t envisage such a long spell at the club.He said: “If I did, I’d be living in Dundee or somewhere around about there. I often say that to Dawn [we]. I love it up there.“In terms of players, Cammy [Kerr] was there – he was only a young boy.

It would be our intention,the season is brought to an early conclusion, where practical, to reimburse those season ticket holders for the remainder of the season that was not played.  This will be further assessed for timelines, etc., as we make our way through the claims process. We have often said that the club is a family and that remains true throughout this situation.In addition to our insurance coverage, we have also sought to access ious sources of support offered by the League, the Association, Government agencies and our associates.  All that have been involved have been extremely helpful in our solidication of the club as a business.  I would like to personally thank John Bennett for his very generous and selfless gesture of suspending rent on the stadium. His call, on day one of this crisis helped to set the tone for all that followed throughout this shutdown and is the epitome of showing how we are all in this together.The UK Government and its agencies have also been extremely helpful in the offering of grants loans and providing relief through the Job Retention Scheme.  That includes HMRC. It is our experience, thus far, that this country’s handling of the crisis exceeds others in the mitigation of losses for businesses as well as iniduals.  In the coming days we will be implementing elements of the job retention scheme in respect of our staff and it is our intention that all are looked after fully throughout this crisis. This includes our football players, football staff and administrative staff receiving full pay while they are on furlough for the foreseeable future.We also think it is right to give credit to the dedicated workers at the SPFL and SFA. They have been working in an ever-changing landscape throughout this unprecedented event. They have continued to keep us informed and provide us advice on how to best navigate this predicament. They have freely shared the advice and guidance they are receiving from the government and UEFA as we all feel our way through these weeks. We continue to take advice and express our opinions on what football should look like when football resumes. Although none of us know yet what will transpire with this season, it is clear that football will be back.We’ve been inundated with requests on how people can help the club.  It’s truly been heart-warming. The one way to helpyou can – and onlyyou can # is to purchase season tickets and merchandise online.  We still have limited availability of this year’s Third Strip, which may become a collector’s item as it may never be worn.This supports the club as well as SSAFA and The Black Watch Association charities.  We will soon be launching our - kit in the upcoming days and we know it’s not enough to completely fill your appetite for football, but keep an eye on the social media sites for Dundee FC and DFC in the Community, which will provide some entertainment while we all do our part to save lives by staying home.We wish we had something more definitive to say, but we hope this brief update will provide some reassurance that we are still here and will remain here when this crisis is over.

That goes for the clubs, too.That’s why I’m not surprised both the Dark Blues and the Tangerines have opted to use the government’s furlough scheme – they are businesses and they have to do what is

footballers earn millions of pounds.Boys playing for clubs like Dundee or United or St Mirren, Hamilton etc are not earning fortunes and they have bills to pay like everybody .I think everyone should be doing their bit to help during the coronavirus pandemic, whether that’s through paying taxes or some sort of voluntary work, but it seems like footballers have been called out because they are an easy target.There are plenty of people across the country earning big bucks but not getting hammered.A better way to go about it would have been to say to players exactly what their club needs to save and to give an option to donate part of their salary to the NHS.It seems a weekly occurrence at the moment that we see an SPFL meeting as the time decisions will finally be made.I’m not holding my breath too much for this one tomorrow but you never know.I saw Celtic put out they want to finish the season but they are in a position where they can take the high ground.Everyone has their own agenda but what we really need, what clubs and players need, is some idea of how Scottish football will continue.Cheering on the Virtual Grand National over the weekend was about as close to sporting excitement as you can get at the moment.I didn’t have much luck in my sweepy – my virtual horse fell over a virtual hurdle#"},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2020/04/92354387_1011646992562892_7719572959957876736_n-e1586539337459.jpg ","title":"local artist crates fairy doors trail for local children","story":"A Tayside artist is hoping to sprinkle some fairy dust on the lives of local children stuck indoors because of the lockdown.Gill Hastie, , from Invergowrie, has created a fairy door trail around the local area to give children a fun activity to do on their daily exercise, while keeping a safe distance from others.She was helped by her children, including nine-year-old daughter Breagha, who came up with some of the door design ideas, and there are now around  for kids to find.She said: #We have placed these around Invergowrie and it#s giving local children and their families something to get out in the fresh air and look for. vw, px\"  #I also hope that it#s leading to creativity among others and as well as giving them a walk in the fresh air leads them also to think of ways they can spend their time during lockdown.#I#m also thinking about putting some blank doors around so that anyone finding them can design their own fairy door.# vw, px\"  Gill also painted  shells in rainbow colours, and has now scattered them around the area, for people to collect or leave as they see fit.She said: #I got the idea from a friend and painted around  rainbow shells.#I realise that people are struggling in these dficult times and the idea was to leave the shells around so that they could give a wee bit of hope to anyone who found them.#Gill said that so far her shells and doors had been very well received locally and she was  planning to create and distribute more fairy doors and increase the trail.She said thatit got to the stage where the trail could make any money, it would be donated to a local charity.#This has been something lighthearted and inexpensive to do at this time and I hope it#s spreading a little happiness and joy,# she added."},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/09/DNic_Taw_Teams_Podcast-7-846x564.jpg ","title":"podcast twa teams one

As we stood about on deck while the dishes were being washed a boy from one of the motor boats passed in his dinghy. He was wearing blue shorts and red stockings which brought from the Pilot the remark: #In Brodickyou don’t wear red stockings you might just as well be in Lamlash.#All but the Skipper and Mate went ashore on Centre Island for a stroll. The Major was still completely paralysed in his hind quarters but he was full of spirit and when the Bosun held up his hind legshe galloped along. It was a quiet peaceful evening with a very light northerly breeze but it was distinctly chilly and there was a magnicentsomewhat lurid sunset. The shore party back aboard the Bosun took the Tar off in the dinghy and they landed on Eilean na Beithe and while the former explored the island the latter played on a shingly shore – it was long after dark when they ed.At half past ten we began to turn in and, as always on the first evening, this was a longer business then usual as pillows and blankets had to be allocated and pillowslips put on but by a quarter past eleven we were all in bed and shortly after that a light shower pattered on the deck. The problem of what to do with the Doctor’s mattress was solved by the Pilot double banking his bunk. We were all very glad to have had such a good day for the start.It was noticed that voices were still coming from the ladies’ cabin when the last of us in the main cabin fell asleep.The Tanky brought an innovation to the Fulmar # #Quickies# # a patent washing gadget that saved precious water.We had a dead quiet night with, as far as any of us knew, no rain but the forecast was not good, promising north to north-east winds, force  to  with frequent heavy showers. The glass had continued its steady drop. When we turned out, a light but cold north wind was blowing from a well broken up sky.We had a breakfast of bacon and eggs then the Bosun took the Major ashore for his walk. The latter was possibly a little better and was able to take a few steps on the deck, but ashore on the rough ground could do nothing. While they were ashore the big motor boat with the red-stockinged boy left after very nearly going ashore on Seil Island while getting his anchor aboard.At twenty past ten we were away under engine, but as soon as we were outside the sails went up to the north-easterly breeze and we set off for the Sound of Mull. There was no sign of the swell that is usually met south of Kerrera and we got along quite well, but we could not point any higher than a mile or so south of Loch Don. The Pilot went below and brewed a welcome cup of tea which warmed us up, then we took a tack right up to the south coast of Kerrera and had a close up view of Gylen Castle and the Skipper waxed historical.Putting about again we passed close south of the Potlid Island, but when we were about halfway across to Loch Don the wind died and the strong ebb began to force us south and about the same time the rain came on.The engine was started and we headed up for Duart, but our progress was pitully slow, and indeed at one period we but barely held our ground. The Lady Rock and Lismore Lighthouse seemed never to get any nearer closing. When the engine had run an hour we waited for the first sign of the old familiar falter but none came and we began to hope a cure for its stopping had been effected by replacing the HT coil.This change was a despairing effort made because it was the only thing we had not tried, though all the pundits declare it could not possibly be the cause. The engine would either go or not go, they said, and it would never startthe coil was defective. We got one scare when it staggered for a moment, but the Bosun, who was at the tiller at the time, said we had just passed though a big mass of floating seaweed and may have got some round our propeller.As we were to prove later the cure had been found and the engine ran impeccably all the cruise and the Skipper had a lot of unkind thoughts about all the many professional motor experts who had caused him a great deal of trouble, not a little acute anxiety and more than considerable expense through their failure to diagnose a not very obscure disease.As we came up to the Black Memorial Tower Leonora crossed our bows making for Oban and another yachtpassed close by south bound under engine though by this time quite a reasonable and, for then, favourable breeze was blowing from the north-east and our sails were drawing.We learnt later that the owner’s we would not allow a sail to be set under any conditions as long as she was aboard – a pity, we thought, as she certainly was a lovely job and we felt it would have been betterthe we had decided to stay ashore.At Duart we stopped the engine and were able to make good progress, but the rain got heavier and heavier and our sandwich lunch was taken below in relays. Then at about three with the turn of the tide the wind died completely and the engine was started again. Near the Grey Rocks we saw St Roma coming south under power so we altered course to intercept her then at slow speed turned back the way we had come for a few hundred yards while we exchanged news.We heard a thoroughly bad forecast at mid-day, the wind had gone, the rain was stotting in the glassy sea, and, though the glass had come back only a fraction, we decided to call it a day so, with the Bosun the only dissentient, made for Loch Aline. As we turned inshore at Ardtornish we saw Seewolf to the north of us, becalmed but heading south, and guessed she would be joining us later. Coming in, when between Morven Pier and the Ferry Pier, the Skipper held too close to the west shore and the bottom showed up suddenly far too clearly for our peace of mind and a quick sheer out was necessary.Through the narrows we turned to starboard and anchored at half past four in Kyle Bay in a flat calm and the rain coming down heavier than ever. Gratefully we realised that it was not quite as bitterly cold as it had been out in the Sound.Seewolf came in shortly after going very slowly and Hamish Lawrence called over that he had run a big end and was on his way to Oban for repairs and to hand over to brother Alec and his family. Soon after that we were joined by a small motor boat, Saguenay, flying a blue ensign which, in view of her size, the Skipper was sure she was not entitled to do and then a little later, while we were warming up with some coffee, Lindisfarne arrived and anchored close beside us with Guy Clephane in his usual tremendousform – he’s a proper marvel is Guy.Hamish Lawrence came across in his dinghy and came aboard for a gin and while he was there Guy called over inviting Tanky and the Pilot across to Lindisfarne then sent the Pilot back to Fulmar to fetch the Bosun. Hamish gone, the Skipper began to put nine inch tacklines into our line of flags as we had discovered at Rothesay at the Royal Clyde Centenary Regatta that without them our line was about fteen feet too short and we wanted them to be right for the Queen’s visit to Tobermory.When the Pilot came back he and the Bosun got the tents up as the rain was by then torrential.We had a supper of sausages and beans and while the dishes were being done the Bosun took the Major ashore. He was walking a little bettervery slowly, but there was, unfortunately, no concrete results from his exercise.At nine o’clock we went in two loads across to Seewolf and were offered drinks OR tea, but the Skipper insisted on both. We were, however, not allowed any biscuits with our tea as to have them would have meant opening a new box and broaching Alec Lawrence’s stores. The Tanky had not wanted anything but tea, but Hamish had given her a good strong gin which she tried to hide on a shelf behind her and it was only got rid of when the Pilot took it off her hands and quickly put it to its proper use. The Bosun was drinking beer and when he opened up the tin a goodly portion of it bubbled onto the fitted carpet in the cabin.On board Seewolf were, besides the two paid hands, Hamish’s mother and his two sisters. The old lady, well over eighty, was in grand form and waxed eloquent on #The old days# and the greatness of #Belshaft#. Also on board was a great big collie who was obviously petted and spoilt beyond measure and he behaved more like a lap dog than the great big clumsy creature he was.It was half past eleven before we went back to Fulmar all in one load with little enough freeboard for the dinghy considering the conditions. There was a nasty little lop on the water, the northerly wind was bitterly cold, and the rain was as heavy as ever. As quickly as possible we got below and into our warm bunks, not even the Bosun wasting any time about it, though he did read for some time after all the rest were sound asleep."},{"url":null,"title":"bobcast podcast episode 10 nessie and the lost golf balls","story":"The Oban TimesUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsWelcome to Episode  of the Oban Time#s BOBcast.Charting Bob#s progress  and discussing lots of things golfare  presenters Stephen Day, George Graham, Martin Laing and Keith McIntyre.

As part of this project the fund provided MACPool with seven aqua cycles and training from Hydrorider.Arriving early to take photogaphs of the others giving these bikes a go, any sense of nervousness was set aside as I watched healthcare professionals and fitness and well-being enthusiasts laugh and chat through their shot.After some quick adjustments to the bikes June, from our advertising department, and I were raring to go.Partially submerged, the feeling of being weightless combined with the resistance of the water as we began peddling was initially a bit odd. As we got used to the feeling, we started to speed things up, pretending we were racing the rest of our group to The Cairnbaan for a gin and tonic.Finding our rhythm, instructor Kathryn Craig began to lead us through arm exercises. Our co-ordination was put to the test as we carried on cycling while doing simple arm movements that felt more impactive due to the water resistance. Then for the real challenge # floating off the back of the bike while continuing to pedal – not an easy taskyou are short-legged but a workout that feels like it is doing you the power of good.For me aqua cycling is everything I hoped it would be – a fun, impactiveand enjoyable way of exercising. And I could still walk after it!With no aches and pains the next day and still smiling, I signed up for some of the classes.Classes y in intensity and are currently running on Tuesdays from .-.pm, Wednesday evenings from .-.pm and Saturdays from  .-.am.

Included in this is the Isle of Jura.This is as shockingly reckless as it is offensive.The Isle of Jura is not a #bolthole# as the Daily Mail has chosen to state but a very beautul island steeped in culture and rich history.On both Jura and Islay we, like so many rural areas, are struggling to deal with all of the challenges related to the Corona virus out break. Our local health services have very limited resources as it is, along side a population that has many elderly residents who are more at risk to the virus.We have seen a local uptick in people traveling to Islay in camper vans and this is happening at a time when the UK government is advising against non essential travel.Those who are choosing to travel to our islands of Islay, Jura and the many other islands in Argyll and Bute in order to avoid the coronavirus may end up inadvertently spreading it to islands who arenot as much affected in the same way as so many built up urban areas are. Such actions are as reckless as they are selfish and I would implore people who do not need to travel to our rural constituency to avoid doing so until this global pandemic has passed.Jura, Islay and the rest of Argyll are some of the most beautul places you will ever visit and you won#t find an area where the people are more hospitable and friendly but while this crisis is ongoing I would ask everyone who is not currently living here to avoid traveling here for the time being.Councillor Alastair Redman # Kintyre and Islands ward.To the Scottish public,During this time of unprecedented uncertainty, we are all concerned about the safety and wellbeing of our families, friends and colleagues.Our hearts go out to those who have been affected personally by the outbreak of coronavirus , as well as the many communities around the world that are facing extreme measures in an attempt to slow its spread.We appreciate and are mindful of the challenges iniduals are currently facing as well as the impact this pandemic has had on our vital emergency services as well as the grocery retail sector, supply chain and producers.Like our retail partners, we want to take this opportunity to assure you that Scottish farmers, auctioneers, hauliers, processors and butchers are doing everything they can to maintain the ongoing availability of fresh, locally sourced Scotch Beef PGI, Scotch Lamb PGI and Specially Selected Pork.We would like to thank all those who work in the Scottish red meat industry and their families for their ongoing and unwavering efforts to keep our supermarket shelves and butcher shops stocked, fuelling Scotland with top-quality red meat during this challenging time.As bodies supporting the Scottish agricultural and red meat industry, we are constantly reviewing the developing situation and are doing all we can to support everyone involved in putting nutritious food on your plates.Alan Clarke, chief executive, Quality Meat ScotlandMartin Morgan, executive manager, Scottish Association of Meat Wholesalers Duncan Todd, secretary, Scottish Beef Association Jen Craig, president, National Sheep Association Scotland Penny Montgomerie, chief executive, Scottish Association of Young Farmers Clubs and Gordon King, executive manager, Scottish Craft Butchers.What on earth is going on  It was banal enough when Ben Goldsmith # English financier and environmentalist # tweeted that #overgrazing# by upland sheep farmers, was responsible for the devastating floods in South Wales, rather than record-breaking torrential rainfall.Unbelievably we now have a government official, Dr Tim Leunig, suggesting the whole of the UK does not need farming, and his comparison of the UK to Singapore in this context is absolutely ludicrous. You truly have to wonderthere is something in the water that he is drinking – could it be flood contamination Surely, every person having a full and ing set of neurons and synapses, the complete opposite is the truth, as we dearly need our hard working farming community.The UK Government should be fully supporting the farming industry and indeed, good land management. The Welsh Assembly has totally lost its way with its mindless policy of devastating Welsh forests with thousands and thousands # an understatement # of trees being felled for wind farms, and compounding the felony by covering acres of land with very limited electricity generating solar parks # Wales is not the Sahara and the sun disappears at night! Solar  will generate about  per cent of their maximum capacity in the UK.Returning to farming perhaps some kind person should tell Dr Tim Leunig that the answer lies in the soil and then lead him to a darkened and quiet room so he can lie down and contemplate the truth # wise men recognise that truth is the daughter of time, not of authority.Dave Haskell, Cardigan."},{"url":null,"title":"the voyages of the fulmar part 10","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsWhat a night! All of us were agreed that never had we experienced anywhere a worse one and we were glad we had been in Loch Aline on Sunday night not in Tobermory as intended as, from what we heard, that night had been similar but twice as bad.It was a wild night lashing with rain and a big swell was rolling in from the north-east causing us to pitch and roll horribly. Everything banged and rattled and the ropes, despite their lashings, slapped on the mast, the chain rugged continuously on the bobstay, and there was one most annoying thump that kept everyone awake .We could not trace its origin until in desperation the Pilot donned oilskins, sou’wester and seaboots, and went on deck and found it was the tiller end bumping on the bulwarks. The Pilot had a very justiable grouse about this as he had suggested lashing the tiller, but the Skipper had said that he did not think it necessary and that we would lie easierit was allowed to go free.About six we heard Murdoch in Venture hailing us and the Skipper and Pilot hurried on deck. The yachts in the harbour were all lying higgledy-piggledy owing to the swell, to there being little or not wind, to the strong surface current from the swollen river, and to it being about the turn of the tide.Venture and Fulmar were lying stern to stern and what had aroused Murdoch was that the Venture had got her mizzen boom over our main boom and as we pitched we had lted it up crutch and all – how nothing was broken was a miracle. She had then swung round and her now free boom had knocked the cap off our jackstay. As the Skipper came on deck Venture again surged towards us and started pitching and her counter came down with a terric slam not six inches from our bulwarks. We put our helm over and swung clear.Murdoch and Barclay were both in their dog-house and the Pilot and Skipper stayed in ours until the new tide took charge and the boats began to swing in normal fashion and all were able to retire once more to their bunks. Luckily the rain had cleared off shortly before this episode took place.At a quarter to eight we heard the usual poor forecast but for the first time since the cruise began there was not a gale warning for any area. The glass had risen well during the night. What wind there was was from the north-west.The Skipper went ashore for the milk and rolls. The dinghy had a lot of water in it and owing to the rolling it was impossible to get into it and balance on the thwarts till it was baled so the Skipper got his feet thoroughly soaked – the simple remedy of wearing seaboots had never occurred to him. Again the rolls were sold out and again he had to take porter biscuits.On board the Pilot lit the fire then started in to get our breakfast of bacon and egg. After our meal the sky cleared and it became a beautul sunny day, and everything we had was up on deck drying off or airing. The owner of Rose came alongside and for a good time tried to get us to persuade him to go north against his better judgement, but when we heard he had the lady member of his crew of three sick in her bunk our advice was that he go south and that immediately and reluctantly he was forced to agree and half an hour later he sailed. Hervor also went out about the same time and she turned north and we were to meet her later in Iona."},{"url":null,"title":"worldwide ceilidh community sign up for tunes in the hoose","story":"Fiona ScottUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsCapercaillie founder Martin MacLeod, originally from Oban, and his son, also Martin, have came up with an innovative way to connect musicians from all over the world and allow them to play together for the enjoyment of others.#Tunes in the Hoose# was inspired by Scottish musician, and family friend of the MacLeods, Peter Wood, who was posting videos of himself playing tunes in his home during self-isolation.Having saw the footage Martin senior, called his filmmaker son to askhe had the technology and know-how to put a video together of him playing along to Peter’s video.#I run my own production company based out of Glasgow, so it’s relatively straight forward work for me ,# said Martin Junior.#From that first successful attempt, our new idea was to create an online community for all Scottish musicians to help them connect and continue to play together during these uncertain times.#Housed in Facebook, Tunes in the Hoose amassed over  followers last week with ,+ views worldwide.

Almost nobody has been untouched by it, although for some it has been more cataclysmic than others. But we are in this together, and it will be together that we pull through it.One of the real heartbreaking consequences of the lockdown has been the separation of families. Many grandparents now cannot see their grandchildren, or even their own children. Family of people who are ill cannot visit their loved ones. Each story has its own set of circumstances and sadly more is to come before it gets better.While we do need light-heartedness at this time, itrsquos also really important to acknowledge peoplersquos struggles. It was with gut-wrenching despair I realised a number of weeks ago that the arrival of Covid- in Europe was going to seriously affect so many families, my own included.I have five children, but my middle child, who is now  years old, has for the last eight years shared time between Scotland and Sweden.She went to school here until she was seven, when she began to attend school in Sweden. It was then that I had to adjust to the painful reality of less time with her, although I was still able to maintain regular time with her in Scotland and of course keep in daily touch.Itrsquos been an emotional rollercoaster, in which I have stories of me sleeping at airports, travelling through Scandinavian landscape at ungodly hours, and along the way meeting people who have helped and made a real dference. But itrsquos been worth it as it meant our blended family remained connected and my daughter hasnrsquot felt ided between two families but rather a full part of both.We were due to travel to Sweden this Friday andlater, but of course the flights were cancelled a couple of weeks ago. Explaining this to my daughter, and then not being able to say when we would be together was heartbreaking. I felt so helpless, unable to comfort her. Wersquod all counted down the days and now it seems it may be weeks, even months, before any reunion will be possible.I know that there will be families in similar or worse situations. My heart goes out to them all. My initial response to my situation was to close down with despair. The idea of not being with my child, for whom I was the equal main carer until recently, feels unbearable. Some friends have said, with good intentions: ldquoAt least shersquos safe.Yes she is, and I give thanks for that. But any loving parent facing long-term enforced separation from their child will understand the grief that such separation creates. It seeps into your being and makes it dficult to get through the day without having really dark moments. I tried to hide my emotions, but my loving and understanding we knows me too well yet she too felt helpless.There are moments in our lives when we are just overwhelmed by the impossibility of a situation and we just want to curl up and close down. I recently reached that point.Then my daughter asked me while we were talking online: ldquoI wish we could get a magic flying carpet or something dad, or ask the faeries to make a portal. She understood this wasnrsquot possible, but it was the wake-up call I needed. It made me realise I needed to get out of the pit of despair and, for her sake as well as mine, use my creativity to make that magic carpet, and that portal, to help us stay closely connected during this awful time.And the magic ingredient is stories. My daughter has always loved stories, and we have made many up together some of them have even been printed on this page. Now these stories help keep us connected and ease the pain of separation for us both.And so, with the help of technology, and, crucially, a good relationship with her mother, stories have begun to create a vital space for my daughter to be with her Scottish family, even when separated. We can all be together, even my grown-up daughters, who I miss even though they are isolating close by.We storytell to each other, make stories up and even share them in short films. Wee sister Skye, who is six and misses her sister like crazy, holds the tablet which she uses to speak to her, so they can be together while I tell stories and share riddles. We draw and add to the stories together, make fun dramas in which we film ourselves on phones acting out stories like Cinderella, and I have learnt to put wee films together which we can then watch together.Sharing stories like this has given extra meaning to our online communication. It takes us away from just asking ldquohow was your day  or ldquowhat did you do today  questions that often just seem to emphasise our current disconnection. Later, after this crisis is over, the wee films, the artwork and written stories will be memorabilia of this time our evidence that we remained close, even when forced apart.I write about this because I know there are parents and children out there in similarly dficult situations to say you are not alone in this and letrsquos be kind to each other and share the ways we keep ourselves connected. I also know others will have discovered better solutions, as Irsquom no technical wizard.Children are resilient, often more than their grown-ups are, but we need to help them manage this time emotionally, and when we canrsquot give them a hug or be physically with them in hard times, an inheritance of stories they can access can be a real support.I have often been less than enthusiastic about social media in the past, but right now people are discovering in this crisis it has become a leline in many ways.If you, or someone you know, are in a similar situation, please do get in touch. Letrsquos share our experiences, and understand that while we may be isolating, we are not alone."},{"url":null,"title":"european-stone-stacking-championships-dunbar-postponed","story":"The European Stone Stacking Championships were due to take place between April  and , with a place at the World Rock Stacking Championships in Texas next year up for grabs.However, James Craig Page, creator and director of the festival, broke the news that the event, like dozens of others across the county, had to be postponed amid concerns surrounding coronavirus.Mr Page said: ldquoIt has been postponed but we are very hopeful that we will find another venue or be able to go ahead at a dferent time.ldquoHowever, for the time being we have to postpone.This year would have marked the fth year a stone stacking event had taken place in Dunbar event.Each year, it attracts thousands of people to the area, as well as competitors from throughout Europe.Mr Page spoke to the Courier upon ing from the World Rock Stacking Championships in the USA last month.Initially, he was keen to see the European event, which takes place at Eye Cave Beach, off Bayswell Road, take place.However, upon ing to British shores, he became aware of the state of the global issue.Speaking to the Courier, he said: ldquoWe were just waiting for word and advice but it became apparent when I got back how bad things were and that we needed to put it on hold.ldquoWe donrsquot want to be taking any risks with anybodyrsquos health and wellbeing.

At a crucial time in the survival of the language, graduates have helped create a Gaelic speaking workforce that now holds key posts across a wide range of sectors in Scotland.Sabhal Mograver Ostaig is one of the key partners in fulfilling the governmentrsquos objectives in the National Gaelic Plan, which aims to increase the number of people speaking the language and accelerate the growth of Gaelic.Many people are keen to learn more about the language because of its rich culture and the college provides a wide range of short courses in Gaelic language, song and traditional music. Ceilidhs, workshops, conversation circles and music sessions all create an encouraging atmosphere that bring together students from  countries across five continents.As a modern, innovative college, Sabhal Mograver Ostaig has excellent learning resources on campus including an exceptional library collection, residential student accommodation, broadcast and recording facilities and a Gaelic medium childcare facility on site. It also has a growing international reputation for academic research.The college was founded on the principle of being part of the local and wider community and its activities are greatly enhanced by co-operative links, being home to a number of signicant national creative and cultural projects such as Tobar an Dualchais, Ainmean Agraveite na h-Alba and Cagravenan Graphics Studio.

It is one of the many canards which have debased social media in this crisis and turned Twitter into a pariah medium.What he told Philip Schofield on This Morning on March  was that ldquoone of the theories is that people should ldquotake it on the chin and not take measures to prevent the spread of the disease. He went on to say that this was not the Governmentrsquos policy, and that it was pursuing a ldquobalanced approach and taking measures to ldquoprotect the NHS.But that hasnrsquot stopped people saying it for him. It has become a political factoid, an article of faith that Mr Johnson, under the guidance of his dark amanuensis Dominic Cummings, has been pursuing a social Darwinist, survival-of-the-fittest approach to Covid-.Enough. Everyone with any decency should simply be wishing the Prime Minister and his pregnant partner, Carrie Symonds, well right now, following the lead of Nicola Sturgeon yesterday when she echoed the Get Well, Boris slogan.It could be any one of us in the next few weeks. This is a moment to reflect on the fragility of existence and the gt of being alive. For once, we really are all in this together.The only grain of truth in the ldquochin theory is that, as is widely known, Mr Johnson has tended to see illness as something other people get. He has famously robust good health and former advisers, like the journalist Guto Harri, say theyrsquove never seen him ill before.All the more reason to take this disease seriously. It doesnrsquot just kill the very old or those with medical issues. Even a fit, tennis-playing political leader in his prime has had to be placed in intensive care fighting for his le.This is not like a bad dose of flu, as President Trump unhelpfully suggested. Covid- mocks us because many carriers have mild symptoms or none at all. Then, after  days,the symptoms donrsquot go away it turns very nasty.There is so much we do not know about coronavirus. What we do know is that it is gendered ndash though not in the way we expect that word to be used. It seems to hit men very hard, and twice as many die of it. Women seem to have some form of genetic immunity.Either that or men just ldquodonrsquot look after themselves as some believe. That might actually be the case with Mr Johnson, since hersquos been under immense pressure over the past year: replacing Theresa May, renegotiating Brexit, then fighting a General Election.So, no one should be under any illusion that hersquoll be able tonormally any time soon. This raises dficult questions. Who in his Cabinet will have the authority to tell him that he canrsquot be allowed to take key decisions while his faculties are impaired Who exactly is in charge  The First Secretary, Dominic Raab, is formally chairing Cabinet committees. But that begs the question of who takes the final decisions. Where does the buck stop Someone has to balance the competing demands of the two front-line Cabinet ministers, Matt Hancock and Rishi Sunak. They have very dferent constituencies of interests. Mr Hancock is all about saving the NHS and avoiding immediate deaths Mr Sunak is about saving the economy, upon which just as many lives could ultimately depend.Who decides whether and for how long to renew the lockdown on Monday  It will almost certainly be continued, but should there be a provisional timetable for lting aspects of it, following Austria and Denmark Research led by Professor Russell Viner for University College London appears to show that keeping schools closed is of little use in halting the spread of coronavirus. Yet it damages the educational prospects of less-well-off children. Others disagree, including, it seems, Professor Neil Ferguson of the celebrated Imperial College report that prompted the lockdown last month.The minor scandal of the Scottish Chief Medical Officer, Dr Catherine Calderwood, breaking her own stay-at-home guidelines underlines the problem of compliance. For the comfortable middle classes, with gardens and nice homes, lockdown is tolerable but working-class families in small flats may find it unbearable.Then again, should the UK be encouraging the wearing of masks  Countries like Austria and Slovakia have made them compulsory. America is adopting masks on the grounds that it slows the spread of the disease. But the advice here is still that theyrsquore of little use.A broader question now there is a new Labour leader, is a government of national unity. Keir Starmer has clearly ordered his new shadow cabinet members to stop saying ldquowe were right and start talking constructively about how to revive a moribund economy when the lockdown is over.The Opposition has a crucial role to play in getting the Government to focus and be clear about what it is doing. But should there be a more formal arrangement, as in the Second World War when the then Labour leader Clement Attlee, was made Deputy Prime Minister It would mean the Opposition is bound by collective responsibility, and has to endorse the decisions made by Government in the next few weeks. On the other hand it would greatly enhance the political profile of the new Labour leader, and could provide a  on which Sir Keir could build a winning election campaign, in the way Attlee won the post-war General Election in .These are decisions that only a Prime Minister can make, for the simple reason that he will be required to accept the consequences. This is a desperate time for him and the country, as the death toll continues to rise.As I write, it seems that the PMrsquos condition is stable. Twitter aside, there has been a considerable degree of public sympathy for Mr Johnson. No one can be in any doubt that he feels our pain.

The wording is apparently so ldquocack-handed ndash the charityrsquos phrase ndash that recipients are misinterpreting it to mean they will not receive any medical helpthey contract the virus.This is not what the letter says, but it would be an easy mistake to make. Evenit were clear, it would still be upsetting. Signing a DNAR is almost as sure an indication that the end of the line is fast approaching as requesting the last rites. Often it is signed by those with power of attorney for elderly relatives who are no longer of sound mind. Brutal though it looks when expressed in cold print, the intention behind it is compassionate.At a certain stage of ill-health, the process of resuscitation can be harsh. It unnecessarily prolongs suffering rather than allowing someone who has suffered a cardiac arrest to slip away peacefully. In some circumstances, especially where the patient is extremely frail, resuscitation is the worst of all options. Hard though it is to accept, the prospect of death can come as a relief to some for whom there is no hope of recovery, and who are simply longing to be gone.But for many who received this bald DNAR request, that is not the case. Instead of being asked to speed up and simply medical bureaucracy, they needed reassurance that, should they fall ill with Covid , they will be treated like anyone . The only grey area is over what they wish done in the event they require resuscitation. In their thoughtless and insensitive mail-shot, doctors presumably have pre-selected those for whom they think a DNAR is in their best interests. But what a way to go about it. It brings to mind Treasure Island and the sinister Black Spot pressed into piratesrsquo hands, signying their imminent demise.Even worse is the case of a care home where some residents, who were mentally well, learned staff had signed these forms on their behalf. I would not wish to be the manager should anyonersquos otherwise robust existence end prematurely because of a legally binding instruction they knew nothing about.What all this points to is troubling. There has been much trumpeting about the ways in which communities are pulling together under lockdown, growing stronger and kinder because of the strain on those who are least able to help themselves. Despite this, however, there is an insidious undercurrent to some discussions, a faint suggestion that the aged are in danger of being perceived as a nuisance, a drain on limited resources that are better used for the young. The tenor of recent government guidelines appears to hint that when people reach a certain vintage they should expect less heroic or interventionary treatment, and accept thatthings take a turn for the worst, their time is up.When new guidance was issued to medics by the former Chief Medical Officer Catherine Calderwood last week, Dr Donald Macaskill, chief executive of Care Scotland, was perturbed at its implications: ldquoNothing in this document gives me confidence that we will not be putting our clinicians in a position where they have no option but to decide on the basis of age.Le-saving equipment and highly trained medical staff are undoubtedly in limited supply. When intensive care beds and ventilators have to be rationed, then the decision of who benefits most will have to be made. Who would envy a doctor faced with such a bleak choice But it would be a terrible indictment of our societythe exigencies of this emergency fostered the sense that old is synonymous with surplus. If the word ldquopensioner is in danger of becoming a le-threatening label the long-term legacy of this disease will be far worse than the number of fatalities. It will have buried one of the primary principles on which modern civilisation is based.The idea that iniduals automatically become obsolescent after a certain age is repugnant. So too that their worth diminishes with each year. Who has the authority or right to say that one personrsquos le is more valuable than another  The more I see of friends in their eighties and nineties, the more I understand the old joke: Who would want to live to   Someone who is .One of the reasons this pandemic is so intense is because we have long recognised the importance of seniors. Modern medical advances have been expressly designed to allow much of the population to reach and enjoy advanced age, eventhey do rattle occasionally with their daily regimen of pills.Before going to university I worked for a year as an auxiliary nurse in a small hospital, on the male and female geriatric wards. It was a revelatory experience. Some of the patients had dementia, a few were permanently bed-bound, but there was not one of them who could not find some enjoyment and pleasure each day, or who did not retain much of their personality. It was an inspirational lesson that one of the finest achievements of society is to take such loving care of those whose best years are behind them, and for whom the future is measured in months, weeks, or simply hours.It is not for the state to determine who lives and dies. Every day doctors quietly make these calls, for reasons of humanity, and we must trust their judgement. When they need to discuss matters of le and death with relatively healthy patients, however, they would do well to remember that up to the very end, we all will rage against the dying of the light, and rightly, properly so.Shops across Scotland are closing.

Where do you feel the anxiety  Be conscious of what your body is telling you. Is your heart racing, stomach churning  To help ease these symptoms, be mindful of your breathing. Inhale through your nose for  slowly and exhale through your mouth again counting to  slowly. Repeat this exercise four times.AwarenessWe cannot control how her lersquos have changed due to this pandemic but what we can control is our thoughts to this global crisis. To quote from the Greek philosopher Epictetus ldquoPeople are not disturbed not by things, but by the views they take of them. Through awareness of how our thoughts make us feel, we can challenge these to more positive helpful thoughts. Awareness is the key to unlocking our distorted thoughts and through recognising whether we are for example predicting, judging or catastrophising, this can assist us in challenging and changing these negative obtrusive thoughts to more positive helpful ones.Self-CareTake this time as an opportunity to look after self. Self-care is crucial for building up resilience to le events and there is no time more important than in the now to engage in self-care: it is a priority. Self-care consists of several elements:Physical self-care such as nutrition, exercise and sleep.Mental self-care such as being aware of our thoughts and behaviours and engaging in activities such as crosswords. Emotional Self-care such as being aware of our emotions for example anger and sadness and how these can be managed. For example, through keeping a daily journal to recognise the triggers for our emotions.Spiritual Self-care such as awareness of when our minds are racing with thoughts and to try and be still. Engage in activities such as meditation, mindfulness and through being still in the now this will quieten the racing mind and provide strength at this challenging time. Take time to assess your self-care by implementing a self-care plan and commence small steps to change through looking after self. ldquoAn empty lantern provides no light. Self-care is the fuel that allows your light to shine brightly. If you find yourself struggling with anxiety, low mood or lapsing into unhelpful ways of coping, then contact Sharon.

Situated on the banks of the River Teviot, in an award-winning conversion of the former Victorian electrical works, the distillery is laying down spirit for a future Single Malt release, makes an excellent gin, and recently released a vodka.Kerrrsquos Borders Gin is genuinely Scottish Gin ndash wholly distilled from barley grown within  miles of the distillery. It is named after William Kerr ndash Hawick-born, and among the th centuryrsquos most accomplished botanists. He sent  plant specimens back to Kew Gardens from his Far East travels.Kerr would likely have approved of the distilleryrsquos Carterhead Still ndash one of only a handful in operation. It gently heats the botanicals rather than boiling them like most other gin stills, capturing more of the subtle flavours. Together with the barley, this gives the gin a distinctive depth. The rounded flavour works well with the bitterness of tonic water, creating a beautully balanced GT.The newest addition to distilleryrsquos range is Puffing Billy Steam Vodka ndash unfiltered malted barley vodka, named after the special still which plays a key role in its production. The spirit is steamed through charcoal inside the still itself and never filtered as a liquid, preserving the delicious character of the barley.Itrsquos the only vodka in the world made this way, and drinks commentators have praised the result, suggesting it could reinvigorate vodka, a spirit somewhat overlooked during the recent gin boom. Fabulous with tonic or Ginger Beer, the vodka also tastes incredibly smooth sipped chilled and straight.Kerrrsquos Borders Gin and Puffing Billy Steam Vodka are available direct from the distilleryrsquos online shop, currently offering free delivery anywhere within the UK when you buy a bottle.See www.thebordersdistillery shop ------------------------------------------------The Mortgage Advice Service ScotlandRe-mortgaging During the Coronavirus OutbreakAlthough health concerns are their immediate priority, people are searching for ways to reduce their monthly expenditure and cutting their biggest monthly outlay makes financial sense.Although the Coronavirusis having a signicant impact on obtaining funds for purchasing a new home, re-mortgages are still available from lenders at competitive rates and depending on the size of your mortgage, you could make substantial savings each month by simply changing lenders.Re-mortgaging neednt be a hassleEvenyou can save hundreds of pounds by shopping around, the thought of trying to switch your current mortgage may seem like a hassle you could do without.However, re-mortgaging isnt nearly as much hassle as you may think, because, thats where we step in and do all the work that is involved in finding you a fresh deal that can lower your monthly payments and maybe even help you to pay off your mortgage quicker.Choosing the right mortgage can be tricky.Next to purchasing your home, choosing the right mortgage is probably one of the most important decisions you will make when you are looking for a new deal.Approaching your current lender or bank may not result in you obtaining the best mortgage deal because they generally only consider their own products.

Guy spends ages engaged in pointless task to pass the time. Guy appears to be going slowly insane.Not le in lockdown Britain but business as usual on Limmyrsquos Handmade Show, the comedy so surreal the credits should be painted by Dali.Brian ldquoLimmy Limond does nothing as conventional as telling a joke. Dear God, no.Do not expect a series of set ups and punchlines, Only Fools and Horses-style, from this Glaswegian.No cuddly chummy stuff, and will-they-wonrsquot-they romance as in Peter Kayrsquos Car Share.Limmy is hardcore, brittle, slightly scary, and off the money more times than he is on it, but when his material works it sings like Connollyrsquos and can be as funny as Bridgesrsquo.This new three part series follows a pilot last year not long after the new BBC Scotland channel had launched. As before, it will be premiered on BBC Scotland before going network on BBC.Shot by himself in his flat, Limmy plays all the parts. He also the writer, producer, sound recordist, and editor. He probably did the location catering, too, and had a quick whip round with the vacuum before switching on the camera.When not in his flat he is out and about in Glasgow at ious venues. ldquoThis here is the international financial district of Glesga, he tells the camera. ldquoItrsquos offices hellip When I see offices like these it makes me so grateful that I donrsquot yet have to go back to having a real job.Note that ldquoyet. Limmy was one of the first to make \"do it yourself\" videos on his phone and upload them to social media. Now everyone and their granny is at it.Besides his television work he is best known for popping up on Twitter whenever a celebrity passes away to say he once had the pleasure of meeting so and so at a charity do, and that they were ldquo surprisingly down to earth, and VERY funny. Many are the unwitting TV researchers who have fallen for that one.In the first episode, besides wondering what it would be like working in an office, he teaches a masterclass in techno and how to rile the crowd into throwing bottles at you, rfs on contactless payments, and wonders what the numbers on a toaster mean.In a later episode he treats a creepy intruder ashe is a woodland creature that has wandered in by mistakeIt all sounds bizarre because it is. Limmy is so far down the rabbit hole he may never see daylight again.While he has his own particular brand of absurdism, he is part of a long tradition in Scottish comedy of surrealist humour stretching from Chic Murray and Lex McLean to Arnold Brown. Billy Connollyrsquos finest routines are the most fantastic flights of imagination that start at a point familiar to the audience before ending up who knows where.That said, the most successful sketches in the first episode were of the more conventional iety. In one he managed to take something as simple as an arrow chalked on the pavement leading him into an underpass and mine three pretty decent gags from it. It was almost silent comedy, with his face doing a lot of the heavy lting. A Glesga Buster Keaton no less.Some of the material fell flat, the social media chat felt dated, and three half hour episodes might be pushing it. Older now and a father, he is losing a bit of his punk edge .But I did laugh at the sheer daftness of some of it.

If someone is threatened by cattle, they are encouraged to release your dog and take the shortest route out of the field. As always pick up and remove all waste. A government spokesman said: #This is a temporary situation and it is more important now than ever to maintain good relationships between neighbours and within communities. This is not about restricting the general right of responsible non-motorised access to land but it is part of the wider approach to prevent COVID- deaths and preserving the nation’s food supplies.#Exercising access rights responsibly means respecting the needs of other people, and you will need to adapt your behaviour accordingly in the national effort to contain the spread of COVID-. Land managers should respect access rights, which are particularly important at this dficult time.

The shot was clearly going just wide of the upright before Fraser MacDonald inadvertently erted it into his own net for a bizarre opener.”Under the canny guidance of manager Angie Murchison, Skye’s useful blend of youth and experience continued to revel on the big stage. Youngsters like Somhairle Macdonald, Ewen MacSween, John MacLean and Allan MacLeod had established themselves along with several survivors of the  team – Cowie, Willie MacRae, Peter Gordon, John ‘Bodach’ Mackenzie, Ally MacDonald and Ewen MacKinnon.With  minutes played the islanders doubled their advantage.McCormack takes up the action: “John MacLean delivered a corner into the danger area, and with keeper Kenny MacDonald under pressure Cowie took two attempts before slipping the ball over the line as he tumbled face-forward onto the pitch”.Skye’s fans were in dreamland but, as the reporter had noted: “Kyles are famous for their battling qualities”.By half time the match was level.From a powerful hit in from the right the ball broke to veteran Dan MacRae “who had time and space to place the shot beyond the reach of keeper MacKenzie.”Then, calamity struck Skye in the closing moments of the half.“Another massive hit in by Tom White caused panic in the Skye defence, and as MacKenzie lashed out in an attempted clearance the ball appeared to come back past him off team captain MacSween”.Seconds later it took an outstanding save from MacKenzie to deny Dallas Turner and prevent Kyles from turning around in the lead.Murchison’s men regrouped.“The second half had been underway less than  seconds before Skye retook the initiative thanks to a corner which was turned in by Cowie, with Peter Gordon hovering to pick up on any mistake.”For much of the second half Kyles were kept well away from the Skye danger area, but a fourth goal proved elusive – thanks in large part to legendary goalkeeper Kenny MacDonald.And with Skye just eight minutes away from sealing a place in the final the men in blue hauled themselves back from the brink.Our reporter said that Dallas Turner “had looked the likeliest threat” and it was the youngster who “saw a glimmer of an opening and fired in a shot which took a deflection and flew past Bodach MacKenzie and into the net”.“That was the signal for the islanders to lay siege to the Kyles goal and for the Tighnabruaich keeper to dig dep with a string of exceptional saves.”MacLean, Somhairle MacDonald , Gordon and Cowie were all denied before the whistle sounded to herald extra time.In “energy-sapping heat” it was hardly surprising that the added half hour was more low-key, but five minutes into the second period came a “glorious chance” for Skye.Referee Donne Fraser spotted an infringement in the area, and the islanders were awarded a penalty.Rankin stepped up, but was unable to make clean contact and the “scuffed spot hit was easily turned away by MacDonald”.And so to a penalty shoot-out. Both goalkeepers excelled themselves, MacDonald saving two, and MacKenzie doing likewise. With Kyles - ahead, Rankin had to score to force sudden death, but his shot sailed wide and it was Kyles who went through to the final.Ian McCormack concluded: “Rankin was hero as well as villain. Once he got the measure of Ronnie MacVicar he dictated play from the centre, giving a hundred per cent in effort and running himself into the ground in the process. Up front Willie Cowie was immense – especially for a player just back from injury.“And while the defence as a whole were tight, Willie MacRae at buckshee back gave another award-winning performance.“If there was a man of the match award it would undoubtedly have gone to Kyles keeper Kenny MacDonald, who had excellent cover from full back Fraser MacDonald.“Their most dangerous forward was Dallas Turner, while that veteran Dan MacRae showed he still has a few seasons left in him at the top level.”In the final Kingussie, in the middle of a run of seven-successive Camanachd Cup triumphs, proved too strong, though Kyles gave a good account of themselves and had taken the lead before succumbing to a - defeat.The redoubtable Kenny MacDonald was the final’s man of the match, but his remarkable career had still some way to run. Both he and namesake Fraser # the full back in the epic tussle of  – would again pick up winners’ medals in , by which time Kenny’s son Roddy had also emerged as a star of the sport.For Skye the wait for another shot at the big one goes on – with the club also missing out in semi finals in  and .Allan MacLeod, the current Skye co-manager, reflected on that game at Ballachulish – recalling that he played much of the first half without a contact lens.“I remember marking Dan MacRae – a fantastic player. But it was great chance for us.“We were the better side for much of it, but not for the first time Kenny MacDonald was the saviour for Kyles.“At the time Kingussie were virtually unstoppable and we’d have met them in their prime. Our chance of winning the cup may have been slim, but it would have been nice to have made the final.“A lot of that Skye team would have deserved a shot on that stage.”"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Covid-19.jpg","title":"details of covid 19 case on skye leaked to the free","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineAs of Friday th April, there were a total of  confirmed cases in the NHS Highland area, but the health board have not released any further details on where the cases originate.Amid fears that some people might still consider rural areas to be isolated and virus free, there have been calls for greater clarity on where cases are.

It was a Saturday afternoon and the game was a supposed friendly against Rothienorman.“Back then I was a hard man, or so I thought! I was up against a burly young farmer-type at centre-half. I had a couple of robust challenges with the lad and he warned me that next time he was having me! Two minutes later he came in from behind and elbowed me in the head, I shrugged it off and instead of walking away I turned around and said: #You ain’t big enough to put me down, kid.# The next thing I knew, the birds were tweeting around my head and my front teeth were missing!“The game was abandoned and I had to go to the emergency dentist that afternoon and had months of repair work afterward. He had to pay my dental bill and a £ fine.

The game went to extra-time # we had Bruce Neil and Paul Flynn sent off but ended up winning something like -.“I remember John ‘Spod# Macleod scoring a goal and running up the touchline with his hands cupped over his ears to the once noisy Portree support who had given him dogs# abuse during the game. That lives long in the memory!” “It won#t come as a surprise to learn the best match was the title-winning game on th August , for many emotional reasons. We had a great campaign that year and had won  out of  games with only three matches remaining. We had to go to Kyleakin away on this date and they were the only team who could catch us in the title challenge.“It was a really nice summer evening and we had a strong team out, although leading striker John Murphy was unavailable through injury which meant young James Pringle played upfront with Craig Brown.“Kyleakin got out of the blocks quickly and we found ourselves - down early on in the match in front of a big crowd. We settled after that and played some decent stuff but Kyleakin, as usual, were well marshalled by Michael Taylor and we had dficulty in creating clear-cut opportunities. However, with  minutes to go, coach Ian MacLeod and I decided to put youngsters Ian Morrison and Angie MacPherson on each touchline to give us pace and width. The freshness seemed to galvanise us and with  minutes to go, we pulled a goal back through Craig Brown. It seemed the whole match swung on that goal, we picked up some real momentum and Brown scored again to equalise. Then with five minutes to go, we were awarded a penalty with two Kyleakin defenders tackling Brown as he broke into the box. Craig dusted himself down and scored the penalty in off the post # we were delirious on the sidelines. We saw out the game for our first-ever title and then won the remaining two games to make it  wins from  matches # it was a campaign never to be forgotten!” “It was my first game in charge, and funnily enough, it was also against Kyleakin. In those campaigns it was always the case that the first game of the season in the Bagshaw League pitted the reigning champions against the team which finished bottom the season before. The bottom club then had to play the runners-up from the previous season and so on, so it was very dficult for the clubs at the bottom to gain any early momentum.“We went down to Kyleakin with a whole bunch of youngsters against the likes of Scott Graham, the Nisbett clan, Darren Wainwright # who were all top players in the league at that time. We lost - and I swearit wasn#t for our young goalie Calum Montgomery making one save it could have been . But in essence, that is where I started from in management.

Seán is Chairperson of Cumann na mBunscol Aontroma, and on the board of management of Gaelfast.He explained in the interview with Áine Ní Bhreisleáin how he had received a call from his doctor on  March advising him to isolate. vw, px\"  Seán Mac Mánaispictured in Croke Park in  after O#Donovan Rossa won the AIB GAA Hurling All-Ireland Intermediate Club Championship final.“He said, you’re in danger here, because of the medication and that. It COVID- could be really serious for you. I got sick in , and for most people it would just have been a very bad cold, but I was in hospital for a month. He was talking about that as an example of how this wouldn’t be the same for me as for someone , so that I’d have to stay at home. And that everyone  in the house should stay home too, and keep their distance from me for a set time. I made my decision that day, and I haven’t left the house since.”Seán said that it was a challenge to pass the day, but that he was taking the opportunity to catch up on podcasts and reading, and getting up to scratch on distance learning. He’s also helping his two young daughters with their schoolwork.

Some of the top Cabinet team were exposed to the virus — and did not seem to have followed the public health advice.Stormont seemed preoccupied and torn between London which was now playing catch-up to WHO in Geneva and Dublin, which had been following the Galway doctor from day one.We had somethings going for us a good,under-resourced health system, a public health agency and a local firm Randox Health who made the initial test needed and imported the serology test which toldyou were now immune.Frittered AwayThese advantages were frittered away and attenuated.Emergency pandemic laws were enacted to empower the state rather than to penalise those who flouted the public health advice. The new law has empowered the stateto cut corners thereby disempowering the GP and the coronerfrom scrutinising the circumstances of thedeath to make accurate certication which is so important in measuring the pandemic. The laws also infringe the rights of patients and bereaved relatives. vw, px\"  ECMO OXYGENATOR: Only one in Ireland and that is in Dublin.Progress on PPE was slow as was the identication and upskilling of necessary staff and the procurement of extra ventilators and oxygenatorsnecessary for the many who would go into lung failure as a result of infection with the virus.We are - days away from the surge of cases and, unfortunately, deaths, and we must pray that enough will have been done to save lives and limit the damage.This virus has taught us some cruel lessons some of which should have already been learned. We will survive this to have a vaccine to protect us in the autumn.Maybe only a public inquiry can tell us who knew, what, when, how and the why of this epidemic.R.H.I. was about chickens, this is about us. vw, px\"  Dr Michael DonnellyMB, BCh, BAO is a clinical epidemiologist"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"opinion gerry adams we reflect back at eastertide only because we are focused on future","story":"THERE probably has not been an Easter week quite like this one in modern Irish history. I have always liked Easter and although I have less connection now with the institution of the Catholic Church, Good Friday always is a special day for me. It is the one afternoon that I try to slip into a church to reflect on the le of Jesus and his execution by crucixion all those years ago. This Good Friday the churches are closed. In fairness a church is not necessary for reflection. Any quiet place will do. But it will be strange nonetheless. vw, px\"  GERRY ADAMS:  commemorations will be more personalFor those of us who commemorate the  Easter Rising this will be a strange year also. There were Easters when repression and imprisonment, north and south, resulted in only a handful of activists coming together at gravesides and republican memorials to lay a wreath, read the Proclamation and list the names of our patriot dead. These were the Easters when successive Irish and Unionist governments banned such remembrances and used brutal tactics to enforce that ban. During the more recent years of conflict some Easter commemorations and republican memorials and graves were also bombed and damaged.This Easter we face a dferent kind of adversary. A silent, deadly enemy – the Coronavirus. So the traditional Easter commemorations have been cancelled.But that doesn’t mean that republicans will not commemorate our patriot dead. On the contrary this year commemorations will be more personal, more intimate, as we as iniduals and as families participate in our own little commemorative events or join in the online programme devised by Sinn Féin and others during this unprecedented health emergency. This includes a programme of social media events and posts, videos # some historical, speeches, including the keynote Easter address by Party President Mary Lou McDonald TD, music, encouraging children to produce art work reflecting on Easter, poetry, the flying of our national flag and the wearing of the Easter Lily.Many of us have favourite rebel songs and poems of struggle about the many dferent periods of rebellion in Ireland from , through Robert Emmet, the Young Irelanders, the Fenians, to Easter  and the Tan and Civil Wars, to the more recent decades of conflict. So as more and more people put video messages on social media why not consider posting your favourite rebel song  Or sing it yourself  But onlyyou’ve the voice for it. That leaves you out RG. Brón orm, chara.Or pick a poem by Pearse or Connolly or Bobby Sands or the last words of republican heroes. If you are a relative or friend or admirer of one of our patriot dead consider putting up a photo and telling their story.Court MartialThe book ‘Last Words’ by Piaras F. MacLochlainn is a personal favourite. It contains the letters and statements of the leaders who were executed after the  Rising. The poems of Pearse and the defiant statement by James Connolly to his court martial are often quoted but I have always had a special grá for Tom Clarke. He spent  years in English prisons in the s and s and endured long years of solitary confinement during which he was treated appallingly. In  he was the first signatory of the seven who signed the Proclamation. In the early hours of May  his we Kathleen, who was a prisoner in Dublin Castle, was brought to visit him in his cell under military escort. With a candle held by a British soldier for light and just hours before his execution Thomas Clarke gave Kathleen a message for the Irish people. It was brief but poignant.“I and my fellow-signatories believe we have struck the first successful blow for freedom. The next blow, which we have no doubt Ireland will strike, will win through. In this belief we die happy.” vw, px\"  National Graves Easter Parade JCThe story of the love of Joseph Plunkett and Grace Gford is well known. ‘Last Words’ contains a letter from Plunkett to Grace on  May in which he writes: “Listen –I live it might be possible to get the Church to marry us by proxy – there is such a thing but it is very dficult I am told. Father Sherwin might be able to do it. You know how I love you. That is all I have time to say. I know you love me and so I am very happy.”At pm on the evening of May  Grace was brought to the prison chapel. Joseph entered accompanied by a party of soldiers with fixed bayonets. The soldiers remained while Fr Eugene McCarthy read the marriage service by the light of a candle. After the ceremony they had to separate. A few hours later in the early hours of May  Grace was brought back to the prison and met her husband in his cell. They had ten minutes. Plunkett was executed on the morning of May  along with Edward Daly, Willie Pearse, and Michael O’Hanrahan.Oh Grace just hold me in your arms and let this moment lingerThey#ll take me out at dawn and I will dieWith all my love I place this wedding ring upon your fingerThere won#t be time to share our love for we must say goodbye.A century ago this November Kevin Barry was executed in Mountjoy Prison in Dublin. The song, which commemorates this young  year old, is a firm favourite with many. It has never lost its ability to stir the heart and remind us of the courage of this young man and his comrades. It has been recorded and sung countless times over the years, including by Paul Robeson and Leonard Cohen. Robeson’s version can be found online.A Nation Once AgainIn an earlier generation the essays and poems of Thomas Davis reminded people of the  Rising and of the awful impact of British colonialism on Ireland. RG has an edition of a book – Essays and Poems: Thomas Davis – published by the Gresham Publishing Company some time around the s. Davis died at the age of  from scarlet fever in  the first year of An Gorta Mór. One of his enduring works is ‘A Nation Once Again’.And then I prayed I yet might seeOur fetters rent in twain,And Ireland, long a province beA Nation Once Again.Davis also wrote ‘The West’s Asleep’ which in more recent years has been made famous by the Dublinersand the Clancy Brothers and others as ‘The West’s Awake’.So, this week and next use social media to post a personal reflection of the events in Dublin and where in  and of all those periods of struggle in Ireland’s long history of resistance and our demand for freedom. It can be something from YouTube or it can be you and those in your home or you and your friends singing, reciting, reading about Ireland’s patriot dead.These are some of my personal words and poems and lyrics.

But local representatives told the Belfastthe money will only be usedabsolutely necessary.DUP Westminster leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson said the rise to expenses, which applies to all eight party members, was indicative of the exceptional circumstances.Parliamentary authorities have made provision for MPs to avail of additional office costs to be incurred so that staff may continue to safely continue their work, he said.It allows for the purchase of any additional IT equipment for staff to work from home or for telephone systems to be amended so that important queries from constituents can still be dealt with.The support is not given directly to MPs, but enables them to purchase equipment from a central facility.The increase is obviously an exceptional measure and it was a decision taken quickly by Ipsa to assist during this exceptional time of crisis.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseColum Eastwood FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappColum EastwoodA spokeswoman for the SDLP, which has two MPs including party leader Colum Eastwood, said the cash will be a welcome boostneeded.The allowance is designed to allow MPs and staff to work effectively from home, she said.If we need to access it to enable us to provide an effective constituency service we will.Stephen Farry, who is the Alliance Party#s only representative at Westminster, said he did not think he would need to access the additional coronavirus fund.This is a decision taken independently from MPs and its purpose is to facilitate remote working, he said.I am committed to ensuring Parliament canand meet virtually during this crisis, with constructive scrutiny and accountability more important than ever.

It is an uplt in office cost allowance for ensuring a constituency service can continue to operate remotely in these times of crisis and to meet the needs of constituents.Given the increased demand on constituency services at a time of public health emergency, constituency workers should be able to work safely from home or adhere to strict social distancing guidelines - this inevitably creates a need for additional IT equipment.” According to The Times, the extra funds will be available until March  and come with a relaxation of the rules on evidence of purchases.In addition to increasing the money available for MPs# office costs, the authority is also suspending the -day limit for claiming costs and relaxing the requirements on producing evidence of money spent.The monthly credit limit on MPs# payment cards has been increased to £, and the single transaction limit has been increased to £,.The authority says it will provide additional funding from the staff absence budget for workers who are unwell or cannot be in work.Responding to the announcement, Labour MP Andrew Gwynne said: Casework has explodedso it#s right that our offices remain open ­- remotely - at this time.But he added that it would have been betterIpsa had done an equipment loan scheme instead.And Conservative MP Julie Marson said: No MP will see an extra penny of this in their bank accounts.Ipsa increased the office budget to provide staff who primarily work from the office the ability to work from home, and to produce and distribute Covid- information.Ipsa was established in the wake of the  MPs# expenses scandal.

And this year, pregnant women also have to worry about Covid-, a virus that can affect a person’s lungs and airways.Last week, the UK government announced that pregnant women were at an increased risk of severe illness from coronavirus.However, the advice to pregnant women was described by Chief Medical Officer Chris Whitty as “a precautionary measure” because “we are early in our understanding of this virus and we want to be sure.”So how does the coronavirus crisis affect youyou are pregnant or have just had a baby This advice was compiled with the help of Dr David Glenn FRCOG, a Consultant Obstetrician and Gynaecologist at Kingsbridge Private Hospital and Clinical Director for Women and Child Health at Ulster Hospital.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseDr David Glenn FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappDr David GlennWhy are pregnant women in the high-risk category Pregnant women do not appear more likely to contract the infection than the general population. Pregnancy itself alters the body’s immune system and response to viral infections in general, which can occasionally be related to more severe symptoms and this will be the same for Covid-.Can a pregnant woman pass coronavirus on to her baby Transmission from mother to baby during the pregnancy or delivery is probable, although the proportion of pregnancies affected and the signicance to the baby has yet to be determined. Amniotic fluid, cord blood, neonatal throat swabs, placenta swabs, genital fluid and breastmilk samples from Covid- infected mothers have so far tested negative for the virus. However, a new report describes a case in which the baby born to a Covid- positive mother was found to have antibodies in their blood at birth. This is thought to represent a baby’s response to infection within the womb.Is there a greater chance of miscarriageyou test positive for Covid- There is currently no evidence of an increased risk of miscarriage or early pregnancy loss in relation to Covid-.Moreover, there is no evidence that the virus damages the baby. Despite recent evidence that the virus can be passed from mother to baby, the proportion of pregnancies affected and the signicance to the baby has yet to be determined.What symptoms should pregnant women be aware of, and what should they dothey are experiencing any of them If you are infected with Covid- you are still most likely to have no symptoms or a mild illness from which you will make a full recovery. Most women will experience only mild or moderate cold flu like symptoms. Cough, fever, shortness of breath, lack of smell taste and even gastrointestinal symptoms are other relevant presentations.For women who have had symptoms, antenatal appointments can be deferred until  days after the start of symptoms, unless symptomspersevere.For women who are self-isolating because someone in their household has possible symptoms of Covid-, appointments should be deferred for  days.If women develop more severe symptoms or her recovery is delayed, this may be a sign that they are developing a more signicant chest infection that requires enhanced care. In this situation you should contact your maternity care team.Are all antenatal appointments going ahead as normal in Northern Ireland If you are well at the moment and have had no complications in your previous pregnancies arrangements for your care may be altered but they are still important to attend.If you have a routine scan or visit due in the coming days, you will still need to attend but the appointment may change due to staffing requirements. Maternity care is essential to reduce complications in mothers and babies. Even in the context of coronavirus, it is important that pregnant women continue to attend their scheduled routine care when they are well.Pregnant women will be asked to keep the number of people with you to a minimum. This will include being asked to attend maternity appointments alone.There may also be a need to reduce the number of routine antenatal visits.If women have an urgent problem related to the pregnancy but not related to coronavirus, they should get in touch using the same emergency contact details they already have. They should not contact that number unless they have an urgent problem.If women have symptoms of coronavirus, they should contact their maternity service and they will arrange the right place and time for the visits. They should not attend a routine clinic.What risks are there of an expectant mother contracting Covid- on a trip to hospital for an antenatal appointment Maternity care is essential and has been developed over many years with improving success to reduce complications in mothers and babies. The risks of not attending care include harm to mother, her baby or both.Many provisions have been put in place to reduce risk to mothers. These include reducing the number of visits to the hospital to a minimum, advice to mothers on reducing the number of people travelling with mothers to the hospital, attending the appointments alone, keeping numbers reduced in waiting rooms, spacing patients in waiting areas, staff taking additional protective efforts to reduce transmission in clinics with hand washing, cleaning equipment etc.How prepared are hospitals to deal with pregnant women with the virus Very signicant changes have been occurring in hospitals over the past weeks to deal with pregnant women with Covid-. Signicant changes have been made in all areas of the hospital, from clinics to wards and including delivery suites. Practice drills are being run frequently to train staff, additional resources have been brought in to help and a huge effort has been made by all levels of non-clinical, clinical, administrative and management staff.If the mother of a baby has symptoms or tests positive for Covid-, should she isolate herself from the baby Given the current limited evidence, we advise that women and healthy infants, not otherwise requiring neonatal care, are kept together in the immediate post-partum period.A risks benefits discussion with neonatologists and families to inidualise care in babies who may be more susceptible is recommended.Can a new mother with the virus breastfeed The main risk of breastfeeding for infants is the close contact with the mother, who is likely to share infective droplets. In the light of the current evidence, it is advised that the benefits of breastfeeding outweigh any potential risks of transmission of the virus through breastmilk. Precautions should be taken to reduce spread to the baby such as, hand washing before touching the baby, avoiding coughing or sneezing on the baby while feeding, and considering wearing a face mask,available, while feeding or caring for the baby.Can a pregnant person be accompanied by a partner or have visitors A person in labour can be accompanied by one birthing partner, according to the new guidelines. No visitors are permitted in ante-natal or post-natal ward areas.Will babies continue to be delivered in all Northern Ireland hospitals No, not at Causeway Hospital in Coleraine. Antenatal services will continue but it is not possible to deliver babies in the hospital during this surge period.This is due to a lack skilled paediatricians available to provide emergency care to a baby born in distress throughout the  hour period. To protect the wellbeing of mothers and babies, women booked to deliver in Causeway will be contacted and have their delivery transferred to Antrim or Altnagelvin Hospital.Should parents introduce their newborn to friends and family Current government guidance is that you should not meet with people outside your household, so no family celebrations are permitted at present.Belfast ,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

She slammed anyone ignoring government restrictions as crazy and irresponsible. She said: I usually post messages on my #liver-versary# as I call it to thank my donor#s family for my le and for more people to become organ donors.

Six years later her joy was complete after she gave birth to a son, Jericho. Aislinn, who is on furlough from her National Trust job as assistant retail manager at the Giant#s Causeway visitor centre, said she has to go to extraordinary s to protect herself and her family from Covid-.She added: I#ve had to shield myself in the house even before the lockdown started. I#m at high risk because I#ve had a solid organ transplant and I#m immunosuppressed, which basically means that my immune system is a lot less than a normal person#s would be. In order that my body didn#t reject the new organ, the immune response within my body was more or less knocked down.The good part of that is that I can keep an organ which isn#t mine. The bad part of it is that I#m open to a lot more viruses because my body doesn#t have the same fighting capability. An ordinary cold or flu can knock me for six but coronavirus would have a bigger percentage chance of killing me. In her online message Aislinn wrote: As someone who is immunosuppressed and at high risk, I ask anyone who reads this, stay at home please. Reduce the chance of me and others like me having a reduced lespan from Covid-. My family and I will do everything we can to protect me, but please also do your bit.Aislinn has been horried to read news as she self-isolates that some people in Northern Ireland have been ignoring the warnings to stay at home.She added: I find it hard to understand what it is that people don#t fathom about the guidelines. It#s almost asthey think: #I#m alright Jack and sod the rest of you#.Aislinn has pleaded in particular with people who have second homes on the north coast to stay away. There seems to be a feeling that by coming up here people will have less chance of getting the virus, she added.But nowhere is safe and Covid- is already having a huge impact on local services like shops who have run out of delivery slots.

It was where I was meant to be.The Free Presbyterian Church Mission Board are continuing to work on supporting the school through the current coronavirus pandemic, with the most recent team having ed to Northern Ireland just a few weeks before the travel restrictions were put in place.I hadn#t actually planned to go back over there, but the opportunity came up when one of the people travelling had to pull out.There was no intention to head back with Alastair either, but we found ourselves together again and he never blinked an eye considering what we had been through together. He showed no concern, which was just what I needed.And to be honest, it really helped to be able to talk openly about what had happened. He was able to tell be a lot about it all, things I hadn#t realised. It allowed both of us to put our thoughts to rest and just get on with doing what we were going there to do, and that#s to help the people who needed our assistance.I always say now that Alastair is myangel. We were meant to carry on with the work we had started.And when he dropped me off at home when we ed he said to my we Roberta, here you go, he#s in your care now.I thank the Lord that I#ve made such a good recovery, said David.I#m feeling very well, in fact there are days I can#t believe how well I actually feel when I look back on what happened and how close I was to death.Now firing on all cylinders again, David is determined to help the team of missionaries continue their work in overseeing the development of the Emmanuel Christian School in Uganda, still very much in the company of hisangel.I was back in Uganda again in November of last year with another Mission Board colleague, Barry Stewart, an elder in Magherafelt Free Presbyterian Church, said David.We went to Kenya first for six days to visit the missionaries there and Alastair, who is Mission Board Treasurer, joined us for that part of the trip. Then Barry and I flew down to Uganda to visit the school for a few days. It was at that time that we opened and dedicated the new community bore wells for the area around the school and that was a wonderful sense of achievement for all of us.We#re still seeking to provide aid to  families in the area around the school to help them through these very dficult times, he continued.Most of these families are very poor and have very limited financial resources, especially at this time when there is little work or business so there is no cash coming in. We#re working to provide maize, rice, salt, sugar, cooking oil and soap. The work continues.At the end of February, a team of seven people from Northern Ireland went out to the school for two weeks to wire for mains electric. A smaller team willto complete this when the coronavirus crisis settles down.The Free Presbyterian Church currently has three missionaries working in Uganda: Noreen McAfee, from Ballymoney, and Andrew and Hannah Foster, from Comber.I chair the sub committee overseeing the work at the school, said David.

Castledawson man Jason is currently renting a flat on Ireton Street, off Botanic Avenue near Queen’s University in south Belfast with three other students. Jason said his letting agency were unsympathetic to the students’ situation, saying there was nothing they could do. He told Derry Now: “They said it wasn’t their problem – that was what guarantors were for. “The situation is that they won’t give us any sort of leeway in terms of paying it when they know we’re not in the house due to university being cancelled. googletag.cmd.push “They’ve said it’s not their problem because it’s privately rented and I understand that to a point, but common sense has to kick in somewhere.” Jason and his flatmates are renting their accommodation through USPM Ltd, a letting agent based on University Road and say they had to initiate contact about Covid-. “There’s very little contact with the letting agency unless you miss or have to arrange a payment. They hadn’t contacted us about the pandemic, we had to do the ringing,” said Jason. “I rang them, and our contact said they understood the frustration but there was nothing they could do. To them, we were renting a house in Belfast to live in. googletag.cmd.push “Our landlords are usually dead on, butthey had any sort of generosity, they could do something. It’s not always up to the person on the end of the phone.” While Jason is able to fall back on the support of his family, he realises not everyone has that support available. He said: “I have a few friends who wouldn’t come home as much, they don’t have a stable home to come home to and they’re paying rent through jobs in Belfast. “A lot of them were in part-time jobs and have now been laid off. They have no way to continue that, no income. It’s not a good situation for them.” Jason believes the ‘mortgage holidays’ mooted by the government could provide the solution to the problem, but that the options did not appear to be being explored. “Anybody renting privately is just being made to pay. There are no mortgage holidays coming into play,” he said. “We’re probably now having to pay- months where we aren’t there whereas we had been in years gone by. That’s probably half the year of not being in the house and having to pay for it. “If they can take mortgage holidays, there is absolutely no reason for us to be paying rent, except for making a profit.” Derry Now contacted UPSM Ltd for a response, but none was available at the time of going to print.

Derry Trades Union Council chair, Niall McCarroll, said: The global Covid- crisis means we cant celebrate May Day, the international workers day, in the way we normally would. This year we were working with Derry and Strabane Council to host a Workers Rights and Social Justice Week culminating with the May Day march and rally. The Covid- crisis is causing tremendous pain and hardship. We are in the midst of a tragedy that we hope will end as soon as possible with as few deaths as possible. googletag.cmd.push The response to the crisis has also put a spotlight on the inadequacy of government action, the state of our public services and the central role of workers saving lives, protecting communities and allowing society to . Many in the political establishment have joined claps in recent weeks for our heroic nurses and frontline workers but they have spent the last decades justying poverty wages, undermining trade union representation and dismantling our public services, including our health service. The hypocrisy is glaring. Governments have described the battle to contain Covid- as a war but theyve sent frontline workers out without PPE and testing. Far too many employers have risked workplace and public safety by refusing to implement public health guidelines. Workers have been forced to take strike action to make sure health guidelines are followed. googletag.cmd.push Its crucial we put a focus on the heroic efforts of workersresponding to this crisis, on the need for workers rights and on the central importance of our public services. The Derry Trades Union Council is calling on everyone to mark this May Day by joining a Five Minutes of Noise for Workers Rights at pm on Friday May st - and by putting up red flags and signs for workers rights from homes and workplaces for  hours. Well be working with unions, community groups, equality campaigners, artists and others that we were collaborating with for the Workers Rights and Social Justice Week to organise as much as possible through social media. We will be launching our Workers Charter - our vision for dignity, respect and justice at work, in communities and for a more equal society. Were calling on the trade unions and organisations supporting workers rights across Ireland, North and South, to join this effort. People from all backgrounds and communities deserve workers rights,dignity and equality. We want this event to be as inclusive as possible. We need to begin to shape a new way of doing things thats centred around recognising the value of workers and the needs of the working class communities.

Henderson’s Eurospar in Rossdowney, Glassagh Taxis and Creggan Enterprises. Adrian Kelly said it he felt it was the ‘very least’ the community could do given the sacrices the nurses were making. “The nurses are serving on the frontline, spending Easter in isolation away from their families,” he said. “A friend of mine askedwe might possibly help make things a little more bearable for them with a hamper of treats to acknowledge our appreciation. And the other Spar stores all thought it was an excellent idea – and signed up immediately. We are delighted to be doing it.” googletag.cmd.push The stores have assembled  hampers – each containing Easter eggs, chocolates treats, snacks and a bottle of Cava - for the nurses who are staying in the Holiday Inn. The first of the deliveries, organised by local volunteers, will be leaving Raacuteth Moacuter at .pm tomorrow . Last month, Eurospar teamed up with Creggan Enterprises and Glassagh Taxis to launch a free delivery service for older and vulnerable customers who are unable to do their own shopping because of the virus. Raacuteth Moacuter’s Conal McFeely said the community response to the Covid crisis in Derry had been very strong. googletag.cmd.push “Our nurses’ courage and dedication at this worrying time has been steadfast and vital,” he said. “It is inspiring to see initiatives like this which recognise and salute the contribution being made by those on the frontline our behalf. “Let us hope that it is not long before our nurses are able tosafely to their loved ones to enjoy some much needed family time for themselves.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Anyone caught neglecting to clean up after their dogs can now be issued with an pound fine and the council has wasted no time in getting the message across along some of the citys most popular walkways. Recently, Mayor of Derry City and Strabane District Council, Councillor Michaela Boyle, reminded the public of the need to take responsibility for their pets following an increase in the instances of dog fouling in recent weeks. Government measures to reduce the spread of the Covid  virus by limiting when the public can leave their home has led to an increase in walkers in local parks, greenways and public footpaths and with it more dog foul for Councils Cleansing teams to clean up. googletag.cmd.push Mayor Boyle urged dog owners to show respect for public health and other parks and greenway users when walking their pets. The vast majority of dog owners are conscientious and clean up after their dogs but there has been a noted increase in fouling since the new stay at home measures were introduced,” she said. Dog excrement left on our streets and parks poses a serious public health hazard and is putting extra pressure on our Cleansing team at this dficult time.  I would appeal to all owners to carry a bag to lt the dirt and dispose ofit in a designated dog bin where possible or in a black bin. googletag.cmd.push “Similarly, owners are reminded that when in designated pedestrian zones, dogs must be on a lead held by someone who is able to control it and owners should be mindful of other dogs and members of the public who could be scared of animals.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Kieran Stevenson was man of the match in their win over Antrim and Michael McMullan spoke with the Derry keeper, as he rekindled the memories of their golden era.  For  years, Derry had wandered around in Ulsters hurling wilderness. Until that moment. The  Ulster final was ticking towards a conclusion. Mickey Collins won a free which his brother Ollie drove between the posts at the Andersonstown Road end. Derry fans among the , strong Casement Park attendance exploded into another frenzy, as their caman-wielding heroes hit the front again. googletag.cmd.push Was this eventually going to be their day  Not just yet. There was time for Antrim to cast the dice one last time. Gary OKane composed himself over a stoppage time sideline cut. The wind carried the sliotar into the danger-zone, where vigilant Derry goalkeeper Kieran Stevenson deflected it wide. It was the last action and the final whistle kick-started an outpouring of emotion for the new Ulster champions. Bullfrog was the keeper in Banaghers three-in-a-row winning minor team, before moving into the county scene. An -year career began in , as understudy to Laveys Fergal Shorty McNally. The following year, he was second choice behind Padraig Oacute Mianaacutein when Derry won the All-Ireland B championship. googletag.cmd.push In , the Us lost to Antrimin the Ulster final. From that team, captain Colin McEldowney, Benny Ward, Mickey Conway, Gary Biggs and Geoffrey McGonigle would help spearhead Derry seniors towards Division One. The minors lost in the final that year, to the Saffrons, by an almost identical margin and Stevenson was the keeper on both teams. In , the Us took Antrim to a replay and  frees from the unerring Dermot Doherty, on his own Emmet Park turf, finished the job as Derry took the title in mid-week extra-time thriller. “That was a good win,” Stevenson recalls. “Antrim were always the team to beat, in terms of the county.” Things began to change. They ran Antrim to three points in the  senior final, but lost convincingly the following year. It was a spell in hurlings top tier that made the wheels of change turn that bit quicker. Promotion at the end of  began a four-year stint in the top flight. They ran Waterford to seven points at Ballinascreen in their first outing, before facing Cork and Kilkenny. The cream of hurling was lting Derrys standards. A -point slump to Tipperary, in Thurles, was their toughest afternoon. A one-point defeat in Laois was the one that got away, leaving Derry needing to beat Kerry in a relegation play-off to stay afloat before dropping down at end of the  campaign. “I think it as the Division One hurling that stuck to us and we were on an upward curve,” Stevenson feels. “There were more players added to the . “Derry hurlingwas about filling up the numbers and going out to play the matches. Then it changed and everybody was taking it serious. The club scene was improving and you could see the skill level going up from  to .” HARMONY In an interview three years ago, Conor Murray painted the Derry hurling scene he played on at the start of the noughties as a family. A unique one, with club rivalry left at the gates of Owenbeg and picked up on the way home. Stevenson agrees. “No club stuck to themselves, everybody got on well with everybody,” he said. Other managers werent chirping in players ears, telling them not to commit to the small ball game. In the  season, Kieran McKeever threw his lot in with the hurlers, while also playing in an Ulster football final weeks later. “Players were not restricted in playing for the county, in terms of hurling and everybody gelled,” Stevenson added A mountain of upside-down kit bags would be erected in the aisle of the team bus, with a coat thrown over it. Hey presto, they had a card table, around which they laughed on their journey to whatever battle they would later brace themselves for. It got more advanced when Stevenson, a kitchen manufacturer by trade, patented a custom-made card table. “When we were coming home, we were arm-wrestling on it and it was all a bit of craic,” he joked.  Emmett McKeever, Kieran McKeever and Geoffrey McGonigle celebrate Derrys  Ulster title. Steering the ship was Cushendall man Kevin McNaughton. After spending time helping foster Swatraghs structures and leading them to back to back intermediate championships, he came on board with Derry at the start of the  season. His trusted lieutenant, from the Swa, Roger Anthony Quinn, Laveys hurling godfather Tom Magill, Banaghers Gerard McCloskey and athletics coach Malcolm McCausland made up the management team. Heading up the M for the  final, Derry were in a decent place, following a - to - win over a Down team who had beaten New York in the quarter-final. Antrim were -point winners over London in their semi-final, but Derry blitzed them in the first half of the decider. Rookie defenders Emmett OHara and Declan McKillop were led a merry dance by the Derry attack. Ace attacker Geoffrey McGonigle and Emmett McKeever were missing through suspension. That told enough of the depth in Derrys squad. “We were getting better with playing all the better teams. There was plenty of skill, speed and fitness in the team. It was about trying to put it all together...it was a good ,” Stevenson explained. McKeever had been suspended after being sent off with Downs Noel Sands in the semi-final, on the advice of a linesman. With high-ranking officials on their July holidays, the appeal – lodged before the end of June – wasnt heard and McKeever would miss the final. “Beefywas our best player in defence...he was lethal,” Stevenson said of his captain. “We wanted to try and win it for him because he was hard done by. He was well-liked and in every match, hed have put his head in front of the hurl to stop the ball. “Antrim had Alistair Elliott, Gregory OKane was full-forward and Gary OKane started at centre half-forward, before going back .” DREAM START Kieran McKeever, Gary Biggs and Ollie Collins hit first half goals to leave Antrims foundations rocking. The Saffrons didnt score from play for  minutes. “We shouldve been further ahead,” said Stevenson of their - to - interval lead. “We had missed a pile of scoring opportunities and we were against the breeze in the second half. “We knewthe forwards were getting on the ball, they could score goals because they were skilful and quick.” Derrys backs were to the wall as Antrim notched  unanswered points and, with  minutes gone, went four points ahead. Derry replied with points to take the wind out of Antrims sails. Their case was helped further when John ODywer finished to the net for the crucial fourth Oakleafers goal. “It was the goals that won us the match,” Stevenson said. “I still have a hurling ball in the house, with the scorewritten on it.” All the press cuttings and programmes were kept too. A raft of memories from the glory years. But the hurl that deflected Gary OKanes last minute sideline cut to safety is long gone. “Some wee Belfast boy stole it,” Stevenson reckons. The Derry squad threw their history-making hurls on the turf to celebrate and within minutes they had vanished. “When the final was blown, it was more thepressure, you were always checking the time to see what was left. If the game had went onthere was less likelihood that we couldve won the game.” Conor Murray accepted the cup in the stand, before taking it down to the pitch for the suspended Emmett McKeever to again hoist it skywards to salute the magical moment. “We were there on merit,” was Stevensons assessment of their win. “We had a good defence and a good forward line. When you take the likes of John ODwyer, Geoffrey and Mickey Collins as your front three – you have a good side. “Conor Murray at full-back was safe, you had Collieand Niall Mullan in the corners.” Stevenson picked up the man of the match award and added to it with the Ulster hurler of the year accolade the following season when Derry retained their title. Later that night, the team partied into the wee small hours in Dungiven club. You could barely turn a sweet in your mouth. It was jam packed. Before that, on the joyous journey home, there was a poignant moment when the players got off the bus to carry the cup over the River Bann in Toome. “We had talked about it in previous years – the days when we were beaten,” Stevenson remembers. “It was a short walk, the boys were more interested in getting on the bus and heading on home.” Derrys fallow  years was over.

As one might expect there’s a strong representation from multiple John McLaughlin winners Ballinderry, Slaughtneil and Coleraine but I can’t believe some of the players that I have left out. However, I’m pretty sure thatan imaginary club was able to field this line-out in their prime, they’d not be far off lting the Andy Merrigan Cup. googletag.cmd.push  - MichaelConlan - Ballinderry A fixture between the sticks for Ballinderry for almost two decades, Mickey C was a good goalkeeper at the start of his career when winning an All-Ireland club medal in . By the s he seemed even better, maintaining a physical condition that would have been the envy of men  years his junior and adjusting to a massive transformation in what was expected from a modern goalkeeper. He just edges out Slaughtneil’s Antoin McMullan for the number one jersey.  - Karl McKaigue – Slaughtneil Karl might not be as well know as his elder brother, but he has been just as vital in Slaughtneil’s success. The archetype of the modern defender, who must meld man-marking skills with ability on the ball, McKaigue is often the initiation point for the Emmett’s attack. Has held some of the finest forwards in club football scoreless during Slaughtneil’s rise to national prominence including Conleith Gilligan, Ryan McHugh and Seanie Johnston. googletag.cmd.push  - Brendan Rogers Slaughtneil Another Emmets dual star Rogers, has been the defensive rock on which Slaughtneil’s success has been built. Named Ulster Club footballer of the year for , as a youngster Rogers initially chose to focus on hurling but has established himself as one of the football’s best defenders in not just Derry but Ulster, an automatic pick for this selection.  - Ciaran Mullan - Coleraine A superb athlete whose ball-carrying ability and pace have made him a nightmare for opposing forwards who end up spending much of their time tracking back into their own half. A key man as Coleraine claimed the John McLaughlin Cup for the first time in  and was still a fixture when they claimed their second title in .  - Kevin McGuckin - Ballinderry Another Ballinderry man with an All-Ireland medal in his pocket, the fact he was still making the starting  for the Shamrocks in  is testament to his qualities. A Rolls Royce of a footballer the former Derry captain’s experience was crucial as the Loughshore completed a hat-trick of victories between  and .  - Oisin Duffy - Foreglen It’s a measure of Oisin Duffy’s consistent excellence that he makes this selection based on performances in the Intermediate Championship. Could play any position in the backline, his strength and pace made him an effective man marker but equally comfortable in possession. Still as effective as ever as Foreglen claimed the Intermediate crown last October.  - Chrissy McKaigue - Slaughtneil First rose to prominence on the Derry minor side that reached the All-Ireland final in  the current Derry Captain has been a fixture for club and county for a decade. In addition to his evident abilities as a player, McKaigue provides the intangible qualities of leadership that every successful team needs. On the rare occasions that Slaughtneil find themselves floundering McKaigue is the man to whom his team-mates look to steady the ship.  - Patsy Bradley - Slaughtneil Another who’s career has spanned the ages, Patsy Bradley is an icon of Derry football. The quintessential quiet, hard man, Bradley’s aerial prowess rarely fails to catch the eye and his work-rate is immense. Has overcome injuries that might have restricted the career of lesser players Patsy’s toughness is the stuff of legend.  - Niall Holly - Coleraine Strong in the air and extremely mobile. Holly’s ball carrying skills have the been the starting point for countless Eoghan Rua attacks, with his languid style belying and athleticism allows him to glide past opponents. A perfect foil for the combative Bradley.  - Enda Muldoon - Ballinderry One of the most gted footballers ever to apply a boot to a size five, the Shamrocks man’s gts appeared to immune to the passing of the years as Ballinderry emulated their s antecedents in winning three in a row from  to . His ball to Raymond Wilkinson for the decisive goal in the  semi-final win over Banagher may be the best pass I have ever seen in club football.  - Benny Heron- Ballinascreen The only man in my team who doesn’t have some form of Championship winners medal to show for his efforts. Heron has been a prolic scorer for a Ballinascreen team that has regularly been in the mix for the John McLaughlin Cup without quite sealing the deal. With his phenomenal work rate and ability to score from both play and placed balls, Heron was a key factor in the St Colm’s club’s run to the  and  county finals.  - Sean Leo McGoldrick - Coleraine The oil that has kept the Coleraine engine running smoothly for a decade. Adaptable players can sometimes be the victims of their own versatility but Sean Leo McGoldrick’s quality is such that every manager in Derry would love to have him in their squad. One Coleraine mentor once told me that the one time in any game when he could relax was when Sean Leo had the ball because he knew it was secure. An incisive runner and an accurate passer the Eoghan Rua man can also chip in with a vital score when the occasion requires.  - Coilin Devlin - Ballinderry The flame-haired front man maybe didn’t have the profile of the other Ballinderry forward in this line-up but his impact for the Shamrocks in the early part of the decade was undeniable, bagged the decisive goal in the  final against Slaughtneil, and scored five points from play to earn man of the match honours in . Dooks pace and direct running made him a handful for opposing corner-backs.  - Colm McGoldrick - Coleraine The second member of the McGoldrick clan to make my team and you could make case for the inclusion of any of the brothers, but Colm is well worth his place. He was the fulcrum of the Eoghan Rua attack as they claimed their first county crown in . The intelligence of his movement is something that can’t be taught. As captain he scored four points in the  final as Coleraine doubled their tally of John McLaughlin Cups.  - Shane McGuigan - Slaughtneil The sharpest shooter in Derry club football in recent year. McGuigan’s scoring tallies speak for themselves scored - in the  Derry Championship and better that tally with - in . Performs well on the big stage top scored in the  Ulster final with - against Kilcoo and bagged - in ’s provincial triumph over Cavan Gaels.

Even in defeat, it was Derry who stole the show. What was supposed to be a Sunday stroll for Offaly turned out to be nothing of the sort as Derry flew the underdog flag with real pride. At the midpoint of the second half, Derry were level and pressing, and it took a strong finish by the overwhelming favourites to earn a six-point cushion at the end. Offaly’s manager, Pat Fleury, readily admitted that his team would have to make enormous improvements before the semi-final against Cork. googletag.cmd.push The truth is, Derry were always in contention in this game despite the dire predictions of a massacre. Geoffrey McGonigle ed from suspension to rattle in two goals and the full forward line of Gary Biggs, Michael Collins and John O’Dwyer scored - among them. There were high-class performances at midfield from Ronan McCloskey and Oliver Collins, and at the back, Derry held both John Troy and Gary Hannfy scoreless. We came down here to win, said manager Kevin McNaughton. We know we are not that far away and I always thought we were in with a chance, we were hurling so well. googletag.cmd.push There was the feeling throughout the first half that Offaly always had the upper hand, but once McGonigle pounced for goals in the final quarter, the complexion of the contest changed. Brian Whelahan had been left out of the starting lineup due to a hamstring strain, but he was quickly pitched into service to shore up a leaky defense, and Joe Errity was also sent into the action. Their presence had the desired effect as Derry managed only two scores in the closing stages, while Offaly had five points and a vital goal by Brendan Murphy. Derry were five points in arrears at the changeover, but they had the advantage of the breeze to come. McGonigle got the first of his goals when he latched on to Kieran McKeever’s probing delivery, and then when Stephen Byrne made a save from John O’Dwyer’s shot, McGonigle was perfectly positioned to dispatch the rebound. We put in a hell of a performance, said Ollie Collins, who was forced out with injury during the second half. This our first time down here. I’m certain this team will be back at this stage of the competition and go better.

No matter where you go or who you are talking to up and down the country, they always ask about Roly. There is always someone who knows him or has played with or against him.The above paragraph was taken word for word from Drumaness Millsrsquos th anniversary booklet in . It captures brilliantly the essence of Roly lsquoThe Manrsquo.Roly died on Wednesday, March , sparking a deluge of tributes on social media. True gentleman, one in a million, what a lovely man, one and only Roly, top man, a legend mdash these tributes, among many others, appeared again and again.Roly was an integral part of village le in Drumaness, dandering to the bookies or the shop. He would make multiple stops to say hello to everyone he met, discussing the issues of the day.I have known him for a!most  years. He worked in Sam Bellrsquos egg factory across the road from St Josephrsquos Primary School in Crossgar. The workers would kick a ball about the road during their break and even to my untrained eye he was dferent class. It was my introduction to Roly lsquoThe Footballerrsquo.Some years later Roly and his brother, John, knocked on our door in Crossgar. They wanted me to play for the Mills in the Newcastle Summer League and I was more than happy to do so.Playing with Roly was a great education for a young player. He made football look easy, was stylish and talented, possessing the rare gt of keeping the game simple.Small wonder then that when talk comes around to the Millsrsquo greatest ever player, Roly is always in the conversation, despite competition from the likes of Robbie Strain, Osie Gelston, Conor Walsh and Davy Mills.Legend has it that in those days boys were born with boots on in Drumaness because this was a village where sport was king. So it was that Roly also excelled at billiards and cricket, reaching a very high standard in both.But football and the Mills were Rolyrsquos first loves and he rarely missed training or matches. Inevitably his talent came to the notice of Irish League managers and he enjoyed spells with Portadown and Cltonville in the early seventies. Nevertheless, Roly was a home bird and sooner or later he would pull on the Mills shirt again.By now I was playing for the all conquering Downpatrick Rec team of that era and we pitched up to a Border Cup final early in  to play the Mills. We had just won the Steel and Sons Cup and had our eyes firmly on the double, but Roly and Osie Gelston had other plans and proceeded to inspire the Mills to a famous - win.Roly had reached the twilight years of a glorious footballing career, but there was still time to lead the Mills reserves to another giant-killing act, beating Castlewellan in the Bobby Dalzell Cup final in .After such a stellar playing career, Roly was expected to become a manager. He did dip his toes in the managerial waters once or twice, but with no offence intended to the managerial fraternity mdash myself included mdash Roly was probably too nice to be a manager. In all the years I have known him I canrsquot remember him raising his voice. He was just so easy going, decent and level-headed.As a result people liked Roly and this popularity unsurprisingly proved to be an asset in his working le. After Sam Bells he spent a number of years working in the Co-Op shop in Drumaness before taking up employment with well-known butcher Vincy Doran.He was a familiar sight in Vincyrsquos van, delivering to hotels and restaurants, but it was his weekend door-to-door run which played to his strengths and further cemented his popularity.He became known as Butch or Butcher mdash a nickname he loved mdash and Vincy to this day has nothing but good things to say about Rolyrsquos eight-year stint with him.Rolyrsquos next stop was with Jimmy Quinn, who owned a bakery in Downpatrick. Jimmy shrewdly ed Roly to the door-to-door market and with people still finding it dficult to say no to the personable Roly, their successful liaison continued for  years.Jimmy likes nothing better than relating Roly stories,none of which can be repeated here, and like the rest of us he will remember Roly with the utmost fondness.Unfortunately Roly wasnrsquot immune to the ups and downs of le and deteriorating health curtailed his working le. He managed to fight and beat prostrate cancer a number of years ago, but this time around the lsquoBig Crsquo has claimed this lovely man.Ironically it was during these latter years that he seemed to be ever present on the streets of Drumaness, allowing him to befriend a generation entirely unaware of his past sporting prowess.Roly married Betty Rice on October , , and together they brought Noel, Pauline, Betty, Carol and Christine into the world. After almost  years together as a couple they remained best friends, as well as husband and we.Apart from my football connection to Roly, I have been his neighbour for  years and since his passing I have heard him described as lsquoMr Drumaness Millsrsquo, but for me he was Mr Drumaness full stop. This village will never be the same without him.Rolyrsquos family should be immensely proud of his impact on those who knew him and how sad it was to see coronavirus rob them and Roly of the fitting send-off he deserved.However, the good news is that I know there are plans afoot to have a celebration of his le when normality s. Nobody deserves it more. RIP Roly.Roly Hanna -.prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/8th April 2020 Cormac.jpg","title":"Ardglass golfer on teeing up with the best in the world  ","story":"ARDGLASS golfer Cormac Sharvin could be forgiven for feeling understandably frustrated right now.The richly talented  year-old should be locking horns with some of the worldrsquos best players on the European tour.But instead of prowling the fairways hersquos holed up in his apartment in Dublin mdash like many others undergoing coronavirus lockdown.Itrsquos not how Sharvin, currently th in golfrsquos world rankings, thought his first season on the European Tour would go.Having secured his card for the  season by finishing th on the  Challenge Tour rankings, he was gearing up for a potential breakthrough campaign on the top circuit.However, after just four events, he is unsure of what the future holds as the sporting world goes into shutdown due to the coronavirus outbreak.He clearly appreciated that golf, and sport in general, is of minor importance when compared with the COVID pandemic.Of the decision to close all golf courses north and south of the border, he told the BBC recently: ldquoItrsquos a precaution that needs to be in place.I donrsquot know enough about the virus, but theyrsquore obviously trying to slow things down. Hopefully wersquoll be back playing as soon as possible, I think thatrsquos the goal.ldquoI think we just have to accept it and sit tight and when it does pass, we can get things moving a bit quicker.Certainly things have happened fairly quickly for Sharvin in his career to date. He only took up golf seriously relatively late in his teenage years, but went on to have glittering amateur career.In  he was a member of the Great Britain and Ireland Walker Cup team, contributing three points and remaining unbeaten in a .-. thumping of the United States.Sharvin turned  the following year and joined the ranks of the European Challenge Tour.Having missed his European Tour card by a single shot in , Sharvin relocated to Dublin and It proved to be the right move.He amassed eight top ten finishes in  starts to earn a rookie season on the European Tour thanks in large part to his six top fives.Sharvin only missed four cuts, two of which came in the first two events of the season, before he kickstarted his campaign with back-to-back top ten finishes.However, his best performance came at the Irish Open at Lahinch where he finished tied for th and was also the leading Irish golfer.He showed impressive consistency during the  season and proved his elite-level credentials with a tie for th finish at the Irish Open, ending the week as the leading home competitor.He says: I had a really good year, I put myself into contention a lot which was great. I think I was ready to take that step and I think the way I played, I deserved to get my card in the end with a few good results.ldquoI also managed to play well in a couple of European Tour events as well which showed me that I was ready to take that step. Therersquos a relief that I have my card now but itrsquos only the start of it mdash I know I have to keep improving and moving up the rankings.At the Irish Open he finished ahead of future Open champion Shane Lowry, Ryder Cup star Tommy Fleetwood former world number one Lee Westwood and Ryder Cup captain Padraig Harrington.ldquoIt was disappointing to shoot level-par on Sunday, but I feel like I didnrsquot do much wrong, he said.ldquoIt was really nice to have that pressure of going into the final round of a big European Tour event with a chance to win. It showed me where I was mentally and physically, that I was able to come from the Challenge Tour and compete in a top-level European Tour event.ldquoThat was an unbelievable week. The crowds were incredible and I attracted a big following being the leading Irishman, and that was a great feeling.ldquoItrsquos a nice feeling when hundreds of people are following you and everyone is willing your ball into the hole. I think that really geared me up quite a lot. It was a class buzz.ldquoIt was dficult going back to playing the Challenge Tour in the middle of nowhere in France the week after, but that week gave me the confidence to string together more good results to get off the Challenge Tour.Sharvin admits itrsquos been a slow start on the European Tour, with a tie for th in the Oman Open his bestin four starts this year, but his belief in being able to compete at the higher end of leaderboards remains undimmed.ldquoI feel like my game is good, but I havenrsquot really put all the facets together. ldquoI think in Oman I was second in strokes, gained tee-to-green and just putted really poorly. I played quite nicely in Qatar and just didnrsquot get it going.ldquoItrsquos obviously such a short period of time so itrsquos hard to assess in four events, but I feel like Irsquom close. This break may help me improve other things and hopefully Irsquom a better player when we start again.Given his Walker Cup experience, Sharvin would dearly love to play in the Ryder Cup in the years ahead.ldquoThe Ryder Cup would definitely be up there for me. I grew up playing team sports and have been involved with them my whole le, so that would be huge.ldquoI feel like Irsquom pretty good in a team and having tasted a little success in team sports, I think thatI can get my game to that level, Irsquod be a good asset in that sense..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/8th April 2020 Ballynahinch.jpg","title":"Ballynahinch singer performs at nursing homes  ","story":"A BALLYNAHINCH man is serenading residents in local nursing and residential homes through the COVID- crisis with hit songs to remind them of happier times.The gesture from popular singer Wayne Rodgers is even more laudable as he lost all his work overnight in the lockdown as a driving instructor and a wedding band performer.The  year-old performed outside four homes on Monday, delighting the residents and carers in Redburn Nursing Home, Oakridge Care Home, Spa Nursing Home and Fishbourne House Care Home.Performing classic hits from artists such as Jim Reeves and Clf Richards, Wayne believes his singing is helping strike a chord with the elderly residents who need to be kept apart from family members at this time.ldquoThe singing helps the residents and it really helps me too as it passes the time for me as my work has had to stop due to the virus, said Wayne, who now lives in Bellaghy.ldquoIrsquove received photographs taken from the inside of the home showing residents enjoying my songs and itrsquos lovely to see. It can get really emotional as there are now family members turning up to wave and talk to their relatives through windows while I sing.ldquoItrsquos heartfelt to see their enjoyment at being able to connect with their parents or grandparents inside. It can be heart-breaking at times but itrsquos still nice to see it.ldquoI have been told by some of the carers that they have seen some patients with dementia sing along to the music and thatrsquos also really good to know.A former soloist with St Patrickrsquos Church in Ballynahinch and ex-pupil of St Colmanrsquos High and Sixth Form College, Wayne ensures he keeps the residents and carers safe at all times.A long extension power lead from the home is laid for him before he arrives so he can plug in his mixing desk, microphone and laptop.Wayne said: ldquoItrsquos sterilised before I get it and when I had it back itrsquos sterilised again so I have no direct contact with anyone in the home.ldquoI try not to sing beyond  minutes as the homes often open the windows to allow residents to hear better and Irsquom conscious of not wanting anyone to get too cold in the process.Wayne started off singing at a Magherafelt nursing home when a pub owner hersquos friendly with was approached by the home asking for suggestions at how they could entertain the residents.He added: ldquoThe residents in the home loved it and asked me to come back again so I did and then I got calls from other homes.He now has nine performances under his belt with the help of his brother-in-law, former Newry, Mourne and Down Council chairman Mark Murnin, and his sister, Michelle, who runs Paddy Kellyrsquos Bar in Ballynahinch.Wayne, whose parents Maurice and Naveen still live in Ballynahinch, has been a show band singer for years and once performed with the legendary Sunshine.Gigs for his wedding band, The All Stars, have been cancelled or postponed as couples were force to rebook their wedding dates.Wayne is performing free of charge and says he is happy to as it gives him some focus in his le at this time.ldquoI donrsquot have much  to do as work has stopped, but I do feel a lot better knowing that Irsquom bringing some happiness to others, he added..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/8th April 2020 Binmen.jpg","title":"Binmen receiving thank you messages for essential work  ","story":"THE districtrsquos binmen have been thanked for continuing to provide collection services during the coronavirus pandemic.Some people have been pasting messages on their bins thanking the men for the job they are doing, while their efforts have also been commended by Newry, Mourne and Down Council chairman Charlie Casey.Working in extremely dficult circumstances, the binmen are providing a critical service at this time and their efforts have not gone unnoticed by ratepayers who taking time to wipe the handles of their bins with disinfectant before they are collected to help keep refuse staff safe.Householders are also being reminded to ensure that they continue to place the correct waste in the right bin to help ease the burden on public health services to help stop additional risks to staff who are working under increasing pressure.Refuse collection staff have been singled out for particular praise as they collect and transport waste, with their work also helping to protect the environment.Stormont environment minister Edwin Poots said the materials refuse staff collect for processing such as cardboard, plastic and glass are vital resources in package production across the food and retail sectors, explaining that ain recycling could impact on the supply chain ing effectively.He added: ldquoAll those working in the waste sector are key workers and I have also established a COVID- Waste Group to provide support, guidance and regulatory direction to the waste sector.Newry, Mourne and Down Council mdash which recently closed all its household recycling centres to redeploy staff to work in refuse collection mdash said that all bin collections continue as normal.However, residents are asked to provide additional help by ensuring that bins are put out for collection no later than am every morning or the night before.Where possible, residents are asked not to restrict bin lorry access and park as considerately as possible. Over recent weeks, binmen have experienced issues accessing homes in a number of areas including Ballynahinch and Newcastle to collect bins.Residents are also asked to ensure that all bin handles are cleaned or wiped-down before and after use and not to approach refuse staff without following the minimum two-metre social distancing guidance.Commending refuse staff for the work they are doing in dficult circumstances, the council chairman explained that as the coronavirus crisis unfolded, the local authority was quick to implement a number of health and safety measures to protect staff.He explained that the measures allowed bin collection teams to continue the service with minimal disruptions to residents.ldquoCrews now operate staggered start times between .am and am and are authorised to leave work immediately upon the completion of their rounds, said Cllr Casey.ldquoTo support social distancing, crews are restricted to one driver and one loader in each cab. For crews that operate as one driver and two loaders, the loaders are transported behind the collection lorry in a support vehicle.ldquoLoaders are also asked to limit their time in cabs to an absolute minimum and can be collected and drop-off points along designated routes.Cllr Casey said the local authority is constantly reviewing its services in light of ldquorapidly changing events and may make further changes at very short notice.He said the current situation remains challenging and is dependent on the ongoing impact of COVID- on council employees.The chairman continued: ldquoWe would like to thank all our frontline workers who continue to engage with our residents to deliver essential services.ldquoI fully appreciate the disruption this has had on normal working routines. However, as a workforce and a wider-society we are now having to make signicant changes to our daily lives. I would also like to thank the public for their support and patience during very dficult circumstances.:Cllr Casey added: ldquoWith our household recycling centres now closed to free up resources needed to maintain domestic refuse collection services and help ensure compliance with social distancing guidance, we are appealing to people not to fly-tip and to do their bit to keep the district clean and safe..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/8th April 2020 County.jpg","title":"Down Leisure Centre to be community hub  ","story":"DOWN Leisure Centre has been transformed into a new community co-ordination hub to ensure that vulnerable residents across the district receive essential supplies.Set up by Newry, Mourne and Down Council, the Downpatrick hub is one of three that have been established across the local authority areas.Others have opened in Kilkeel and Newry but the distribution centres are not open to members of the public or community groups.Local council officials have been working in partnership with their colleagues across local government, health trusts and the Department for Communities to set up the hub which is to play a key role in delivering the service on the ground.Down Leisure Centre mdash which has been closed to the public for the past month as a result of global pandemic mdash has been transformed into a processing centre to organise deliveries, with other sites currently being identied should they be required.When fully operational, over  leisure centre staff will be redeployed to work across all sites and work alongside others from across the organisation to help operate a lsquovirtualrsquo hub to coordinate the response.Staff training is currently underway for those who will be working in split shts at the centres while observing social distancing and other safety protocols.The service was formally launched on Monday across the councilrsquos seven even district electoral areas, with deliveries expected to centre on food supplies.In addition, a COVID- community helpline is already operational, with those in vulnerable groups seeking support can make contact between am and pm, seven days a week.The Freephone number is   , while the email is covid@adviceni.net.

It is certainly a strange experience for me.I was ordained in  in Downpatrick. New technologies and new means of communication came after that, and Irsquove struggled ever since. So the recent experience of having to install web-cams at short notice into the three churches in my two parishes of Portaferry and Ballygalget, has been somewhat traumatic.This week is the holiest of weeks for Christians. The passion and death of Jesus is commemorated, in preparation for the resurrection on Easter Sunday. We celebrate this in ious ways. We might well ask ourselves what happened to Lent and how on earth do we celebrate what will seem like a lsquovirtualrsquo Easter Coronavirus suddenly intruded into our Lent, at close quarters, and changed everything.My mother still remembers the glow in the sky over Belfast, when from her home in Ballykinlar, she heard the planes over South Down on their way to blitz Belfast. No doubt her grandmother would have told stories of the terrible pandemic of Spanish Influenza just over a century ago.But my generation and that of my nieces and nephews have known little of such things and we experience this pandemic a grave threat.At the moment of writing, the streets of Portaferry and Downpatrick are entirely empty, as are the great cities of Rome, London and New York.The unexpected severity of lockdown leaves us feeling bewildered, disorientated, shell-shocked. We are acutely aware of the suffering around us mdash illness, hospitalisation, loneliness in sudden isolation. As schools close we are anxious about increased tension in family le. The loss of our work and leisure patterns, financial and employment worries.In the Old Testament Jobloses so much of what he had mdash health, family, possessions and friends mdash yet he refuses to rebel against God in his suffering. This is incredibly dficult for most of us. His attitude of acceptance of his suffering can be of help to us. He says: ldquoShall we receive the good at the hand of God, and not take the bad Jobrsquos story can be useful to us at present. If you can get a chance, read it.Lent mdash an old English word for spring mdash is more challenging this year than we ever expected. As we celebrate Holy Week here are two words that figure in the writings of Henri Nouwen, a Dutch spiritual writer, that I find useful.The first word is security. Where do we look in our lives for security. A basic human need  In success, popularity, money, friends, family, insurance and so on  We mightnrsquot think we do. We will always be influenced by them, but deep down they will never provide us with security.Many of those things are good in themselves, but spiritually, the only true security will be found in the everlasting love of the One who loved us first and who wishes to love us into and for all eternity. Job understood that mdash security.The second word is patience. Patience means a kind of ldquosuffering through the present. Itrsquos from the Latin, patior, which means to suffer. But being patient does not mean sitting back and doing nothing. It is not being passive. Having patience is not easy for us. How do we wait patiently for God this Holy Week, Easter and beyond during this world pandemic Being patient is an active waiting mdash it means a certain experience of suffering through the present moment. To let the seeds of our suffering be sown in the ground so as to grow later into healthy, strong plants.It means avoiding the dead-end of what could have been for the ability to pay attention to what is happening before our very eyes, paying attention to the people and world around us. By that patience, we can begin to catch a glimpse of the first rays of Godrsquos glorious coming.Last week, I personally saw those first rays when I witnessed the staff in a residential nursing home in Portaferry decide to live-in with the residents for as long as this emergency would last.This week I witnessed those first rays when a cousin, a retired doctor, rang me to tell me he was volunteering toto work to bolster the Health Service.In one way or another have we not all been privileged to witness the generosity of spirit, despite danger, of those carers, nurses, doctors, medics, ancillary staff and many others Might this not be for us another glimpse that helps us experience in our present circumstances that Christ is indeed risen and lives now among us  It certainly is a glimpse for me.The Old Testament reading for many of us on Sunday last was from Ezekiel. ldquoThe Lord says this: I am going to open your graves. I mean to raise you from your graves and lead you back to the soil of Israel. I shall put my spirit in you, and you will live, and will know that I, the Lord, have said and done this it is the Lord who speaks.The people of Ezekielrsquos time knew their frailty and experienced uncertainty as we do today. Their faith in God had been severely shaken. Could they start again Security, patience, maybe these two words might stay with us over the next while as the reason for the hope that we have I leave you with the words of a psalm, which St Patrick himself echoed in his own writings, his lsquoConfessionrsquo.The words encourage us to place our hope in the Son of God who will sustain and strengthen us in our days, the Son of God, Jesus, who knew what it was like to stumble and fall beneath the weight of the Cross. With these words I ask God to bless us and keep us safe:ldquoI waited, I waited for the Lord and He stooped down to me, He heard my cry. He drew me from the deadly pit, from the miry clay. He set my foot upon a rock, and made my footsteps firm.With security and patience we can put our trust in the fallen saviour..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/8th April 2020 Huge.jpg","title":"Huge boost for foodbanks  ","story":"THE districtrsquos foodbanks have been provided with a pound, boost by Newry, Mourne and Down Council to help them respond to increasing need during the coronavirus pandemic.The funding has been provided via the local authorityrsquos community network and is one of a series of initiatives the local authority is spearheading to continue providing a range of frontline services and responding to the needs of the vulnerable and elderly in particular.This week, residents across the district have been thanked for adhering to advice to help stop the spread of coronavirus by staying indoors and keeping safe.And, as the Easter weekend approaches, council chief executive Marie Ward has appealed to people to continue to listen to the advice to stay at home and save lives.

","story":"AMBITIOUS plans to redevelop Ardglass harbour could cost in the region of poundm, a new report has revealed.The figure is contained in a detailed consultants report commissioned to undertake an in-depth feasibility study to look at potential developments for the harbour which is home to Northern Irelandrsquos third largest fishing fleet.The key issue the consultants focused on was deepening the harbour to facilitate larger vessels, with work also undertaken to look at improving harbour conditions, berthing pontoons for smaller vessels and increased berthing facilities.In addition, the study included a comprehensive review of possible harbour layouts, historic document research, topographic and bathymetric harbour surveys, quay wall inspection above and below the waterline and computermodelling.The consultants also liaised with the Department for Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairswhich has been given a copy of the consultants report ahead of further discussions with its officials on the way forward.Ardglass has the only all-weather harbour between Howth and Bangor and has three primary areas including the so-called fish dock within the south pier.There is also the Phennick Cove marina located behind a breakwater mdash which could be extended mdash to the west of the main harbour which can accommodate up to  leisure craft and the inner harbour which dries out at low tide.The consultants say that the inner harbour is particularly useful for vessel maintenance but not utilised as extensively as the outer harbour due to limited water depth.Last August, ious concept layouts produced by consultants were reviewed by members of the Ardglass Harbour Developments group which has been set up to oversee the regeneration of the port. The concepts were subsequently amended in November.The prime focus is on deepening the harbour and moving forward, a cost effective approach may be to zone dredge levels in particular areas.The report suggests deepening the outer harbour by nine metres and the area adjacent to Cochranersquos building at the inner harbour by two metres to facilitate crab vessels.In addition, consideration is being given to creating a pontoon with so-called finger berths adjacent to the quay wall in front of Cochranersquos with gangway access for crab vessels. No leisure craft would be permitted at this part of the harbour.Removal of the existing slipway at the southern end of the harbour adjacent to the beach is suggested as it is not generally used and considered too deep for access, with potential issues in relation to the removal of an area know as Church Rock to be investigated.Quay reclamation work is suggested between the north west corner of the existing finger pier at the ice plant and north western tip of the fish market quay.This would feature a new piled quay, backfilled and surfaced with a heavy duty concrete. Extending theof the quay wall by  metres is also suggested.The estimated cost of the harbour dredging is in the region of pound, with piling work and the new quay line and reclamation work estimated at poundm and poundm respectively.The breakwater extension is estimated at pound.m with the new pontoon facility estimated at pound,.The consultantsrsquo report makes it clear that the costings include primary construction elements but does not include licensing fees, site investigation, engineering design and tendering costs.Before anything happens, a marine licence is required for specic site investigation work, rock quality design and testing, sediment sampling of overburden, contamination testing and an environmental impact assessment.The regeneration jigsaw also requires detailed design work and planning approval ahead of tendering and construction.An economic appraisal may also be required.News of the proposed investment at Ardglass harbour comes after the portrsquos importance to the Ardglass fishing industry to the district and wider South Down economy was highlighted during a recent meeting with Stormont fisheries minister Edwin Poots.He met with South Down MLA Colin McGrath and local councillor Dermot Curran to discuss planned improvement work at the harbour, with the politicians also highlighting the need for additional investment in the harbour and its infrastructure.They described Ardglass harbour as ldquostrategically important for the Co Down fishing fleet, highlighting its crucial role in driving the South Down economy and its location as a central hub for processing fish landed at the port.Mr McGrath and Cllr Curran say further investment is ldquocritical to allow Ardglass harbour to expand to provide an economic boost, not only for the village but the wider area, and create new jobs..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/8th April 2020 Mourning.jpg","title":"Please stay in  ","story":"ldquoHE was my superman ndash the moving words from Loughinisland woman Maria Farrell whose father sadly lost his battle with COVID-.As her sister also lies in hospital fighting the virus, the mother-of-two has bravely spoken out to warn others not to be complacent about the deadly disease.Maria, who buried her father on Sunday, warned: ldquoIf you think you are exempt from this or you are immune to COVID-, you are barking up the wrong tree.ldquoMy dad went really quickly, hersquos tackled prostate cancer, heart attacks, falls, you name ithellip and hersquos bounced back.

I have been transported to a time that has changed my perception of le forever.People with CF have a faulty gene which means the mucus in their bodies is much thicker and stickier than in other people.They donrsquot catch viruses more easily than other people but when they do, it affects their lungs by causing inflammation and increasing the amount of the sticky mucus. This makes bacterial chest infections more likely, some of which are resistant to antibiotics, leading to a decline in lungwhich is the leading cause of death in people with CF.As parents, for the first sixth months of Lorcaacutenrsquos le we were consumed with the fear. We were advised not to visit baby groups, not to let people with colds into the house, not to take him to the supermarket on a weekend when it was busy, not to let him play in soil, wet sand, or day-old playdough as well as taking many, many more precautions to keep him safe.We also discovered that my mother-in-lawrsquos COPD and my fatherrsquos bronchiectasis meant that Lorcaacuten would always have to be careful around his beloved Nana and Grandad in case he caught an infection from them. For the same reason, he could never be within six feet of someone  with CF because of the risk of cross infection. My world would never mdash could never mdash be the same.We rarely left the house. I gave up my job in the RSPB and postponed my studies. Much of our time was taken up with the heavy burden of treatment for CF, including daily physiotherapy and antibiotics. I spent a lot of time campaigning for a cystic fibrosis drug, Orkambi, to be made available on the NHS.And I cried a lot.Over the last three years, le has become more lsquonormalrsquo but beneath the joy of every milestone has been the fear of taking risks that could shorten Lorcaacutenrsquos le at any time.During this time we have learnt that there are some risks you need to take in order to be happy. Lorcaacuten began pre-school as well as swimming, gymnastics, and football classes and I resumed my studies and began working a few hours a week.There has been a lot of stress and sleepless nights, a lot of handwashing, and a lot of happiness. With the support of the public we won the campaign for Orkambi, a drug which can slow the decline in lungby up to % and can be taken by around half of people with CF. Lorcaacuten started taking it at the end of last December mdash the champagne was popped and finally we thought we could start to relax a little.Sadly it wasnrsquot for long. During the wait for Orkambi, Lorcaacutenrsquos lungs had become damaged, after catching a couple of colds in March, he ended up in the wonderful Royal Belfast Hospital for Sick Children for  days of IV antibiotics to treat a long standing chest infection.During those  days I watched the horrying news that COVID- was spreading. I grew ever more disturbed at the lack of action by the UK Government. How could our amazing health service, stripped bare by  years of austerity and cuts, possibly hold up under the strain of COVID- Lorcaacuten was moved to a room further away from other patients, masks appeared and I watched the eyes of the incredible staff in the hospital become more and more tense.With nearly every death I read that the patient was either elderly or had an underlying health condition. But why did that make it OK: Surely that made it worse  The message seemed to be that lsquoonlyrsquo the vulnerable were at risk but other peoplersquos lsquoonlyrsquo is my everything.As the days in hospital passed, I learned that the lung conditions of my son, mother-in-law, and father put them among the , in NI on the extremely vulnerable list. They would need to lsquoshieldrsquo for the next  weeks. Shielding means not leaving the house at all and having to rely on the government and the goodness of others to deliver medication and food to your door.When Lorcaacuten was able to leave the hospital, we arrived home mdash with great relief mdash to a lockdown. Once again, with no job to go to and my studies on hold, I am transported to those months of isolation three years ago.This time, however, it is dferent, because this time I have hope. For us, this too shall pass. We willto the normality so hard won in our lives. We, unlike so many others who will lose their lives, will have this as a memory to pass on. I let so much of Lorcaacutenrsquos infancy be marred by fear that I just canrsquot let it happen now. Every day I am thankful for my good fortune in a desperately unfair world. I am thankful for all the frontline workers and volunteers, for the Executive finally working together for the common good to sustain us and to protect the most vulnerable in society, for the kindness of people delivering food and medication to those most at risk.I am grateful to the other souls sitting in their homes feeling helpless and feeling like le is passing them by. But by feeling helpless we are helping more people have a le toto after this all ends.It will end but the world will never mdash can never mdash be the same and none of us will look at it in the same way either.Maybe it will be a world in which those who need support will begin to get it, a world in which our NHS will finally be built up rather than worn down, a world we protect rather than profit from. As I watch Lorcaacuten run happily and healthily around our safe home with his little sister, Saorla, I donrsquot feel fear for him. I feel fear for those putting their lives at risk for all of us, for those who will lose their lives and loved ones, and for those who are sitting in their homes feeling afraid.I often think that doing nothing is the hardest thing to do, but for the moment doing otherwise is a risk too great to take, for us all.

To help overcome this a new mobile telephone number is available mdash  .Good Morning Down was established to help reduce loneliness and isolation. Volunteers also signpost those who need further support to other agencies.Good Morningrsquos Down service has never been more important. One of the charityrsquos volunteers, Aidan Harris, says the current climate represents a challenge for everyone, particularly those who live alone.ldquoThe staff moved out of our base at the business park over two weeks ago, but we are providing the service from our own homes and what we are doing is very much appreciated by those we contact every week, he explained.ldquoWe certainly are living in unprecedented times none of us have ever experienced anything like this in our letimes and hopefully will never do again.Aidan explained that while a lot of information people need to hear is circulated via social media, many elderly people do not have access to it. In the main, he said they are relying on the television and radio.ldquoWe are letting them know what is happening and reinforcing the message to stay indoors and not let anyone into their home, even their own relatives. We are highlighting the importance of them doing all that they can not to catch the virus, the charity volunteer continued.ldquoPeople are very concerned at what is going on and many of those whom we contact used to get out to attend ious clubs but they have all closed due to the pandemic which means the elderly and vulnerable are spending even longer alone in their homes.Aidan also revealed that some who normally received only one call a week are now getting several more, with people brought off the waiting list so they can be contacted.He also revealed that the charity is also providing the people they contact with details about local shops which are providing a delivery service.ldquoWe are emphasising the hand hygiene message as much as we can and reminding people to stay indoors. We are also telling them to exercise social distancing and not let anyone into their homes, he said.ldquoWe are also telling those whom we contact not even to let one of their neighbours over the door as it is simply too risky. The people whom we contact are very concerned about what is going on but they are made of stern stuff.Aidan added: ldquoAll the volunteers are working hard to make sure we maintain contact with our clients, more regularly than in the past by increasing the number of calls we make to them.ldquoThe reward is how grateful they are for the service we provide and our main goal is do all we can to let them know that we are here for them and want them to keep safe..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.impartialreporter.com/news/ource srcset=/resources/images/11221837.jpg?htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"latest figures reveal island trend","story":"Latest statistics show that in the Fermanagh and Omagh District region the number of positive cases rose to  with a total of  positive cases across Northern Ireland.Health Minister, Robin Swann explained that there is likely to be a second surge of the virus later in the year: ldquoEven then, a reasonable worst case scenario would involve signicant loss of le in Northern Ireland.

Performance of the Oberammergau Passion Play : Freelance“The nd Oberammergau Passion Play will be postponed due to the current situation caused by the corona pandemic.”In the Baian district of Germany, beside the Ammer River and framed by the Ammergau Alps, Oberammergau is a small town known for its woodcarvings, its NATO School and its internationally renowned -yearly Passion Play.The organisers of the Passion Play summarised the historical signicance of the postponement, explaining that the event “goes back to a vow made in . At that time, the people of Oberammergau vowed to perform the suffering, death and resurrection of Christ,no one died of the plague anymore.Engraving depicting the Passion Play in  : Freelance \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

Therefore the plans to perform the Passion Play in  are currently beginning.”Held in the ‘decimal year’I attended a performance in , one of the most vivid and moving experiences of my letime, and indeed, I had toyed with the thought of ing this year.There would have been  performancesstarting in mid-May with an expected , visitors from around the globe paying between € to € for a ticket.The enormous production has been running since  except for two cancellations and a postponement.Crucixion scene in the Passion Play in  : FreelanceNearly half of the , residents of today’s Oberammergau are involved with the show - actors, musicians, front of house, backstage and looking after the horses, sheep, goats, cows and doves that add to the often intensely dramatic scenes.The other half of the townsfolk run the restaurants, shops, hotels, BBs and farmsteads where many of the visitors stay,they’re lucky.The nearest accommodation I could get in  was St. Anton am Arlberg in the Austrian Tirol.Participants in the production must have been born in Oberammergau or have lived there for  years.Oberammergau on the River Ammer in  : FreelanceIt’s not unusual for up to four generations of the same family to be taking part in the same run of plays, which can involve around  children on stage at the same time.In the th century, passion plays were held in many parts of Europe, often performed on carts in the street.They re-enacted Christ’s last days, from his entry into Jerusalem to his trial, crucixion, resurrection and ascension.In the bigger and more elaborate productions, when scene one ended the cart trundled off to another part of the town or city and scene two arrived, and so on!They were the ‘poor man’s Bible’ enabling even the most illiterate become familiar with Bible stories.But Oberammergau’s is the only play with its origins in a collective vow to God which has run, almost without a break, for approaching four centuries. This unique double-accolade brought the town a UNESCO World Heritage award.It’s quite likely that passion plays were already common events but a document in Oberammergau’s archives records “the first decades of the th century went by in peaceful calm…but then followed the Thirty Years’ War with all its hardships from  until . As early as , infectious diseases spread in Baia. This village was spared by dutul vigilance until the church festival in , when a man brought the plague into the village.”More than  local folk died and almost every family lost loved ones.“Faced with the great distress that the terrible illness inflicted upon the population,” the archive continues, “the leaders of the community came together and pledged to hold a passion tragedy once every ten years. From this day forward, not a single person perished, even though a great number of them still showed signs of the plague”.They made the pledge in  and the Passion Play was first performed at Pentecost in , on a wooden stage that some say was built on plague-victims’ graves near the church.Surviving documentation from the  production shows that the play ran ‘completed smoothly’ with seating provided ‘for spectators standing close by.’From  the date of the performance was changed to the beginning of each decade, by which time folk were coming from all over Germany to see substantial productions.Paint and painters for the  show’s scenery cost  guilders, ‘the gentlemen trumpeters’ got two guilders and  guilders went ‘to the actors for drink’!There was no performance in  when Maximilian III’s Clerical Council banned all passion plays and when another threat loomed in the s the so-called ‘mad’ King Ludwig II of Baia protected it from those who wanted to close down the ‘harmful’ passion plays. Following WWI the play was postponed until , and there was a special th anniversary show in  attended by Adolf Hitler.There were no performances in  during WWII, just the second cancellation…until now.Plans to perform the Passion Play in  are already under way, for over  five-hour shows, several thousand participants, a -strong orchestra and a -strong choir.\"\"Get the latest news on the CoronavirusWe have launched a daily public interest bulletin to deliver all the updates and vital information to your inboxSign Up Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-bEjcJn boXdXt\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-fOICqy kfiVLF\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-bEjcJn boXdXt\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-fOICqy kfiVLF\"This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us onExploreNewsSportIrish League FootballWhats OnLestyleFarming LeMore from the News LetterAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryLocal GuideReader ShopUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter\" fill\"#ea\"©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-bYSBpT sc-elJkPf kHpvMx\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policy Sign in\"Edit AccountSign OutSubscribeNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessEducationHealthPeopleRead ThisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"SportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoNightleRetroLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"LestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessCoronavirusFollow us \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

I think they’re maybe more likely to comply with their unusual or unprecedented restrictions on their movements.”He also said that the relative lack of large cities in Northern Ireland “would be a factor certainly”, adding: “You look at where we’re getting the bulk of our cases – they are happening around the predominately urban areas, Belfast in particular.”When it comes to when the current restrictions may be lted, Dr Waldron said: “It’s really, really hard to say. It’s going to be driven by so many things. I think it’s going to last well in to May at least. But what do I know ”What will aid hugely isthe UK gets antibody tests.These screen people to seethey have had Covid-, helping scientists identy those with some degree of immunity and who are no longer infectious.But this is “a way off” yet, said Dr Waldron.And as for a vaccine, that goal remains a “long, long way off”.THE RAW NUMBERS: NI makes up roughly .% of the UK population.But it accounts for only about % of the Covid- deaths in the UK.And as well as a lower death rate than the UK, the number of overall Covid- cases is disproportionately low too.Out of all UK-wide cases, NI made up .% of the total at time of writing yesterday .A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

It will cut planned capital spending to pound million from a budget of pound million and will work to grow online.MS said in a statement: \"Whilst we remain confident that the post-crisis future of the business and our transformation programme remains as strong as ever, trading over the next nine to  months in our clothing and home and international businesses is likely to be severely impacted.\"As a result, it is not possible to provide meaningful guidance on future earnings, although we are taking every step to secure future value for shareholders, colleagues and suppliers.\"The chairman of Wetherspoon has said that a decline in sales was accelerated when prime minister Boris Johnson told people to stay away from pubs.After rising in previous weeks, sales fell by . per cent in the week to March  and the slowdown has picked up further since the Prime Ministers statement, Tim Martin said.It came as the business reported profit before tax rose  per cent to pound. million in the half-year to January  on revenue of pound million.Health secretary Matt Hancock has warned that coronavirus will keep spreading as long as people continue to socialise.Speaking on talkRadio, Mr Hancock said: \"If you stay at home you are saving lives.\"I know, of course, this is a more dangerous disease for older people but not exclusively, some young people get it too.\"But, more importantly, the more that people continue to go out and continue to socialise, the more it will spread and the longer were going to have to keep these measures in place.\"So, were urging people to follow the public health advice.In the emergency Bill thats in front of Parliament right now, we are taking the powers to be able to enforce these measures, so we can make it happen by lawwe need to.\"Id rather not do that and the evidence so far is that the vast majority of people are following the advice, are doing what is sensible and right.\"The company said it was cancelling its interim idend, which had been p a year earlier.Mr Martin said: \"It is obviously very dficult to predict, in these circumstances, how events will unfold in future weeks and months, but we now anticipate profits being below market expectations, so long as the current health scare continues.\"As a result of this uncertainty, it is impossible to provide realistic guidance on our performance in the remainder of the financial year.\"The company has decided to delay most capital projects and to reduce expenditure, where possible, including the cancellation of the interim idend.\"As a result of these actions, combined with the Governments proposals on business rates relief and credit guarantee facilities, the company believes it has sufficient liquidity to maintain operations at a substantially lower level of sales.\"Nicola Sturgeon has urged anyone who left the medical profession in the past three years to consider ing to help the fight against coronavirus.Sharing a plea from Scotlands chief nursing officer Fiona McQueen, the First minister tweeted: \"Scotlands NHS needs our help to meet the #coronavirus challenge.\"Mr Hancock said some retired medics whoto work in the NHS to fight the coronavirus will be able to come \"straight back in\".Asked on the BBCs Breakfast programme when workers couldto the NHS, he said: \"Well, over the next couple of weeks because for some theyll have very recently left and they can come straight back in, their annual trainings been up-to-date and they can just restart.\"Imagineyouve left at Christmas, for instance, you can restart straight away.

The training will happen for those who need it over the next couple of weeks, at the same time well allocate people to a hospital near them because theres a logistical exercise here as well.\"Mr Hancock suggested that tougher measures could have to be brought inpeople do not follow the Governments advice.He told the BBCs Breakfast programme: \"What I can say is thatpeople follow the advice, stay home which saves lives andthey keep apart from others, more than two metres, more than six foot, then we can tackle this and we can turn the tide.\"The scientists advise that we can turn the tide in  weekspeople follow the advice.\"If people dont follow the advice, then itll be longer and we might have to bring more and tougher measures.\"He added: \"We have brought these measures in earlier than Italy did in terms of where theyre up to with the number of cases.\"But were absolutely clear thatwe need to, we have the powers, in fact weve got a Bill in front of Parliament now to strengthen those powers further.\"But I think its far betterpeople follow the advice.\"The FTSE  has risen by more than five per cent in early trading as travel companies jump out ahead after a bruising few weeks for the sector sparked by the Covid- pandemic.Intercontinental Hotels jumped by about a fth despite revealing that demand for rooms was the worst it had ever seen, as markets opened on Friday.EasyJet also rose by around  per cent and cruise operator Carnival jumped by around . per cent.Meanwhile, the price of a barrel of Brent crude oil joined the rally, rising five per cent to . dollarsafter a massive fall earlier in the week.Shadow chancellor John McDonnell has warned about the prospect of a recessionpeople do not receive their wages.Labour has urged the Government to ensure the salaries of workers are protected as businesses lose trade during the coronavirus pandemic.He told the BBCs Breakfast programme: \"We need the Government now to act to protect people to keep them in their jobs.\"In that way, what well be able to do is ensure people have an income coming in, their job will be protected, but we prevent the second wave of a recession hitting uswere not careful.\"Becausepeople lose their jobs, they dont have their wages, demand collapses in the economy and then you really do have a recession.\"The lesson from past crises like these is act fast and act big, so thats why were saying the Government should step in and say to employers, well cover  per cent of your wages, you keep people in work.\"Demand for a room at Intercontinental Hotels has reached its lowest point in history, the group said, as the travel industry continues to be battered by the coronavirus pandemic.The business revealed that it would be cutting costs, eliminating its idend and reducing salaries in a bid to save cash.However, shares in the group, which have been badly hit in recent months, jumped by around  per cent on market open in London as investors reacted positively to the companys proposals.Chief executive Keith Barr said: \"Demand for hotels is currently at the lowest levels weve ever seen.Intercontinental Hotel Group has a robust business model and the measures we are announcing today to reduce costs and preserve cash give us the capacity to manage the business through this unique environment and to support our owners during this incredibly dficult time.\"These were not easy choices and we are mindful of the impact these decisions will have on our colleagues and shareholders.\"However, we believe that these are essential to ensuring that we come out of this as strong as we possibly can and ready to capitalise on what remains an industry with excellent long-term growth potential.\"Geoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders , said the list of key workers to whom schools will remain open is \"perhaps more extensive than we might have expected\".He said: \"Realistically, theywill need to identy these children by lunchtime.\"Mr Barton added: \"We already know from the trajectory of this that were not going to have many staff.\"We have to be careful that the message to parents is not business as usual.\"Matt Hancock said that a communication will be sent to around . million people who are classed as vulnerable to set out specic action for them to take.The Health secretary told Sky News: \"The first thing were going to do is set out exactly what conditions that applies to.\"We expect about . million people to then get a communication from the NHS to say that they are part of this and what they need to do.\"Many of these people have pre-existing health conditions and so will be very worried right now, and I understand that, and theyll need very specic sets of action - for instance, how do you go about still getting your chemoyou have cancer whilst also social-distancing \"If you have cancer its particularly important to stay away from other people, but you also of course have got to keep going with your chemotherapy.\"He added: \"These are some of the most dficult and challenging cases so well be getting in contact with them, butpeople think that they are on this list and dont receive a communication from the NHS, then they also need to get in contact.\"So that is under way, the money was announced for it yesterday.\"A combination of money to the NHS and money to councils because theyve got a very big part to play in keeping people safe.\"ASCL general secretary Geoff Barton said schools will have first worked to identy vulnerable children, as they will know who they are, and will then be looking at the \"key worker\" category.He said the ASCL is telling members: \"You have to do your best to negotiate the key workers list. Youre doing this to a tight timescale, and what you offer children on Monday may be dferent to what you offer next Wednesday.\"Mr Barton said that initially, schools will be doing all they can so that pupils who need to can still turn up to their own school after the weekend.In the longer term, there will be more strategic planning of school provision, he added.Paul Whiteman, general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers , said: \"The Government has made clear that every child who can be safely cared for at home should be. And their advice makes clear too that this applies to children of key workers.\"For the vast majority of children and young people, school buildings will close tonight and not reopen for the foreseeable future.\"Taking up a place at school during this time of wider closure is the offer of last resort, for the minority of key workers, who have no alternative.\"School leaders have many questions that remain unanswered about how this will work in practice. We will continue to work with the Government throughout the day to provide greater clarity to schools to enable this reduced offer to be up and running as soon as possible.\"Dr Mary Bousted, joint general secretary of the National Education Union, added her voice to calls from school leaders urging parents to only send their children in as a last resort.She said: \"This is a very long list and could result in some schools having the majority of pupils attending. This will not achieve the goal of slowing the spread of the virus.\"So it is vitally important that parents follow government advice to keep their children at home, wherever possible. Schools can only accommodate a limited number of children and the fewer children making the journey to school, and the fewer children in educational settings, the lower the risk that the virus can spread.\"The competition watchdog has launched a taskforce to tackle businesses looking to exploit the coronavirus outbreak to take advantage of customers.The Competition and Markets Authoritysaid the outbreak has prompted concerns that people could be exploited by companies \"charging excessive prices or making misleading claims about their products\".It said it has already contacted traders and s over excessive pricing of hand sanitiser as part of its efforts.Andrea Coscelli, the CMAs chief executive, said: \"This is obviously a time when we all have to behave responsibly to protect our fellow citizens, and particularly those who are most vulnerable.\"We urge retailers to behave responsibly in the exceptional circumstances of the Covid- outbreak.\"Butthey do not, our taskforce is monitoring market developments to enable us to intervene as quickly as possible.\"We have a range of options at our disposal, from warnings to enforcement action to seeking emergency powers.\"The ceremonial of the Changing of the Guard at Buckingham Palace, St Jamess Palace and Windsor Castle is being postponed until further notice \"in line with Government advice to avoid mass gatherings\", Buckingham Palace has announced.The palace said in a statement that the situation would be \"reviewed on an ongoing basis, with a view to restarting when appropriate\". article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.
