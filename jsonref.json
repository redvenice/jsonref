If you ask somebody to leave you give them the required notice, which in this case was two months.\u0027 Asked about being reported to the police, Ken said: \u0027I was quite surprised about that.\u0027We were having discussions - if she wants to complain about it then that\u0027s up to her.\u0027\u0027I can\u0027t really say anything more. I\u0027m sure it will resolve itself in the next few days.\u0027I\u0027m not vindictive towards her and I am not unsympathetic for her.\u0027Lancashire Police confirmed a call was made to them on Tuesday at 3.30pm following the row.A spokesman said: \u0027From our point of view no offence has been committed.

He\u0027s become a nightmare.\u0027  Ken insisted he acted after the council highlighted problems with the property.He said: \u0027It said what needed doing and we did it immediately.\u0027Asked if he will take her to court, Ken added: \u0027We hope we don\u0027t reach that point.\u0027I don\u0027t dislike her. I\u0027m sorry it\u0027s ended up like this as we\u0027ve had quite a good relationship.\u0027I got on very well with her.

That faith was a little bit crushed, so that was really painful for a lot of people,\u0027 he said.                The Horizon programme on tonight follows staff trying to fix problems such as data leaksIn a glimpse of Facebook\u0027s creative approach, staff are seen skateboarding through the office and amusing themselves with games rooms and table-tennis tables.During a talk, Mr Oser says: \u0027When we give feedback, we give feedback in a way that is constructive, but we don\u0027t believe in being a***holes. That\u0027s straight up, we just don\u0027t tolerate d***s.\u0027Defending the social media giant\u0027s risk-taking approach, he said firms such as Facebook \u0027have to encourage people to take risks and be willing to fail because otherwise you\u0027re just not going to achieve anything\u0027.Some staff still subscribe to the optimistic early-2000s vision of the Internet as a force for good in the world. One lab manager, Allan, said he was \u0027driven\u0027 by the ideal of \u0027democratised access to information\u0027.Monika Bickert, the company\u0027s head of global policy management, said: \u0027When I came to Facebook I had been living overseas and dealing with international law for some time.\u0027One thing I didn\u0027t anticipate was how difficult it is to craft rules that work at our size with the volume of content we see every day, we get millions of reports every week, and so we need to craft rules that can be enforced fairly, and quickly and efficiently around the world.\u0027We want Facebook to be a place that people want to come. At our scale, even if we get it right 99 per cent of the time, that still means we\u0027re making thousands of mistakes every day. And every one of those mistakes is important to somebody.\u0027                 Huge rows of servers and shelves full of cables and equipment are seen at the company\u0027s base         Staff are tasked with fighting hacking issues which have threatened to bring down the firm         Top engineers are trying to build unique systems to help Facebook become even biggerAnother insider said: \u0027This is a new world. Everything we\u0027re doing is brand new. And that comes with painful learning.\u0027Mark Zuckerberg\u0027s firm has hired thousands of new engineers and reviewers but there is too much content for humans to police it all.Facebook staff also say that users are \u0027getting more creative\u0027 despite their efforts to crack down on online abuse.In one example that was shown in the documentary, staff looked at a post in which the abuse consisted entirely of emojis: a series of guns pointing at a symbol of two men holding hands, in what was clearly meant as a homophobic comment.Similarly, Facebook\u0027s artificial intelligence (AI) software can detect faces and clear images of child pornography, but cannot yet interpret the meaning and context behind posts.For example, the famous picture of a young girl running from a napalm attack during the Vietnam war could appear to an image of child sex abuse if taken out of context.Facebook staff revealed they now want to bridge that gap, teaching AI how to interpret human emotions and body language.\u0027As time goes by that technology is getting better and better and I think we\u0027ll continue to use it more and more,\u0027 Ms Bickert said.          Among its areas of research are training artificial intelligence to analyse human movement          Guy Rosen is a vice-president at Facebook, overseeing its work on safety and integrity          Mark Zuckerberg\u0027s company has grown to be worth an estimated $500billion in just 15 years         The California-based company has been hit by a series of scandals over the past few years         A Facebook employee takes part in a hackathon to collaborate on computer programmingFacebook staff said they were still hoping to expand, with projects which would make the social network even more indispensable for its users.In one project run by the company\u0027s Social Good department, people looking to donate blood can be linked to people who need it.The service is free, but cannot be accessed without a Facebook account, making users ever more dependent on the platform – and there are fears the blood donation system could be exploited by the black market.Similarly, Facebook staff say they receive daily requests from police departments to put out alerts for missing children.Facebook is also laying thousands of miles of fibre optic cable under the sea to improve connectivity between the data centres, and building new offices around the world to house its growing workforce.           Messages written on a whiteboard in part of Facebook\u0027s nerve centre in Silicon Valley          Hema Budaraju is the health product manager at Facebook and features in the programme         The episode includes a talk given by Jonny Oser from Facebook\u0027s global communication teamIn a disastrous period for Facebook the firm has been hacked, fined and faced waves of criticism over its role in enabling the spread of misinformation online.  In September last year, Facebook acknowledged that another data breach affected 50million users.Two weeks later, the company said that data belonging to 29million other users had been stolen.Facebook has also been criticised for allowing users to spread terrorist propaganda and child abuse online.Earlier this month the UK Competition and Markets Authority placed Facebook in its crosshairs with a major probe into the online advertising industry.It will examine if Facebook and Google abuse their control of customers\u0027 data to exclude competition and overcharge advertisers, who pass on costs to consumers.Germany has also cracked down on Facebook\u0027s data collection, banning it from combining data from WhatsApp, Instagram and websites that use its \u0027like\u0027 button.            Last year a major security flaw at Facebook exposed the personal details of 50million people         Mr Oser talked in the documentary about giving feedback \u0027in a way that is constructive\u0027         Fresh efforts to tackle scam ads across Facebook are being introduced in the UK today"},{"url":null,"title":"Bulls 2 Man 0 Bull runner gets completely taken animal Spanish festival","story":"          The horrifying moment the man is trapped between two enraged cows at a bull-running event in Moratalla, Murcia, southeast SpainThe unnamed man runs towards the fence and manages to side-step the advances of one heifer, but spins into the path of another which sends him flying.At one point, he appears to be trapped between two cows trying to gore him from opposite directions.The first heifer then uses its horns to toss the man around near the fence as spectators scream in shock.

The catastrophic injuries mean that David will need life-long care. His life has changed and so has the lives of those closet to him.\u0027His parents home will need to be remodelled for disability access, specialised treatment and new treatments will need to be explored and of course many other unforseen expenses covered.

They may be the most energy-efficient houses ever built in the UK. Could this be the start of proper social housing? Rows of glossy black tiles glisten in the afternoon sun, dripping down the facades like a neatly controlled oil slick. They cap a long row of milky brick houses, whose walls curve gently around the corners at the end of the street, dissolving into perforated brick balustrades, marking the presence of hidden rooftop patios. A planted alley runs between the backs of the terraced houses, dotted with communal tables and benches, where neighbours are sitting down to an outdoor meal.London-based architects Mikhail Riches and Cathy Hawley first won the competition for the site in 2008. The council’s intention had been to sell the site to a local housing provider, but these plans were scuppered by the financial crisis. In 2012, the city took the brave step of deciding to develop the site itself. It was a big risk: it hadn’t built homes for decades. Ever since the Tory government of the 1980s prevented councils from reinvesting funds from the sale of their council flats into building new housing, it had lacked the resources to do so. But, like a growing number of local authorities, Norwich found a way, using a mix of borrowing, funds from its housing revenue account, some right-to-buy receipts and council reserves.“It’s already won lots of awards, which is lovely, and other councils are really envious, but that’s not the point,” says Gail Harris, the Labour council’s deputy leader and cabinet member for social housing. “It’s about people having good quality homes and low fuel bills. And we plan to build a lot more.” In 2015, the city set up its own wholly owned housebuilding outfit, Norwich Regeneration Company, which has several other sites under way, and the council is planning to establish an additional fund to acquire sites and allow it to respond more quickly. In Goldsmith Street, the bar has been set high.The architects won the original competition because they were one of the few firms to propose streets, rather than slabs of apartment blocks. They took inspiration from the city’s Golden Triangle, a desirable neighbourhood of Victorian terraced houses. This provided a useful lesson on density: planning rules would usually require at least 21 metres between facing homes, to prevent overlooking, but these popular historic terraces were just 14 metres apart. The architects used the precedent to argue that this new neighbourhood could be just as humanely scaled, while fitting in more homes.The project might take its street width from the Victorians, but there is no pastiche. With generous windows, handsome brick details and bin stores cleverly hidden behind perforated bronzed screens, the homes are a smartly tailored arrival to the area of mostly postwar blocks of flats. Their rooftops are precisely angled to ensure that, even in winter, each terrace will not block sunlight from the windows of the row behind.David Mikhail, of Mikhail Riches, was initially apprehensive when the council suggested the Passivhaus route. “Most existing examples are pretty ugly: rendered boxes with small north-facing windows.” In the architecture world, Passivhaus is a byword for clunky boxes with fat rendered walls and tiny windows, representing a kind of socks-and-sandals, ironed hair-shirt approach to design. But Goldsmith Street shows that it doesn’t have to be so grim.“It’s onerous in a good way,” Mikhail admits, explaining how the homes had to undergo three airtightness tests during and after construction. “One pinprick in a membrane can destroy the whole thing. At one point, the builders had to go around with thermal imaging camera to find one small tear. There’s no cutting corners.” It means that heating bills should be just £150 a year, a boon when fuel poverty is a major issue.There are additional chance benefits, too. Passivhaus means windows have to be raised up around half a metre from the ground, which happens to be a good height for a little window seat. Other clever interior touches include an intelligent use of the space beneath the canted rooftops, where day-lit first-floor landings provide a space for a study nook, home office or play area, while the upstairs flats have been cleverly designed with interlocking stairs so that each has a door on to the street.It seems the only thing stopping Norwich, and other energetic councils, from doing more is central government rules. “There is a lot of rhetoric about needing more homes, but they should do more to help us,” says Harris. “They’ve lifted the borrowing cap, but we’re still losing a huge number of homes through right to buy.’"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/43c3ff9695421c02b27bd2ae7bb9903a8c8a50fa/0_0_5973_4480/master/5973.jpg?width=700\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=a7130364b50e11d44ca88b1483b522f9 1400w","title":"real life film noir scenes from the lapd in pictures","story":"Crime scene photographs shot by Los Angeles police officers in the line of duty between 1925 and the 1970s are on show at the city’s Lucie Foundation.

He added that rail franchising had “had its day”.Williams said he would deliver final proposals in the autumn for “revolution not evolution”.Speaking at a Northern Powerhouse event in Bradford, Williams indicated that overhauling the industry structure, its fares system, customer service and franchising were all part of his thinking.Williams said the immediate circumstances that had prompted transport secretary Chris Grayling to commission the review last year – the timetable chaos, budget overruns and delays on major investment projects, plus the collapse of the Virgin Trains East Coast franchise – were “all symptomatic of deeper, more fundamental issues”.He said the railway was “not set up to be flexible, lead or adapt to major change”.Williams said that the scale of change necessary would mean a different role for the Department for Transport, adding that “the government will have to step back from the railway”.He hinted at further devolution for a railway “anchored in the regions and communities”, and called for a “new passenger offer” including better compensation, information and customer service, driven by performance measures to change railway culture.Fares and ticketing should be overhauled, he said, but warned that reform would “require tough decisions” and “create winners and some losers”.Williams said a new industry structure, better aligning track and train and creating clear accountability was needed. He affirmed the need for “a greater distance between government and running the day-to-day railway” and said he was “looking closely” at the -possibility of a new body governing at arm’s length – although he added that there were “difficult questions” about its scope and place.Meanwhile, he ruled out giving Network Rail control over the trains as well as track: “You don’t create a customer-focused railway by putting engineers in charge.”Train operators and suppliers welcomed Williams’ suggestion of an arms-length body. Labour said it backed such a body, “removed from government interference and micromanagement”, but said Williams “misses the point” and it should be all in public ownership.“Continuing with private train operators subject to performance-related payments means sticking with a failed, unaccountable and disjointed railway,” said Andy McDonald, the shadow transport secretary."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1529761e010891417d28db7a564b12101d61146e/0_309_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=886d0a9e384d2cce29f0e0983bd8894b","title":"for the pound there is little or no short term cheer","story":"Predicting currency flow is a mug’s game but there’s little to stop sterling’s slide anytime soonThere are no sure-fire bets in the currency markets but, in retrospect, selling sterling has been a ridiculously easy trade for two months. The direction for sterling has been downwards from the moment Theresa May lost her third attempt to force through the EU withdrawal bill in early May. The Tory leadership contest, in which both contenders have issued hard Brexit statements, has merely continued the losing run. We have now arrived at a two-year low for the pound against the dollar.Where next? Well, don’t expect the Bank of England to arrest the falls by raising interest rates. There is no recent example of the Bank raising rates when the economy is flat, which is the picture suggested by the data for the April-June quarter.The foreign exchange markets, then, will be obliged in coming months to hunt for nuances in every Brexit statement by the new prime minister. Will “do or die” and “come what may” be uttered so regularly, or so casually, by Boris Johnson in office? Impossible to say, but we can say this: there is no incentive for him to try to talk up the pound.First, Johnson has a couple of months in which he can blame Theresa May for inherited ills. Second, any expression of concern about sterling will be read as compromising his commitment to a no-deal Brexit if agreement can’t be reached with the European Union. Third, since Johnson is wedded to the idea that Brexit, in whatever form, will be eventually good for the economy, he’s semi-obliged to brush off any sterling crisis as a temporary jolt that will quickly pass he’s fooling nobody, but that’s the logic of his position.Does it mean sterling has further to fall before the crunch arrives in October? To repeat: trying to predict short-term currency movements is a mug’s game. But it’s currently hard to see what’s supposed to stop sterling’s slide.When he was hired as chief executive of Standard Chartered in 2015, Bill Winters was hailed as an ex-JP Morgan superstar who would quickly knock the Asian-focused FTSE 100 bank into shape.It hasn’t quite worked out that way.

Here’s a roundup of readers’ experiences – from Harlow to Perth, Shannon to IslamabadPerth really is about as bland a built environment as you could imagine, luckily set on amazing natural beauty. But its planning is still rooted firmly in 1950s style suburbia and auto dependence. Car ownership is one of the highest in Australia, which nationally is one of the highest in the world. Vibrancy is lacking, community occurs despite, not encouraged by, the built environment. Walking is hardly done, and the streets of suburbia are deserted as everyone drives.Milton Keynes is comfortably the easiest town or city I’ve lived in – not the prettiest, or the most interesting, but certainly the most pleasant to live compared with other traditional British urban landscapes. You quickly realise why visitors will struggle to warm to it while residents love living here. On first appearances it’s all fast roads, roundabouts (yes, yes) and housing estates. Very easy to dismiss, just another post-war new town. Spend some time among those odd highway intersections and you’ll discover the hidden pockets of preserved villages, rivers, canals, woodlands that were very carefully integrated into the modern network. And let’s stop describing it as a sea of concrete – there’s more grass, shrubbery and vast swathes of trees wherever you look. On a mundane level, it has most of what young families, young professionals and retired people could want – a strong local economy, fast travel connections, good amenities and numerous leisure facilities. But these are what makes it work as a place to live. Everything is so easy to access that you could forgive it its faults. For a town so meticulously planned there still exist the usual issues of crumbling housing, over development and a poor provision of local public transport in a town that is so enamoured with car ownership. Nevertheless, after having lived here for a decade, I’m a full convert to the cult of MK. Jules Rye, 37While the city itself is old, the vast majority has been built over the past 20 years. It certainly comes with a lot of conveniences and wonders, but people living here often find things to complain about. You never have to ask how far someplace is, though unless you’re going downtown, pretty much everywhere is 20 minutes away, wherever you are. Arad, 18Shannon is the only planned town in Ireland. Because of the presence of the airport it was far more cosmopolitan than any other town or even city in Ireland at the time. I had Danish and Swedish classmates and Aeroflot had a base here which meant signs in Cyrillic in the local bank. Everything was in walking distance and to this day Shannon has the highest rate of children walking to school in Ireland. On the negative side there was no high street at all in the town, just a dispiriting shopping centre in the middle of town. Restrictive planning meant two pubs in the whole place. AnonymousIslamabad is now over 60 years old. Even though it is a planned city, much has now been growing without any vision or direction. Due to the rapid growth of population, demand for housing skyrocketed which led to the development of urban sprawl and of private housing societies. To this day, the authorities have failed to address housing and commercial needs. Businesses and schools are forced to operate within residential areas illegally due to a lack of zoned areas for their activities. I find it perplexing that I live in a premium gated housing society and can enjoy a lifestyle comparable to living in Dubai located right next to the mud huts of rural migrants. Ammaz, 23I was brought up in Harlow from birth. It was great until adolescence, with lots of open space, we had a great council house with a huge garden and purpose-built primary and secondary schools. There were also lots of jobs in the 1960s and 70s. But in adolescence it was rubbish because of the huge distances between neighbourhoods at a time when you wanted to be out roaming around. Public transport was poor and pricey. You could cycle but the bike paths became badly maintained and threatening over time. I left at 19 and never returned. Michael, 60I moved from Sydney when I got tired of my three-hour commute and the prospect of choosing between living with my parents or paying a third of my salary in rent (at a minimum). Here, I’m considered to live “far” from my workplace, which still only translates to a 20-minute drive in peak hour.I love the orderliness and ease that makes things comfortable, not boring. In Canberra, my biggest problem is deciding between multiple arts events in a night.

Now he runs Dig Brew Co, which produces the tipples of choice for Birmingham’s cultural sceneOn the edge of Birmingham’s city centre lies Digbeth, a partially deserted industrial landscape of former Victorian factories, warehouses and tall railway arches. For the past few decades, it has been a handy place for artists and independent businesses to set up shop and take advantage of large spaces with low rents. Dig Brew Co, founded by 27-year-old Oliver Webb, recently joined this artistic hub, its craft brewery and taproom sitting proudly in a former gun factory on River Street.Webb studied at the Slade School of Fine Art, part of University College London, and says sky-high prices in the capital gave him the idea to start running bars. “We’d be working until 10pm but couldn’t afford to go anywhere, as all the bars and clubs in London are so expensive. So I set up a bar in my studio space and started serving cocktails and cheap beer we bought from the supermarket,” he says.Webb used his artist’s woodworking and sculpture skills to create a collapsible “tiki bar” in his parents’ back garden in Wolverhampton. He shipped it to London and also started to brew his own beer. “We made our own beer from home-brew kits, as it was cheaper than buying from supermarkets. The bar was really popular and we just put out a donation box for people. But, eventually, the police shut us down for not having a licence.”From that point on, the idea of running a pub was in Webb’s mind, and he began learning the art of brewing. Meanwhile, his lecturers were recommending that students visit the growing number of galleries and exhibitions happening in Digbeth. Webb left university and worked briefly for a log cabin company, while also selling tiki bars on the side. His father introduced him to Peter Towler, the owner of Mad O’Rourke’s World Famous Pie Factory. Towler decided to back the young entrepreneur, and Dig Brew Co took possession of its brewery space in March 2017.“I painted it all myself,” recalls Webb. “I rented a sprayer and covered the walls with £1,000 worth of white paint. I built the bar myself, too. We got mash tun, kettles and fermenters on hire purchase – I could never have done that without Peter.”To make it easy for customers to pay, Webb brought in iZettle’s payment systems to enable card payments. “They are easy to use and so training staff is no problem. The machine connects to an app and that makes sense to our staff and customers,” he says.The brewery, opened in October 2017, now employs 20 staff and brews a selection of lagers, stouts and bitters, including its double IPA Dagger Dagger and popular Hell lager. Webb hired a head brewer who now looks after the beer, while he focuses on running the business. However, Webb says it took a while to catch on. “When we opened, nothing much happened. We knew nothing about PR or promotions, so there weren’t many people coming in,” he says.But sometimes, when you’re struggling, helping others can be the answer. James Connolly, owner of Gorilla Coffee Cafe, became a customer and taproom regular when Webb helped him out of a tight spot. “Oli was in my cafe and he saw I was having trouble with a broken beer dispenser,” Connolly recounts. “He lent me one and so I ended up buying some beer from him. A lot of our customers are his target market. They want a sense of community, an experience, and they want it to be fun,” he says.Other local businesses and arts venues liked the idea of buying beer brewed in Brum and Webb also started selling kegs to businesses such as the burger restaurant Original Patty Men. Webb’s arts background helped him make connections and see opportunities that other breweries would likely miss. One example was the decision to host the Infinite Opera company, which performed Besse, a production about beer, feminism and witchcraft. “It was a fitting venue as the early brewsters were all women,” says Kim McAleese, programme director at Grand Union, which houses the Infinite Opera. “There were over a hundred people here to see the Infinite Opera perform between the steel tanks in the brewery.”Local festivals and event spaces have also been big buyers, with the Home of Metal Black Sabbath rock exhibition and gallery space Eastside Projects among its client list. But the big breakthrough for Dig Brew Co came when it beat Guinness to become sponsor for Birmingham’s St Patrick’s Day event and its Mayo stout was on offer to the thousands that attended.“There were smiles all around the room when we made that decision,” says Peter Connolly, chairman of the St Patrick’s Day festival. “Most of the pubs in Digbeth are independently owned by Irish families and Dig Brew Co is all about community,” he adds.Webb says he wants his business to be about far more than just making beer. The city of Birmingham has been through hard times, but he and others in the arts and creative sector seem determined for it to have brighter days. “There’s a real scene happening here and we are providing beer for a lot of those involved in it.”To find out how iZettle helps small businesses like Dig Brew Co, visit izettle"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f26bd299e1cf021eea9216490310a7197fd1b5df/0_0_1733_1040/master/1733.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a0ef8584e31715a2fbaf57647a2c9cb7","title":"going cashless has been huge for us the coffee shop thats stopped using cash","story":"For young entrepreneur Ed Barry, running a business has had its ups and downs. But embracing the cashless economy has paid offIt’s no secret that the great British high street is warming to the idea of going, if not cashless, then certainly less cash. In the past 15 years, we’ve seen the introduction of contactless cards and mobile phone payments (or digital wallets).That’s exactly what Ed Barry, 28, owner of west London coffee shop and cocktail bar Over Under Coffee, has done. Barry’s Earl’s Court shop is only a stone’s throw away from the tube station, where relaxed customers work on their laptops or discuss things over plates of food from the simple “toast and toppings” menu, made in the shop’s flatpack kitchen.The space is small but comfy, and the furnishings simple but effective, much like the business as a whole. For two years, Over Under Coffee has been a cashless business – a practice more common now, but not so when he first adopted it after a successful trial month at the start of 2018.Barry recalls some teething issues – the odd customer who’d prefer cash, for example – but Over Under Coffee was already taking the vast majority of its payments using card and, reflecting back on it, Barry feels his business has reached the level it’s at today because of the decision.“Going cashless has been huge for us,” Barry says. “It’s been a big talking point, and everyone knows about it. I think generally Londoners are warming to it, because of things such as Oyster cards, for example.“We’ve had a few hiccups along the way, but generally it’s been quicker for us – quicker for the customer.”His two shops in Earl’s Court and West Brompton have been operating completely cashless for more than two years, powered solely by iZettle and Barry and his team’s enthusiasm.For the uninitiated, iZettle is a mobile point-of-sale device and integrated app that takes card payments, both contactless and chip and pin. It’s affordable – with an iZettle Reader only costing £29 (for your first reader, £59 for subsequent readers) without having to sign up to a contract or pay high fees – and its accompanying app can be used for accounting, inventory and business analytics, which has helped Barry every step of the way.“iZettle has always been super supportive of us: we always get a really good rate, and we’re not tied into a contract,” Barry says. “The devices look cool on the counter and they’re portable, too – we do a lot of events and we just use our phone hotspot to make payments, so it’s really easy to use. It’s basically plug and pay for payments, so it’s great for small businesses like us.”“Supporting independent businesses such as Over Under Coffee is iZettle’s whole reason for existing. We want to ensure that they have the tools they need to start, run and grow their businesses,” says Ed Hallett, managing director at iZettle UK.At 6pm at Over Under Coffee, the counters, seating and walls all flip around to reveal their evening cocktail bar alter egos.“I wanted to create a really welcoming environment, and have that throughout the day and then throughout the night,” Barry says. “My whole ethos is: there’s no point in working in hospitality if you’re not going to have a positive impact on somebody’s day. A positive mental attitude is something I try to filter through our entire company and culture.“Just because there’s a counter between us doesn’t mean we can’t talk like we’re mates. It’s not going to please everyone, but I’d rather verge on too friendly than the opposite.”But it’s not always been easy for him to create and run a business as a millennial entrepreneur in London.“There have definitely been tough periods. Some months I couldn’t pay myself any money. I had never run my own shop, I’d never been a boss, I’d never written employment contracts, or taken accounts,” Barry explains. “We opened our second shop too quickly and had to close it within four months. We picked the wrong location, we got the layout of the bar wrong, we hired the wrong people.“But now we’ve got another shop in West Brompton, west London, and are opening another place in Manchester next month. So each year you have to take stock of what you’ve learned and realise that the things you thought were problems at first are actually very easy to do, but only if you’re willing to learn on the job.”To find out how iZettle can help your business, visit izettle"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5a1b0dc6ee8f4dec5af258c787b953c417af5049/0_66_1733_1040/master/1733.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=818739c85203c89addfad8b8c84dce54","title":"learn what people want 10 tips on how to create a successful vintage fashion business","story":"Flea markets are a favourite weekend pastime for many. Here’s how to turn your passion for fashion into a bustling market stallIf your ideal weekend is spent hitting up car boot sales, browsing charity shops and scouring Etsy for the perfect vintage find, then having your own stall may seem like the dream job – or at least the dream side hustle. But what are the tips and tricks to make your vintage fashion business a success? We asked successful stall owners how they went from vintage fan to thriving market trader – and how you can do the same.1. Start small“Don’t get carried away and invest a lot of money at the start,” says Amanda Barnes, whose shop Ooh La La Vintage in Dorset began as a stall at events and vintage festivals. “Keep expectations realistic and reassess every few months before you buy more stock. Even if you’re just doing it as a hobby, it’s a good idea to write a loose business plan. Decide how much you’ll spend on stock, and think about other expenses, such as travel and the cost of the pitch. Then work out how much you need to sell to recoup costs and turn a profit.”2. Follow your passion“Think about your current vintage collection and whether there’s a theme that stands out, because that’s what you should focus on,” says Sarah Horrillo, who started her Portobello Road stall London Vintage six years ago. “When I first started out, I did a lot of vintage table linens and homeware now I just focus on women’s clothes. But your passion might be accessories or childrenswear or denim or ’50s clothes. As you build up your business, people will come to associate you with a particular theme.”3. Build a brand“From the outset, think about who you’re trying to reach and what you’re offering,” says Kerry Norton, a part-time nurse who also runs Sisters of the Moon, a vintage stall in London and Brighton. “Get a logo and business cards, so that if a customer doesn’t buy anything that day, they can go away and find you. Get an Instagram account – it’s a really important way to build up a following – and pay attention to analytics. If a particular item is getting lots of likes, you’ll know to look out for similar pieces.”4. Go contactless“I set myself up with iZettle straight away,” says Norton. “Loads of people don’t carry cash and people want contactless payments, which makes things so much easier and quicker and less hassle than rummaging around for change. It’s also a good idea to have a separate bank account for your stall, so you can keep track of incomings and outgoings.”5. Always be on the hunt“The hardest part of the job is finding the right pieces – and no one wants to reveal their sources,” says Norton. “Some traders use wholesalers, but my stock is all inidually sourced. Always keep your eye out wherever you go, and be willing to do repairs.” Horrillo takes an empty suitcase when she goes on holiday, as she says she never knows where she might find a gem. “The best advice I can give is to only buy things you love. Don’t be swayed by a designer label, or overthink it and buy something because you think it will sell – that never works.”6. It’s good to talk“Chatting to your customers is a great way to learn what people want,” says Barnes. “That’s your market, so it’s a great way to get instant feedback on what you’re doing. Do they want things in bigger sizes? Are they looking for better quality? Are they finding items too expensive? Take it all on board and adapt your strategy accordingly.”7. Get friendlyTeaming up with a friend who also loves vintage fashion can be a good way to split pitch costs and make selling more fun. “It’s also a good idea to make friends with fellow stall owners,” says Jean Thompson of Love Vintage, based in Leeds. “They can watch the stall for you when you’re having a break, and will often have loads of great advice if they’ve been doing it for years. There’s a really nice community of vintage traders and we all help each other out.”8. Presentation is key“Take the time to make sure your items are nicely presented, ironed, clean and clearly priced,” says Barnes. “Make sure all of a garment’s seams, buttons and fastenings are intact, too. People want to immediately incorporate an item into their wardrobe – they don’t want to take it home and spend time repairing it.”9. Get organised“Try to lay out your stock in an orderly way,” says Thompson. “That also makes it easier to keep track of your current inventory, and pull out similar pieces when they do sell.” Norton suggests thinking about how you’ll transport your stock and where you’ll put it when you’re not on the stall. “I had a year of keeping all my stock in my tiny flat, but now I use a storage facility,” she says. “It’s a hidden cost that I didn’t think about at the start, but for me it’s well worth it.”10. Accept the ups and downs“You can have long quiet periods, and that’s scary,” says Norton. “But you have to think on a monthly basis rather than having a bad day and then feeling despondent. If you do have an unsuccessful selling day, try to think about what you can learn from it – maybe it wasn’t the right location for you, for example. Ultimately, I’m doing something I enjoy and, for me, that’s much more rewarding than a regular paycheck.”To find out how iZettle can help your business, visit izettle"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3f97252bfc4ba11d20f847aeaf12ba6d09bc08cf/0_221_5090_3054/master/5090.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c2b16bc578ea77f13e599181eb64ab9b","title":"alan turing 50 note british science equality committee","story":"I sat on the committee that helped select the scientist. Honouring him sends a message that the UK respects all peopleOver Christmas, I had the unusual delight of reading short biographies of 989 dead scientists. As a member of the Bank of England’s banknote character advisory committee, I was sifting through potential nominees to be included on the new £50 note: the sheer volume of UK scientists, put forward by more than 225,000 members of the public, reflected the enormous contribution our small island has made to international scientific progress over the past few centuries.The advisory committee finally arrived at a list of 12, which we duly presented to the bank’s governor, Mark Carney. All were outstanding scientists in their own right, universally agreed to have made a significant and enduring contribution not just to the world of science, but to society as a whole. They ranged from Stephen Hawking and Rosalind Franklin to Dorothy Hodgkin and Srivanasa Ramanujan. It was a list to challenge the outdated stereotype of the socially awkward old white man, working diligently alone in his laboratory. A damaging trope that still prevents many young people today from seeing a place for themselves in science.One name stood out in particular to be honoured on the £50 note: Alan Turing. His contribution to science is clear: he was the father of computer science, a significant influence on the modern field of artificial intelligence and most importantly, his work at Bletchley Park during the second world war led a team of code-breakers to crack the German Enigma code.But Turing’s importance goes beyond science. Shortly after the war, he was prosecuted by the British government for “gross indecency” due to his relationship with another man. He chose to undergo a year of chemical castration rather than face a prison sentence, but he died two years later, aged 41. The inquest found that his death from cyanide poisoning had been suicide. In 2009 Gordon Brown issued Turing an apology on behalf of the government – and in 2013 the Queen officially pardoned him. This may have seemed too little, too late, but such public acknowledgment of his mistreatment by the state helped pave the way for the subsequent government pardoning of nearly 50,000 homosexual men who had been historically cautioned or convicted for homosexual acts.Turing’s legacy contributes to ever-greater acceptance of sexual differences, and by celebrating him the UK might seem to be progressing in this matter – but a recent national survey found that two-thirds of the LGBT community in the UK are still afraid to hold hands in public for fear of negative reactions, and four in 10 have experienced some form of hate incident. Although I have been a lifelong ally of the LGBT community, I had never experienced this directly myself. That was until I recently entered into a relationship with a non-binary partner, assigned female at birth. While determined to walk down the street with pride, we have nonetheless been subject to negative comments and disapproving looks, and I admit that I feel nervous when we’re out together at night.There are still 72 countries in which same-sex relations are illegal (36 of which are Commonwealth members) and 11 countries in which homosexuality is punishable by death. The honouring of Turing sends a powerful message: this is a nation that believes that all people should be treated equally and with respect – a nation in which Alan Turing should be celebrated for the important contributions he has made to the world.• Dr Emily Grossman is a science author, public speaker and TV personality.

Their preferred candidate is well ahead in the final straight of a Tory leadership contest, and his rival doesn’t dare to contradict him on the issue that matters most.In hustings on Monday night, Boris Johnson ruled out any Brexit compromise based on revision of the Northern Irish backstop. And that is the only route to a negotiated, orderly resolution visible from Brussels. No backstop no deal. Jeremy Hunt might have inserted some practical reality into the conversation, if only for the sake of his intellectual credibility, but instead he endorsed the central tenet of Johnsonism: the only Brexit deal worth aiming for is one that doesn’t exist.It is not news that dignity is soluble in ambition. Hunt, like Matt Hancock and Amber Rudd, has examined the price of a seat at Johnson’s cabinet table and decided he is willing to pay. Others who served under Theresa May, and who understand what leaving the EU in a disreputable huff would cost the country, have made a different choice, preferring integrity on the back benches. The resistance to a no-deal Brexit will soon be bolstered by ministerial veterans – the likes of David Gauke, David Lidington and Philip Hammond.Even with heavyweight reinforcements, the Tory moderates do not intimidate the zealots. Pro-Europeans in the Commons have been adept in the use of procedural subterfuge against a no-deal Brexit, but that arcane combat does little to advance arguments for alignment with continental allies. One thing it has achieved is Eurosceptic radicalisation, sustaining tales of Westminster conspiracy against national liberation.Moderate Tories have won skirmishes over the legislative timetable and lost the battle for their party’s soul. One reason is their culture of obedience. The insurgent spirit does not come easily to these natural parliamentary prefects, who sit at the front of the class, waiting to be picked by teacher. The Eurosceptics have the temperament of troublemakers, sitting at the back.A greater problem still is lack of clarity among pro-European Tories about what they are really fighting for. There is a large number of Brexit Mensheviks – MPs who accept the referendum result but draw a line at the destructive revolutionary fervour of Ukip-style Bolshevism. They voted for May’s withdrawal agreement. They were in favour of “soft” options before the party’s centre of gravity shifted towards the hardliners. Then they ended up taking the view that any deal would be better than no deal. Their candidate in the leadership contest was Rory Stewart, who was lauded for supporting Brexit with body language hinting that he understood it to be a stupid idea. That stance is no longer available. What the Mensheviks call pragmatism, the Bolsheviks call enslavement to Brussels.There are queasy leavers on the Labour side too – MPs who like nothing about Brexit but would rather go through with it than explain to constituents why it shouldn’t happen. More avowedly pro-European Labour MPs have focused on nudging their reluctant leader towards a second referendum – a strategy that has muddled up means and ends. No one who likes Brexit wants another vote, so the only point of the thing would be to remain, and Jeremy Corbyn struggled to be enthusiastic about that the first time. Inordinate amounts of energy seem to have been wasted trying to persuade a man who doesn’t like the European project to give his party permission to run a campaign in which he would inevitably take a surly back-seat role.Pro-European voices in the main opposition party have been muted. In the governing party they have been suffocated. That has allowed the Liberal Democrats to emerge as a confidently anti-Brexit party, foil to Nigel Farage’s Brexit party. But that apparent symmetry creates a false equivalence between two polarised positions. The Lib Dems find themselves cast as “ultra-remainers”, as if aborting Brexit is a notion as extreme as Farage’s ambition to burn every bridge to the continent. The fallacy is exposed by imagining the morning after each side gets their way. In the remain scenario, the state functions as before, undisturbed. In the no-deal scenario there is frantic, costly execution of contingency plans and, if they fail, pandemonium.That is not to deny the political cost of staying in the EU. There would be a heavy penalty in trust among leavers who already feel their democratic will is despised. That price is so high in part because Brexiteers ramp it up, knowing it is their only argument for proceeding with a project that has no economic justifications left. On any technical, legal, financial basis, keeping our current EU deal is by a mile the easiest way out of the mess we are in.If remaining feels like an extreme measure, that is because even pro-European politicians have been extremely reluctant to admit that it is an available option, let alone make the case. But their other options are running out. The strategy of dilution has failed. The hardliners see no distinction between compromise and betrayal between efforts to avoid no deal and plots to stop Brexit. That could be liberating for Tory dissenters who feel unable to climb aboard the Johnson bandwagon. They will be cast as remainers anyway, so perhaps they should finally clear their throats and make the case for remain."},{"url":null,"title":"housing britain landlord tenants","story":"Britain has enough housing – it’s just that a series of outrageous policies make it accessible only to the richI have a friend who works almost every waking hour, mainly to pay the rent. Her landlord lives on a beach, 4,000 miles away. He seldom responds to her requests, and grudgingly pays for the minimum of maintenance. But every so often he writes to inform her that he is raising the rent. He does not have to work because she and other tenants work on his behalf. He is able to live the life of his choice because they give their time to him. As there is a shortage of accessible housing, they have no choice but to pay his exorbitant fees.The effects are devastating not only for people’s finances but also for their family life and peace of mind, as Catrina Davies reminds us in her beautiful, elegaic book Homesick, published this month. After a childhood clouded by her father’s bankruptcy, the subsequent loss of the family home, destitution, orce, chaos and mental illness, she finds herself on the wrong side of the magic line between those who own and those who don’t. She is engaged in an endless struggle to lead a good, fulfilling life, without being crushed by the demands of rent.After living in a tent, a van and a static caravan, she rents a tiny box room in a crowded, angry house in Bristol for £400 a month. While she struggles to meet her bills, her landlords blithely travel the world. Eventually, it all becomes too much. She flees into a collapsing shed in Cornwall, without planning permission, electricity or water. She now lives on the wrong side of the law, under corrugated iron and decaying timber, in extreme precarity, but with a measure of freedom she has not been able to find elsewhere.She is surrounded by the dysfunctions of Britain’s property market. A miserable, pokey flat comes up, but there are no available jobs that could possibly cover the rent. Buying is impossible: the average price of a house in Cornwall is £206,000, while the average wage in the county would permit her to borrow £51,000.Davies encounters an almost feudal economy, in which non-owners work for the owners. Some of the employers – offering casualised work at the minimum wage cleaning and servicing holiday homes and staffing cafes and car parks – are also the local landlords, who set rents their own workers cannot afford. The economy is sustained by people living in tents, vans and caravans. She notes that “basic needs can be satisfied very cheaply when you don’t have a landlord to support”. But landlords have become punitively expensive to maintain.The folk theory of crazy rents and mortgages is that they are the result of too few houses and too many people. But one of the amazing facts of our time is that the UK has more bedrooms per person than ever before. Throughout the boom in house prices, the number of dwellings here has been growing faster than the number of households. There is plenty of housing – for the rich. But a series of outrageous policies ensure that it remains inaccessible to the poor. There are council tax discounts for second homes and holiday homes, and for single people in large houses. The capital gains tax on second homes and investment properties is lower than income tax. Why work if your extra homes earn more than you do – even if they are left empty?We will need private landlords for the foreseeable future, and they should be able to make some money from their property. But they cannot be allowed to use their position as owners of a limited and non-reproducible resource (the land on which their houses sit) to extract private taxes from people much poorer than themselves. We claim to be a nation that values freedom. But freedom is currently the preserve of the rich."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4a27f6350f5d9f8fbb59a8b56f6992e2f74032c5/0_0_1200_720/master/1200.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2ccd65de943cdac89232635c1848eb6c","title":"your pictures share your photos on the theme of round","story":"Wherever you are in the world, this week we’d like to see your pictures on the theme ‘round’The next theme for our weekly photography assignment, published in print in the Observer New Review is ‘round’.Share your photos of what round means to you – and tell us about your image in the description box.The closing date is Wednesday 17 July at 10am.

He is now vice-chancellor of the University of Exeter, part of the elite Russell Group.Nick Petford left school at 16 and worked in a tool-packing factory before training to install air-conditioning. He is now vice-chancellor of the University of Northampton.The study demonstrates that higher education – alongside football – is one of the few British professions in which working-class people have been able to reach the top. Smith’s theory is that this is because studying at university is much more of a “leveller” than any other process you go through the point from which your outcome is no longer determined by your background. And, crucially, he says those who stay on to do research are judged on how good their intellectual work is – in his case, in international relations.“My first articles weren’t rejected because I was Steve Smith, born in a house with an outside loo – they were blind to my origins,” he says. “And when I became president of the world academic body in my field, it wasn’t because of my class, it was all about my academic record.”Nonetheless, given that no one in his family had gone on to higher education before, Smith says he wouldn’t have made it to the University of Southampton if someone hadn’t spotted his potential.His dad came home in tears from that parents’ evening at Norwich City comprehensive school in 1969, because his teacher thought boys like him shouldn’t have ideas above their station. But a second teacher, Mr Shearing, later told Smith that if he stopped mucking around in class he could really go somewhere. “Christ, that made all the difference,” he says. “Someone, somewhere, has to put faith in you to go forward.”Petford says his life would have taken a very different path if he hadn’t made it to university. A member of Southampton’s first punk band in his teens, he left his comprehensive school at 16 with a handful of CSEs. He got a factory job, because that was what all his mates were doing. Petford doesn’t remember either his school or his parents ever mentioning university to him.“I was unemployed and on the dole when I saw a poster for a university access course at the age of 23. Seven years later I was a Cambridge don. I guess that’s social mobility in action,” he says. He did his access course at Southwark College and went to Goldsmiths.Petford is now a top volcanologist, and, like Smith, argues that vice-chancellors are different from leaders in other professions because they typically have to have a proven academic record that is based on peer review. “Esteem in this sense can be a great leveller, allowing you to build a career based on what you’ve done, not where you come from.”But he warns that snobbery can still triumph in universities if the appointment board is not open-minded. “If a university’s board of governors is dominated by alumni from Oxbridge colleges and is intent on hiring a vice-chancellor from the Russell Group, because that’s where they assume managerial quality resides, then ersity becomes restricted.”Paul O’Prey, who has recently retired after running the University of Roehampton for 15 years, won a place at Oxford to study English, despite his council house burning down when he was in the sixth form.O’Prey is concerned for the future, however. He worries that lack of funding for PhDs is making it harder for people from poorer backgrounds to get a foot on the academic career ladder. “There was greater access to grants when I was young, so entry was more possible regardless of background,” he says. “A lot of PhD students have to support themselves now and there is a risk it could become a middle-class profession.”Peter Mathieson, the new head of the University of Edinburgh, did his PhD at Cambridge, but insists it wasn’t a leg-up. He grew up on a poor street in Penzance, Cornwall, and went to an underperforming state school. When Mathieson told his teachers he wanted to study medicine, they said he “would only be disappointed” if he tried. It was “like a red rag to a bull”, he recalls, and at 15 he made an appointment to see his family doctor alone, to ask for advice on where to study.“The key step for me was getting to university, which I did partly through sheer bloody-mindedness.”Mathieson has recently caused controversy by publishing contextual requirements for all courses at Edinburgh, showing explicitly that those from less-privileged backgrounds can get in with lower grades than their fee-paying counterparts. “It arouses strong feelings, as inevitably some well-qualified students won’t get in,” he says. “But I don’t believe we are lowering standards: we are levelling the playing field.”Anne Carlisle, vice-chancellor of Falmouth University, grew up on a farm with seven siblings outside Belfast, in an area where no one went to university.She admits that rising through the ranks in academia, she has encountered snobbery based on both her gender and the fact that she studied fine art. But she argues that the top jobs in higher education are opening up more as people see that university chiefs are basically running a company – and the key thing is demonstrating you have the skills to do that.“At some universities researchers think they are a breed apart and they very much operate on networks. There are a few of that type running universities still – but they are in the minority. Most of us come up through the ranks and can point to what we have achieved.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/405a9af2baa3bdcee0a416c8d272c4076d318c43/0_71_3061_1837/master/3061.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b521655106901055b4a82e52677c8484","title":"government proposals home schooled children","story":"Councils should be given powers to enter homes to check on a child’s schooling, LGA saysThe government has been accused by councils of watering down plans to improve oversight of the growing number of school-aged children who are educated at home in England, leaving some of them at risk of a second-rate education or worse.The Local Government Association (LGA), which represents councils in England and Wales, says government proposals to introduce a compulsory register for home-schooled children are welcome but do not go far enough to protect children and ensure they get a high-quality education.In combination with the register, the LGA wants councils to be given additional powers that would enable them to enter a family home or other premises to check on a child’s schooling. Without those powers – and more funding to enact them – the LGA says concerns will persist for a minority of children who could be at risk of neglect or poor future prospects.“We know that most children get a good education at home and fully support parents’ rights to home-educate their children,” said Anntoinette Bramble, chair of the LGA’s children and young people board.“But there is a minority of cases where home-schooled children are not receiving a suitable education or being educated in a safe environment. Those children have got to be our priority.“It is good the government is introducing a register but this risks failing to protect children unless it goes further. It needs to toughen up its plans and give councils the powers and appropriate funding to enter homes or other premises to speak to children and check their schooling.”Damian Hinds announced in April that parents would be required to register home-educated children with their local authority under government proposals intended to prevent young people from disappearing off the radar.An estimated 60,000 children in England are thought to be educated at home – a figure that is rising by about a quarter each year. The register will for the first time enable authorities to see where children are if they are not in school and intervene more effectively if required.Announcing the plans, the education secretary said: “As a government, we have a duty to protect our young people and do our utmost to make sure they are prepared for life in modern Britain.“That’s why this register of children not in school is so important: not to crack down on those dedicated parents doing an admirable job of educating their children in their own homes, but to prevent vulnerable young people from vanishing under the radar.”Home educators criticised the proposals at the time, saying a council register would be a further step down the path of unwarranted intrusion into family life by the state. They also resisted giving councils additional powers to intervene.Ministers have become increasingly concerned about growing numbers of pupils who are being “off-rolled” by schools, in particular families who are encouraged to take their children out of school and “elect” home education in order to avoid exclusion or fines.The schools watchdog, Ofsted, has also flagged up concerns about more than 500 illegal or unregistered schools. In some cases, children who are said to be home-schooled will in fact be attending illegal schools.In its original consultation, the Department for Education included the possibility of giving additional powers to councils, but the proposal was dropped. The LGA has urged the DfE to reconsider and give councils the authority to investigate further.A DfE spokesperson said final proposals would be published next year. “We have a duty to protect our young people and that’s why our plans for a register of children not in school is so important.“If there is a concern over the standard of home education a child is receiving local authorities already have substantial powers including being able to request that parents show the education at home is of a good quality.” If a council is not satisfied it can serve a school attendance order, enforceable in court."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d39e29b213e95008a9bd037cf5b0e8950e34c7e4/0_200_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9bccc6f38adb706bbd7ad51c95e93edc","title":"july on course to be hottest month ever say climate scientists","story":"If global trends continue for another fortnight, it will beat previous two-year-old record Record temperatures across much of the world over the past two weeks could make July the hottest month ever measured on Earth, according to climate scientists.The past fortnight has seen freak heat in the Canadian Arctic, crippling droughts in Chennai and Harare and forest fires that forced thousands of holidaymakers to abandon campsites in southern France and prompted the air force in Indonesia to fly cloud-busting missions in the hope of inducing rain.If the trends of the first half of this month continue, it will beat the previous record from July 2017 by about 0.025C, according to calculations by Karsten Haustein, a climate scientist at the University of Oxford, and others.This follows the warmest-ever June, which was confirmed this week by data from the US space agency Nasa, following Europe’s Copernicus satellite monitoring system.In response to the new numbers, Michael Mann, the director of the Earth System Science Center at Pennsylvania State University, tweeted: “This is significant. But stay tuned for July numbers. July is the warmest month of the year globally. If this July turns out to be the warmest July (it has a good shot at it), it will be the warmest month we have measured on Earth.”The scientists stressed that this outcome is uncertain because conditions could change in the second half of the month, but it underscores a broader pattern of steadily rising temperatures caused by increasing emissions of carbon dioxide from power plants, deforestation, cars, planes and other sources.“It is clear that 2019 is shaping up to be a top-five year – but depending on what happens it could be second, third or fourth warmest. The warmest year was 2016, which started with a big El Niño, which we didn’t have this year, so a record year is not particularly likely,” he said.Of the many recent temperature anomalies, perhaps the most remarkable was in the Canadian Arctic community of Alert, Nunavut, which hit a record 21C on 14 July, although temperatures at this time of year are usually just a few degrees above freezing.Last month, France shattered its previous heat record during a heatwave across much of Europe that was made at least five times – and possibly hundreds of times – more likely by human-driven climate disruption, according to scientists.Political leaders have failed to halt the rise in emissions that is behind global heating. On Tuesday, the UK environment secretary, Michael Gove, warned that time was running out to prevent a breakdown of the climate and natural life support systems. “These twin challenges of bioersity and climate change are massive and urgent and interrelated. The action taken so far hasn’t been sufficient, but late as it may be, there is still time,” he warned. “The scale of action required may be daunting, but the need to act is imperative.”The UK has avoided most of the extreme heat seen in Europe in elsewhere in recent weeks. The average temperature in the first two weeks of July was 15.1C, which equals the July average, though Mark McCarthy, the head of the Met Office’s National Climate Information Centre, said there might be a modest rise because the second half of the month is usually marginally warmer than the first.Concerns about rising temperatures and their impact on health are growing. On Tuesday, the Red Cross launched a new Heatwave Guide to help urban planners and city authorities reduce the risks, which are particularly great for the elderly, very young children, pregnant women and people who are socially isolated.“Heatwaves are one of the deadliest natural hazards facing humanity and the threat they pose will only become more serious and more widespread as the climate crisis continues,” said Francesco Rocca, the president of the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies.Previous heatwaves have killed tens of thousands of people, including 2,500 in India in 2015 and 70,000 in Europe in 2003, according to the Red Cross."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/14707c7a7426523843280cf5dc1f918c062c8dfa/0_498_1333_799/master/1333.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1fcb3b9a055e1ab97ddfc7cbdd7f8320","title":"lets go meet the artist helping to make the flintstones high fashion","story":"For his SS20 collection, emerging London menswear designer Liam Hodges called upon the talents of artist Alfie Kungu to help him capture the primitive futurism of his menswear designsFrom the menswear designer who brought us prints of Mr Blobby and a British interpretation of Las Vegas Americana came a much lauded take on The Flintstones at London fashion week men’s last month. It was the latest chapter in London-based designer Liam Hodge’s phenomenal success tale that has seen him work his way up the ranks for the last six years to become a key player on the LFWM schedule. Yet the takeaway print this time was born out of a collaboration with a fellow creative.The brains behind the artwork was British artist Alfie Kungu, a rising star in his own right since he graduated with a degree in Fine Art at the UWE Bristol in 2016, later becoming part of Saatchi’s Best of the Year collection in 2017.The pair first crossed paths when Kungu modelled for Hodges’ SS19 runway show last June. After expressing adoration for one another’s creations via Instagram, they linked up at the artist’s studio to discuss what a potential collaboration might look like.After the first few paintings were complete, Hodges was enthusiastic about the work and together they went back and forth presenting new ideas and looking for fresh sources of inspiration. The peak of their creative process was when Kungu introduced the designer to David Cronenberg’s 1990s sci-fi horror, eXistenZ. Both realised it perfectly summed up what they wanted to convey in the collection. “It was from here that we started building together the idea of clashing techno references and graphics with primitive, free-spirited and fun graphics,” says Kungu.Despite initially thinking that the extent of the collaboration would be just a T-shirt graphic, Kungu’s work was also used across embroidered motifs, jacquard knitted pieces, printed and tie-dyed cotton, as well as the inidually hand-painted denim pieces. “It was crazy good,” the painter says of the moment he first saw the finished samples. “We really trusted each others’ skill set and admired each others’ abilities. I knew what Liam can do and I was inspired to match that.”Growing up in the small West Yorkshire market town of Hebden Bridge, art was always at the centre of Kungu’s upbringing. Despite deciding to study dance instead of art at GCSE level, he decided to enrol at Leeds College of Art, where it didn’t take long for him to find his own unique style. “I’d describe my work as being unpretentious and always having a positive feeling. It expresses the little things that I have picked up along the way through films or adverts on the street. Every time I paint, I feel like the next one is going to be better so that motivates me to keep doing it.”Prior to working with Hodges, Kungu shared an exhibition in Paris with the Belgian 3D artist Frédéric Platéus and secured a residency at London’s House of Vans. His large-scale cartoonish and childlike visuals are also cropping up across the capital, most recently via his solo show Fast Luck at The Bomb Factory Art Foundation in London’s Archway.However, Kungu wants to ensure his work is not just London-centric. “I am doing a residency in Leeds with East Streets Art.” Split across a five-floor building and running until the end of the year, Kungu will team up with his old college friend and multimedia artist Jake Krushell. “It’s important to go back to Yorkshire, give it the limelight and make sure things are happening up there.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c54cd5861b2b7aa134b16b5d24dee68730021765/382_104_2150_1290/master/2150.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5340ed0772e87b97af5b1e3f3b620052","title":"harry styles prince eric the little mermaid","story":"The ex-One Direction frontman is being touted to star opposite R\u0026ampB singer Halle Bailey in Disney’s new take on the animated romanceHarry Styles is in talks to take on the role of Prince Eric in Disney’s live-action remake of The Little Mermaid.The former One Direction singer is said to be an early favourite and is currently in discussions with the studio.

Place 6 large courgettes on a chopping board and slice each one at half-centimetre intervals, cutting almost through to the board. Put the courgettes in a roasting tin, holding them together as you lift, and baste them with 5 tbsp of olive oil.Bake the courgettes for 40 minutes or until they are tender, basting halfway through cooking with roasting juices in the tin. Crumble 200g of feta into a mixing bowl. Tear or shred 8 large basil leaves. Add them together with a handful of parsley leaves and season with black pepper, but no salt. Finely grate the zest of a small lemon into the cheese. Set the lemon aside.Remove the courgettes from the oven, transfer to a serving dish or plates, then slice the zested lemon in half and squeeze the juice into the roasting tin. Pour the roasting juices into the feta and parsley then spoon over the courgettes and serve. Enough for 2, with bread for mopping up the juices.The slicing of the courgettes allows the heat to penetrate and the basting juices to trickle right through. Slice cautiously, making sure not to cut right through to the board. Though sliced, the courgettes should remain intact. Some find it easiest to place a chopstick either side of the courgette as you slice down, the wood preventing the knife cutting all the way through.You can use any crumbly cheese for this, changing the herbs as you think fit. Oregano with halloumi for instance, or goat’s cheese and rosemary. If going for the former, grill the halloumi first, singeing its edges and tossing with a little crumbled chilli. Those round “rondelle” courgettes work very neatly here, too.

Catch up on the big moves in La Liga, Bundesliga, Serie A and Ligue 1After an underwhelming title race and struggles in Europe, Spain’s top three have all been very busy already. Real Madrid have spent more than £250m to sign Eden Hazard, striker Luka Jovic and defenders Ferland Mendy and Éder Militão, along with Brazilian forward Rodrygo, who arrives after agreeing a move last summer. The sale of fringe players like Mateo Kovacic has helped offset the outlay – but there may be more to come.Barcelona are also rebuilding, with Antoine Griezmann finally heading to the Camp Nou and coveted midfielder Frenkie de Jong arriving from Ajax. They’ve also traded goalkeepers with Valencia, as Neto replaces Jasper Cillessen. Atlético Madrid received €120m for Griezmann but invested even more (€126m) to trigger João Felix’s Benfica release clause. Atléti have also signed Real midfielder Marcos Llorente, Brazilian defender Renan Lodi, and extended Álvaro Morata’s loan. With Griezmann, Rodri and Lucas Hernandez all departing, they are still £75m in profit.Monchi has returned to Sevilla with an array of new arrivals, including forwards Luuk de Jong and Munas Dabbur, defenders Sergio Reguilon, Diego Carlos and Jules Koundé, attacking threats in Joan Jordán, Lucas Ocampos and Óliver Torres, plus former Manchester City midfielder Fernando. The shopping spree has been offset by the sales of Pablo Sarabia (PSG), Quincy Promes (Ajax) and Luis Muriel (Atalanta).Real Sociedad have made some intriguing buys, bringing in Martin Ødegaard on loan and signing forwards Alexander Isak (Dortmund) and Portu (Girona). Juanmi leaves the Anoeta for Betis, who have also sealed a permanent deal for PSG playmaker Giovani Lo Celso. Valencia have done the same with winger Denis Cherysev, and won the battle for Celta Vigo striker Maxi Gomez. Santi Mina goes the other way, with Denis Suárez joining him.Scottish forward Jack Harper is among Getafe’s cut-price signings as they gear up for Europe. Eibar have been among the busiest teams, signing nine players and letting six leave. Valladolid have brought in forwards Sandro and Enes Unal on loan, while Alavés have snapped up Lucas Pérez from West Ham, and Newcastle’s Joselu. Promoted Real Mallorca have reinforced with seven signings and Granada have landed veteran striker Roberto Soldado from Fenerbahce.It is the end of an era at Bayern Munich, with Arjen Robben retiring and Franck Ribéry also departing. The German champions have reinforced in defence, signing French World Cup stars Hernandez and Benjamin Pavard long before the window opened. Teenage striker Fiete Arp joins from Hamburg but other attacking targets – including Manchester City’s Leroy Sané – have so far proved elusive.Borussia Dortmund moved fast to bring in defender Nico Schulz and attacking talents in Julian Brandt and Thorgan Hazard - all from rival Bundesliga clubs - before springing a surprise by bringing Mats Hummels back from Bayern. Leverkusen lost Brandt to Dortmund, but have signed PSG winger Moussa Diaby and Hoffenheim playmaker Kerem Demirbay as they prepare for a Champions League return.Eintracht Frankfurt made a healthy profit on Jovic and have spent on potential so far, including Swiss midfielder Djibril Sow. His Young Boys teammate Kevin Mbabu joins Wolfsburg along with promising Austrian midfielder Xaver Schlager. Gladbach have signed forward Breel Embolo from Schalke, who in turn have bought Stuttgart centre-back Ozan Kabak, Fortuna Düsseldorf forward Benito Raman, and agreed a loan deal for Everton’s Jonjoe Kenny.RB Leipzig have again recruited from their sister club in Salzburg, spending €12m on midfielder Hannes Wolf. Mainz have signed eight players, including West Ham’s Edmilson Fernandes, while newly-promoted Paderborn have recruited nine. Nobody can match Union Berlin, who have signed 14 players – including former Dortmund defender Neven Subotic.Juventus have reinforced their squad while still making a profit – a frightening prospect for Italy’s chasing pack. Aaron Ramsey and Adrien Rabiot arrive as free agents, while Gianluigi Buffon returns after a year at PSG. Defenders Wesley, Merih Demiral and Cristian Romero have also joined, with the latter going back to Genoa on loan.Leonardo Spinazzola leaves Turin for Roma, with Luca Pellegrini heading the other way. Paulo Fonseca has also recruited Betis keeper Pau López and Napoli midfielder Amadou Diawara, who arrives as part of the deal that took Kostas Manolas to Naples. Atalanta have recruited Muriel and Genk midfielder Ruslan Malinovskyi for their debut Champions League campaign, while Lazio have signed Copenhagen defender Denis Vavro and Liverpool winger Bobby Adekanye.Antonio Conte has begun shaping his Internazionale side, recruiting Hertha Berlin winger Valentino Lazaro, and securing Stefano Sensi (Sassuolo) and Nicolò Barella (Cagliari) on loan-to-buy deals. Milan have paid off a similar agreement for midfielder Franck Kessié, who arrived in 2017. Defender Theo Hernández joins from Real Madrid, while club stalwarts Riccardo Montolivo and Ignazio Abate, depart as new manager Marco Giampaolo arrives.Giampaolo’s former club, Sampdoria, have brought in Italy Under 21 goalkeeper Emil Audero and Colombia defender Jeison Murillo as they rebuild under Eusebio di Francesco. Local rivals Genoa have signed eight new players after dodging relegation. Torino have sealed permanent deals for Chelsea’s Ola Aina, Inter defender Christian Ansaldi and Valencia’s Simone Zaza.Bologna have spent £40m so far this summer, paying off loan-to-buy deals and recruiting Club Brugge defender Stefano Denswil, plus Chievo’s Gambian winger Musa Juwara, who continues his Serie A dream after arriving in Italy as a refugee in 2016. Elsewhere, the three promoted sides – Brescia, Lecce and Verona – have made 22 signings between them already.PSG’s summer transfer plans hinge on Neymar’s future, but the French champions have made a handful of signings, including Sevilla playmaker Sarabia, Borussia Dortmund defender Abdou Diallo and Ander Herrera. Lyon have lost Tanguy Ndombele to Spurs and Mendy to Real but have raided Lille for midfielder Thiago Mendes and full-back Youssouf Koné and also recruited Sampdoria defender Joachim Andersen. Lille have signed a goalkeeper – Rio Ave’s Leo Jardim – and prised striker Tim Weah from PSG.Montpellier have sealed permanent deals for Jordan Ferri and Andy Delort, and spent £9m on Téji Savanier, a star last season with local rivals Nîmes, who have also lost winger Denis Bouanga to Saint-Etienne. Les Verts have also brought in promising Le Havre defender Harold Moukoudi and Barcelona’s Sergi Palencía, while Monaco have kept winger Gelson Martins and signed Montpellier keeper Benjamin Lecomte.Rennes have paid £13.5m to sign Senegal forward M’Baye Niang permanently, and £9m for Angers winger Flavien Tait. Nantes have signed promising keeper Alban Lafont on a two-year loan from Fiorentina, while Toulouse have spent £3m on Greek forward Efthymois Koulouris, who led PAOK to the title last season.

The United States won the tournament for the second consecutive time.“This is the reality,” said Lima, who was fired as coach of the national side in 2017 after just 13 games in charge. “Why is the United States so far ahead of us?”Lima recorded more videos the morning after explaining how they had found a hotel in which to spend the night.She also detailed Santos’ post-match travel plans, saying that after Wednesday night’s game, the squad will return from Manaus on a 4am flight to Brasilia before catching a connection to São Paulo.

We could do with some of that now“I am someone who believes that what we need without a doubt is more of Jimmy Greaves,” wrote the performance poet John Hegley in Greavsie, an ironic yet affectionate early-1990s paean to a then ubiquitous figure. “The more I get of Greaves, the more my life achieves.”The Premier League’s paywall model would soon be bringing down the curtain on one of the more curious and varied media careers of an ex-footballer. ITV’s failure to land broadcast rights to what the victor, Sky, would trail as a “whole new ball game” meant the axe for Saint and Greavsie in July 1992.The sight of Ian St John’s shoulders rocking in laughter as his pal riffed away was lost to a large viewership that had enjoyed the pairing of the former Liverpool and Tottenham forwards. The pair seldom met outside the studio as they lived on opposite sides of the country, but they had chemistry. Saturday lunchtimes spent with them were erting and fun, during an easy yet informative stroll through the week’s footballing issues.Here was a time before virtual-reality analysis, tactics boards and GPS running stats read-outs, but the pair still knew the game inside out. Beyond the Greaves gags and mockery of Scottish goalkeepers was someone who had been there, done that. It was not until May 2017 that his European record of 366 top-flight goals was surpassed by Cristiano Ronaldo.Though the show’s seven year-run from 1985 took in some of the most turbulent years in the English game’s history, anyone dipping into the archive of episodes that can be found on YouTube will not fail to be struck by the lightness of touch compared to the portentous treatment given to any rank-and-file live match these days. “It’s a funny old game” was Greaves’s catchphrase, and it spoke to the special peculiarities and the sense of enjoyment that could and should be attached to the game. Football was, back then, a weekend ersion from the rest of life, something to be savoured during the Saturday afternoon kick-offs that followed their lunchtime broadcast. Once the satellite revolution came, football would morph into a deadly serious business played every night of the week to fill schedules and media companies’ ravenous appetite for content.Setanta Sports got the band back together for a special 2009 FA Cup final broadcast but a further televised reunion is sadly unlikely. St John, now 81, was recently sighted during Liverpool’s “This Means More” viral campaign, visibly emotional as he recalled Bill Shankly, but Greaves, 79, has rarely been seen in public since suffering a near-fatal stroke in May 2015 that initially robbed him of speech. He remains severely disabled and requires full-time care.His old club are currently at one of their highest points since his heyday but Greaves, Spurs’ greatest goalscorer, could not be present when they opened their new stadium in April. “Jim was the absolute best,” as his Spurs teammate Terry Dyson told this writer a couple of years ago. “He was as good as Messi.”The idea of Greaves as an artful dribbler whose pace would whip him by defenders on heavy pitches can be difficult to process. To anyone under 50, his image is that of a balding, gringo-moustached wisecracker in garish shirts built for comfort. The neatly Brylcreemed hair and trim figure of Jimmy Greaves the 1960s goal machine bore little resemblance to the jowly raconteur who served as TV-am’s telly reviewer.During his imperial period as a light entertainer of the mid-to-late 1980s, Greaves was to be found fraternising with Hollywood idols, pop starlets and Anne Diamond on the TV-am sofa while carrying out his morning duties. In the evening he served as rival team captain to Emlyn Hughes and Tessa Sanderson on Sporting Triangles, ITV’s rather weak facsimile of the BBC’s Question of Sport. All this at a time when the widest access to his playing greatness came in one of his goals being included in the BBC’s 101 Great Goals VHS compilation.The left-foot tap-in that followed an Alan Gilzean flick-on and a long Joe Kinnear throw-in at an icy Valley Parade in January 1970 was not much to go on as confirmation of genius. The overriding majority of Greaves’s goals were not even televised in black and white and by 1970 he was on the steep decline, exacerbated by the alcoholism that led to him retiring at 31. A spell at West Ham was most famous for him – and Bobby Moore – being caught out on the razz in the former boxer Brian London’s nightclub the night before the Hammers lost a January 1971 FA Cup tie 4-0 at Blackpool.It was not until after he took his last drink in February 1978 that he returned to the public eye with This One’s On Me, the book detailing his troubles and near-downfall. He and his ghostwriter, Norman Giller, later penned novels, including one centred on “soccer superstar Jackie Groves” and another on “controversial manager Steve Walker”, who joins Alcoholics Anonymous in the fight against his demons, but it would be as a TV star that Greaves’s second life would be lived.At a time when those with regional accents would still attempt to amend their voices into an approximation of received pronunciation, Greaves spoke in an unabashed, unpretentious east London accent, his wit almost as sharp as his finishing skills. After stints on Central Television and ITV’s World of Sport, Saint and Greavsie first aired when he was just 45, a year older than Gary Neville is now.“I thought let’s have a lot of fun and we did,” Greaves, by then using a wheelchair, reminisced in April 2017, while being shown around the old White Hart Lane one last time. Such an attitude to football and football television is one largely absent from a game now far too serious for its own good."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b573ae413101877df56421851378ea1d4fe37072/0_343_5148_3089/master/5148.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a06c06b65aeeadfff6221fb217ad4ff8","title":"luxury bottled water is absurd so why is it so popular","story":"People pay top dollar for ‘premium’ brands indistinguishable in blind taste tests from tap water – is it about status, wellness or something more fundamental?Last year, judges at the 28th International Berkeley Springs Water Tasting competition deemed the best bottled water in the world to be an Australian brand “infused with the sound frequencies of love, the moon, and light spectrums of the rainbow”.Called Frequency H2O and sold for A$3.30 a liter (US$2.30), the water is, according to its creator Sturt Hinton, an “ultimate elixir of life”. Also recognized by the judges was Svalbarði, a company that sells $90 bottles of water freshly squeezed from – wait for it – melting Norwegian icebergs.The extravagant taglines and price tag make luxury bottled water a sort of liquid climate change for the rich. Despite an abundance of logical reasons to avoid it, the bottled water industry has never been stronger. And “premium” bottled water, the extra-fancy sort touted for “health benefits” like alkalinity, is the fastest-growing sector of the US bottled water industry, itself valued at $18.5bn.Whether such elite products are pumped from 3,000 feet beneath Hawaii or extracted from Fijian springs and sprinkled with gold dust, most justify their inherent excess with a similar refrain: the more obscure the origin, or elaborate the preparation, the healthier, higher quality, and more delicious the water.This, of course, is happening in a context where water scarcity is an accelerating global crisis, predicted to affect two-thirds of the world’s population by 2025. And plastic pollution, to which discarded water bottles contribute immensely, has become an issue so dire experts anticipate that by 2050 the ocean will be filled with more plastic than fish.Also to consider: nothing about bottled water makes it inherently superior to tap. The majority of American tap water is safe, as is essentially all UK tap water, and more closely regulated for contaminants than bottled. In blind taste tests, subjects cannot distinguish between bottled and tap water. And tap water, of course, is nearly free.So why do we buy it? For one, access to rarified waters has been a status symbol for centuries (think the 19th-century leisure-class craze for vacationing in “spa towns” or the devotion of historic European royals to the supposedly salubrious effects of thermal springs).Then there’s the wellness movement, responsible for a collective spurning of alcohol and soda, and promoting a more fervent interest in “luxury” water than ever. Indeed, luxe “water bars” and even vibrational frequency-charged bottled water brands have been making a go of it since at least 2006. Yet the American mainstream has probably never been as receptive of pricey, esoteric health products as during the current late-capitalistic peak wellness moment.And then there might be another reason, according researchers at Ontario’s University of Waterloo. The reason why society is so devoted to bottled water, they say, may be our fear of death.In a recent social-psychological study on water consumption choices, researchers Stephanie Cote and Sarah Wolfe claim, “iniduals’ unacknowledged death anxiety may be an unrecognized barrier to environmentally sustainable behavior change”.“Death reminders reliably increase humans’ selfish exploitation of natural resources,” writes Wolfe in her related work explaining that when humans consider our impending demise, our instinctive denial and need for distraction leads us to make irrational decisions. Such as, perhaps unconsciously, thinking: “How could the planet be dying when I hold in my hand a bottle of such unfathomably pristine water? How could I be dying when I’m making such healthy decisions?”Cote and Wolfe argue that the way that bottled water is marketed – its associations with wellbeing – happen to make it a particularly appealing antidote for existential despair.Take, for instance, Evian’s slogan – “Evian, drink young” – and its advertising’s use of babies to convey youth, or Fiji Water’s claim to be “bottled at the source, untouched by man”, and lush, tropical island imagery. The bottled water industry works hard to make its products look and feel like the opposite of death.But we can change our habits. On a personal level, it’s wise to carry a reusable water bottle – a status symbol in its own right. In their research, Cotes and Wolfe conclude that government pro-tap water campaigns would be more effective by embracing positive messaging about how wellness-enhancing tap water is, rather than harsh truths reminding consumers that plastic equals death. Governments can also enact bans on single-use plastic products, as Canada and the EU have pledged to do.Beyond the sheer extravagance of “premium” water, the central dilemma is that these products ultimately run counter to their own supposed precept: health – of the planet and all its inhabitants. The future may be scary, but it’s high time we wean ourselves from the bottle."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7a8df0242258c97ca7d5e88e7d866f8e7cc0c7d0/0_0_7360_4417/master/7360.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fa91c0361cc3f6650f73e77f93b4a27e","title":"tangram smart rope why mess with the zen like emptiness of skipping","story":"After 15 seconds, my legs are aching and my stomach is complaining. Does this flashy update really improve a six-year-old’s toy?There exists no purer evocation of childhood than the skipping rope. A rope, two handles, hours of fun. Of course, adults have a way of taking the same ingredients and making them far less innocent. Which possibly explains the Tangram Smart Rope (£79.95, appleuk): an “LED-embedded jump rope that displays your fitness data in mid-air”. Why? Does anyone really need an electronic skipping rope that has its own app? Surely this is the definition of flashiness for the sake of it?I put on my special shorts and get swinging, to see if such monstrosity can be defended. There is a good chance it can. While totally unnecessary, the image of a virtual counter racking up rope turns in mid-air is striking. And, as we know, coolness is infuriatingly self-justifying.But it is important not to fall into a nostalgia trap – exalting our childhood games and the way we played them. Remember how Father would smuggle a piece of coal home? We would pretend it was a mighty horse, taking turns to ride its dusty back! Ahhhh. But, no. Nostalgia is merely sandpaper that rubs jagged memories smooth. Things aren’t necessarily better for belonging to our past.Jump ropes don’t belong to my past, in any case. When I was young, skipping was for six-year-old girls in school playgrounds and 26-year-old men in boxing clubs, and I couldn’t relate to either. Now absent of such hangups, I’m interested, but inexperienced. Perhaps the Tangram Smart Rope can show me the ropes, 2019-style.The model I am testing is certainly a semi-handsome thing. Brushed metal handles in cherry red are topped with low-friction bearings, allowing free rotation of the matte-black rubber cable. The look is thrillingly reminiscent of a child’s first nunchaku. I feel like a Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle, albeit one who didn’t make the final cut. (Velázquez, the Pete Best of hero amphibians! Swinging his light-up rope with frictionless bearings!) None of this is bad. Trying to get into the groove, however, I’m frustrated.The central section of the rope is reinforced and inflexible, to protect the row of LEDs inside, and, as a result, it has a different density and feel. Moreover, the join between the cable and LED strip segments the rope, which impacts on the swinging of it. The thicker section is burdensome, and thuds when it slaps against the floor. It also increases resistance, making it hard to get a good rhythm going. Arguably, the heavier rope increases its fitness potential, requiring greater exertion to rotate. But it’s a drag, dude.The linked Tangram app is fine, and reliably counts the swings and also has a stab at estimating the number of calories burned. But the chief selling point of this model – the mid-air running counter – severely disappoints. The CGI on the box pictures a fitness model with a high number (2016 and rising) hovering before her at chest level, like the projection of a digital alarm clock.When I try it, the lights stay largely dark, erratically bursting into life for a few rotations before disappearing again. My pathetic figure (“0006”) is barely legible, like a fugitive firefly flashing on the ground, around my knees, above my head. It is strangely beautiful, this breathless grasping at phantasms. In fact, the rope could be a metaphor for life itself. But it would be more useful if it worked.This whole business of trying to spot and then interpret the flashes of light is unnecessarily stressful. It may sound odd to wish for exercise that was more relaxing, but the joy of skipping is a zen-like emptiness of repetition. When you are not in the zone, you are forced to remember that skipping is insanely, brutally hard work on the calves, glutes and lats. Maximum respect to six-year-old girls. After 15 seconds, my legs are aching, my stomach is complaining – and I have to skip to my loo, my darling.I try a few more times over several days and my stamina improves, but the LED functionality never does. An analogue rope wouldn’t let you down like this. Turns out this update on a classic is not flashy enough. Smart Rope thinks it’s too cool for school really it needs to work smarter, not harder.I eventually reached 0007, which is the closest I’ll get to Daniel Craig levels of fitness.I’d rather pay money for old rope. 15"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4afaf568eb7afdc378c1d1f43571aa28e6d97265/1108_281_3256_1953/master/3256.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5938c92e961d3c8b49e3e6be30a06f8b","title":"gym eat repeat the shocking rise of muscle dysmorphia","story":"The idealised male body has become bigger, bulkier and harder to achieve. So what drives a generation of young men to the all-consuming, often dangerous pursuit of perfection?It is difficult for Miles to pinpoint the moment his muscle dysmorphia started. It was just always there, a background hum. “As far back as I can remember, I wanted a better-looking body,” says the 35-year-old US soldier, now stationed in Mons, Belgium. When he was 13, Miles spent a summer cutting grass to save up for a secondhand Soloflex exercise machine. The machine cost $1,000 (£800), but as Miles was too young to join a gym, it was worth the expense. With the help of the Soloflex, Miles started weight training and never looked back.When he returned from a posting to Afghanistan at 24, things spiralled. He began obsessively working out and regimenting his meals. “I went all in ... it was full, hardcore dedication to the lifestyle.” Miles set his watch to beep every three hours, to remind him to eat. If it beeped when he was driving, he would pull over. Slowly, he whittled his body into shape. His muscles became striated, every fibre visible. Not big enough. At 95kg (210lbs) and 1.8 metres (6ft 2in), Miles wanted to be more muscular leaner. He lost 22kg and started competing in amateur bodybuilding competitions. There was virtually no fat on him. “You pinch your skin and it just stays pinched.” His girlfriend left him. “She began to realise that my body dysmorphia was like dating another person.” The pursuit of muscularity took over his life. “I just thought, I am so lean, and shredded, and veiny, and masculine – I don’t ever want to go back to how I was before.”Yet by 33, single again – the dysmorphia had claimed yet another relationship – it had all become too much and he was in a dark place. “I did not enjoy life in any way, shape or form.” All day long, he would starve himself, struggle through punishing workouts, go home and binge-eat before throwing it all up. One evening, waiting in line at the burger chain In-N-Out for more food to purge, Miles finally decided enough was enough. “I woke up so happy the next day, knowing it was over.”What drives a generation of young men to slavishly pursue this physical ideal? “Over the past decades, the idealised male body image has got bigger and bulkier,” says Nagata.This body type even pressed its way into our children’s bedrooms: studies show that action figures have become brawnier over the past 25 years.This wasn’t always the case. “In the 70s, we saw very slim, almost androgynous men, like Mick Jagger and David Bowie ... to be muscular was to be defined as to be militaristic, at a time when, in the US, there were protests against the Vietnam war,” says Dr Roberto Olivardia of Harvard Medical School, an expert in male body image. “So that build was really frowned on and rejected by youth culture.“But then the 80s came about, with figures like Ronald Reagan, who was pro-military, and men like Arnold Schwarzenegger and Sylvester Stallone.” This ideal male – hyper-masculine, militaristic, strong above all else – was exported globally through films such as First Blood (1982), Predator (1987) and The Terminator (1984). WWE wrestling was founded in 1980, and the likes of Hulk Hogan became celebrities. In the late 90s, a leaner but still very muscular aesthetic – popularised by Brad Pitt in the movie Fight Club – became fashionable.Today’s muscle men stare down at us from the billboards of superhero films featuring stars such as Chris Hemsworth or Jason Momoa, the latter only last week body-shamed online after photographs emerged of him enjoying himself on holiday in fractionally less-than-superhero condition. On the small screen, the current crop of Love Island contestants mug for the cameras in tiny swimming trunks, all the better to display their perfect six-packs.However, just as fashion magazines don’t cause anorexia, but contribute to a toxic environment in which extreme thinness is celebrated, Hulk Hogan, Dwayne ‘the Rock’ Johnson and Chris Hemsworth are not to be blamed for the disordered behaviours sweeping our gyms. According to the NHS, we do not yet know what causes body dysmorphia disorders but genetics, a chemical imbalance in the brain or a traumatic experience in your past may play a part. You are also more likely to develop it if you were bullied or abused as a child, something student Nathaniel Shaw knows well. The 28-year-old was bullied at secondary school – they called him a Borrower, on account of his slender frame.“I was always the small kid in the corner that no one wanted to speak to.” Social acceptance came one squat press at a time. “From where I’m from in Nottingham, because it’s a very rough place, you’re training to protect yourself. The bigger guys are the serious people that no one wants to mess with. That was the main thing at the start – get big and be taken seriously.”When Shaw went to college at age 17, he had a plan: work out all winter and reveal his buff body come summer. But when he took off his T-shirt playing football one afternoon, a girl said that Shaw “had no chest”. He instantly put his top back on. “I still wasn’t good enough.” The unkind comment laid waste to Shaw’s fragile self-esteem he walked away from the wreckage determined to become even more shredded.Shaw’s life became: the gym, home to eat enormous portions of tuna, pasta and cheese, move as little as possible to conserve energy and repeat. Shaw detached from the contours of normal life. He stayed in bed longer, later and missed exams. He was depressed. “The pursuit of this muscular ideal takes over people’s lives,” explains Nagata. “They become obsessed with it. They can’t function in their daily life outside of pursuing this ideal and it can lead to depression, missing school or work, and losing their ability to do basic living tasks.”To an observer, Shaw – who weighed 80kg at 1.7 metres – was tank-like. But that wasn’t how he saw himself. “I would be in the gym and say: ‘I look like shit.’ Everyone would be like: ‘No you don’t, you’re huge, I wish I could look like that.’” Muscle dysmorphia is a disease of perception. Although its sufferers live in the material world – a place of grunting exertion and weighted bags and scoopable protein powders – they spend most of their time in an imagined reality, where they are incalculably huge. Their biceps are swollen watermelons each muscle as finely striated as the delicate contours of a seashell.But even if they eventually achieve that physique, it is not enough. As soon as one muscular ideal is achieved, a new goal appears. “There’s a saying: ‘Once you step into a gym, you’re forever small,’” says 27-year-old Rich Selby, an amateur bodybuilder from Cardiff. Miles agrees. “Every muscle could be bigger. I could be leaner. You look at yourself and feel like everything is small and weak. I have no chest muscles I have no arm muscles ... you’re judging yourself against an impossible standard.”Social media reflects this standard back at you. “You’re being sold a false reality,” says Miles. “I can get into really good shape, right before I’m doing a bodybuilding competition, and use lighting and angles and filters to make my physique look even crazier than it already is, and save a bunch of pictures and upload them to make it seem that I always look like that, all year round.”Some turn to illegal substances to attain this ideal. Tony, 23, works for a pharmaceutical distributor in Dallas. He started taking illegal performance-enhancing drugs, including testosterone, equipoise and nandrolone, two years ago. The drugs created a dangerous feedback loop: the more he injected, the more his body changed and the more he took. “People are like: ‘Wow, that guy’s a tank.’ They have more respect for you ... I thought, heck yeah, I’m going to take more so I can get even bigger.”It is a common experience: muscle dysmorphia can be fuelled by the positive reinforcement men receive from other men in the gym. “When you’re large, you get a lot of respect,” Selby confirms. Men come up to him and ask how much he can bench. Sometimes they try to start fights. “That’s why people become addicted. They’re insecure, so they need confirmation from other people.” Selby self-identifies as having muscle dysmorphia, but believes that he has it under control, because he has good self-esteem.Up close, you can see the havoc muscle dysmorphia wreaks. “Your interpersonal relationships fall apart – but you are so caught up in the endorphin rush of affirmation from your gym buddies, you barely notice,” says Miles. “You’re kind of an asshole. You don’t realise it ... you just become this all-around grouch. It consumes not only all of your time and focus, but also the human part of you.” It’s also a lonely existence. All your time is spent preparing protein-rich food, but because you are over-exercising, you are often “hungry, and cranky, and don’t sleep well”.Tony was one young man who used drugs to bulk up. He knew what he was doing was dangerous: he would even donate blood to get his blood pressure down. “I just genuinely didn’t care.” As he cycled on and off drugs, he experienced dramatic mood swings. He got fired from his job at a hardware store for screaming at a coworker in the break room. Eventually, his mental health deteriorated so much that he came off all the drugs in May last year.What makes someone play Russian roulette with a steroid-filled syringe? Selby thinks people are driven to desperate measures because they cannot disassociate who they are from how they look.It’s an obsession that can prove fatal. Freddie Dibben, 28, died in March 2017 after his heart became enlarged by the stimulant Clenbuterol. His father Clifford, 69, found him. “The hardest part was going back through to the kitchen and telling his mum what I found. It’ll never go away.” Like Tony, Freddie experienced mood swings. “He would snap at you,” Clifford says, recalling an incident where Freddie was “stroppy” with him as they tinkered with his car. He put the moodiness down to work stress – Freddie had been pulling a lot of night shifts at Wilton carpet factory, where colleagues referred to him as a “forklift”, on account of how much he could carry.But Clifford felt blessed to have a health-conscious son he didn’t see anything to be alarmed about. A keen gym-goer, Freddie even gave up smoking at his parents’ request. “He used to cook all his own food! He’d cook a meal before he went to work ... he had two sets of scales, and he weighed all his vegetables, everything. He even kept notes of what he was eating and what he was doing.” Clifford laughs, bitterly. “Except for the bloody drugs.”And that is one of the issues of muscle dysmorphia – you can hide in plain sight. A pair of weighing scales in the kitchen tupperware boxes of chicken and broccoli in your backpack. Most people view these as harmless, if idiosyncratic, behaviours. And when you look like you are hewn out of marble, it is hard to consider anything is amiss. It is only when you step past the facade that you realise these statue-like men are slowly destroying themselves.•Some of the names in the piece have been changed"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/01ff2d3426c8c59669e7447950188eb85ffd2f19/1382_270_2679_1608/master/2679.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=88304e8be17c57dfd618cf23a7e1658a","title":"id take no deal over no brexit says labours sarah champion","story":"Former shadow minister says she cannot support Labour becoming a remain partyThe former shadow cabinet minister Sarah Champion has said she would “take no deal” over remaining in the EU, arguing that Labour had to deliver the result of the referendum.MPs close to Boris Johnson have suggested they believe his administration could secure enough Labour votes to pass a new version of a Brexit deal, after Jeremy Corbyn said Labour would campaign for remain in a second referendum.Champion, a former shadow equalities minister who repeatedly voted against Theresa May’s Brexit deal, said she could not support Labour transforming into a remain party.“If my party comes out as a remain party rather than trying to find a deal or rather than trying to exit, I can’t support that, it goes against democracy,” the MP for Rotherham told BBC Politics Live. “I want us to leave, the country wants us to leave and for our democracy I think we have to leave.”Champion said it was an “awful question” as to whether she would prefer no deal over no Brexit, but she said: “If it came to it I would take no deal if that meant we could leave.”Champion appeared to suggest she had thought Labour MPs could get more concessions from May, and this had prevented her from backing the prime minister’s deal.“It’s poker, isn’t it? And if I’m being completely honest, I hoped she would listen to what the Labour frontbench was saying and move and she didn’t. The extent she moved effectively caused her to be sacked.”Asked whether she would back the government in a confidence vote in order to deliver a no deal, Champion said: “I don’t know. Ask me closer to the time.”Several Labour MPs have expressed regret that they did not vote for May’s Brexit deal in March, before the EU’s extension, including Gareth Snell and Stephen Kinnock. “I made a mistake,” Snell told the House of Commons last month. Snell said Labour “will have been responsible for a no-deal Brexit by default because of our inability to make a decision”.One minister close to Johnson said they believed that if Johnson was confirmed as prime minister he would be more able to bring MPs on board with a new deal. “I don’t think we will get to no deal,” the minister said.“If Boris is able to bring MPs from all sides of the party on to the campaign, he is more likely to bring people with him to get a deal through. There may now be enough Labour MPs who are ready to end this mess – and sick of Corbyn’s position – in order to pass this.”Kinnock wrote in the  last month that MPs should have been whipped to back May’s deal, calling it “far from ideal” but calling it “the only feasible means of preventing no deal”.Labour MPs who are prepared to back a new Brexit deal may not be prepared to vote against their party whip in a confidence vote. A new prime minister’s working majority in the Commons is likely to be reduced to three if the Liberal Democrats win the Brecon and Radnorshire byelection on 1 August.Two Tory MPs, Dominic Grieve and Kenneth Clarke, have suggested they would be prepared to vote against the government but a number of other MPs’ positions are uncertain.They include the independent Northern Irish MP Sylvia Hermon and the former Labour MPs Frank Field, Ian Austin and John Woodcock, who are strongly opposed to a Corbyn government.

Western civilisation owes an immense debt to Islam, whether in the form of algebra, the saving of ancient Greek heritage or the free-market economics of Ibn Khaldun.Johnson is correct that many Muslim-majority nations are beset by social and political problems. Yet the same holds true for numerous Christian-majority nations such as Russia, Honduras, Haiti and South Africa. He also makes a “false equivalence” argument in comparing stable western democracies to war-ravaged countries like Bosnia, seemingly blaming Muslims there for being attacked. Curiously, Muslim extremists promote the same arguments as Johnson, albeit for different aims. Neither depiction is true nor helpful.Another pathetic observation by the next British PM concerns the Ottoman empire. Johnson takes one oddity of the Turkish dawlah – the resistance to the printing press – and passes over achievements of the sultans such as religious tolerance and the architectural feats of Sinan. He claims this one act of backwardness negates the entire history of Islam, although resistance to technology is apparent even in British history, the luddites a classic case in point.Johnson’s authority for his ignorance is Winston Churchill. If Churchill said it, it must be true. However, Churchill was neither a historian nor a sociologist. He was a myth-maker whose literary skills were devoted to “demonstrating” the superiority of the Anglo-Saxon race over all others. To achieve this sleight of hand, Churchill had to simultaneously denigrate other cultures, including Islam. It seems that Great Britain under Johnson will be beset by similar doses of myth, fantasy and supremacist doctrines.Dr Colm GillisHethersett, Norfolk• Boris Johnson is quite wrong to deprecate Islamic civilisation by comparison with the achievements of Rome, which he is so fond of trumpeting. As the great historian Lévi-Provençal expounded in detail, from military organisation to public administration, from urban planning to irrigated agriculture, the caliphate in Córdoba was an advanced “medieval” regime, for three centuries the effective inheritor of Roman Spain. But it was also highly repressive, imposing the dhimmi subject-status on Christians and Jews and judicial murder on opponents and apostates. This is doctrinal policy in Islam, as shown by the practices of the caliphates in Iraq and Syria in those times, and more recently in ours. Modern liberal democracy, for all its unrealised ambitions (eg social equality), is infinitely friendlier to freedom and human dignity than either Islamic or Roman rule.Peter LomasBalmullo, Fife• Before deprecating Islamic civilisation as inferior to western, the Tory contender should surely acknowledge the outstanding examples of high Arabic society and culture seen in such places as mudéjar (Moorish) Spain, notably Granada’s Alhambra Palace, Córdoba’s Mezquita mosque and Seville’s Alcázar as well as in cities beyond, like Palermo, Fez and Damascus.Not only did these Islamic civilisations lead in the fields of astronomy, science, medicine and farming irrigation when most of Europe was still in the dark ages, but they also encouraged Muslims, Christians and Jews to live and trade together in harmony for centuries.Sadly (as surely the scholarly Johnson must know), much of this rich tapestry was swept away by invading armies from either Turkey in the east or Christian Castile in the north. Given such wanton ignorance, is Boris Johnson really fit to unite and lead an increasingly multicultural Britain?Paul DolanNorthwich, Cheshire• While not wishing to support Boris Johnson in any way (I think he would make a disastrous PM), may I offer Professor Jim Al-Khalili’s suggestion, made in one of his programmes, that the complexity of Arabic script may have impeded the Arab world’s enormous strides in mathematics, art, literature, medicine and astronomy up until the middle ages. The invention of the printing press and its use to disseminate western culture and ideas worldwide and the inability or difficulty of doing the same with Arabic script may have been one of the causes of the loss of impetus for the Muslim world. Just an idea.Joan HepworthLondon• Given Boris Johnson will not be long at 10 Downing Street, perhaps he should apply for the master of studies at his old university in Islamic studies and history. On the other hand, I doubt he has the linguistic skills to get in. The great Arab scholar Ibn Khaldun, in 1377, in his preface to the Muqaddimah, wrote: “The inner meaning of history … involves speculation and an attempt to get at the truth, subtle explanation of the causes and origins of existing things, and deep knowledge of the how and why of events.” The “how and why” of Boris Johnson and his many wayward events over the years speak for themselves. What did Mr Johnson learn during his four years at Balliol College, Oxford? Bruce Ross-SmithOxford• It is astonishing that Polly Toynbee, in commenting on the Laffer curve (Journal, 16 July), should describe Ibn Khaldun as “an obscure 14th-century Islamic scholar”. Her grandfather, the world historian, Arnold J Toynbee, described Ibn Khaldun’s introduction to the Muqaddimah as “undoubtedly the greatest work of its kind that has ever been created by any mind in any time or place”. Ibn Khaldun is regarded by both western and Islamic scholars as one of the world’s great minds. Clearly there has been, down the generations, a narrowing of view and understanding.Francis RobinsonEgham, Surrey • Join the debate – email • Read more  letters – click here to visit guletters• Do you have a photo you’d like to share with  readers?

Yet even if the conspiracy theories are true and the Nevada air force facility harbors extraterrestrial technology andor life, it would still barely qualify as being weirder than the internet where, early this month the anonymous users behind a Facebook meme page proposed a jaunty group invasion of the restricted compound.In a Facebook event titled “Storm Area 51, They Can’t Stop All of Us,” the creators explain: “We will all meet up at the Area 51 Alien Center tourist attraction and coordinate our entry. If we naruto run, we can move faster than their bullets. Let’s see them aliens.”The “naruto run” part of this call to action refers to the particular, oft-memed, ostrich-like sprint of a popular Japanese anime character.Their plan, scheduled for the wee hours of 20 September, has gained momentum 1.4 million people have RSVP’d as “attending” the raid, while 1.1 million more are “interested”.In a post pinned to the top of the event page, a user named Jackson Barnes has drawn a diagram “game plan”, illustrating how different factions of attendees could best swarm the base.Beneath his scheme, Barnes writes: “Hello US government, this is a joke, and I do not actually intend to go ahead with this plan. I just thought it would be funny and get me some thumbsy uppies on the internet.” (He currently has 101,000 “thumbsy uppies” for his effort).Barnes’s disclaimer contains perhaps the most important bit of information to retain from this story: “Storm Area 51” is all a joke. And through engaging with that joke, most people are simply trying to take it to further extremes of silliness, such as by posting goofy blitzkrieg suggestions based on astrological signs.The US air force, however, is not amused, with a spokeswoman telling the New York Times “any attempt to illegally access military installations or military training areas is dangerous”. “No trespassing” signs in the area reportedly state that the use of “deadly force” against intruders is authorized.The Times also noted that Nevada’s alien-themed Little A’Le’Inn hotel has been booked solid on 20 September, with many guests referencing the Facebook event while making reservations. It seems some people hope to take this gag as far as they can.Granted, even those who do travel to Nevada with the intent to descend upon Area 51 are very unlikely to get anywhere close to the base’s restricted zone, not only because it’s assiduously surveilled and patrolled, but because it’s located deep within a desolate and punishingly hot stretch of desert, far from amenities like convenience stores and public bathrooms. Is that really how anyone wants to spend their vacation days? In this economy?Whether this wildfire meme will be forgotten by next week, or catalyze real (inadvisable!) action come 20 September remains to be seen.The truth, maybe, is out there."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0eceecf095f25782c65e40902bc48e40b3a93cbb/0_0_4096_2456/master/4096.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d2b84f3eecb08e0b2a62b71944181937","title":"babies nepal get quarter calories junk food study","story":"Diets heavy on snack foods linked to undernutrition and stunting, say researchersChildren under the age of two in Nepal are getting a quarter of their calories from junk food, according to groundbreaking research that warns their diet is linked to stunting and undernutrition.Biscuits, crisps, instant noodles and sugary drinks appear to be displacing foods with the vitamins, minerals and other vital nutrients babies need to grow well, say the researchers. The work, published in the Journal of Nutrition, illustrates that the 21st-century junk food diet spreading around the globe is linked not just to obesity but also to poor growth in children.The study was carried out in the Kathmandu Valley among the families of 745 children aged between 12 and 23 months. It is among the first to look at the nutritional effects of snack foods given to small children in a low-income country. The researchers work for Helen Keller International, a global health organisation.They found that all the children in the study ate junk food, some more than others. Those who got half their calories from high-sugar, high-salt and high-fat snacks were shorter than others of their age who ate less of them. They were more likely to have inadequate levels of the nutrients that are vital for growth and development, including protein, calcium, iron, vitamin A and zinc.“We hope these findings sound the alarm for researchers and policymakers alike – there is a need for continued research on the role of snack food products in the health and development of nutritionally vulnerable children,” said Dr Alissa Pries, the principal investigator of the Assessment and Research on Child Feeding project.“Packaged snack food products – typically high in sugar and salt and low in micronutrients – are increasingly available across the globe. There is already growing global concern in the health community over the role of junk foods or ultra-processed foods in the obesity epidemic, but for young children in contexts where access to nutritious food is limited, this study signals that these foods may also be contributing to undernutrition.”Snack foods, some processed and packaged locally and some of them international, were common all over Nepal, even in remote places, she said. “They are available on the shelves. There is marketing that is occurring. Mothers and fathers choose these products, as in the US and UK, because they are convenient – and the child gets a preference for these sugary snacks.“A lot of the caregivers reported that the foods were not good for young children – they used the English words ‘junk food’ – but they said the driving force was convenience. They are easy to prepare and easy to feed. Children can hold them and eat them.”Pries said she was disturbed by the findings. “Knowing that a quarter of all the calories that these babies were consuming were coming from unhealthy food and beverages – to me that was shocking,” she told the . “The prevalence of consumption of these foods is growing. We are seeing it globally.”The study was observational, so could not prove cause and effect, but the authors are calling for more research into the potentially damaging developmental effects of junk food on small children.“There is growing evidence that children are consuming unhealthy snack products at a shocking rate,” said Dr Atul Upadhyay, a co-author on the paper. “More attention and efforts need to focus on increasing consumption of nutrient‐rich, locally available foods and developing strategies to limit consumption of unhealthy snack products among young children.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e49e6ab3b9583abedfbee49e597799965c56345f/0_167_4284_2570/master/4284.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=766a2ac35b77cc746ea71939d2acdd69","title":"chimps more sociable after watching movies together study","story":"Evolutionary roots of bonding through shared activity may be deeper than was thoughtChimpanzees enjoy watching movies together, scientists have discovered, in research that suggests social bonding through shared experience has deep evolutionary roots.It is widely known that humans can bond over group activities such as watching a movie or playing board games. But it has been unclear whether the underlying psychology behind this effect is present in other species.“Humans have an enormous variety of social bonding activities that we don’t see in other species because they’re somewhat cultural – for example listening to music or watching movies,” said Wouter Wolf, a graduate student at Duke University in North Carolina and an author on the study. “We thought that this kind of connecting through shared experiences was uniquely human”In the research, published in the journal Proceedings of the Royal Society B, chimpanzees were placed in pairs and shown a short video. The researchers then measured how long it took them to approach their partners, how close they got and how long they remained in proximity – two measures of social bonding. The effect was also measured for pairs of bonobos and for great apes paired with humans.Great apes who had viewed the video with either another of their own species or a human approached their partner faster or spent longer in proximity to them, compared with those who had watched the video on their own, the scientists found.The finding indicates that social bonding created by shared experience may have deeper evolutionary roots than previously thought.“Animals can stand together and watch a waterfall, but they don’t seem to seek out those kinds of experiences,” said Wolf. “So for a long time we thought they weren’t capable of processing that way or they weren’t feeling any psychological consequences from doing so.“It’s exciting that at least some parts of the psychology that we need to connect through shared experiences may actually have a slightly older evolutionary history than previously suspected.” The animals were tracked for only three minutes after they had watched the film, so it is not clear whether shared experiences strengthen social bonds in the long term. The research used animals in captivity, and scientists said it was not known whether the same effects would be observed in the wild.A similar study is being planned to measure the effect in children."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/38430d2aa6fa407284bd976d5aa554920dac1d3e/0_116_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=465\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9442fbb70513d19569f19c6018f76570 465w","title":"montana fossilized dueling dinosaurs skeletons dino cowboy","story":"A Montana rancher found two skeletons in combat – the Dueling Dinosaurs. But who do they belong to, and will the public ever see them? The early June morning in Montana was already very hot and dry by 7.30, when Clayton Phipps and his friend, Mark Eatman, set out to search for fossils. Phipps, a rancher who calls himself the Dino Cowboy, was wearing his trademark black felt Stetson cattleman hat.The two had gone bone collecting before, but they were joined on this day for the first time by Phipps’s cousin, Chad O’Connor. The trio fanned out to hike through the badlands of what they thought was the Judith River Formation later, they would learn they had actually been in an area called Hell Creek, a ision of gray and ochre sandstone, shale and clay deposited about 66m years ago during the Late Cretaceous, when the area was a swampy floodplain.Phipps, like most locals, calls it the Hell Crik. It’s one of the most storied dinosaur fossil sites in the world.At lunchtime, the group reconvened for roast beef sandwiches. Phipps asked Eatman if he had found anything. Yes, he said⁠, a pelvis weathering out of a hill – not a big deal, except this one appeared to have an articulated femur, potentially suggesting a rare level of completeness. They went to the site. Phipps could tell right away it was from a ceratopsian, a group of herbivorous, beaked dinosaurs. He brushed away some of the sand, and thought there might be more of the dinosaur buried in the hillside.But excavating it would have to wait for another day: he had 260 acres of hay to cut for cattle feed.Eatman went back to Billings, where he had gotten a job at a carpet store after a run of bad luck put an end to his 13-year career as a full-time fossil hunter. (“His wife said: ‘We’re starving to death – you gotta get a real job,’” Phipps recalls.)O’Connor and Phipps headed home to Phipps’s ranch. “We weren’t all that excited,” he says. “It was a pelvis in the ground at the bottom of a canyon that was really remote and no roads to it at all. We had no plans to go back, but Chad convinced us to. I’m sure glad we did.”Phipps and O’Connor returned to the site about a month later, this time with Lige and Mary Ann Murray, ranchers who owned the land where the bones had been found. In the US, fossils found on private land belong to the landowner prospectors simply need their permission to dig. The Murrays signed off, and Phipps and O’Connor got to work. They built a road to the site. They began excavating the ceratopsian with penknives and brushes. Business partners were brought in secret contracts were arranged. Eatman came to help when he could, along with a rotating cast of confidants.After two weeks, the body of the plant-eater had been revealed. It was more than a pelvis and femur – it looked like a fairly complete skeleton of Triceratops horridus, which is the triceratops you’re thinking of. One day, Phipps was behind the wheel of his uncle’s backhoe, scooping out soil from around the fossil so it could be removed. Carefully watching each dump of the bucket, at one point he noticed dark fragments among the light-colored sandstone.Oh no, he thought. He jumped down, combed through the sand, found the claw of a theropod. Theropods, like Tyrannosaurus rex, are three-toed carnivores. That doesn’t match the plant-eater, Phipps thought. What is happening here?Phipps scrambled down into the quarry where he had been digging and brushed away more sand. A hand appeared. Then a leg. It was clear: there was another dinosaur in the outcrop.“It was just surreal,” Phelps remembers. “Obviously, these two dinosaurs weren’t friends, so what were they doing in there together?”Phipps had been hunting for dinosaur fossils since 1998, excavating and preparing them to sell at trade shows and to museums and private collectors. But he had never found anything like this. “I think,” he says, “my hat went in the air that day.”This was in 2006. Three months of intensive excavation followed, during which Phipps lost 15 pounds. In the end, he and his partners had a 28ft-long ceratopsian and a 22ft-long theropod in four multi-ton blocks. “A little cowboy ingenuity, and we got ’em out of the hills,” Phipps says.The meat-eater was either a juvenile T rex or its relative, Nanotyrannus lancensis, a rare dwarf species whose existence is disputed. Both dinosaurs were extraordinarily well-preserved, fully articulated, with envelopes of skin and, possibly, mummified internal organs.Best of all, they seemed to have died together, not washed into their grave separately. And they appeared to have been battling when they died: teeth were found in the spine and near the pelvis of the ceratopsian, and the theropod’s skull was split laterally, as if it had been kicked.Phipps dubbed them the Montana Dueling Dinosaurs. “They’re remarkable specimens,” says Mark Norell, chairman of paleontology at the American Museum of Natural History. “Especially the tyrannosaur – it could go a long way toward resolving whether nanotyrannus was its own species.”Thirteen years later, the number of people who have seen the fossils remains in the low double digits. They’ve still not been fully extracted from the rock matrix, cleaned, prepped, studied or put on display. Phipps isn’t even at liberty to say where they are – he’ll only reveal that they’re at an American museum, pending the resolution of Murray v BEJ Minerals LLC, which deals with who owns what’s on top of the land versus what’s beneath it.“Dinosaurs bring drama,” Phipps says, “and being a cowboy, I’m not a drama fan. You can have it.”For years after unearthing the Dueling Dinosaurs, Phipps and his team tried every tactic they could think of to drum up interest for a sale. They set up a website, and a marketing campaign called the Paleo-Incident Project. They tried to get sponsors, like Dr Pepper, to fund further work on the fossils. They posted videos on YouTube, men in western wear standing around the fossil jackets, taking turns talking into microphones.They contacted natural history museums around the world, including the Smithsonian – where the bones were offered for a reported $15m – and the Museum of the Rockies, in Billings, whose head paleontologist, Jack Horner (the inspiration for the character played by Sam Neill in Jurassic Park) told them they were scientifically useless.“In order for a specimen to be of scientific use and publishable, we have to know its exact geographic position, its exact stratigraphic position, and the specimen must also be in the public trust, accessible for study, which this specimen is not,” Horner says.Phipps called Horner’s reaction “sad”, adding: “If somebody in his position is telling the world that the best dinosaurs possibly ever discovered in the world are worthless, what donor’s gonna donate anything to paleontology?”Acrimony between commercial and academic paleontologists is abundant. “The haters are always gonna hate,” Phipps says. “No question about that.”In the meantime, other valuable dinosaur fossils were found on the 27,000-acre Murray ranch, including a well-preserved triceratops skull and nearly complete adult T rex, which a Dutch museum purchased for several million dollars. The Dueling Dinosaurs themselves went to auction in 2013 at Bonhams in New York, but no bid met the reserve price of $6m.Though the fossils technically belonged to the Murrays, they ceded control of what to do with them to Phipps and his team via a contract, the details of which remain private. “We have a pretty loose arrangement, to be real truthful,” Mary Ann says. The deal specifies that any proceeds be split between the Murrays and Phipps Phipps will then subide his percentage with his team, which includes the owners of CK Preparations, a commercial fossil services company, and Peter Larson of the Black Hills Institute of Geological Research, which has unearthed some of the most complete T rex specimens ever found.Larson’s story is also one of loss. After the T rex known as “Sue” was discovered by Black Hills in 1990, a dispute arose over its legal ownership. Two years later, the bones were seized by the FBI and South Dakota national guard in a highly publicized case, and ownership was returned to the landowner, a Sioux rancher whose deed was held in trust by the Bureau of Indian Affairs. He sold Sue at auction for a record $8.36m to the Field Museum in Chicago. Subsequently, Larson was sentenced to two years in federal prison on separate charges related to trafficking fossils, including failing to report to customs traveler’s checks and cash transported internationally, and illegally taking a fossil worth less than $100 from federal land.His experience with the legal morass around dinosaur fossils would prove useful later.Lige and Mary Ann Murray were young hired hands in 1983 when they began working for George Severson, a longtime Montana rancher. The Murrays had a good relationship with him and a few years later, near the end of his life, Severson sold them half of his ranch, leaving the rest to his sons, Jerry and Bo, who live outside the state.For 14 years, the Seversons and Murrays operated the ranch in amicable partnership. But in 2005, the Murrays purchased the other half of the land. Exactly why is unclear the Seversons say Lige called to ask about buying them out, while Mary Ann says the Seversons approached them unexpectedly. An agreement was reached to split the estate: the Murrays would control all of the surface rights and one-third of the mineral rights, and the Seversons would retain the rest of the mineral rights.The following summer, the Dueling Dinosaurs were found.“Lige and I knew nothing about fossils,” Mary Ann Murray says. “We just ran cows and farms, that’s all we did.”Fossils, undoubtedly, can be composed of minerals, but they have generally been recognized as belonging to the surface estate owner – whom we normally think of as the landowner – in cases where the estate is split. The Department of the Interior ruled in 1915 that “fossil remains of dinosaurs and other prehistoric animals are not mineral”, after the Carnegie Museum of Natural History paleontologist Earl Douglass had tried to procure a huge deposit of dinosaur bones with a mining claim. (The site today is Dinosaur National Monument.) This imposed some semblance of order after the wild west days of fossil hunting, when rivalrous collectors like Edward Drinker Cope and Othniel Charles Marsh would freely roam public lands, digging up fossils to sell to museums or wealthy collectors. It has been the precedent ever since.The Seversons say they didn’t know the bones were worth much until 2013, when they were appraised between $7 and $9m before the auction. So they decided to assert a mineral rights claim after the Murrays refused to share any of the future proceeds. The following year, the Murrays filed a lawsuit seeking a declaratory judgment that the fossils were theirs because they owned the surface estate. A district court ruled in their favor, leading the Seversons to appeal to the US ninth circuit.In a test, last November that court ruled that fossils on Montana state and private land could be considered minerals. “Once upon a time, in a place now known as Montana, dinosaurs roamed the land,” begins Judge Eduardo Robreno’s opinion. “On a fateful day, some 66m years ago, two such creatures, a 22ft-long theropod and a 28ft-long ceratopsian, engaged in mortal combat. While history has not recorded the circumstances surrounding this encounter, the remnants of these Cretaceous species, interlocked in combat, became entombed under a pile of sandstone. That was then … this is now.”The decision sent shockwaves through the field of paleontology, jeopardizing as it did the status of any fossil found on private land in Montana. The Murrays filed for an en banc appeal, supported by an amicus curiae brief from paleontological institutions including the Field Museum, the Museum of the Rockies and the Society of Vertebrate Paleontology – which had opposed Larson in the Sue case.“By reversing a widely accepted understanding of land rights,” the brief states, “the panel decision subjects scientifically important fossil collections to damaging ownership disputes and impedes future efforts of the paleontological community to discover, collect and study fossils.”The state of Montana, meanwhile, unanimously passed legislation clarifying the definition of fossils and distinguishing them from minerals.En banc appeals are rarely granted, but in May the Murrays got good news: the ninth circuit, “in the spirit of comity and federalism”, vacated its decision and punted the case to the Montana supreme court, where it will be taken up later this year.Larson sees some similarities to the Sue case – “when people, through a lot of hard work, make a fantastic discovery, there’s always somebody with their hand open” – but he’s more optimistic about the outcome for the Dueling Dinosaurs. And while the Seversons, the Murrays and the commercial paleontologists disagree on much, they all claim to want the fossils to end up in a museum, where their immense scientific potential can be explored, and they can be put on display for people – the undisputed inheritors of natural history.The question of who owns a fossil gets slippier the further back one goes. Before the Murrays or Seversons ever set foot in Montana, it was Sioux, Cheyenne, Crow and Blackfoot territory. The oldest dated human burial site in North America is near present-day Wilsall, Montana. For millions of years before that, the uplift of the Laramide orogeny, which created the Rocky Mountains in the west, was depositing thousands of feet of sediment in what is now eastern Montana, creating the rare conditions needed to fossilize the remains of the terrible lizards that had roamed that land long before, for humans to later find and fight over.But that was then. This is now.“To get it down in cowboy terms, I’m getting an education in our justice system I never wanted to pay for,” Phipps says. “I’m in my 40s and I’d never needed an attorney until this. I try to live my life to avoid ’em.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fec7b07a7575c33e2bc28cd1fb6d913695c4ad44/0_0_2419_1451/master/2419.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a5c8ae63d3b252ce40203edec4d1474b","title":"cricket world cup 10 fans countries review action","story":"Readers from around the world reflect on seven weeks of cricket and one astounding finalEngland’s run to the semi-finals, and indeed final, could not have been more quintessentially English. The team came into the tournament on a great run and hope was lifted to even greater heights with a few high-quality performances, only to be met with a crash back to traditional English cynicism when we almost inevitably lost to two tournament underdogs. From this point on though, they were exceptional, rising to the challenge of what essentially became four consecutive knockout games.What else can be said about the final? It was the best game of cricket I’ve witnessed and quite possibly the best of all time. The match had it all and England finally proved that they can stand up in those pressure moments in a knockout tournament. They had no small degree of luck and there was plenty of tension, but how else would you want to win your first Cricket World Cup?Let’s hope this group stays together for one more World Cup under the cool head of Eoin Morgan and a coach who will further develop this exciting brand of cricket. It would be easy to see this as the pinnacle, but how incredible would it be to push for an Australia-esque World Cup dynasty? Matt LeechWe delivered the greatest of World Cup finals. No other countries would have produced such a game. New Zealand always get stuck into games and regularly deliver some of the greatest cricketing spectacles. It’s such a shame we remain financially uninteresting for cricketing schedulers. Winning the World Cup might have changed that, but we are worthy runners-up.Jimmy Neesham was my player of the tournament. He plays hard and fearless, keeps going and has a mental toughness and mature outlook on life. He will have plenty of big moments in his career. Malcolm EddingtonIndia were like a critically acclaimed television show. After power-packed leading performances from neo-noir legend Rohit Sharma and the experimental yet highly engaging directorship from Jasprit Bumrah, most expected that pair, along with a strong supporting cast, to help India execute a stunning finale. But, despite bringing in the biggest viewing figures, the show was cancelled at the last moment by the executives at the World Cup – the notorious Kiwis.MS Dhoni was a fan favourite, but his personal style did not suit the overall tone of the crew. Rishabh Pant, a cult hero on the local soap opera, Indian Premier League, wasn’t ready for the biggest stage just yet. Surely, by the time the next big show comes around, he will be in the spotlight. Scriptwriter Virat Kohli was excellent but still did not meet his lofty standards and fluffed the ending. Cameos from Sir Ravindra Jadeja grabbed bits and pieces of the public imagination and an unexpected starring role during India’s final moments justified calls for his regular introduction to the set-up in the future. Abhijato SensarmaDespite the horrible thrashing in the semi-final, we performed above expectations. Six months ago I didn’t think we’d make it to the last four in some respects we got through because other sides failed to deliver.Mitchell Starc was our best performer. It was a shame he went AWOL in the last two matches. Alex Carey looked a class above most in his ball-striking and attitude. He was a real find. To play a great knock after being cleaned up by Jofra Archer really showed he has what it takes. The performances of Glenn Maxwell and Marcus Stoinis were really disappointing. The one innings where Maxwell looked really like to kick into gear was the one where Usman Khawaja ran him out horribly.The semi-final revealed all our weaknesses at once, which was a shame. Unfortunately our domestic one-day competition is now contained in a short period at the start of our season. It’s not enough for players to improve their skills in this format on the biggest international stage. Scott MeehanPakistan did well. Our performance would be viewed much more positively had we reached the semi-finals, but that’s how fine the margins are. The game against West Indies was very costly and some fans think the Sri Lanka washout was a missed opportunity. Although we have no one to blame but ourselves for not reaching the last four.After beating both the finalists in the group stage, it’s a shame we weren’t consistent enough elsewhere. We have a few special players coming through and they will surely help. Although fielding remains a problem. Awais AhmedWe were hot favourites to finish in the bottom two, yet finished sixth and may have qualified for the semis had we won our two washed-out matches. We have a bright talent in Avishka Fernando. In fact, we could have a fearsome batting unit in 2023. The bowling will be the real concern. We have to search hard for the next Malingas and Muralis. Malinga still has a role to play in four years’ time. We need his personality and experience in the team. And our former cricketers need to take part in building cricket from scratch. The current administration is useless. Akesh SamudithaIt took us four games to get a point on the board and we had to thank the English summer weather for that. South Africa paid the price for a terribly slow start, and highlights were few and far between. The AB De Villiers debate before the tournament obviously didn’t help.I’m hugely disappointed that we were so poor early on. The late wins against Sri Lanka and and Australia, were spoiled by the fact that there was so very little to play for. Wasting a successful 300+ run chase against Australia in a dead rubber hurts. Nils LouwAfter a great start to the tournament – beating South Africa and almost forcing a win against the Kiwis – the Tigers threatened to be the story of the World Cup, but it never quite happened. Instead the campaign ended in a whimper with damaging losses against both south Asian neighbours. The defeat to Pakistan was particularly disappointing given the historical context and the fact they were playing in front of a packed house at Lord’s. It was easily their worst performance of the tournament.In contrast, the stunning run chase against the Windies on the postage stamp-sized Taunton ground was the tournament highlight, reaching the target of 322 with such ease and with so many overs to spare. It gave fans genuine hope for a top-four finish. Had fine margins gone their way, a semi-final place would have been a reality.The team didn’t quite live up to its billing for the emotional Tiger fans. A feeling of the wheels coming off was compounded by the swift dismissal of coach Steve Rhodes long before England lifted the trophy.Giving player of the tournament to Kane Williamson was obviously a sympathy vote. Shakib Al Hasan was the true star of the World Cup. After spending a decade being the most underrated international cricketer in the most underrated international team, Shakib finally became a household name – for those households with Sky TV anyway. His consistency batting at No 3, often arriving at the crease early in the innings, and scoring at nearly a run a ball was staggering. Add to that tidy reliable off-spin and you have the complete package. Tawhid QureshiWe were terrible for most of it. Bowling Pakistan out for 105 in the first game got our hopes up, but there wasn’t enough thought into anything after that and we played out the tournament as a Chris Gayle testimonial tour. At least we beat a plucky Afghanistan side.The authorities must begin planning for the next World Cup immediately by investing in players who will be available solely for the longer version of the game. We have become champions of the T20 game, but the same players struggle in longer formats. T20 is hurting the quality of players in the longer versions. The problem remains that we have a very small pool of players. Glen DucreayIt was always going to be tough. Always. I’m disappointed we didn’t take any points but there were some competitive performances. Falling 11 runs short of beating India, and two balls from shocking Pakistan, were the best memories.Captain Mohammad Nabi had plenty to say before the tournament, but his inexperience showed in the field. I’ll be happy if we can progress tactically and learn from the experience of playing against the very best.

The second day of next month’s second Ashes Test at Lord’s will be turned red in Ruth’s memory and to raise funds for the foundation set up in her name. Strauss, a former Middlesex opener, was back at his old ground on Tuesday to drum up support for that day as well as offer his thoughts on the legacy the World Cup can offer English cricket.As a member of England’s fabled 2005 Ashes-winning side and the captain who led the Test team to No 1 in the world in 2011, Strauss knows how the highest of highs can be followed by a dramatic crash.“We have made mistakes in the past,” he said. “We’ve won Ashes series and got to No 1 in the world and thought that was the end in itself. We have to find a way of making this a launchpad for something bigger and better and that is a huge challenge.Sunday’s dramatic World Cup final win against New Zealand was the first cricket to be shown live on free-to-air TV since the 2005 Ashes. Strauss, unsurprisingly given his ECB links, is backing the new 100-ball competition that starts next year, part of which will also be free to air on the BBC, as the vehicle for capitalising on the World Cup euphoria. “What you don’t want is for this to be a high-water mark and everything drifts back again,” he said. “The Hundred is the best opportunity the game has to really engage the people that tuned in for the first time for that Lord’s final and make them more than just casual fans.”Ben Stokes was England’s hero at Lord’s, completing his redemption story from the Bristol brawl that led to him missing the 2017-18 Ashes series in Australia – and have to clear himself of a charge of affray in court last summer – to a World Cup winner. Strauss, the man at the helm when the ECB decided to make Stokes unavailable for selection for six months following Bristol, has not been surprised by the all-rounder’s response since.“I think what we’ve seen is some of those rough edges just smoothed a little bit over the last 12 or 18 months without him losing that incredible desire and competitive streak. It’s an easy story to say what happened in the World Cup final is redemption for him. I just think it was one of English cricket’s talents showing what he can do on the greatest stage.”Strauss has warned Stokes that coping with the level of fame he will now encounter will be his biggest challenge – just as it was for Andrew Flintoff after the 2005 Ashes. “What is going to be hard for Ben going forward is the levels of adulation he’ll receive,” Strauss said. “I think that was a burden for Freddie – he often lived up to it and that was great but increasingly you are under more and more pressure to be the man every time you play and that is a big burden.”Stokes was not even picked for the last World Cup and Strauss admits his anger at England’s performances during that tournament sparked the white-ball revolution that reached its high point last weekend. “I was genuinely angry by what I’d seen,” he said. “The same mistakes made in the two previous World Cups that I’d been involved in, and prior to my time as well, were being made again.“Picking Test players. Playing a conservative brand of cricket and trying to justify the unjustifiable. I still remember my quotes from the 2007 World Cup that two threes are as good as a six. That was trying to justify what you just couldn’t justify. To me, and this was before I was appointed director of cricket, we just could not do this again.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a1731d329c40fc90e5896f737ecc2bf9bfaea5a7/11_276_5017_3012/master/5017.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5f67320bc40bb0831d0694c32375b964","title":"tiger woods confident art of playing opens","story":"Woods is short of tournament practice but, with three Open wins, he knows he can work his way around Royal PortrushAccording to the nice lady at the tourist office, 200,000 people will swarm into Portrush for the Open Championship this week. Early on Tuesday great swathes of them were already tracking Tiger Woods as he scuffed around, hoping to find his groove and his game. Eight holes later he was still looking.“It’s not quite as sharp as I’d like to have it right now,” the winner of 15 majors admitted. “I still need to shape the golf ball a little bit better, especially with the weather coming in and the winds are going to be changing.“I’m going to have to be able to cut the ball, draw the ball, hit at different heights and move it all around. Today it was a good range session. I need another one tomorrow. And hopefully that will be enough to be ready.”That assessment, while modest, represents progress. On Monday Woods was so out of sorts, one spectator promised to immediately stick £1,000 on him missing the cut. Another, the owner of the local surf shop, said that one rattling putt on the 18th aside, he missed everything.Yet the 43-year-old winner of three Opens remains optimistic, despite having played only 10 competitive rounds since winning the Masters in April, because he believes his brain can interpret the wiles and winds of links golf quicker than anyone else.“There is an art to playing links golf,” he said. “It’s not: ‘OK, I have 152 yards, bring out the automatic nine-iron and hit it 152.’ Here, 152 could be a little bump-and-run pitching wedge. It could be a chip six-iron. It could be a lot of different things.”Another factor in his favour is that he likes the course. Woods had never played Portrush before this week, although in the first flushes of his career he would often come to Ireland with Payne Stewart and Mark O’Meara to golf and fish, but he has immediately liked what he has seen.“It’s such a great venue,” he said. “Everyone who’s played it has always enjoyed it. I can understand why. You’re going to have a lot of either bump-and-run chips, chips, or quite a bit of slow putts coming up the hills. It’s an unbelievable golf course.”That doesn’t mean Woods is averse to getting some extra help. During a press conference he was asked whether he had been given any local knowledge by Darren Clarke, Graeme McDowell or Brooks Koepka’s caddie Ricky Elliott, who hails from Portrush, Woods chuckled. “No, I have not,” he said, before a smile came across his face.“Tell you a funny story. I texted Brooksy: ‘Congratulations on another great finish.’ What he’s done in the last four major championships has been just unbelievable. To be so consistent, so solid. He’s been in contention to win each and every major championship. And I said: ‘Hey, dude, do you mind if I tag along and play a practice round?’”He and Koepka are good friends and the clear implication was that Woods wanted to be able to enjoy his Ryder Cup teammate’s company and assimilate his caddie’s local knowledge.But it turned out that he was out of luck. “I’ve heard nothing,” said Woods, laughing, although there may be an innocent explanation given that Koepka admitted before the US Open that he recently changed his mobile number.Woods also shrugged off concerns about his lack of match practice or the effect the forecast cooler weather may have on a body that has required multiple surgeries to fuse his back.“I learned last year I played a little bit too much, the body was pretty beat up. Unfortunately, dealing with the procedures I’ve had, and being a little bit older, it just doesn’t move quite as fast when it’s a little bit cooler.”Yet Woods is not overly downbeat, pointing out that Tom Watson and Greg Norman have challenged at the Open even during the flickering embers of their careers. “The great thing is playing in an Open Championship, you can do it,” he added. “Look what Tom did at Turnberry, what Greg did at Birkdale. Even if you don’t have the speed to carry the ball 20 yards any more, you can still run the ball quite a bit out there. You just have to navigate the bunkers and navigate around the golf course.”And that, Woods believes, makes this the most open of Opens. “You don’t have to hit the ball very far. You can actually hear it land and still roll it out there far enough. You make a few changes here and there on equipment but it opens up for anyone to win this championship because it’s not overly long.”And while his game does not appear quite ready to scale another peak, Woods’s upbeat mood suggests that after making it back from injury to win in Augusta any success here will be an unexpected bonus.“It’s exciting to be able to come back and play championship golf again,” he said. “I didn’t think I could. And to be able to do it again in major championships makes it that much more special.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/995b9d9f1a2c043669ba48df44ff1384ceb42484/0_11_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=28540af0eaa2f1f23f8681a8cf7b5f6f","title":"australia pass malawi test with flying colours at netball world cup","story":"Ahead of a potentially tournament-defining clash with New Zealand later this week, the undefeated Australian Diamonds needed an acid test against Malawi at the Netball World Cup in Liverpool. What they got was a pop quiz: and an easy one at that.Despite slow patches in the second half, the reigning champions passed with flying colours, winning 74-25 in a lopsided contest. But they have an exam to sit on Thursday and coach Lisa Alexander would have undoubtedly preferred a sterner test from the world No 6.Earlier, Noeline Taurua’s Silver Ferns crushed Northern Ireland 77-28, leaving the Kiwis, like the Australians, unbeaten in five matches in as many days. Neither side has a true measure of where they’re at though, having recorded double-digit margins every game.The arch rivals – who have won or placed second at 11 of the 14 World Cups – now face-off in a mouth-watering battle on Thursday.While the trans-Tasman rivals are both likely to advance to the semis regardless of the result, it’s a match fans have been waiting for since the Ferns’ spectacular fall from grace at last year’s Commonwealth Games, where they didn’t medal for the first time.Winning may set up a run for the title or a loss could galvanise a team, as happened at the 2015 Cup in Sydney. Then, the Kiwis beat Australia early in the tournament in what has gone down as the “poking the bear” match. That loss spurred the Diamonds all the way to the trophy.In Liverpool, the Malawi Queens were outrun and outclassed by a Diamonds outfit which had to generate its own momentum after quarter-time, when the game was all-but won with the scoreboard at 21-2.With April Brandley missing after injuring her ear during the Barbados match, Jo Weston started at goal defence, with Courtney Bruce at keeper and Jamie-Lee Price at wing defence.Keeping Malawi to a tournament-equal low of just two goals, Australia made a sharp start in the first, with Bassett scoring 1414 and Tippett 77. Hadley looked keen to impress and had eight feeds.Under suffocating defensive pressure, the Queens managed just three in the second, while the Australian shooters and a rampaging Watson continued to dominate. The quarter ended 41-5, with the Diamonds having caused 24 turnovers.Alexander made a raft of changes at half-time, leaving just Bruce, Watson and Price from the starting seven and it took a while to settle. Meanwhile, Malawi put on nine goals, most care of new shooter Sindi Simtowe.After a slow start, Caitlin Thwaites and Steph Wood picked up where Bassett and Tippett left off, scoring 1414 and 66 respectively, with good service from Kelsey Browne. It was 61-14 at the last break. In the last, the Diamonds scored just 13 as the Queens managed 11 something to work on.After the New Zealand game, Australia will face England or South Africa in a semi-final later in the week. It’s game on."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7d07d70360f54e64a7981510c114b3b5e4aaaa21/128_46_1123_674/master/1123.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f0bdd326349ad68534c4217eaa6c64eb","title":"tears of joy as south koreas water polo team score but concede 94","story":"South Korea’s women’s water polo team lost their first two games at the world championships by an eye-watering aggregate score of 94-1 – but they celebrated their solitary goal as if they had won gold.After suffering a record 64-0 defeat by Hungary in their Group B opener at the weekend, the plucky hosts were battered 30-1 by the 2017 bronze medallists Russia on Tuesday.But despite another lopsided result, goalscorer Kyung Da-seul was the toast of Gwangju after finding the net in the final quarter to trigger tearful scenes. The 18-year-old said she would cherish the memory but was sad not to keep the ball as a memento.“I’d love to have the ball but I have no idea where it’s gone,” Kyung said. “I’d be grateful if someone found it for me.”Footballers get to keep the match ball when they score a hat-trick and baseball players often keep the ball they hit for their first career run or homer – if they can trade a signed bat or other memorabilia to get it back.Kyung went home without her ball but was nevertheless feted after her goal provided a little respite with the Koreans losing 27-0. “When I took the shot I didn’t think it was going to go in,” said Kyung. “But I gave it everything I had. I couldn’t have done it without my teammates.”South Korea only managed to rustle up a team a month before the start of the competition, calling on former swimmers, with all but captain Oh Hee-ji still in their teens.Their dogged determination evoked memories of Equatorial Guinean swimmer Eric “The Eel” Moussambani, who clung to the lane rope at the 2000 Sydney Olympics in his first dip in a 50-metre pool before making it to the wall as the crowd erupted.“Our coaches told us that we’re here to show people that we’re ready to battle hard,” Kyung said. “They also said we grew so much after the first game – we shed many tears of joy.”The local crowd got into the spirit as fans danced along to Korean pop classic Gangnam Style blaring from the venue’s loudspeakers, including a group of elderly women, who brought the house down by copying musician Psy’s raunchy moves.Back on the pool deck, Korean-American Ryan Hanna Yoon promised there was more to come from the hosts.“It was really emotional because we’ve been going through a lot,” she said. “The goal means everything for us. We’re just beginners in water polo.”Asked about her hopes for their next game against Canada on Thursday, Yoon smiled: “Scoring more and having them score less.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f5e122864e954b50986b61367e75eb6073a32290/233_0_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=515e524343e528bfe8c437ee66e3b37b","title":"emmys 2019 nominations game of thrones leads race","story":"The final season of the fantasy drama leads the pack while The Marvelous Mrs Maisel, Fleabag, Chernobyl and When They See Us follow behindGame of Thrones leads this year’s Emmy nominations with a record 32 nods, with The Marvelous Mrs Maisel and Chernobyl close behind.The final season of HBO’s fantasy hit received mixed reviews from critics but America’s television academy placed it at the top of this year’s long list of shows, with recognition for actors Kit Harington and Emilia Clarke in the categories of lead actor and actress in a drama series as well as seven further actors in the two support categories. Last year the show reigned supreme with seven awards, including for best drama.The previous record for most nominations in a single year was held by NYPD Blue. HBO has also scored another record this year with 137 nominations, beating Netflix who scored 117 across the board.Game of Thrones will be battling it out to be named best drama alongside Better Call Saul, Bodyguard, Ozark, Pose, Succession, This is Us and Killing Eve. The acclaimed BBC drama about an assassin and the agent tracking her down also received nominations for its two stars, recent Bafta winner Jodie Comer and Sandra Oh, as lead actress in a drama series. As well as the aforementioned Clarke, the two will face off against Viola Davis, Laura Linney, Mandy Moore and Robin Wright, nominated for her role in the final season of House of Cards.Last year’s big winner The Marvelous Mrs Maisel is the year’s second-most-nominated show with 20 nods, including for outstanding comedy series and lead actress in a comedy series. Rachel Brosnahan will compete against Veep’s Julia Louis-Dreyfus, who has won six times before for her role in HBO’s political comedy. The category also found room to recognise talent in new shows, including Dead to Me’s Christina Applegate and Russian Doll’s Natasha Lyonne.Phoebe Waller-Bridge also received a nod for lead actress in a comedy for the second season of Fleabag, as well as a nod in the category of outstanding writing in a comedy series. The show, which received 11 nominations in total, will also compete for the title of the year’s best comedy. The first season failed to receive a single mention.The fact-based drama Chernobyl also received 19 nominations, including recognition for actors Jared Harris and Emily Watson. Ava DuVernay’s When They See Us, based on the story of the Central Park Five, was Netflix’s most-nominated show with 16 across the board. The two shows will compete in the category of outstanding limited series alongside Sharp Objects, FosseVerdon and Escape at Dannemora.This year has seen a strong showing for British talent with both Hugh Grant and Ben Whishaw nominated for their roles in BBC’s drama A Very English Scandal as well as nods for Fiona Shaw and Kristin Scott Thomas for their guest spots in Fleabag.Sacha Baron Cohen’s latest comedy series, Who is America?, also received three nominations and in a series of tweets the star has thanked Sarah Palin, Dick Cheney and Donald Trump. “I want to thank my crack team of researchers told to uncover bigotry, racism and hate in the US,” he wrote. “That took them about 30 seconds … they just started following the President.”Australian comedian Hannah Gadsby received two nominations for her Netflix stand-up special Nanette, which is competing with Beyonce’s Homecoming, James Corden’s Carpool Karaoke and Wanda Sykes’ Not Normal in both categories.There were, however, a number of notable snubs with the heavily predicted Julia Roberts failing to receive a nomination for her role in the Hitchcockian thriller series Homecoming, her first small-screen performance to date. The Amazon show was only recognised for its cinematography and in total, the company flagged way behind rival Netflix with just 47 nods overall.Emma Stone and Jonah Hill were also left off the list for the Netflix drama Maniac and while Bodyguard was picked for best drama series, its Golden Globe-winning star Richard Madden didn’t make the cut.The ceremony is yet to have a host attached, with reports suggesting it might follow in the footsteps of this year’s host-less Oscars.

After Yosemite awarded a contract to Aramark, the park service learned that Delaware North had applied for trademarks for the names when it prepared to open bids.In 2016, to avoid disruptions to visitors during the concessionaire changeover, the park pre-emptively changed the names of the Ahwahnee and Wawona hotels. For more than three years, the Ahwahnee was the Majestic Yosemite Hotel. Curry Village was Half Dome Village. The Wawona Hotel was Big Trees Lodge and Badger Pass was Yosemite Ski and Snowboard Area.The name change did not sit well with visitors who had frequented the breathtaking landscapes in the park for generations, and the park service vowed to keep fighting for the original names.The National Park Service announced on Monday that it had reached a settlement with Delaware North that “involves the transfer of trademarks and service marks at issue in the lawsuit from Delaware North to Aramark”. Under the park’s contract with Aramark, those trademarks and service marks will transfer back at no cost to the National Park Service at the end of Aramark’s contract.As part of the settlement, Aramark will pay $8.16m and the US government will pay $3.84m to Delaware North for the names, logos and branded content, a Yosemite National Park spokesman, Scott Gediman, told the Los Angeles Times.“I’ve said from literally Day One that these names belong with these places, and ultimately belong to the American people,” Gediman told the Times. “So to have this dispute resolved is huge.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/65ab75af1cc5c0972c9b669add4e4a44cdfdacf6/0_59_3500_2099/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1f1b3e5ce01d27243bb2c149ad571690","title":"who is ursula von der leyen the new eu commission president","story":"From ‘closet feminist’ to bossy career woman, detractors paint conflicting pictures of German politicianThe nicknames Ursula von der Leyen has acquired over the course of her 29-year career in German politics tell their own story about the new president of the European commission.During her time in charge of the family ministry, she was first called Krippen-Ursel (“crèche Ursel”), a conservative closet feminist set on expanding nursery places, and then Zensursula, a control freak who wanted to shield German youth from the dark sides of the internet.When she became Germany’s first female defence minister in 2013, her (mostly male) detractors referred to her as Flinten-Uschi (“shotgun Uschi”), a caricature of the bossy career woman.A liberal in conservative clothing or a pious authoritarian matriarch? If there is one quality the European commission’s first female president shares with her mentor Angela Merkel, it is that her political persuasions can be difficult to classify. Unlike Germany’s consensus-seeking chancellor, however, she is not afraid to raise heckles and ide opinion to drive through the policies she believes are right.Born in October 1958, Ursula Gertrud von der Leyen spent her first 13 years in Brussels, where her father was one of the first pan-European civil servants. She attended the European School in Uccle, graduating two years before a certain Alexander Boris de Pfeffel Johnson joined the same establishment.One of seven children, she was raised in a Christian household that adhered to the traditional model of the West German nuclear family. As state premier of Lower Saxony, her father, Ernst Albrecht, became a leading figure of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) and a bete noire for the burgeoning Green movement, with whom he clashed over the opening of a nuclear waste depository.Her mother, Heidi, took a supporting role, at times leading a family choir that serenaded its patriarch on German TV shows, and stating: “The best way for me to gain the respect of the public is through the role of motherliness.”But if her father’s career enabled her international upbringing, it also allowed Von der Leyen to step out from his shadow.When she was studying economics at the University of Göttingen in the late 1970s, her father was informed that his family could be a potential target for the Red Army Faction, a terrorist group also known as the Baader-Meinhof gang, and that his daughter should consider moving to another university.Von der Leyen adopted the pseudonym Rose Ladson – a combination of her family nickname and the surname of her American great-grandmother – and enrolled at the London School of Economics.“I lived much more than I studied,” she told the weekly Zeit. “No details, please. Only this: in 1978 I immersed myself for one year in this seething, international, colourful city. For me, coming from the rather monotonous, white Germany, that was fascinating.“For me, London was the epitome of modernity: freedom, the joy of life, trying everything. This gave me an inner freedom that I have kept until today. And another thing I have kept: the realisation that different cultures can get on together very well.”Switching to study medicine, she later worked as an assistant physician at a women’s clinic in Hanover and graduated as a doctor of medicine in 1991.After she joined the CDU in 1990, on the same day her father stepped down from his job as state premier, her inner freedom made its mark on the posts she held, first as a regional and national delegate and then at the family, work and defence ministries.“She has an incredible amount of energy”, said Daniel Goffart, a political correspondent for the news magazine Focus who co-wrote her biography in 2015. “You especially saw that in her bitter and protracted battle to modernise her party’s view on the role of the family.”Under her watch, Germany introduced a law guaranteeing every child over 12 months of age a place at a daycare facility, and a paid parental leave scheme that includes at least two months of paid leave for fathers. She forced Merkel to drop her opposition to boardroom quotas for women, even though the policy was later defeated in the Bundestag.Married since 1986 to a physician, Heiko, and mother to seven children, Von der Leyen has juggled a prolific career with family life – at the cost of popularity within her own party, some say. Instead of attending CDU summer fetes in rural Lower Saxony, said her biographer Goffart, she preferred to spend weekends at the family home in Beinhorn near Hanover when her children were still young.Among her critics, the 60-year-old Von der Leyen has a reputation as an Einzelgängerin, a lone wolf with an instinct for front page-grabbing interviews and photo ops, but lacking the gift to pass the inner freedom driving her career down to the teams she works with.If Von der Leyen’s approval ratings have recently plummeted, making her the least popular minister in Merkel’s cabinet, it is because her handling of Germany’s notoriously under-funded military at times displayed those same deficiencies.When she diagnosed the troops with an “attitude problem” after the emergence of stories about rightwing extremist activities and hazing of new recruits, she was accused – and not only by members of the Bundeswehr – of choosing a good write-up over loyalty to her staff. “If she has a weakness, it is her tendency to excessive stage management,” said Goffart.More recently, Von der Leyen grabbed negative headlines over the accusation that her defence ministry had allocated over-inflated contracts worth hundreds of millions of euros to external consultants. A parliamentary committee is investigating the ministry for accusations of nepotism, and Von der Leyen is expected to be invited as a witness in December. In Brussels and Berlin, she will have two stages to manage."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3bb2137eb3032aeab4ca85d1c217bb7f3f4987cd/0_291_4368_2621/master/4368.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e1e0ee148a73c4f2a37b21c7a5127657","title":"dunedin rolls with it after new zealand city loses worlds steepest street title","story":"Mayor of New Zealand city says a tweak to signage might be all that’s needed, while some living on Baldwin Street are relieved The New Zealand city of Dunedin has sought to look on the bright side after losing its claim to have the world’s steepest street to a town in Wales, with its mayor saying: “The street certainly hasn’t got any less steep as a result of the decision.”Mayor Dave Cull took the blow on the chin, saying “Dunedin has a wonderful range of visitor attractions and we think plenty of people will still visit Baldwin Street as part of their Dunedin experience.”He suggested changing the street’s signage from “world’s steepest street” to “southern hemisphere’s steepest street”, something the council is taking advice on.Baldwin Street has long been a drawcard for tourists and daredevils alike. It has played host to brave drift triking, pogoers, electric scooter riders and rubbish bin rollers.Residents of the street do not seem to be fazed about their loss of status, and some have even welcomed the decision.The street’s title was initially flagged in 1985 when a Dunedin journalist asked the council what the city’s steepest street was.

From late spring through to autumn, the high season for mycophiles, Russians fan out into the forests in search of fresh air, solitude and fungi to fill their wicker baskets. Should you see Ladas and Range Rovers abandoned roadside after a downpour, do not be alarmed: it is just mushroom season, not the zombie apocalypse.The prey depends on the season: morels in spring, then pine boletes, broad milkcaps, orange chanterelles and the prized boroviki, the porcinis or penny buns that crown the season before the first snowfalls.Yes, Pushkin and Leo Tolstoy wrote about mushroom hunts. But for a more hallucinogenic offering, turn to the Bolshevik functionary Alexander Tolstoy, who wrote a fairytale about talking mushrooms complaining how painful it is to be eaten, trampling a poisonous mukhomor and then shoving their way into the mouths of two children with the cry “All right, kids, open up!”Soviet labour unions sometimes rented out buses to send factory workers off for a day of mushroom picking as a kind of teambuilding exercise. But the quiet hunt is really about leaving everything behind – our troubles, our devices, and often our loved ones – and communing with forests of birch and pine until we emerge again, our burden a little lighter.Well, most of us emerge. Each year, dozens of Russians go missing and only stumble out weeks later in a kind of trance state. Others become so hopelessly lost that they are never found at all.• Andrew Roth in MoscowIndians are born negotiators, and everything in Delhi has a price. But twice a day, tens of thousands of people file into the city’s largest Sikh temple, take their place on their floor and eat a simple meal of vegetables, daal and roti – without paying anything.The langar, or communal kitchen, is a pillar of the Sikh religion. At the Bangla Sahib gurudwara in Delhi, an estimated 35,000 people are fed each day in a ritual symbolising the faith’s commitment to equality and eradicating hunger.“For everyone who comes it is free of cost,” says Harbhej Singh, who runs the langar. “It doesn’t ide anyone by caste, creed or culture. It’s for everyone.”In a culture that has traditionally been riven by the caste system, an intricate south Asian social hierarchy whose rules include who can and cannot prepare food or eat together, the 500-year-old langar tradition is still a radical statement.“The main motive is to remove these class differences,” Singh says. “Whether it’s a foreigner, a minister, or anyone, they all sit together. A beggar might be sitting next to you, but you both eat.”Preparing the meal involves thousands of volunteers as well as staggering quantities of food. On an average day, the kitchens prepare 450kg of lentils, 1,800kg of flour, 300kg or rice and 900kg of vegetables, most of it garnered through donations.And will the temple ever start charging? Singh is emphatic. “It will never happen.”• Michael Safi in DelhiWhen the initiative to make public transport free for residents in Estonia’s capital Tallinn was introduced six years ago, it was seen as something of a throwback to the communist era.No matter. It’s predictably popular. Across ages, genders, mother tongues and ideologies, free public transport has become something that residents expect and value. The scheme has encouraged people to sign on as residents of Tallinn with the city’s population registry. This has increased the tax base and improved revenues. Proponents of free public transportation in Tallinn have pointed to gains in the city’s income that far outweigh the loss of fares.“I couldn’t do without it,” says Mari-Liis Kade, 20, a barista at the coffee chain Reval Café in Tallinn’s old town who commutes in from a suburb 10km away.“Young people generally don’t earn much in Estonia by EU standards,” she adds. “If you take home €300-€400 a month, which is common in the service industry, you can see why a free mode of transport is a great benefit.” A ride on the bus or tram in Tallinn is €2 for non-residents.“But it’s not just the money,” she continues. “It’s as much about convenience. It’s great to just jump on the 1A bus, ping my (Tallinn Transport) card and not have to worry about the fare. I definitely use the bus more because it is convenient in my community but also for getting to other places. Tourists think of Tallinn as just the Old Town and centre but it’s actually quite a spread-out city.”And is free public transport alleviating traffic snarls? “Well, the people of Tallinn are addicted to driving. I don’t know how much it has helped with that. But for those of us without cars, free public transportation is a godsend. It definitely encourages my friends and I to go into the city more often.”• Michael Amundsen in TallinnEver wondered why you feel so gloomy about the world - even at a time when humanity has never been this healthy and prosperous?

Surely there are not enough fitness freaks to necessitate even a quarter of the pull-up bars, pec decks and leg-swinging contraptions that interrupt the view?But by evening, they are full. Dakarois take fitness seriously. Packs of men jog up and down the city’s chinks of beach, turning shoal-like every 50 metres to cover the same ground hundreds of times. Other groups do aerobics, play football or wrestle as the traffic splutters past. The most creativity is brought to bear on elaborate synchronised press-up routines: with legs crossed one way then the other, elbows in then splayed out, then holding each other’s legs aloft.On a recent weekday evening on Yoff beach, a group did frog jumps en masse, first forwards, then back. Wrestling is equally popular, and you will often find a ring of spectators egging on two skimpily-dressed but deadly serious men circling each other before launching themselves at each other’s waists.At Dakar’s biggest and most prestigious gym, the Olympique Club, staff confide that some of the country’s most famous wrestlers often come to work out – but add that they preen a little more than they train. Senegalese boys are as likely to tell you that they want to be wrestlers as footballers, which goes some way to explain the citywide pursuit of “musculation”.Often sensible of gifts that are likely to be popular, China has cottoned onto that too – their donation of a large wrestling arena was inaugurated in Dakar last summer.• Ruth Maclean in DakarAmber fishing is a popular pastime for visitors to the Baltic Sea coast. I’ve been doing it in the islands off northern Germany with my children ever since they were babies.

Take a scoop net – known as a kescher – to drag over the sea bed, and if you’re really serious, a pair of waders, or waterproofs that reach as far as your oxters and enable you to walk through the breakers, and possibly even a rope fastened to the shore to stop you being swept out to sea. Still keen?The idea is that a storm loosens the amber nuggets – believed to be around 44m years old – from the sea bed, and once it’s relatively calm again, the “golden tears of the Baltic”, as they are typically referred to, are either to be found floating among the concentration of disturbed shells, seaweed and driftwood or, if you’re lucky, washed up on the beach.The most likely time of the year is between November and March, when storms are most common. The sea must be cold.Patience and luck is required to find the best gems, and the most magical finds include pieces with insects encased in them, or the rarer green moss amber, and sometimes even blue chunks. But we have always been thrilled by the tiniest find – some little bigger than a pinhead. Other orangey-coloured stones on the beach can easily be mistaken for amber. But its lightness, hollowness and softness (tapping them against your teeth and biting into them helps to identify the real stuff) helps distinguish them from stones and pebbles. Polished them up is as easy as using a duster dipped in dry washing powder, and rubbing it over the nugget.Make a hole in it (local amber shops are usually happy to do this for a small fee), insert a thread, and you have the perfect unique holiday souvenir.• Kate Connolly in BerlinNow that the dawn tuna auctions at Tsukiji fish market have moved to more clinical surroundings, arguably the best possible early start to a day in Tokyo is a visit to a sumo stable. Several heya allow visitors to sit in on training sessions, although reservations are recommended to guarantee getting close enough to take in the slapping of sweaty flesh and the sweet scent of the wrestlers’ bintsuke hair oil. The Arashio stable has an English-language page on its website, but restricts visitors to watching the action through a window.Visitors arriving in Japan in the next few weeks will have to be incredibly unlucky not to catch a glimpse of the springtime sakura – or cherry blossoms – whose pale pink petals appear at different intervals the length of the archipelago. The blossoms’ ubiquity means you are never far from a park or riverbank to indulge in a spot of hanami flower viewing and ponder the ephemeral nature of life as the petals float to the ground, not to be seen for another year. A Japanese picnic and a plentiful supply of beer and sake are optional, but recommended.• Justin McCurry in TokyoThey move with a stealth and speed that belies their years, materialising suddenly at pedestrian crossings, on cafe terraces and in tube carriages. They carry sweets, gooey compliments and, above all, centuries of accumulated wisdom and opinion. They are the grandmothers of Spain, and they are not shy.Undoubtedly the most assiduous worshippers of children in a country where kids possess semi-ine status no matter how infernal their true natures, the abuelas are always keen to talk, ruffle hair and magic up tissues for snotty young noses.Their chief function, however, is the imparting of parenting advice – whether solicited or not. God help the mother or father who dares to venture out without wrapping their offspring in at least two more layers than is strictly necessary. Being a guiri (foreigner) will not serve as mitigation.There is something wonderful about these daily displays of affection and about the way old and young communicate in Spain. To be a child here is to be seen, to be heard and to be engaged with. And, obviously, to be fussed over relentlessly. I sometimes wonder whether the children and the grannies don’t share some secret signal long lost to the eyes and ears of the generation that sits between them.Perhaps it is something learned, forgotten and then rediscovered over the course of a life. Perhaps it’s just the smell of sweets.• Sam Jones in MadridShrines are scattered across Bangkok, dedicated to deities, gods, ghosts and spirits. In a city where the luxury mall is king, they serve as a spiritual counterbalance to the ever growing number of Louis Vuitton boutiques and on days when Bangkok feels overwhelmingly urban, I go and seek out some of the weirder and more wonderful ones. And the Chao Mae Tubtim shrine is certainly weird, and certainly wonderful.The modest shrine, tucked away in a park in the hectic centre of Bangkok, is dedicated to the Chinese fertility goddess Tubtim, and since 1920 has been where women hoping to conceive have come with a phallic offering – mostly in the form of a penis sculpture. It is a shrine dedicated to the power of the female and there is something both so endearing and so defiant about seeing the image of a goddess with hundreds of penises – big and small hot pink, red, black, brown and ornately decorated some piled up on a gold platter, laid out before her like a phallic congregation standing to attention.Another favourite is the shrine dedicated to Mae Nak, one of Thailand’s most famous ghosts. As the myth goes, she was so in love with her husband that when she died in childbirth she returned to the world and pretended to him she was still alive – until unfortunately he noticed she could walk through solid objects. Then there is Trimurti shrine, known as the lovers’ shrine and always strewn with red roses: a joy to encounter in the midst of a crowded, polluted Bangkok junction.In a city of chaos, the shrines offer a moment of stillness. And whether I’m sitting in the company of a lovesick ghost or in a sea of phalluses, they offer a window into the spiritual side of Thai society that can otherwise be easy to miss.• Hannah Ellis-Petersen in BangkokFrom summer outdoor cinema in deckchairs in northern Paris to December’s monumental, nocturnal light creations in central Lyon, France has a vast array of free festivals all year long. The Atlantide international book festival held in the western city of Nantes in early spring each year – and currently run by the acclaimed Congolese novelist Alain Mabanckou – is among the best literary festivals in Europe, attracting top writers. And it doesn’t cost a cent to attend.Local festivals such as the Fêtes d’Arvor in Vannes, southern Brittany, are about celebrating regional traditions and culture. Others such as the Techno Parade in Paris each September are more about hundreds of thousands of fans taking over the city centre in a giant, free street party.The Parc de la Villette in northern Paris stages a summer free open-air cinema where people can bring their own picnics and watch films from Yellow Submarine to La La Land. In October, Paris also stages its Nuit Blanche nocturnal art trail, where people roam the city into the early hours looking at art installations in buildings and courtyards that they might not otherwise have access to.Even France’s more than 16,000 public libraries – over four times the number of libraries in the UK – regularly stage their own free events, such as the Paris libraries which decamp to parks on certain days in summer.Many of the most popular festivals are in smaller locations, like Saint-Louis on the Swiss border, well known for its free summer open-air music festival, Conç-Air.Lyon’s December Festival of Lights – one of the region’s key tourism events – sees top artists create giant, cutting-edge light projections and installations in the city centre.

The planned legislation follows Minister of State Mary Mitchell O’Connor’s announcement last year of plans to reform higher-education governance.However, there is alarm within some universities which fear the move will undermine long-standing rules which protect the autonomy of the sector.There are also concerns among some senior academics that the move could result in more power being consolidated in the Department of Education.“At a time when less and less money is going into higher education, control of the sector is on the increase. It’s eroding our autonomy,” said one source.However, Government sources insist that the moves are simply an attempt to place many of the HEA’s existing functions on a statutory footing.“The legislation for the higher-education sector hasn’t kept pace with the developments in the sector.

Photograph: Irish WaterDublin’s water supply system has mains that are so ancient that not updating them is not an option, and yet the city is served by an abundance of high-quality water.Twice as much water is produced daily than is actually needed by consumers.On paper, water volumes should be more than enough to supply the future needs of a dynamic, growing city, but a combination of drought increasingly linked to climate disruption, rising demand and population growth will soon put supplies on a knife edge.The proposal to extract water from the Shannon and pipe it to Dublin to serve 40 per cent of the country’s population prompts conflicting reaction.Its proponents say it would provide a long-term solution to the eastern region’s current difficulties and emerging risk of disrupted supply. It opponents say it is unnecessary and will add to the vulnerabilities of the Shannon and Lough Derg, while not solving a leakage problem that is triple the average rate in western Europe.For dairy farmer Liam Minehan, whose farm is at Puckane, Co Tipperary, close to Lough Derg, “it’s all down to do you believe it’s necessary or not”.He says it is not necessary and is being favoured over other tangible solutions, which were brushed aside. And yet does not solve Dublin’s exceptional leakage problems, he argues. “A dismal pipe replacement rate of 0.3 per cent was achieved last year worse than promised.”He admits his opposition is primarily due to a pipeline that would quickly make his dairy business unviable, but he is also deeply worried about potential consequences for the Shannon. This prompted him to stand in the European Election in Ireland South.DroughtOn the worst day of the drought last year, Dubliners consumed 315 million litres of water while 300 million litres was lost due to leakages when the city was close to its limits in capacity to deliver.Mr Minehan cites the case of Temple Bar, where the city’s worst leaks are – in 80 per cent of pipes. There are 200-year-old pipes three metres under the ground, but Irish Water “are afraid to replace the pipes on the basis of disruption to businesses”.He contends a programme of replacing rather than fixing the pipes, which would be easily done by installing insulated pipes a metre under the surface. “It doesn’t make sense, spending €1.6 billion-plus on a pipeline, when businesses would have a reduced footfall of just a few weeks in getting the work done.”The events of last year’s prolonged drought should put paid to any notion of taking water from the Shannon on the basis of a dramatic reduction in river flows.Under legislation relating to the Ardnacrusha hydro-power plant, the ESB is required by law to ensure 10 cubic metres per second to flow down the natural channel of the river. During the drought it had to turn off the plant in an attempt to maintain flow on the river for several weeks, he claims. “My understanding is that did not reach the required flow.”With such droughts, “you will soon be able to walk across the Shannon in your shoes,” Mr Minehan predicts. This has to be factored in given the scale of extraction envisaged. There is a move to extract 1.5 cubic metres per second from Lough Ree to serve Athlone and Mullingar, while the pipeline to Dublin will extract at four cubic metres per second.His family has farmed for four generations, yet its dairy business could be wiped out overnight as the pipeline would cut through its fragmented holding, making milking a large herd close to impossible.His frustration is such that once planning permission is submitted, opposition will be scaled up through the courts in Ireland and Europe.The Old River Shannon Trust, which monitors the river, posted on its Facebook page at the height of the 2018 drought that the Shannon at Curraghour Falls in Limerick city had been reduced to a relative trickle, “due to the extreme drought and that there had has been no hydroelectric generation at Ardnacrusha power station in two weeks as the water has run out”.“If the Dublin pipeline was already built flows would be circa 40 per cent less than this – and the river would be at a real risk of drying up. Just 11 cubic metres of water per second is currently being released from Lough Derg – yet Irish Water are planning to take 4 cubic metres per second,” it said.“This is not a sustainable proposal when droughts like this current one are factored in. Once the scheme is in place, the abstraction will be all year round 247, no matter what climate change brings.”LeakageProfessor of economics at DCU Edgar Morgenroth says increasing supply when there is a big leakage problem is not an efficient way to use a scarce resource, and underlines the importance of the Shannon in a different context.“The original analysis was done pre-Irish Water days, so that might explain why the wider resources were not considered but now with Irish Water in existence there is scope to link up different networks and exploit excess capacity elsewhere.”Sinn Féin TD Eoin Ó Broin, a member of the Oireachtas Committee on Housing, Planning and Local Government, believes Dublin urgently needs a new water source.Going to the Shannon makes an awful lot of sense and can be justified environmentally and ecologically, but with a 40 per cent leakage in the capital it fails to address another acute problem, so under current circumstances “40 per cent of what you bring from the Shannon will be lost”.“Irish Water have yet to satisfactorily explain why it’s not accelerating its leakage programme, given what’s being achieved elsewhere, notably in London,” Mr Ó Broin says.“I have yet to be convinced on the Shannon project. This is, firstly, because of the level of leakage in Dublin. I don’t understand why there is not an increased allocation to address this.”He would like to see evidence on whether aquifers in the wider Dublin region are in a position to supply some of Dublin’s needs. The city has had an ongoing problem for 20 years that has to be faced up to, while extraction legislation needs to be published as a matter of urgency. “We need to know how much is being extracted by big business and farmers.”He also has concerns about the cost of the project. At in excess of €1.3 billion, it was considered the largest infrastructural project ever undertaken by the State, until what has emerged on the national children’s hospital (NCH).Added to that, he has concerns about the way the utility is constituted, in that it is “not subject to sufficient democratic accountability and scrutiny”. On that basis he favours bringing the utility back into State ownership.Irish Water should be made a standalone non-commercial semi-State company, which would allow the Minister for Housing and the Oireachtas oversight, “to allow us ensure what’s happening with the NCH does not happen with this project”. In that respect, the committee would play a critical role.Chartered hydrologist Shane Bennet of SM Bennet \u0026amp Co in Rosmeen, Co Meath, is not in favour of the pipeline though he remains open to the possibility of being convinced. As an engineer familiar with major construction projects – and the menace of burst pipes in Dublin – he sees the need to carefully evaluate the project at this point, “when you look at how the children’s hospital project has ended up”.DiversificationLondon has reduced its leakage to less than 20 per cent, along with ersifying its water sources: some comes from surface water, some from groundwater and some from desalination of water taken from the Thames estuary.While Dublin does not have shortages at most times of the year, during summer and drought periods it can quickly become an issue, he warns.He believes the operation and maintenance of the pipeline would be costly when surface water storage and groundwater sources are an option, the latter especially providing a considerably degree of protection.There is a vulnerability at the height of summer, as past incidents with the Poulaphouca water supply and in the lower Boyne have shown, while “world events” such as volcanic activity can pose a separate threat due to reliance on surface water.Mr Bennet believes the Shannon is vulnerable, even to an isolated incident such as a pig slurry tank bursting its banks or simply the spreading of slurry too close to the water’s edge. Lough Derg has had a eutrophication problem in recent years, with excessive run-off of nutrients into the water causing a dense plant life growth.Groundwater plus desalination adds up to much more modest cost, and that needs to be thoroughly explored because, as it stands, the project is “a bit of a white elephant with huge maintenance costs”, Mr Bennet says.On dealing with leakages, he accepts it is problematic to hold up traffic for lengthy periods, but points out that the Luas was completed and London replaced its Victorian pipes because “needs must”. As it stands, “taking water from the Shannon and losing 50 per cent of it is ludicrous”, he adds.Tomorrow: The response of Irish Water on Dublin’s water crisis and how the Shannon pipeline project was evaluated"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3957350.1563209451!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"shannon pipeline not needed if dublin water leaks fixed study claims","story":"Irish Water plans to build a 170-kilometre pipeline from the River Shannon in Tipperary to Dublin to combat water shortages in the capital, but campaigning lawyer and investment analyst Emma Kennedy says their case is full of holes.\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe latest cost estimate for a pipeline to carry water from the Shannon to Dublin is between €1.2 billion and €1.3 billion.

Over half of its treated water is lost between the reservoir and the tap,” she told The .“If Irish Water did nothing more than meet its own leakage targets in the coming years, the volume of ‘new’ water available at the tap would more than offset the growth in demand from Dublin’s growing population.”While the capital’s water issues are acute, they are, in her view, down to infrastructure rather than a lack of water.Kielder schemeThe project, she believed, had striking similarities with the infamous Kielder supply scheme in northeast England in 1981, which was considered “a bold and imaginative one: the largest single water conservation scheme yet undertaken” in the country.But the industry it was planned to supply was already reducing its water requirements before construction started. It may have been one of the biggest water projects ever undertaken in Europe, but the reservoir now rests mostly idle. The water is rarely needed.Ultimately, it was condemned as an expensive white elephant. It became, Ms Kennedy said, a victim of “the politics of promotion of mega-projects” and showed “unfortunately, engineering accomplishments were often marred by economic miscalculation”.She argues that fixing Dublin’s leaks essentially creates a huge new “source” of water, which would make the Shannon project redundant,This is a view, however, that is disputed by some experts, who warn Dublin will have major capacity issues in coming years compounded by population growth and climate disruption.Irish Water, Ms Kennedy noted in her report to the committee, is nowhere near meeting its own 2021 leakage target. Indeed, “unaccounted-for water” has gone up, not down.In April 2018, Irish Water said it was currently replacing about 25km of Dublin’s 9,000km of pipes a year. “This equates to an annual replacement rate of 0.3 per cent well below Irish Water’s proclaimed 1 per cent target. London’s water supplier recently replaced 2,074km of pipes in just five years.”Irish Water cites the disruption of replacing pipes, but in London, Thames Water found replacing the pipes reduced disruption by eliminating the need to repeatedly dig up the same stretch of tarmac to deal with repeat bursts.The Irish utility’s policy when a pipe bursts is to patch it up. It told the joint committee that it only actually replaces pipes once there are “multiple frequent failures” and the pipes are bursting “three or four times” a month.‘Third-world pipes’However, Ms Kennedy said the policy of pumping yet more water into the supply system while neglecting the pipes is a time bomb. “This is no longer just about leakage – there can be more efficient ways of reducing leakage than replacing the pipes – this is about a water supply system that has been neglected so badly for so long that it is now barely fit for purpose. It is about a thriving first-world city having to rely on third-world water pipes,” she said.“Dublin has all the makings of a city in a powerful global position, in a world where water is an increasingly valued commodity. It has twice as much water as its householders and industry actually use. Its raw water reservoirs are large by international standards. But it has one major Achilles heel: its water pipes.”Ms Kennedy has advised a number of groups opposed to the pipeline. She has always acknowledged the proposed route passes through a farm owned by her husband’s family near Nenagh.She has furnished a detailed appendix to her latest analysis, which fact checks Irish Water’s statements made to the committee and compares them to the utility’s own reports and those of independent analysts.Unless Dublin addresses its pipes – no matter how much extra water it pumps into one end of the supply system – there will be outages with every cold snap and prolonged drought, and misery for Dublin’s residents, she predicted.“Irish Water claims that it is doing all it can to address the pipes but today we show, again, that Irish Water’s statements about leakage and about the Shannon pipeline are unreliable.”In a letter to committee members, Ms Kennedy said its purpose is “to ensure you are aware Irish Water made statements to the joint committee that its own reports show to be inaccurate or misleading”.While insisting her analysis did not amount to a suggestion of bad faith, she said there were issues about the project, on top of its immense cost, that remained unaddressed.Tomorrow: Contrasting views on the Shannon pipeline project.

Farmers in the vicinity of Lough Derg and the Shannon have led opposition to the pipeline project. Photograph: Alan Betson A new approach is urgently needed to get major infrastructure projects across the line on time in Ireland, according to communications experts at Dublin City University (DCU).Public buy-in and greater understanding of the case for nationally important developments must be secured, a soon-to-published study concludes.Dr Pádraig Murphy, assistant professor in DCU’s school of communications recommends extensive public engagement at the earliest possible stage that is backed by a genuine “democratised participatory process”.In an independent evaluation of Irish Water’s approach to the Shannon pipeline proposal, the study finds the utility regarded it primarily as an engineering solution – “a legacy project” – with technical issues to be solved rather than, for instance, social concerns to be addressed.A new approach is now routinely adopted across the European Union and will be critical to successful implementation of the National Development Plan, Dr Murphy points out, as well as effective implementation of national and regional spatial strategies.In an evaluation of Irish Water’s Shannon pipeline and of the case presented to justify it, the study concludes a failure to adopt responsible research and innovation principles meant the project has so far failed to get buy-in and wide acceptance.The utility’s approach appeared to be a black-and-white issue of where water goes, Dr Murphy notes: “It rains in the west there’s a shortage in the east”. Such projects were never as simple as that, he adds.There were big issues to be addressed about “ownership”, not just of farmers, but also businesses and community groups.A responsible research and innovation approach “breaks away from the usual suspects” and vested interests adopting set positions, Dr Murphy says.In its fullest sense, it embraces “open science” making research and its dissemination accessible to all levels of an inquiring society, amateur or professional. Above all, it is a robust process embracing everything from regional development issues to ethical issues to aesthetics. It is also about choices. Dr Murphy cites the changed approach of the utility company EirGrid in facilitating meaningful discussions about the location of onshore wind farms.It means major projects are not considered as “a stage-managed engineering issue” where views such as “the jackeens are not getting our water” can take hold. While Irish Water had referenced climate change factors, however, these were not factored sufficiently. Communications Dr Murphy says Irish Water’s narrow approach to the project meant it had to manage controversy about the project as “a firefighting exercise” in communications terms.In his opinion, it is not too late for the utility to acknowledge its mistakes, to commit to doing better in future and to invite people in to foster collective ownership, though it was unlikely that major changes could be made to such a big project at this stage.The lessons could be applied to projects in adopting the approach in underlining what is best for Ireland.On the leakage issue, he says, it was too easily pushed aside with the utility insisting “we cannot do that” in addressing the issue of such large quantities of water being wasted, rather than setting out a 10-year plan to address it which would rebuild trust with stakeholders.On the cost of the project and speculation it might be up to €2 billion, Dr Murphy does not believe it is the same as the national children’s hospital’s runaway costs. That said, he warns, the cost factor fuelled by populist arguments could dominate over other bigger issues, such as climate disruption.He underlined the need for the Oireachtas Committee on Housing, Planning and Local Government to have a central role in evaluating the pipeline project and other major infrastructural projects in future."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3958618.1563307900!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"talk of brexit banished as portrush embraces the british open","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tSpectators watching golfers on the course during practice day for  the Open Championship 2019 at Royal Portrush Golf Club.

On these early practice days, the majority of accents are native ones many are local or have holiday homes nearby.All understand the significance of the Open’s presence in Portrush.“You have to pinch yourself to think how far things have come here,” says Brian McGee. From the town, he is watching as his grandchildren play at a putting range.His daughter Lauren says: “I’m very proud to be from Portrush”.For her, the holding of the Open here is the culmination of many years of change in Northern Ireland.Different story“I think we’ve been writing a different story here for a long time. This is the icing on the cake for Northern Ireland, and it cements how far we’ve come.“It’s a shame there’s no government in place to really celebrate it. I hope all the benefits of it don’t just fade away – look at how hard they worked to get us here, wouldn’t it be better if they were here to help us reap the rewards?”Gordon Armstrong from Enniskillen, Co Fermanagh, describes the Open as “a massive PR opportunity” for Northern Ireland. “It shows there’s more things in the world than the ‘B word’.”The B word, of course, is Brexit on the course at Royal Portrush, it feels a distant prospect.“This is one of the biggest international events in the world,” says Armstrong. “It transcends golf, and it sends the message that we’re looking forward to the future in an optimistic way, and shows what we can do here when we put our minds to it.“Golf is an all-Ireland sport. It’s not split – and it shows that there’s a common heritage here that people identify with.”Noreen Pakenham, from Bangor, Co Down, agrees.“I find it quite emotional, actually,” she says. “Sport doesn’t ide people, it unites them. We’ve met some lovely people here today, from both sides.”She and her husband Ted come to Portrush for three weeks every summer.“We’re Remainers,” Noreen stresses. Protestants who vote for the Alliance Party, they are strong supporters and friends of Independent Unionist Lady Sylvia Hermon, the North Down MP.“I’m afraid of our present situation,” says Ted Pakenham. “I think Brexit has tended to make us look into our own wee groups again, and I think that’s sad.“One would hope it’s not going to ide Ireland again, that would be the worst case scenario, but whatever happens we’ll make the best of it.”“We look on ourselves as Irish,” says Noreen. “Things have been going so well, we wouldn’t want anything to change or to stand in the way of progress. It’s not for us, but for our grandchildren.”The Boyces – Ian and Bea – are also from Co Down. Members of a golf club near their home, they also go to the K Club in Co Kildare.“You don’t really think about the Border any more,” says Bea Boyce. “Brexit brought it back a little bit, but in sport you just don’t think like that.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3958590.1563307748!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"government set to reject eu proposal to end daylight savings time","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tEarlier in 2019, the European Parliament voted to abolish the custom of changing the clocks by an hour in spring and autumn by 2021. Photograph: Bryan O’Brien The Government is set to oppose an EU proposal to end daylight savings time because it could mean Northern Ireland and the Republic being in different time zones, among other concerns.Minister for Justice Charlie Flanagan will on Wednesday seek the approval of Cabinet to oppose the move and is also expected to lobby other EU member states on the issue.The European Commission last year announced it would propose a directive to member states and the European Parliament to abolish twice-yearly clock-switching. Earlier this year, the European Parliament voted to abolish the custom of changing the clocks by an hour in spring and autumn by 2021. Majority decisionA qualified majority of member states is needed to back the idea and support a final plan agreed with the European Parliament. A qualified majority means an initiative must be supported by 55 per cent of member states, representing at least 65 per cent of the EU’s population. Although member states have the sole prerogative to decide what time zone they are part of, the commission says the union collectively has the right to determine whether countries make the summertime switch within those time zones.In Ireland, should Brexit go ahead and the UK decides to keep the summertime clock change, clocks in Northern Ireland would continue to go forward an hour on the last Sunday of March and back one hour on the last Sunday of October. Clocks in the Republic would remain unaltered, with both parts of the island out of step for seven months every year.The UK is also opposed to the proposal."},{"url":null,"title":"revealed really goes recycling rubbish behind scenes","story":"The chaos of Britain’s recycling system is exposed today with hundreds of thousands of tons of waste being redirected to landfill or incinerators.Despite residents sorting their household waste into separate bins, up to half of “recyclable” material is not being recycled in some areas of England, government data shows.It comes as an undercover investigation by The  and Unearthed reveals staff at a recycling centre in London are sending recyclable plastic and paper to be incinerated.Today, The  launches a Zero Waste campaign calling on the Government, local councils and private companies to do more to boost the country’s lacklustre recycling rates.It is backed by Boris Johnson...To continue reading this articleAccess all Premium articles then only £2 per weekRegister for freeRegister or subscribe to continue readingAlready a subscriber?Newsletters and daily briefings30 days free, then £2 per weekUnlimited access to Premium articlesExclusive subscriber events and rewardsThe daily newspaper on your smartphone or tabletAlready a subscriber?Comment: Is there method in the madness of Donald Trump\u0026#39s latest outburst?Comment: Erdogan\u0026#39s gone too far.

A container was also overloaded, without anyone knowing why. It may be incompetence or manipulation. Everything is possible. This will be part of the questions for the Malaysians.”MH370 became one of the world’s greatest aviation mysteries when it vanished with 239 people on board en route from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing on March 8, 2014.French investigators who examined flight data at Boeing’s headquarters in Seattle believe that the pilot was in control of the airliner “right up to the end”. Mr Wattrelos said the investigators told him the data “lends weight” to the theory that the pilot crashed into the sea in a murder-suicide, although they stressed that there was no proof. The investigators expect it to take up to a year to examine the data fully.However, some experts believe a hijack by a stowaway is a possibility and the mysterious load could lend credence to the theory. Tim Termini, an aviation security specialist, told Channel 5 earlier this month: “It’s highly likely that a hijack took place and again, there’s four options for the hijack.One is the hijack of the aircraft through a crew member. The second is a hijack coming from a passenger. A third option, which is a fairly unusual one, would be a stowaway. And then of course the fourth option is an electrical takeover of the aircraft from a ground-based station.”Mr Wattrelos, 54, who has led a campaign to find out what happened to the flight, acknowledged that “there is a risk that I may never learn the full truth.”Comment: Is there method in the madness of Donald Trump\u0026#39s latest outburst?Comment: Erdogan\u0026#39s gone too far.

Just brilliant. Absolutely fantastic.The 1969 mission marked one of humanity\u0027s biggest moments in space exploration.A few days after the launch, on July 21, people across the globe watched in amazement as Armstrong and Aldrin walked across the lunar surface, taking photos, collecting samples, planting a US flag and taking a call from then-president Richard Nixon.The  values your comments but kindly requests all posts are on topic, constructive and respectful.

research findsClick to followThe IndependentEvery person in the UK could be given a monthly idend to spend on fresh, healthy, locally produced food as part of radical proposals to reform the farming system and avert the twin crises of climate change and deteriorating public health.A “beetroot bond” would nudge people to buy healthy food and shift local communities away from unsustainable large-scale agricultural practices that produce large amounts of unhealthy food and contribute to environmental degradation, according to a report from a commission set up by the Royal Society of Arts (RSA).Alongside the bond, which would be government-funded, people would also become “shareholders” in their local food system with the ability to influence decisions on which types of produce will effectively be subsidised, such as local and seasonal, organic or other high-welfare, plastic-free or fairly traded.It is one of the more eye-catching ideas among plans laid out by the RSA’s Farming \u0026amp Countryside Commission, which argues the UK farming and food system must be urgently and radically reformed if we are to stem rising temperatures and rates of obesity and diabetes.The research involved farmers and supermarkets as well as health and environmental groups and thousands of conversations with rural residents.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.Environment news in pictures

the three largest wildlife trafficking gangs operating at the height of Africa’s elephant poaching epidemic.It concluded that, while agricultural and economic policy has focused for the past 70 years on producing more food more cheaply, this has come with unintended consequences that have moved many of the costs elsewhere.“More intensive farming practices are not necessarily more productive or more profitable,” the repost states.Even though Britain has some of the lowest food prices in Europe, it has the highest rate of food poverty. The poorest 10 per cent of households need to spend 74 percent of their disposable income after housing costs on food to meet the Eatwell Guide, a policy tool used by government to define a healthy diet.Type 2 diabetes, which is associated with a high-sugar and high-carbohydrate diet, now eats up 10 per cent of the NHS budget, a figure that is expected to rise to 17 per cent by 2035.Tesco suspends \u0027ethical\u0027 farm over \u0027disgusting\u0027 abuse of chickensMeanwhile, farming accounts for 83 per cent of global ammonia emissions that contribute to air pollution and 11 percent of greenhouse gas emissions.“Time is now running out. The actions that we take in the next 10 years are critical: to recover and regenerate nature and to restore health and wellbeing to both people and planet,” the report states.\u0026nbspThe commission recommends the government implements a “polluter pays” principle so that the true costs of food production, including on the environment and public health, are borne by the businesses that benefit.To accomplish this requires a “strong and escalating” regulations that put pressure on businesses to end practices that deplete public value.Another key pillar of the proposals is to simplify the “jungle of labels” that consumers face when trying to decide on healthy and environmentally friendly food, and to provide better, simpler and clearer information.Other ideas floated in the Our Future in the Land report include ramping up production of healthy British food such as fruit, vegetables, nuts and pulses, with the help of a national agro-ecology development bank that it is hoped would attract long-term investors to fund a transition to sustainable farming.Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Secretary Michael Gove said: “This report raises issues that are hugely important for changing the way we produce food in this country when we are outside of the EU\u0027s Common Agricultural Policy.”Mr Gove has previously said the UK would have more freedom to pursue a greener farming policy after Brexit.\u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

With Brexit bringing an end to reciprocal medical cover, this mattersClick to followThe IndependentThanks to the Conservative Party some 14m people may find travel to Europe much more difficult if not impossible after October 31.\u0026nbspThose people are those of use with pre existing medical conditions.Even with the reciprocal health coverage we currently enjoy thanks to the UK\u0027s memberhip of the EU, it’s still wise for us to take out travel insurance. A no deal Brexit would make it essential. And that can prove very expensive.\u0026nbspHow can we get a fair deal on our travel insurance?How to buy the right travel insuranceThe Financial Conduct Authority waking up to the issue is therefore timely.\u0026nbspIt is proposing a series of reforms to a market in which it currently is legal to discriminate against those with disabilities in a way that it is not against, say, male drivers. The statistics show that those of us with a Y chromosome pose more risk of an accident, which used to be reflected in our premiums. However, the EU put paid to that and you won’t hear many complaints about its decision from the usual suspects.\u0026nbspIf you have a pre-existing medical condition the same protection does not apply. You’re likely to pay more, and potentially so much more that it makes travel impossible, or get hit with exclusions, which can severely limited the effectiveness of travel insurance policies. \u0026nbspThe watchdog is proposing to address this by mandating that insurers point customers to a directory of alternatives who might be prepared to do better when they load their premiums or demand exclusions.\u0026nbspThere are specialists out there which can offer improved deals and policies for we who have pre existing conditions. They still charge more - I pay more than the rest of my family put together - but they can be an improvement on what mainstream insurers offer. \u0026nbspA good innovation? I have to admit to being in two minds about this.\u0026nbspIt may help people get cover who might otherwise be stuck. A couple of years ago Scope, the disability charity, highlighted the case of Samantha Renke, an a 31-year-old actress and disability campaigner, who was quoted £500 for a two-week trip to Mexico.\u0026nbspShe has osteogenesis imperfecta, or brittle bones, but had had her spine straightened with rods, which would have significantly reduced the risk of her having to claim as a result of her disability. The insurers she tried appeared unwilling to take this into account.\u0026nbspAt a time when underwriting is becoming increasingly automated, with artificial intelligence playing a progressively greater role, I expect this to happen more and more often.\u0026nbspThe FCA’s plan might have helped address the issues she faced. She would have\u0026nbspbeen referred to the\u0026nbspdirectory. I imagine the same thing would happen to me.\u0026nbspBut I worry that what the watchdog is doing is pushing\u0026nbsp14m Britons into an insurance ghetto, allowing what you might call mainstream insurers to wash their hands of us, rather than making them treat us fairly.\u0026nbspSo the plan is not without thorns. Here’s another: It is suggesting providing information to “help consumers understand the implications of travelling with exclusions, and how factors such as country of travel can impact medical costs and therefore travel insurance premiums”.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.

That’s something I do because travelling is a massive pain in the neck. But those with a more adventurous disposition really ought not to be put off because of insurers’ knuckle headedness.\u0026nbspThe watchdog is due to publish an update on pricing later this week, which will look at the way vulnerable consumers are treated. Travel insurance for those with medical conditions or disabilities won’t specifically be part of that, but perhaps it should be.In the meantime, it should be said that it has good intentions here.

Yet another one was announced alongside the delay: the group said it had formally taken control of Game Digital. So something like this was always on the cards.\u0026nbspThat was the view of the City and investors duly ran for cover. Sports Direct’s shares lost more than ten per cent within minutes of the stock market opening.\u0026nbspMike Ashley’s Sports Direct weighs up £61m Debenhams dealEvans Cycles to close more stores after sale to Sports DirectBut that’s not the most troubling thing about the company’s announcement.\u0026nbspInvestors not named or in the employ of Mike Ashley haven’t had an update on how their company is doing since December. In the interim, it has been as busy as a sports coach in the days leading up to the start of a new season, butting heads, gobbling up businesses, buying back shares.\u0026nbspSports Direct said the reasons for the delay were that integrating HoF into the sprawling retail empire had created “complexities” at a time when auditors overseeing the preparation of company\u0026nbspresults are facing additional scrutiny from the Financial Reporting Council (FRC), particularly Grant Thornton, Sports Direct’s auditor.\u0026nbspIt had a rocket fired at it by the watchdog last week. The FRC said only half the firm’s audits were rated as good or requiring limited improvement during its most recent review. One in four had failed to pass muster over the last five years. This landed the firm on the accountancy naughty step.\u0026nbspThose excuses are ostensibly plausible. The problem came with final part of the explanation for the delay, the reference in the stock exchange announcement to “uncertainty as to the current trading performance” of HoF. \u0026nbspUsually the word “uncertain” is code for “bad”. You never see it used when a company’s business is going like the clappers but it isn’t quite sure whether where the best description for its permanence should fall in a range between “better than expected” and “yowza”.But how bad? There’s a big difference between trading being at, say, the bottom end of the company’s or the market’s expectations and the roof falling in.\u0026nbspAnd what’s going on at the rest of the business?\u0026nbspApparently a number of areas are being looked at which could “materially affect guidance”. But which areas? Nobody outside of Sports Direct knows, so the City was left with no option but to assume the worst.\u0026nbspIt was a busy morning for Sports Direct announcements. Another concerned the share buyback programme it announced in April. The company said it spent just shy of £150,000 buying 56,368 shares on 12 July.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.

followThe IndependentEvery person in the UK could be given a monthly idend to spend on fresh, healthy, locally produced food as part of radical proposals to reform the farming system and avert the twin crises of climate change and deteriorating public health.A “beetroot bond” would nudge people to buy healthy food and shift local communities away from unsustainable large-scale agricultural practices that produce large amounts of unhealthy food and contribute to environmental degradation, according to a report from a commission set up by the Royal Society of Arts (RSA).Alongside the bond, which would be government-funded, people would also become “shareholders” in their local food system with the ability to influence decisions on which types of produce will effectively be subsidised, such as local and seasonal, organic or other high-welfare, plastic-free or fairly traded.It is one of the more eye-catching ideas among plans laid out by the RSA’s Farming \u0026amp Countryside Commission, which argues the UK farming and food system must be urgently and radically reformed if we are to stem rising temperatures and rates of obesity and diabetes.The research involved farmers and supermarkets as well as health and environmental groups and thousands of conversations with rural residents.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.Environment news in pictures Show all

on producing more food more cheaply, this has come with unintended consequences that have moved many of the costs elsewhere.“More intensive farming practices are not necessarily more productive or more profitable,” the repost states.Even though Britain has some of the lowest food prices in Europe, it has the highest rate of food poverty. The poorest 10 per cent of households need to spend 74 percent of their disposable income after housing costs on food to meet the Eatwell Guide, a policy tool used by government to define a healthy diet.Type 2 diabetes, which is associated with a high-sugar and high-carbohydrate diet, now eats up 10 per cent of the NHS budget, a figure that is expected to rise to 17 per cent by 2035.Tesco suspends \u0027ethical\u0027 farm over \u0027disgusting\u0027 abuse of chickensMeanwhile, farming accounts for 83 per cent of global ammonia emissions that contribute to air pollution and 11 percent of greenhouse gas emissions.“Time is now running out. The actions that we take in the next 10 years are critical: to recover and regenerate nature and to restore health and wellbeing to both people and planet,” the report states.\u0026nbspThe commission recommends the government implements a “polluter pays” principle so that the true costs of food production, including on the environment and public health, are borne by the businesses that benefit.To accomplish this requires a “strong and escalating” regulations that put pressure on businesses to end practices that deplete public value.Another key pillar of the proposals is to simplify the “jungle of labels” that consumers face when trying to decide on healthy and environmentally friendly food, and to provide better, simpler and clearer information.Other ideas floated in the Our Future in the Land report include ramping up production of healthy British food such as fruit, vegetables, nuts and pulses, with the help of a national agro-ecology development bank that it is hoped would attract long-term investors to fund a transition to sustainable farming.Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Secretary Michael Gove said: “This report raises issues that are hugely important for changing the way we produce food in this country when we are outside of the EU\u0027s Common Agricultural Policy.”Mr Gove has previously said the UK would have more freedom to pursue a greener farming policy after Brexit.\u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The bank heist is a tired dramatic trope these days, but don’t let that, or the show’s bland English-language title, put you off – creator Álex Pina has made something special. The heist here, led by a mysterious man known only as The Professor, involves breaking into the Royal Mint of Spain and printing off €2.4 billion. There are even more twists in the show’s 15 episodes than there are hostages. 220 American Vandal (TV series, two seasons, 2017–2018)Part satire of true crime documentaries such as Making a Murderer, part carefully observed portrayal of teenage life, American Vandal was criminally underappreciated during its two season run. It’s been cancelled now, but that doesn’t mean you can’t catch up with it, and then write Netflix a strongly worded email.320 One Day at a Time (TV series, two seasons, 2017–)In stark contrast to the off-beat, low-key comedy that currently rules TV – the kind that provokes a wry smirk rather than a hearty laugh – One Day at a Time is a big, bright sitcom filmed in front of an interminably enthusiastic studio audience. You wouldn’t have thought that the story of a Cuban-American army veteran  nurse  single mother – who suffers from PTSD and depression – would fit into this format, but it does so beautifully, tackling issues of sexuality, racism and sexism in the process.  Based on writer  director Tamara Jenkins’s own fertility struggles, Private Life stars Kathryn Hahn and Paul Giamatti (both giving brilliant performances) as a spiky, loving middle-aged couple desperate to have a baby. They even rope their enthusiastic but irresponsible niece Sadie (Kayli Carter) into the mix, much to the horror of Sadie’s mother (Molly Shannon, turning a potentially repellent character into one worthy of empathy). It’s subtle, restrained and beautifully realised.520 Big Mouth (TV series, two seasons, 2017–)Crude, rude, and rife with surprise emissions and bodily functions, animated sitcom Big Mouth is also a sensitive, nuanced deep e into the various horrors of teenagehood. When 12-year-old Andrew Glouberman (John Mulaney) is visited by the hormone monster (Nick Kroll, who voices many of the show’s best characters), he finds his life irreversibly – and seemingly disastrously – changed. Unlike many other puberty-centred comedies, Big Mouth makes as much time for its confused female protagonists as its male ones Maya Rudolph is a delight as the female hormone monster, and look out for Kristen Wiig’s wonderful turn as a talking vagina.  620 Easy (TV series, two seasons, 2016–)Joe Swanberg’s style of defiantly undramatic mumblecore isn’t for everyone, but if you enjoyed his earlier films, Drinking Buddies and Happy Christmas, you’ll find plenty to admire in this anthology comedy-drama series. Big-name stars such as Orlando Bloom and Aubrey Plaza crop up, but Jane Adams – who you might remember from Todd Solondz’s chronically depressing 1998 film Happiness – is the show’s heart, and Marc Maron is its jaded soul.Community’s Gillian Jacobs is brilliant as the prickly, magnetic recovering addict Mickey, who forms an unlikely – and arguably deeply unwise – relationship with her nerdy neighbour Gus (Paul Rust). Despite Gus’s pathological need to be the nice guy, we’re never quite sure who or what we’re rooting for – which is what makes Love such complex, compelling viewing.  In 2016, comedian Patton Oswalt’s wife, the true crime writer Michelle McNamara, died suddenly in her sleep. That subject matter doesn’t exactly scream “stand-up special”, but out of his devastating loss, Oswalt managed to craft something funny and profound. Over the course of an hour, he processes his grief onstage, managing to find humour in the struggle to raise his grieving six-year-old daughter alone.920 Santa Clarita Diet (TV series, two seasons, 2017–)Granted, this horror-comedy – which stars Drew Barrymore as a neurotic real estate agent who suddenly develops a taste for human flesh – is really silly, and really, really disgusting. But it’s also strangely charming, and funny. Timothy Olyphant is excellent as Sheila’s frazzled husband Joel, and the pair’s idiosyncratic but respectful relationship with their smart teenage daughter Abby (Liv Hewson) isn’t quite like anything else on TV right now.1020 Dark Tourist (TV series, one season, 2018–)New Zealand journalist David Farrier is an unlikely TV presenter in the same way that Louis Theroux is – in just about every scenario in which he finds himself, he’s a little bit awkward. But as with Theroux, Farrier’s weakness is actually his strength, allowing him to endear himself to the many unusual people he meets on his journey through the world’s most questionable tourist destinations. Farrier’s stops include the site of the Fukushima nuclear disaster, the road where JFK was assassinated, and the Milwaukee suburbs where serial killer Jeffrey Dahmer murdered his victims.1120 Sacred Games (TV series, one season, 2018–)Based on Vikram Chandra’s epic 2006 novel, Netflix’s first Indian original series is a slowly unfolding gem. The first season of Sacred Games – which follows a troubled police officer (Saif Ali Khan) who has 25 days to save his city thanks to a tip-off from a presumed dead gangster – only covered one quarter of Chandra’s 1,000-page novel. As the show itself declared when it announced the forthcoming second season, “the worst is yet to come”.When the trailer for Dumplin’ first landed, it seemed all the ingredients were in place for a film that was at worst tone-deaf, and at best vaguely patronising. Thank heavens, then, that the trailer did Dumplin’ such a disservice. Starring Danielle Macdonald (who broke out in the excellent 2017 film Patti Cake$) as Willowdean, a self-described “fat girl” who enters a local pageant to annoy her former beauty queen mother (Jennifer Aniston), Dumplin’ is as funny, warm and sensitive as its protagonist – and with a killer Dolly Parton-laden soundtrack to boot.1320 Dark (TV series, one season, 2017–)This sci-fi thriller – which features disappearing children, a mysterious local power plant, and scenes set in the Eighties – has, for obvious reasons, drawn comparisons to Stranger Things. But Dark is even more beguiling and (true to its name) less family-friendly than Stranger Things.1420 The Death and Life of Marsha P Johnson (Film, 2017)Though it’s been somewhat tarnished by claims that director David France appropriated the work and research of trans film-maker Reina Gossett, this documentary is nonetheless a loving, respectful tribute to gay rights activist Marsha P Johnson. One of the key figures in the Stonewall uprising (though her involvement was almost entirely eradicated in 2015’s critically hated Stonewall), Johnson modelled for Andy Warhol, performed onstage with drag group Hot Peaches, helped found the Gay Liberation Front, and then died under suspicious circumstances in 1992.1520 On My Block (TV series, one season, 2018–)This coming-of-age series might not have found as many eyeballs as it deserved last year, but those it did find were glued to the screen. In fact, it was the most-binged show of 2018 – meaning that it had the highest watch-time-per-viewing session of any Netflix original. Created by Awkward’s Lauren Iungerich, On My Block follows a group of Los Angeles teens as they navigate both the drama of high school and the danger of inner-city life.Two beleaguered assistants (Zoey Deutch and Glen Powell) conspire to get their over-demanding bosses (Taye Diggs and Lucy Liu) together in order to get their lives back in this winning romantic comedy. Set It Up is responsible not only for coining the term “over-dicking” (it’s much more innocent than it sounds), but for rejuvenating a tired genre.Martin Freeman stars as the father struggling to protect his young daughter from a zombie epidemic spreading across Australia. So far, so overdone. But this drama thriller, directed by Ben Howling and Yolanda Ramke and based on their 2013 short of the same name, throws a handful of unpredictable ners in the works.    1920 Godless (TV series, one season, 2017–)With shades of John Ford\u0027s The Searchers, this languorous western was critically acclaimed but swiftly forgotten after it landed on Netflix in 2016. Set in 1884, it\u0027s about Frank Griffin (Jeff Daniels) and his notoriously ruthless gang of outlaws’ pursuit of their injured former ally Roy Goode (Jack O’Connell), who is hiding out in a small town populated solely by women after a mining accident killed off all its men. A gun-toting Michelle Dockery, clearly relishing the change of scenery after years of Downton Abbey, and a taciturn Jack O’Connell, are on brilliant form.2020 Atypical (TV series, two seasons, 2017–)This coming-of-age series about a teenage boy with autism was sweet and well-intentioned from the start, but its first season was criticised for a handful of inaccuracies, and for its lack of autistic actors. Rather than drowning in a sea of defensiveness – as too many shows tend to do – it listened, and brought in autistic actors and writers for its excellent second season.120 Money Heist (TV series, one season, 2017–)Known as La Casa de Papel (House of Paper) in its native Spanish, Money Heist is Netflix’s most streamed non-English language show. The bank heist is a tired dramatic trope these days, but don’t let that, or the show’s bland English-language title, put you off – creator Álex Pina has made something special.

In short, no.The Handmaid\u0027s Tale, The Crown, Stranger Things and Big Little Lies (which will compete next year in this category as opposed to the Limited Series one) aren\u0027t eligible for nominations. Nor is The Americans, which ended last year.Thrones is a dead cert - and if it wins, it\u0027ll match the record held by Hill Street Blues, LA Law, The West Wing and\u0026nbspMad Men\u0026nbsp(four Best Drama wins).But what\u0027s gonna join it? Better Call Saul will get a look in as will This Is Us and Pose. Killing Eve seemed like a contender until the lukewarm reception to its second season and HBO breakout Succession has the vote of viewers but it\u0027s uncertain whether it\u0027ll be picked by the professionals making it this year\u0027s Leftovers, which was NEVER nominated for Best Drama. Outrageous.Also, don\u0027t go forgetting\u0026nbspAmazon Prime series Homecoming.\u0026nbspWhich brings us on nicely to Best Actress in a Drama Series - a category that some serious big-hitters (Elisabeth Moss! Claire Danes! Everyone in Big Little Lies!) aren\u0027t eligible for. This paves the way for - wait for it - Emilia Clarke, who has been put forward by HBO as a Game of Thrones lead.Julia Roberts is likely to pick up a nomination for her role in the aforementioned Homecoming, while Killing Eve recognition could pit its lead stars - the wonderful Sandra Oh and Jodie Comer - against each other. Comer is finally getting the plaudits she deserves, after all.This is perhaps a good time point out that former Emmy-winner House of Cards probably won\u0027t get a look in for its pretty awful final seasoto n. This means nothing for Robin Wright\u0027s swansong as Claire Underwood. Brutal, but somewhat fair.There\u0027s also a lot of people hoping that Suranne Jones will get nominated for Gentleman Jack. One such person is Danny Boyle, who got extremely excited about her performance in this interview.\u0026nbsphttps:www.arts-entertainmentfilmsfeaturesdanny-boyle-yesterday-beatles-james-bond-25-robert-pattinson-batman-interview-a8967666.htmlBest Actor in a Drama Series time - and before you ask, yes, Kit Harington will probably get nominated.Excitingly, this year could prove Bob Odenkirk\u0027s best chance at winning for Better Call Saul. Other contenders include Sterling\u0026nbspK Brown (This Is Us), Jason Bateman (Ozark), Billy Porter (Pose) aaaaaand Richard Madden for Bodyguard. Lest we forget, he (somehow) won the Golden Globe in January.It\u0027s time delve into the Comedy categories, which is essentially going to be a series of posts yearning for Fleabag recognition.\u0026nbspFirst thing\u0027s first, let\u0027s make it clear - this is a duke out between three-time winner Veep and The Marvelous Mrs Maisel, which swooped in due to Veep\u0027s ineligibility last year. Our money\u0027s on the former.Three dark horses are waiting in the wings, though, and they are called: Barry, The Good Place and Netflix series Russian Doll. Both solid shows with big fanbases that deserve to be recognised in the category. But yeah, they don\u0027t stand a chance next to Veep.\u0026nbspIn terms of Actor in a Comedy Series, it\u0027s no so certain - but expect nominations for *breathes* Bill Hader (Barry), Ted Danson (The Good Place), Don Cheadle (Black Monday) and Michael Douglas (The Kominsky Method). This will be a Donald Glover and Larry David-free affair due to ineligibility.The 71st Primetime Emmy Awards will air 22 September at about 1am UK time.Game of Thrones\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspThe best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxThe best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Villanelle’s new vulnerability invites us to question what it is exactly she wants from Polastri. First time around she was toying with a more worthy adversary, but why now? Polastri, by contrast, is frayed around the edges, a terrible wife to her husband Nico (Owen McDonnell) and an even worse intelligence agent to her boss Carolyn Martens (Fiona Shaw). The script is still tight and the jokes are still there, as are Villanelle’s accents, outfits and abrupt killings, but without the will-theywon’t-they energy of the initial plot, it is harder to care.226 Years and YearsYears and Years, then, is favoured by some wit, a cornucopia of fab talent and promising characters. The dominant one as we continue our quest into the 2030s and beyond, will be Vivienne, or Viv, Rook, played brilliantly by Emma Thompson. As a bit of a long-term Emma-sceptic I was actually startled by how good she is in the role of the epitome of everything she has spent her life hating and campaigning against, for Viv is a horrifically nasty businessperson turned populist politician with the most terrifying of views. Viv Rook makes Ann Widdecombe look like, well, Emma Thompson at an Extinction Rebellion sit-in.Joseph is almost never out of shot, whether seen from afar, contemplating a bottle of strong cider in a playground, or in visceral close-up, clutching his doner to his face. There are few actors you could trust with so much screen time, especially with such a pared back and naturalistic script. The fact any of it is remotely watchable is testament to Stephen Graham’s abilities. No man working in Britain today can drink a pint with more pathos.\u0027Good Omens is a hugely enjoyable, imaginative premiere, as close to Pratchett’s vision as anyone could have dared dream. And while the melancholy tone may not be for everyone, fans of the book will surely be sated.\u0027526 Line of Duty (BBC)Plausibility is a spectrum Bodyguard became ridiculous but Line of Duty stays just the right side, and as usual there is more plot in an hour than in whole series of other programmes. As well as being gripping entertainment, Line of Duty has become an effective examination of the relationship between the state and the inidual. The shadowy government forces are elected the organised crime gangs are fuelled by the drug trade. The police are there to save us from ourselves but can only do it if they are subjected to constant scrutiny. It’s exhausting work, policing the police.The footage is glorious, especially the side-on tracking shots of the birds and the hunting, where it is as if the cameramen were able to set up a rail along the ocean. Most spectacular of all is the sequence of a glacier collapsing into the ocean, where 75m tons of ice being sloughed off in less than 20-minutes. But at times Our Planet feels a little unfocused. Attenborough’s last big BBC series, Dynasties, won almost unbearable amount of emotional resonance through its focus on animal families. Our Planet is more of a greatest-hits parade, with overblown orchestral soundtrack and ponderous intonation. You can’t buy love, even if you pay for David Attenborough.726 Road to Brexit (BBC)The Road to Brexit is easily the best thing to emerge from the whole brexit imbroglio. OK, not much competition, but still... Despite the po-faced title, you realise very quickly that it’s not yet another drama starring Benedict Cumberbatch or yet another attempt by Laura Kuenssberg to explain the inexplicable, or yet another show with the public arguing about stuff they don’t understand. Rather, it’s a very clever, very funny, very \u0027different\u0027 parcel of bollocks to Brexit.While there are plenty of well-turned one-liners, the deeper attraction of Fleabag is schadenfreude. The character is as old as Daisy Buchanan or Lydia Bennett or Scarlett O’Hara. The best compliment to Waller-Bridge and her cast is that they find fresh clothes in which to dress these ancient monsters.It is sometimes remarked that the Troubles in Northern Ireland make for an unpromising backdrop for a sitcom about adolescent kids. Well, yer man’s wrong, as they might say. Derry Girls, returning for a triumphant and exuberant second run, proves that humour, dark or otherwise, can be quarried from even the most unlikely of locations.1026 The Murder of Jill Dando (BBC)A tremendously sad, strange story then, and just as unfathomable today. Dando’s friends, family and the producer and director of the film have made a fitting and balanced tribute to her, something she deserves. I can’t really add anything to that.Home is a rather gentle, unobtrusive variation on the sitcom theme – but one that is built on a quite a bizarre premise. The twist is that a family who returns to Surrey from a holiday touring around France discover a Syrian refugee stuffed in the back of their SUV. Not only that, but, after a few moments of blind terrified panic about a suicide bombing, they eventually adopt him like he’s stray cat that’s just wandered in.Michael Jackson has long looked like a burning tire yard. There were the allegations, the out-of-court settlements, the arrest, the trial and not-guilty verdict. But there has been nothing like Leaving Neverland” 1326 This Time with Alan Partridge* (BBC1)This Time with Alan Partridge is such a consistently strong creative achievement that fears for the future of Alan Gordon Partridge, may, once again, be allayed. Or Alayned, perhaps.” “Like all the best detective dramas, Shetland engages the audience in the very process of detection. That way we grow intrigued, and we care. And so we find ourselves sitting next to Henshall in his (prominently featured) Volvo V70 estate, sharing his thoughts, intercepting suspects and being driven off the road by unidentified enemies.” “It is both a revisionist – and frequently batty – take on the caped milieu and a winningly knotty mystery. And it surely is the first big-budget superhero tale more indebted to Wes Anderson than to Stan Lee.” “Yet again the Williams have woven a brilliantly tangled web, helped in no small part by Karyo’s quietly arresting central turn” “There’s really been nothing quite like Catastrophe on our screens before, and it deserves its cult status for the quality of everything the production team do, not least the stunning cinematography in this finale. Thanks, all. I’m glad Catastrophe died happy. 1826 Inside Europe: Ten Years of Turmoil (BBC2)“For anyone who’s not altogether sure how British politics turned so suddenly into a rolling dumpster fire from which all exits are blocked then Inside Europe: Ten Years of Turmoil is a necessary public service to explain exactly, and exactly how needlessly, we all came to be here.”“West believes Valjean to be “the greatest hero in all literature”, and he plays the part with all the care and intricacy such a character deserves.” “You see, saint or sinner, prince or pauper, we are all part of one race, the brotherhood of man. And the saintly and regal Danny Dyer stands as its finest ambassador.” 2126 The Secret Life of the Zoo (Channel 4)“This documentary goes behind the shrubbery to show off these animals and their s. The humans are a pretty exotic bunch too, judging by some of the lines they come out with.”2226 A Year of British Murder (Channel 4)“The programme-makers must have done much to win the confidence of so many friends and families, as they went through unspeakable personal pain but they repay that confidence with an understated and powerful film.” “Despite what some feared, the casting of Cumberbatch doesn’t simply flatter Cummings – the A-lister is too good a chameleon for that. But, inevitably, as he scrawls out his campaigning brainwaves on a whiteboard, there is a touch of that deductive maverick Sherlock in his portrayal of this scruffy, balding political saboteur.” 2426 The Paras: Men of War (ITV)“From the outset the production is elevated by its sensitive handling of the men – and the Paratroopers remain exclusively male – involved. These kinds of programmes have a tendency to fetishise toughness, lingering on assault courses and weaponry.”2526 Billy Connolly: Made in Scotland (BBC2)“Billy Connolly: Made in Scotland is a meandering look back over his life, career, and national identity – a “Proustian wander through Scotland”. There’s a lot of mordant chat about the weather, illustrated with shots of dark grey clouds above even darker grey lochs.” “As a slightly cheesy reminder of what we love about Doctor Who – i.e. the fact it gives us an intergalactic eccentric in a big flappy overcoat shouting at Daleks  – this is a New Year treat that more than delivers” As the series develops, it’s clearer than ever that Eve and Villanelle are more similar than they are different.

Within 24 hours the college social network had more than 1,000 usersWithin one week of launching, fellow Harvard students Cameron Winklevoss, Tyler Winklevoss and Divya Narendra accused Zuckerberg of stealing their idea.

But two people with knowledge of the discussions said the conversations remained vague, with key details of the project discussed only on a theoretical level.Some lawmakers specialising in financial services policy have been frustrated by the lack of clarity from Facebook before and since in recent months, three congressional sources said.Top Republican and Democrat on the Senate Banking Committee had sent Facebook a letter in May\u0026nbspseeking information, including how the company would protect consumers’ financial information. But Facebook did not write back until 8 July, the committee said.One Democratic aide described the company’s contacts with lawmakers as “inept and entitled.”Facebook has said that it announced the project in its early stages to get feedback from stakeholders. Mr Marcus reiterated this at the hearing on Tuesday.The executive added: “I know that we will have to earn people’s trust for a very long period of time to get the benefit of them wanting to use the Calibra wallet.”Additional reporting from agenciesBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

He created a list of people who were allowed to enter the embassy without showing identification or being searched by security, and was granted the power to delete names from visitor logs. He sometimes met guests inside a woman’s bathroom to avoid security cameras.The report also says that he was given “powerful new computing and network hardware” just a few weeks before WikiLeaks received hacked materials from Russian operatives.

I worry that this image will refuel the public\u0027s imbalanced perception of sharks but as an image capturing behaviour it has drama, adrenaline, grace, beauty and finality. That\u0027s a very rare combination in one image. - Peter Rowlands (Judge) Winner: Wide Angle. The first moment I viewed this image I knew it would be a strong contender. For me it\u0027s the symmetry of the Humpback and the balance between the er and calf. Everything about it is in perfect alignment. The shape of the tail in relation to the four corners of the frame, not to mention the position of the free er and calf. Superb imagery at its very best.  Many congratulations Francois. - Martin Edge (Judge)    Winner: Macro. Fabio’s use of long exposure and panning has turned a classic portrait of a Sepiola into an unforgettable one. The sharp and ghosted images of the bobtail squid balance pleasingly in the frame and combined with the outstretched tentacles give the feeling of the cephalopod lunging for its prey. An innovative and most deserving category winner. - Alex Mustard (Judge) It is hard to imagine what it must have been like to have experienced such a large scale natural spectacle as this but this image, perfectly composed and timed, gets close. - Peter Rowlands (Judge) Winner: British Waters Macro. A mantra of mine is \u0027It\u0027s not what it is. It\u0027s where it is\u0027 and this long clawed Squat lobster is in a perfect position to make a memorable image. The author, instead of \u0027blasting\u0027 it with light, has gone in the opposite direction by restricting the strobe into a snooted spotlight in order to illuminate just the features of the lobster and the dainty sea loch anemones. It\u0027s an example of \u0027Isolation lighting\u0027 at its very best. A great deal of uw photographers invest their time in what they want to illuminate. This is an example which in my opinion illustrates features that they do not want to illuminate, hence the punchy black background and the soft delicate hues of dark sand, facial features topped off by the sea loch anemones. - Martin Edge (Judge)Winner: Marine Conservation. The problems of plastic pollution and ghost fishing are both illustrated by this struggling loggerhead turtle. I am happy to learn this inidual was lucky enough to survive this deathtrap thanks to the photographer - Alex Mustard (Judge)What a chin, what a forehead, what a character. This picture has portrait written all over it, and such a fascinating species ideally suited to this close focus wide angle approach. - Alex Mustard (Judge) Winner: Portrait. Superb impact from the very first moment it was presented. Perfect composition within the image frame and the understated colours. To top it off the authors comments above say it all... a Smiling Happy Angel\u0027s Face. One of my favourites from the entire competition. - Martin Edge (Judge)  Winner: Up \u0026amp Coming. Beautiful split shot with both a perfect under and over split. A very strong favourite with all the judges and one of the best examples I have seen of this type of image for some time. Just Superb! - Martin Edge (Judge)Winner: Black \u0026amp White. It must be 11 out of 10 for this groundbreaking image. Conception, interpretation and perseverance coupled with black and white’s ability to concentrate on the key elements. It gets better with each viewing. - Peter Rowlands (Judge) Grey seals are a perennial favourite in UPY as one of the UK\u0027s star wildlife attractions. This upside-down portrait is quirky and cute and easily won the affections of the judging panel. Great to see an overseas photographer coming to the UK to show us how it\u0027s done! - Alex Mustard (Judge)Winner: Compact. This image was a very popular choice between the panel. Ideal for a split rendition. What makes this a winner for me, not withstanding the double exposure is the sympathetic balance of light \u0026amp colour connected  between the top half and bottom of the image frame. - Martin Edge (Judge)Winner: British Waters Compact. Does British ing get any better than a fun encounter with a grey seal pup? This youngster’s relaxed and curious face is captured perfectly by Martin, making us all want to be there too. - Alex Mustard (Judge)Winner: British Waters Living Together. Images tell stories but well thought out and executed ones speak volumes. This is such an example which feeds the eye with tales of the seaside on summer days, lively marine spectacles and excited human interaction. - Peter Rowlands (Judge)1545 Isles of Scilly, UKWinner: British Waters Wide Angle. Photographers often feel competition shots must be packed with new tricks to win. At UPY we always appreciate classic technique when it raises the bar of what has been done before. Rob\u0027s full technicolour wide angle scenic reveals the richness of UK seas with an elegant simplicity that is incredibly challenging to pull off in British conditions. - Alex Mustard (Judge) Winner: Wrecks. So simple yet so powerful the additional lighting of the turret and the main er perfectly positioned. This was a very strong category this year with a deserved winner and it\u0027s refreshing to read the acknowledgement to Leigh Bishop\u0027s pioneering work. - Peter Rowlands (Judge) The iconic silhouette of a seahorse is a graphically powerful picture. Here Zarina has raised that to another level with the addition of a red filter to her snooted strobe, reminiscent of a rim-lit animal at sunset. - Alex Mustard (Judge) All the judges found this to be probably the most distressing image to view but its uncompromising message must be seen by as many people as possible. - Peter Rowlands (Judge)As a subject we have seen our fair share of these colourful characters but this one shone through and the eggs almost look as if they have been inidually lit! - Peter Rowlands (Judge)Superb image with a perfect line across the split. Good exposure both above and below the water line and such an ideal subject to cap it all off. Excellent work. - Martin Edge (Judge)This is an excellent example for this category. It takes a tried and trusted angle but completely lifts it by using the fabric. It becomes more than an image a concept, a transition, a rebirth. - Peter Rowlands (Judge)2245 Isles of Scilly, UKThis image stood out on many levels. Composition, colour vibrancy and contrast combined with an unusual angle kept us coming back to it and helped it rise in the rankings with each viewing. - Peter Rowlands (Judge)Perfect control of angle, light and focus. This was always up there with all of the judges. A clear favourite just like Nick Park’s genius creations. - Peter Rowlands (Judge) I\u0027ve seen many images of eel and shrimp around Indonesia, however you have taken this two steps forward. 1) With your excellent idea to snoot the eye and 2) with your backlight on the shrimp. You can expect many photographers to practice your technique in the months to come. Congratulations for your vision. Very well thought out and executed. - Martin Edge (Judge)    It’s not what you’ve got, it’s what you do with it. The split may have been elusive but well worth the effort. This is a deceptively subtle excellent delivery. - Peter Rowlands (Judge)I have witnessed this behaviour from the surface with its high velocity \u0027testosterone and tonnage\u0027 and I remember thinking how happy I was to be in the boat. To have the presence of mind to time this shot whilst one\u0027s senses are being bombarded is heroic in my view. - Peter Rowlands (Judge) What an amazing moment. From the expression on the face of the unicornfish fleeing for its life, to the hunting pack of sharks, especially the leader with its mouth snapping open that fan out diagonally across this composition. And that is without considering what a great challenge it is to shoot these images of split second action, in the dead of night, underwater. - Alex Mustard (Judge)  There is so much energy in this image. If you look at it long enough you can begin to see just a hint of movement of all the fish around the coral. The colours are realistic and this top down shot works well.  - Martin Edge (Judge)A jaw-dropping wide angle scene with sharks, rays and mountains. A winning combination in the Up \u0026amp Coming category. - Alex Mustard (Judge)3045 Loch Long, Argyll and ButeThis is a subtle image with light and detail that are a delight to explore. The sunset, trees and underwater scene combine to create a wonderful feeling of the place. We particularly like how the composition allows the line of the shore to be continued underwater by the seaweeds.  - Alex Mustard (Judge)Photographing pike underwater is one thing but finding your own underwater artistic stamp is quite another matter. With this particular image the author has done just that! By using a slow shutter speed of 18th sec and a panning technique from right to left gives the impression of movement whilst the pike is pin sharp. - Martin Edge (Judge)Arthur’s image scores with both its foreground and background. The deadman’s fingers soft coral make an attractive foreground, enhanced by the crab sheltering within, and the striking sunbeams create beauty and atmosphere in the background. I also love the feeling of depth created by the legs of the jetty reaching up for the surface. - Alex Mustard (Judge)In recent UPY competitions UK macro images have lacked their overseas counterpart\u0027s flair and imagination but this magnificent shot raises the bar for everyone else to follow. World class from the UK at last. - Peter Rowlands (Judge)Memorable photographs of people underwater are deceptively difficult and require both the photographer and model to be at the top of their game. The simplicity of the composition works to highlight the delicious details in the girl\u0027s pose. - Alex Mustard (Judge) This is a timeless scene that communicates a detailed story. The cavern, the silversides sheltering, the tarpon hunting and the er kneeling reverentially, taking it all in. It is a fabulous use of black and white to tell this story of shadows and light. - Alex Mustard (Judge) Sometimes it is the small detail which contributes so much. The white of the eye and the row of teeth in what could be construed as a smile convey mischief and menace in equal measures. - Peter Rowlands (Judge) Once again Tobias you have succeeded in capturing one of the most photographed wrecks in the Red Sea and photographing it in a completely different way. You push the boundaries of wreck photography and I congratulate you for your vision and forward thinking of new ideas. - Martin Edge (Judge)  Perfect composition and framed against the stark black background. However it\u0027s the contrast of white on black which attracts the eye again and again every time this particular image popped up to greet us. The colour of the nudibranch was sufficiently bright enough to raise our senses again and again as it proceeded through the competition.  The soft delicate treatment of the snooted flash is also very well managed. - Martin Edge (Judge)    This shot puts you right in the picture and records a special encounter in a very special place. Every element contributes and the lucky or intended curve of the split creates great spatial depth. - Peter Rowlands (Judge) Symmetry, graphic simplicity and for once in UK waters a black background which contributes to a positive outer worldly delivery. A mould breaker. - Peter Rowlands (Judge) I see and judge many images of the sockeye salmon but this is one of the best. The alignment of the two salmon not to mention the composition within the frame.  The surgy peak of the action is in perfect symmetry with the window which provides the viewer with topside influences of the trees against a vivid blue sky. There is so much image depth in this example. - Martin Edge (Judge)    Such a delicate image yet so full of emotion. There are times when there are no more words needed. - Peter Rowlands (Judge)UPY loves seahorse photos! Especially when they capture a fleeting behaviour, such as this. But we hadn\u0027t realised during judging that this was a new species of seahorse, nor did with know the incredible backstory behind this picture, we just loved the moment. - Alex Mustard (Judge)  Whether or not you like fashion photography underwater you would be hard pressed to see a more beautiful combination of complimentary colours and a very elegant pose. A very well executed image. - Peter Rowlands (Judge)A portrait must leave you in no doubt. Simple lighting, illuminating all that is needed, captures this character. - Peter Rowlands (Judge)Winner: Behaviour and overall winner. I worry that this image will refuel the public\u0027s imbalanced perception of sharks but as an image capturing behaviour it has drama, adrenaline, grace, beauty and finality.

It\u0027s an example of \u0027Isolation lighting\u0027 at its very best. A great deal of uw photographers invest their time in what they want to illuminate. This is an example which in my opinion illustrates features that they do not want to illuminate, hence the punchy black background and the soft delicate hues of dark sand, facial features topped off by the sea loch anemones. - Martin Edge (Judge)Winner: Marine Conservation. The problems of plastic pollution and ghost fishing are both illustrated by this struggling loggerhead turtle. I am happy to learn this inidual was lucky enough to survive this deathtrap thanks to the photographer - Alex Mustard (Judge)What a chin, what a forehead, what a character. This picture has portrait written all over it, and such a fascinating species ideally suited to this close focus wide angle approach. - Alex Mustard (Judge) Winner: Portrait. Superb impact from the very first moment it was presented. Perfect composition within the image frame and the understated colours. To top it off the authors comments above say it all... a Smiling Happy Angel\u0027s Face. One of my favourites from the entire competition. - Martin Edge (Judge)  Winner: Up \u0026amp Coming. Beautiful split shot with both a perfect under and over split. A very strong favourite with all the judges and one of the best examples I have seen of this type of image for some time. Just Superb! - Martin Edge (Judge)Winner: Black \u0026amp White. It must be 11 out of 10 for this groundbreaking image. Conception, interpretation and perseverance coupled with black and white’s ability to concentrate on the key elements. It gets better with each viewing. - Peter Rowlands (Judge) Grey seals are a perennial favourite in UPY as one of the UK\u0027s star wildlife attractions. This upside-down portrait is quirky and cute and easily won the affections of the judging panel. Great to see an overseas photographer coming to the UK to show us how it\u0027s done! - Alex Mustard (Judge)Winner: Compact. This image was a very popular choice between the panel. Ideal for a split rendition. What makes this a winner for me, not withstanding the double exposure is the sympathetic balance of light \u0026amp colour connected  between the top half and bottom of the image frame. - Martin Edge (Judge)Winner: British Waters Compact. Does British ing get any better than a fun encounter with a grey seal pup? This youngster’s relaxed and curious face is captured perfectly by Martin, making us all want to be there too. - Alex Mustard (Judge)Winner: British Waters Living Together. Images tell stories but well thought out and executed ones speak volumes. This is such an example which feeds the eye with tales of the seaside on summer days, lively marine spectacles and excited human interaction. - Peter Rowlands (Judge)1545 Isles of Scilly, UKWinner: British Waters Wide Angle. Photographers often feel competition shots must be packed with new tricks to win. At UPY we always appreciate classic technique when it raises the bar of what has been done before. Rob\u0027s full technicolour wide angle scenic reveals the richness of UK seas with an elegant simplicity that is incredibly challenging to pull off in British conditions. - Alex Mustard (Judge) Winner: Wrecks. So simple yet so powerful the additional lighting of the turret and the main er perfectly positioned. This was a very strong category this year with a deserved winner and it\u0027s refreshing to read the acknowledgement to Leigh Bishop\u0027s pioneering work. - Peter Rowlands (Judge) The iconic silhouette of a seahorse is a graphically powerful picture. Here Zarina has raised that to another level with the addition of a red filter to her snooted strobe, reminiscent of a rim-lit animal at sunset. - Alex Mustard (Judge) All the judges found this to be probably the most distressing image to view but its uncompromising message must be seen by as many people as possible. - Peter Rowlands (Judge)As a subject we have seen our fair share of these colourful characters but this one shone through and the eggs almost look as if they have been inidually lit! - Peter Rowlands (Judge)Superb image with a perfect line across the split. Good exposure both above and below the water line and such an ideal subject to cap it all off. Excellent work. - Martin Edge (Judge)This is an excellent example for this category. It takes a tried and trusted angle but completely lifts it by using the fabric. It becomes more than an image a concept, a transition, a rebirth. - Peter Rowlands (Judge)2245 Isles of Scilly, UKThis image stood out on many levels. Composition, colour vibrancy and contrast combined with an unusual angle kept us coming back to it and helped it rise in the rankings with each viewing. - Peter Rowlands (Judge)Perfect control of angle, light and focus. This was always up there with all of the judges. A clear favourite just like Nick Park’s genius creations. - Peter Rowlands (Judge) I\u0027ve seen many images of eel and shrimp around Indonesia, however you have taken this two steps forward. 1) With your excellent idea to snoot the eye and 2) with your backlight on the shrimp. You can expect many photographers to practice your technique in the months to come. Congratulations for your vision. Very well thought out and executed. - Martin Edge (Judge)    It’s not what you’ve got, it’s what you do with it. The split may have been elusive but well worth the effort. This is a deceptively subtle excellent delivery. - Peter Rowlands (Judge)I have witnessed this behaviour from the surface with its high velocity \u0027testosterone and tonnage\u0027 and I remember thinking how happy I was to be in the boat. To have the presence of mind to time this shot whilst one\u0027s senses are being bombarded is heroic in my view. - Peter Rowlands (Judge) What an amazing moment. From the expression on the face of the unicornfish fleeing for its life, to the hunting pack of sharks, especially the leader with its mouth snapping open that fan out diagonally across this composition. And that is without considering what a great challenge it is to shoot these images of split second action, in the dead of night, underwater. - Alex Mustard (Judge)  There is so much energy in this image. If you look at it long enough you can begin to see just a hint of movement of all the fish around the coral. The colours are realistic and this top down shot works well.  - Martin Edge (Judge)A jaw-dropping wide angle scene with sharks, rays and mountains. A winning combination in the Up \u0026amp Coming category. - Alex Mustard (Judge)3045 Loch Long, Argyll and ButeThis is a subtle image with light and detail that are a delight to explore. The sunset, trees and underwater scene combine to create a wonderful feeling of the place. We particularly like how the composition allows the line of the shore to be continued underwater by the seaweeds.  - Alex Mustard (Judge)Photographing pike underwater is one thing but finding your own underwater artistic stamp is quite another matter. With this particular image the author has done just that! By using a slow shutter speed of 18th sec and a panning technique from right to left gives the impression of movement whilst the pike is pin sharp. - Martin Edge (Judge)Arthur’s image scores with both its foreground and background. The deadman’s fingers soft coral make an attractive foreground, enhanced by the crab sheltering within, and the striking sunbeams create beauty and atmosphere in the background. I also love the feeling of depth created by the legs of the jetty reaching up for the surface. - Alex Mustard (Judge)In recent UPY competitions UK macro images have lacked their overseas counterpart\u0027s flair and imagination but this magnificent shot raises the bar for everyone else to follow. World class from the UK at last. - Peter Rowlands (Judge)Memorable photographs of people underwater are deceptively difficult and require both the photographer and model to be at the top of their game. The simplicity of the composition works to highlight the delicious details in the girl\u0027s pose. - Alex Mustard (Judge) This is a timeless scene that communicates a detailed story. The cavern, the silversides sheltering, the tarpon hunting and the er kneeling reverentially, taking it all in. It is a fabulous use of black and white to tell this story of shadows and light. - Alex Mustard (Judge) Sometimes it is the small detail which contributes so much. The white of the eye and the row of teeth in what could be construed as a smile convey mischief and menace in equal measures. - Peter Rowlands (Judge) Once again Tobias you have succeeded in capturing one of the most photographed wrecks in the Red Sea and photographing it in a completely different way. You push the boundaries of wreck photography and I congratulate you for your vision and forward thinking of new ideas. - Martin Edge (Judge)  Perfect composition and framed against the stark black background. However it\u0027s the contrast of white on black which attracts the eye again and again every time this particular image popped up to greet us. The colour of the nudibranch was sufficiently bright enough to raise our senses again and again as it proceeded through the competition.  The soft delicate treatment of the snooted flash is also very well managed. - Martin Edge (Judge)    This shot puts you right in the picture and records a special encounter in a very special place. Every element contributes and the lucky or intended curve of the split creates great spatial depth. - Peter Rowlands (Judge) Symmetry, graphic simplicity and for once in UK waters a black background which contributes to a positive outer worldly delivery. A mould breaker. - Peter Rowlands (Judge) I see and judge many images of the sockeye salmon but this is one of the best. The alignment of the two salmon not to mention the composition within the frame.  The surgy peak of the action is in perfect symmetry with the window which provides the viewer with topside influences of the trees against a vivid blue sky. There is so much image depth in this example. - Martin Edge (Judge)    Such a delicate image yet so full of emotion. There are times when there are no more words needed. - Peter Rowlands (Judge)UPY loves seahorse photos! Especially when they capture a fleeting behaviour, such as this. But we hadn\u0027t realised during judging that this was a new species of seahorse, nor did with know the incredible backstory behind this picture, we just loved the moment. - Alex Mustard (Judge)  Whether or not you like fashion photography underwater you would be hard pressed to see a more beautiful combination of complimentary colours and a very elegant pose. A very well executed image. - Peter Rowlands (Judge)A portrait must leave you in no doubt. Simple lighting, illuminating all that is needed, captures this character. - Peter Rowlands (Judge)The footage was released on Thursday by Ningaloo Marine Interactions, the tour company which Mr Wilton works for.The hero himself suggested it was all in a day’s work.First known nursery for giant manta rays discovered in Gulf of Mexico“I’m often guiding snorkellers in the area and it’s as if she recognised me and was trusting me to help her,” he said.“She got closer and closer and then started unfurling to present the eye to me. I knew we had to get the hooks out or she would have been in big trouble. I went for a few es down to see how she’d react to me being close to her.”When the animal stayed calm, he approached and took out the hooks.The manta stayed completely still in the water,” he said.“It’s pretty incredible behaviour if this is what happened,” said David Boyle, lecturer in marine biology at the University of Plymouth. “It’s not uncommon for animals – generally mammals – to interact with ers but for one in distress to seek out assistance would be novel indeed.”Manta rays are believed to be some of the most intelligent creatures in the ocean. Unlike stingrays, they don’t have an external spike and are generally harmless to humans.Experts believe the injured eye would have become infected, leading to blindness and possible death.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It will be 50 years to the day since astronauts blasted off on the Apollo 11 mission, on their way to walk on its surface for the very first time.The lunar eclipse happens when the Earth moves between the Sun and the Moon. Any light that hits the Moon has to go through the Earth\u0027s atmosphere first, giving it a deep red tinge and making it look much darker than normal.The lunar eclipse is remarkable partly because it is easily the most accessible of the celestial sights that move across our sky. Unlike other similar events – such as solar eclipses or meteor showers – you don\u0027t need special equipment or to be anywhere particularly dark or clear, since just about everyone can see the Moon.Created with Sketch.Best NASA pictures of the month - June 2019 Show all 15Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.A coronal mass ejection as seen by the Chandra Observatory.

That will happen as evening approaches, though it will depend partly on where you are.Unfortunately, not everyone in the world will get to see it.\u0026nbspThe partial eclipse will only be visible across the UK, much of Asia, all of Africa, the eastern part of South America and the western part of Australia.Depending where you are, the eclipse will arrive at a different time in the world and will look more or less clear. In the UK for instance it will come around 9pm, but will be earlier the more east and south you are.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

And with more light coming through, this will create a new habitat and encourage new species to grow.”He added that he hoped the reintroduction of these “charismatic species” to the wood will encourage visitor to think about the issues of climate change and rewilding.“We\u0027re excited that people are starting to recognise the value of British woodland, which is often overlooked when zoos concentrate on more exotic locations such as the African savannah and rainforest.“We have a unique change to reach out to people so they can recognise the importance of our ancient woodland that remains.”Last month, the government passed a law to cut\u0026nbspgreenhouse gas emissions to net zero by 2050.One of the ways the government’s Committee on Climate Change say this target can be achieved\u0026nbspis by offsetting emissions by planting trees and creating woodland.\u0026nbsp“Ancient woodland is one of the richest habitats for wildlife in the UK, providing a home for hundreds of species of animals and plants,” explained Dr Christoph Schwitzer, chief zoological officer at Bristol Zoological Society.“In order to protect what remains, we need to inspire the next generation about the importance of this unique habitat. We believe that the best way to do this is to immerse people in these woods and show them the amazing ersity that is at stake.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It is simply not good enough for the Home Office to use public money to pass the buck to private companies, who can make millions of pounds of profit from immigration detention and visa processing.Home Office outsourcing immigration services ‘on the cheap’MPs and lawyers call for investigation into privatised visa systemChai Patel, legal director of the Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants (JCWI), said outsourcing immigration operations to ordinary people like landlords and doctors created\u0026nbspborders and ision and called for the Home Office to be rebuilt from the ground up.He added: “The Home Office habitually makes the wrong decisions in immigration cases and is forced to overturn these on appeal. These mistakes have seen large numbers of people – the Windrush generation among them -\u0026nbsplose the right to work, to rent a property, and even be detained and deported.Outsourcing immigration control to private profit\u0026nbsp making companies decreases transparency and incentivises rushed, shoddy decision making.Speaking at a parliamentary event organised by the APPG for visas and immigration last week, Mr Bolt said also questioned whether the Home Office\u0026nbsphad “the capacity to do anything about” the issues because it was “short of resource generally, meaning everything is under pressure” – likening the situation to “changing a tyre as you’re driving down the motorway”.A Home Office spokesperson said:\u0026nbsp“We are committed to delivering an immigration system that is fair and delivers value for money for the taxpayer.\u0026nbspWe work closely with all partners to make sure they provide an excellent service to all customers and that they deliver the high standards our contracts demand.“The UK has one of the most attractive visa systems in the world. Its effectiveness is shown by the fact that the vast\u0026nbspmajority of applications are processed in line with service standards.”\u0026nbspAsylum and Immigration\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The governor of the Bank of England said businesses expect they will have to cut jobs if Britain leaves the EU without a deal, as their sales go down and costs go up.There are signs the UK’s looming departure is already having an impact on hiring. Large recruitment company Hays said earlier on Tuesday that its net fees in the UK and Ireland were down 2 per cent between April and June, pulled down by a 6 per cent fall in fees for private sector placements.Evidence of a reduction in hiring and fewer vacancies\u0026nbspunderpin a less rosy outlook for wages from the National Institute of\u0026nbspEconomic\u0026nbspand Social Research (NIESR). After the official data came out, NIESR\u0026nbspforecast that growth in regular pay will stabilise at around 3.5 per cent in the third quarter.Arno Hantzsche, senior economist at NIESR, said: “Economic and political uncertainty pose a considerable risk to hiring activity and, according to our new estimates, prevent a further acceleration of earnings growth in the months ahead.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

She needed 374 votes to reach the threshold to be elected, meaning she scraped through by just nine votes.Ms Von der Leyen, who was nominated by EU leaders earlier this month,\u0026nbspis the first woman to hold the top job in Brussels. The European Commission is the union’s executive arm and is responsible for proposing EU law, enforcing its treaties, and representing the interests of the bloc as a whole on the world stage.\u0026nbspShe is due to take office on 1 November after a handover period during which her cabinet of commissioners, one from each member state, will be chosen and their portfolios allocated. She has pledged to achieve gender balance in the top team – but could face a showdown with member state governments, who may have other candidates in mind as their commissioners.The German politician’s appointment is controversial because she\u0026nbspwas not a lead\u0026nbspcandidate in the EU elections last month. The European parliament had previously said that the next commission president should have been on the ballot paper during the contest and campaigned across the EU, under the so-called “spitzenkandidat” system.New EU commission cabinet will be half women, says Juncker replacementUrsula von der Leyen: the German minister set to run the EUEU leaders back Ursula von der Leyen to be commission presidentBut a majority of\u0026nbspMEPs gave Ms Von der Leyen their backing anyway after national leaders called their bluff and proposed a candidate who was not available to vote for. She was opposed by MEPs from the green and left groups in the parliament, but supported by the centre-right and the liberals. The centre-left socialist group was split, with some countries’ parties such as the German SPD opposing the appointment and others such as Labour supporting it.“The trust you placed in me is the confidence you placed in Europe,” she told MEPs in her acceptance speech.\u0026nbsp“Your confidence in a united and a strong Europe, from east to west, from south to north. Your confidence in a Europe that is ready to fight for the future rather than fighting against each other. Your confidence in a Europe that will take the big challenges of our times together. The task ahead of us humbles me: it is a big responsibility and our work starts now.”Created with Sketch.World news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Rescuers work at the site of collapsed building in Dongri area of Mumbai, IndiaA motorist drives past a destroyed house after a large earthquake that hit Surigao City, in the southern island of Mindanao, Philippines French Gendarmes remove fences next to a burning portable toilet during clashes with protesters on the Champs Elysees avenue after the traditional Bastille Day military parade in Paris, FranceA recortador jumps over a bull during a contest in a bullring at the San Fermin festival in Pamplona, SpainJapan\u0027s Megumu Yoshida and Yukiko Inui compete in the duet technical artistic swimming event during the 2019 World Championships at Yeomju Gymnasium in GwangjuHot air balloons fly over the city of Igualada during an early flight as part of the European Balloon Festival in Igualada, Spain.

There’s no shame for me. There’s no shame for any of us,\u0027 says Mounir BaatourClick to followThe IndependentMounir Baatour’s office is cool, the steady thrum of the air conditioner offering a welcome break from the blistering summer heat that has descended upon Tunis. Past noon, little moves outside. The streets are empty and even the city’s ubiquitous cat population has slinked off to the shadows.Despite the temperature, Baatour, the first openly gay man to run for president in a Muslim country, remains focused upon the task ahead.The road leading to the November poll is unlikely to offer a smooth ride. Homosexuality itself isn’t illegal in Tunisia. However, practising it is. This distinction has allowed Baatour, a lawyer, to register the pressure group\u0026nbspShams. Along with others, the group campaigns for a repeal of the colonial French\u0026nbsplaw\u0026nbspproscribing sodomy.Likewise, legal\u0026nbsprestrictions criminalising\u0026nbsp”outrages against public decency” are often used to persecute the country’s LGBT+ population – these\u0026nbspremain firmly with the sights of Baatour and other rights campaigners. \u0026nbsp\u0026nbspOn top of this, the police force appears eager to exploit existing edicts allowing, for instance,\u0026nbspenforced anal examinations to be used as evidence of sexuality. This is buttressed by a judiciary and political establishment long practised in the art of looking the other way.Created with Sketch.Best photos from Pride 2019 around the world Show all 45Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.In February, a young man from the coastal city of Sfax received an eight month\u0026nbspsentence for engaging in homosexual acts after reporting being raped by two other men. Other stories of official abuse are legion. \u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp“I am openly gay,”\u0026nbspBaatour\u0026nbspsays. “I came out 20 years ago. I was jailed for three months for sodomy in 2013. There’s no shame for me. There’s no shame for any of us.”Baatour, his association and his relatively fringe Liberal party are children of Tunisia’s revolution. In the years immediately following 2011, a number of gay rights groups emerged, led by Baatour’s own Shams, calling for a repeal of\u0026nbspanti-homosexual laws.However, even here, Shams’ tactics have given rise to ision, with the Tunisian Coalition for LGBT Rights issuing a statement\u0026nbsplast year distancing themselves from Shams and its president, a schism Baatour attributes to his openness to potentially normalising relations with Israel, a suggestion considered anathema to many on Tunisia’s left.Perhaps ironically, the same period during which many of these groups arose also witnessed an explosion in Islamism across Tunisia, with the moderate Islamist Ennahda party vying with the radical\u0026nbspAnsar al-Sharia\u0026nbspfor the political souls of Tunisia’s religious majority.When you put gay people in jail for three years, what, do they come out straight? No\u0026nbspAnsar\u0026nbspal-Sharia was outlawed in 2013, and support for Ennahda appears to have ebbed since the groundswell of popular support that saw them achieve a plurality vote in the country’s first free elections in 2011.But across many sections of Tunisian society, values typically bend towards the traditional. In August, conservative demonstrators of both genders took to the street to protest a\u0026nbsppresidentially mandated report\u0026nbspurging greater inidual freedoms and equality across the genders. \u0026nbspAs far as homosexuality is concerned, those conservative sentiments cut deeper. A June 2019 survey by the polling institute Arab Barometer reported that just 7 per cent of Tunisians condoned homosexuality. It’s a sentiment reflected within the rhetoric of some of Baatour’s populist rivals for the presidency. Law professor Kais Saied\u0026nbspis\u0026nbspa close second in the polls – he has\u0026nbspsuggested\u0026nbspthat encouraging the spread of homosexuality within the country is a foreign plot. \u0026nbsp \u0026nbsp \u0026nbspAlleged rape victim imprisoned for homosexual acts by Tunisian court“I think we need to have a debate about homosexuality in Tunisia,” says Baatour, who identifies as Muslim but doesn’t practise.“I’m not talking about promoting homosexuality, just about decriminalising it. Gay people don’t do anyone any harm. They should be free to do what they want with their bodies. If, as Kais Saied has said, homosexuality is a sickness, then – even if I accept that – I have to ask, why are you putting sick people in jail?“When you put gay people in jail for three years, what, do they come out straight? No. So they must return to jail for a further three years and then for the rest of their lives.”Though what Baatour is proposing might seem radical, it is not without precedent. In arguing his case, Baatour points to the country’s first post-independence president, Habib Bourguiba, who in 1956 introduced landmark laws outlawing polygamy and introducing a code of women’s rights that stands to this day.LGBT activists arrested at unauthorised pride march in Cuba“All of that at the time was controversial, a lot of people said it was against Islam. However, Bourguiba had the political will to impose it. In 1956, Tunisia was more conservative than it is now, but people came to accept it and still do.” \u0026nbspHowever, while accepting that much of the attention on him focuses upon his stance on LGBT+ rights, Baatour is keen to stress that his candidacy is about more.He wants to address many of Tunisia’s underlying ills, from the state enterprises that continue to haemorrhage money, to the vast scale of the country’s informal economy, to the environment, which remains a priority.But above all, he says, is his commitment to promoting civil liberties and the rights of the inidual.Whether or not he is successful remains to be seen. However, for Baatour, the fight alone is worthwhile. If anything, he says, his campaign forces the other candidates to address the lack of progress on civil liberties and inidual rights within Tunisia.Baatour leans forward, “I will place this at the very heart of my campaign.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Most of them answered the question honestly but had a decent dig at each other as they went.All in all, a very entertaining debate filled with fun # and some news too.In just a week’s time we will know which of these two men will be your next Prime Minister.Thanks to everyone for watching, and our fantastic readers for sending in their questions.We’ll have all the reaction from outside Sun Towers to the debate coming up.And on talkRADIO Ross Kempsell will have all the analysis of the last hour’s debate.And now it’s time for our quick-fire round of questions, to finish off the debate.# climate change target of net zero emissions by  keep it  Boris: YesHunt:Yes# continue to freeze fuel duty, like the last  years Boris: Not making any more spending commitments.

One Lord was described as a “notorious bullying pervert” by a Westminster worker.The verdict was that the prevailing culture and behaviour in the House of Lords “has not been conducive to an open and supportive culture to ensure all those working there are treated with dignity and respect”.Worse, the report concluded those staff on the receiving end of bullying and harassment generally did not complain because they thought nothing would change, or feared reprisal.Clearly, the House of Lords has issues. But it’s nowhere near as bad as the House of Commons. The second report, by Gemma White QC into inappropriate conduct in Westminster, concluded MPs’ staff face “unacceptable risk of bullying and harassment”.It found sexual harassment in Parliament is seen by young staff as a “necessary evil”they want to progress. Witnesses describe speaking out against any abuse as “career suicide”.Even though both reports state only a small minority of MPs or Lords behave in unacceptable ways, this has been tolerated for too long and shining a light on it will bring about change.What’s clear to me, both from reading the report and working at the House of Lords, is that this is a generational issue. The House of Lords is full of older people stuck in a time warp.Many of them live in a world where it’s still acceptable for women — often females of a lower status to them — to be patted on the bottom or on the head.The House of Lords can feel a bit like a boys’ boarding school, or Hogwarts. It’s populated predominantly by old white men, many of whom lead a le insulated from the real world.That said, the worst behaviour I witness is usually in the library, where Lords often retire after lunch and which rings with the sound of ear-deafening snoring and, I am sorry to say, farting.The only time I’ve ever seen anyone being actively rude was when one Lord commanded a member of canteen staff to get him a bag of crisps. He was so close he could have reached out and got it himself.I’ve also been on the receiving end of the odd condescending comment, such as when a Lord looked me up and down and said: “You’re dressed rather casually.” I was wearing Stella McCartney trousers at the time, so not exactly jeans.Crucially, though, I wasn’t wearing a dress. So I looked him up and down and said: “Dressing casually is better than dressing badly” — and that was the end of that.It must be horrible to work in an organisation where you feel inferior and can’t speak your mind — and,you do, people either shrug or shut you down. The report about the House of Lords suggested it should be mandatory for all employees to go on a “how to value people” course. Some people might see it as unnecessary — but we send West Ham staff on them and they are good.But that’s not the only change required. There’s neither enough women, nor cultural ersity. The only way that will change is by electing a more erse chamber.In the meantime, I hope this report does not diminish, in people’s minds, the important legislation work the House of Lords does and the role it plays in holding the Commons to account. I hope these reports don’t stop people from remembering what an important institution it is.As Spider-Man said: “With great power comes great responsibility” — and as one who sits in the House of Lords, I know I am not the only one who feels it is a great responsibility.BIG news. MPs have voted to make same-sex marriage legal in Northern Ireland.By a massive margin of  to , the House of Commons backed an amendment demanding the province be brought into line with the rest of the country by October  . . . unless Stormont s and decides otherwise.

Those results came after MPs hijacked a Government Bill in a bid to force through the changes.The DUP has accused them of abusing the impasse at Stormont to impose Westminster’s will. So not everyone is happy with the news.But it’s a big “Hooray!” from me that this kind of right-minded thinking now applies to the whole UK.

Leaving your bride-to-be for the wedding planner is NOT a good look.The only consolation – though Donna might not see it quite yet – is that she is almost certainly better off without him.WHEN I heard a Hull mum had called two of her children Jackdaniel and Tiamarie, all I could think was, “poor kids”.But mum Sarah Mennell insists they aren’t named after booze, as she prefers tea.

Pundits give him an agonising  days from next Tuesday to honour that promise.In fact, we will know in an instantBrexit — and Boris — will live or die.The moment will come, perhaps on his first day, as he names the man or woman to prise the Treasury from the cold, dead hands of Chancellor Philip Hammond.If Boris picks Sajid Javid, Matt Hancock or Liz Truss — or anyone  who voted Remain — .million Brits can kiss goodbye to their dream of leaving the European Union.We will end up with a just another bodged version of Theresa May’s BRINO sell-out — Brexit in Name Only. It will be the beginning and the end of King BoJo the First.There will be no second chances. The next Chancellor of the Exchequer must be a proven Brexiteer in word and deedBoris has a chance of surviving his  days.The Treasury is the most powerful and implacable enemy of Brexit. “The new Chancellor needs three key qualities,” says a source close to Boris.“They must have a Brexit pedigree, absolute loyalty to Boris and the intellectual self-confidence to take on Whitehall and the Treasury.”Qualities such as these are scarce in the present Cabinet. The final choice is likely to surprise everyone, especially Remainers.Some names mentioned to me would, to say the least, offer a bracing challenge to pro-EU establishment fanatics who spent the past three years sabotaging the  referendum.Unless the new Chancellor takes them head-on, those forces will crush both Boris and Brexit. Observers have identied the tank traps and sniper nests facing the new PM.He is up against a Remain-dominated Parliament aided by slippery Speaker Bercow, an army of civil service mandarins skilled in the machinery of government and covering fire from BBC propagandists.In the face of such overwhelming odds, a pro-Leave PM is surely doomed to fail. Not so. Despite appearances, Boris has a plan.He will fly immediately to Brussels with a genuine bid to reopen Theresa May’s botched withdrawal agreement.He would seek a clear path out of the EU customs union, single market and European Court jurisdiction, plus a sensible solution to the Northern Ireland border issue.The alternative will be for Britain to leave the EU on October  with No Deal. Unless much has changed, Brussels will say: “Non!” Boris will announce he has no option but to call a snap “No Deal” election.Remainers are appalled at the idea, and for good reason. Poll after poll suggests No Deal Boris would win with an outright majority — at their expense.The public is sick to the back teeth with Theresa May’s dreary defeatism and Brussels’ bullying. Remain voters want this sorted, too.Elections are always risky. But a Tory Party still dithering and paralysed on the biggest issue of the age is the greatest risk of all. Right now, the omens are promising. Labour is committing ritual suicide, shedding voters in droves.Millions of Tory defectors would flock back to a party committed to a final, irreversible Brexit taking us past the October  dead-line and sucking support from Nigel Farage and his Brexit Party.In the intervening weeks, a Boris regime could recruit voters abandoned by both major parties over crime, low pay, high taxes and housing.According to the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, blue- collar voters on less than £, a year, are “up for grabs like never before”.If Boris Johnson has one proven gt, it is for winning against the odds. In fact, despite gloom-mongers, the odds could not be better.To quote Boris, there is an appetite among voters for optimism . . .  stepping off the “hamster wheel of doom”.

It has threatened journalists, too, that they face prosecutionthey dare to publish the content of the cables.Trying to justy his threats, the Met’s Assistant Commissioner, Neil Basu, said he was sure the leaks had “damaged UK international relations” and on that basis no one publishing the leaks could plead a public interest defence.What a ludicrous over-reaction to what is really no more than a diplomatic spat over the Ferrero Rochers.Sure, it doesn’t exactly help UK US relations when our Ambassador calls the President of the United States “inept” and his administration “uniquely dysal”.But I would say it is mildly less damaging than some of the things that the Leader of Opposition, the Mayor of London and Scotland’s First Minister have said about Donald Trump. I can’t see Mr Basu dangling his handcuffs in front of them — and neither should he.Obviously, Sir Kim has reason to feel aggrieved that someone — presumably in the diplomatic service or the Foreign Office, because there is no evidence of computers being hacked — has leaked information he intended to be private. But it is a matter for the Government to investigate, not the police.How ridiculous Basu has said of the leaker: “You are now also responsible for erting busy detectives from under-taking their core mission.”No, Mr Basu — it is only thanks to your decision that officers have been taken off front-line duties to undertake this investigation.You could have told officials what police officers are forever telling the rest of us when we report our houses broken into or our bikes stolen: Sorry, but we’ve got too much  to do.It would be a dferent mattersomeone had leaked material that really did harm national security.The sort of information leaked by Kim Philby and his Soviet-sympathising accomplices in the s put British lives at risk.But leaking and publishing a diplomat’s private thoughts hardly comes into that category. Mr Basu’s attack on the principles of the free Press echoes Operation Elveden, the failed attempt by the Met to criminalise journalists who had obtained information from police officers, in some cases for money.The Met switched more than  police officers from other duties and arrested  people. The police probe cost taxpayers £.million and yet of  journalists charged, only one was convicted at trial — and that was quashed on appeal. Just one journalist, Dan Evans, pleaded guilty to an Elveden offence and was given a suspended sentence.The prosecutions relied on an ancient offence, Misconduct in Public Office, which was only ever supposed to apply to public servants, not journalists.As many lawyers, including the Lord Chief Justice, pointed out, it simply isn’t a criminal offence for someone to receive or to publish most forms of state information — only for a public official to sell it.There is a very good reason for this. Leaks, and the freedom to put their contents into the public domain, are an essential ingredient of our democracy. It is what helps the Press to keep in check corrupt or over-bearing politicians and public officials.Without the freedom to publish leaked information, for example, we would never have known the extent to which MPs and Lords were abusing their expenses regime.That required a newspaper to publish information gleaned from a computer disk which had been stolen — but thankfully in that case the Met decided that the public interest over-rode a possible offence of handling stolen goods.Without the Panama Papers we would never have known the extent to which wealthy iniduals and corporations have gone into keeping their wealth out of the taxman’s grasp. Without the “climategate” leaks we would not have known how some climate scientists were prepared to manipulate past temperature records to support their theories.It took a leak, too, to establish that the Blair government knew it was unlikely that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction, but that George W Bush had resolved to overthrow Saddam regardless.Then there was “Plebgate”, when a leaked police log revealed a bust-up between government chief whip Andrew Mitchell and police manning the gates at Downing Street — and led an officer to be jailed when it was revealed he had invented his witness statement.There are, of course, plenty of other countries in the world where journalists would be locked up for publishing information that has leaked from the government, but they are not countries in which most of us would want to live.By over-reacting to what is an embarrassment to the Foreign Office, the Met has taken a leaf out of the book of President Erdogan of Turkey, who has locked up dozens of journalists as he attempts to suppress all opposition to his regime.Neil Basu and other senior Met Police officers should back off and accept that the Press is quite within its rights to publish leaked information that does not threaten national security.We are, after all, one of the world’s oldest ing democracies — not a tinpot state where people get led off in chains for daring to reveal the truth. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Unlike the cells in the womb that leave the body as a period, this blood has no way to escape.That can lead to infertility, fatigue, bowel and bladder problems, as well as really heavy, painful periods.It affects one in ten women in the UK.Symptoms include:The cause of endometriosis is unknown and there is no definite cure.According to Endometriosis UK, it takes over seven years on average for women to finally receive a diagnosis.Its estimated that up to  per cent of infertile women has the condition.Source: Endometriosis UKThe immune cells help the lesions grow and also drive the development of their blood supply.More recent research has also revealed that macrophages help nerves grow in the lesions.The aim of the new study, published in a recent Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology Journal paper, was to determine the mechanistic role of macrophages in producing pain associated with endometriosis.Senior study author Dr Erin Greaves, who holds positions at both universities, explained that conventional treatments that use hormones are not ideal because they target oianand can trigger side effects, such as suppressing fertility.She added: We are trying to find non-hormonal solutions.The team found that disease-modied macrophages stimulate nerve cell growth and activity by releasing the growth hormone insulin-like growth factor- .They also found that levels of IGF- in pelvic cavity tissue from women with endometriosis were higher than in women without the condition and were in line with their pain scores.Further tests revealed that preventing the hormones activity by blocking the cell receptor for IGF-, reverses the pain behaviour observed in mice with endometriosis.Dr Greaves added: If we can learn about the role of macrophages in endometriosis then we can distinguish them from healthy macrophages and target treatment to them."},{"url":null,"title":"latina border patrol officer internet looks fans crazy","story":"The woman, identied as Kiara Cervantes of Texas, was providing security for Vice President Mike Pence on a visit to the US border with Mexico when she photographed herself standing outside a holding cell.“Holy s–t…I think I’m coming down with a case of undocumentation,” wrote @VibeHi on Twitter, who was one of countless users to share the BPD agent’s photo on Monday, along with a video she posted.“#IceBae could detain me for however long she wants,” another said.A Twitter account purportedly belonging to the woman surfaced early on Monday and identied her as Kiara Cervantes of Texas.A tweet from the account read: Soooo it’s crazy.... but here I am.I’m hearing something about a viral picture.I would like to say i was just doing my job.. providing security for the visit of @VP.It was an honor and I take a lot of pride in my job!A video was posted later in the afternoon claiming the page was authentic.“Just woke up … saw that I needed to make a video so y’all could believe that it’s me,” said the woman in the video.“It’s me.

Well, he didn’t deny it.The interview appeared the following day and shortly afterwards the figure went global when the US-based National Enquirer ran with it.Julio, who is charm personied, made no complaint when his legendary Lothario-ism went stratospheric, though many years later he mitigated to another interviewer who broached the subject: “Me, I don’t have numbers. I respect women very much.”Like Mick Jagger, who is said to have bedded around , women, the Spanish crooner joined the ranks of Warren Beatty, Errol Flynn, Jack Nicholson and the notorious lover Casanova as one of history’s great seducers.Back then, such, ahem, swordsmanship was admired.

Thats near impossible to define.All I know is that us Brits are a complicated bunch, butyou peel back a few layers, we’re just like everyone  – just with an added dash of self-deprecation and sarcasm."},{"url":null,"title":"tragic mum rebecca tollan 23 final selfie","story":"Rebecca Tollan, , shared the tragic picture on social media just  days after giving birth to a baby boy.Posting the image on Facebook hours before she died, Rebecca said: “The maw is oooot x.”The mum from Motherwell, North Lanarkshire, was celebrating being out with pals on Sunday night after giving birth on June .But she was later found dead at a flat in Bellshill in the early hours of Monday morning after falling ill.Her cause of death has not yet been confirmed, but it is feared she may have suffered a suspected drugs overdose.Two men, aged  and , who were also in the house at the time were taken to hospital but their conditions are not thought to be le-threatening.We told earlier how Rebecca died less than three weeks after giving birth to a baby boy, named Carter.She shared a number of social media posts announcing the tot’s arrival.Heartbroken friends and family have been paying tribute to the young mum, with pal Rachel Bell posting: Just seems to be heartbreak after heartbreak recently.Cant quite get my head around it.

Kim Leadbeater who runs More in Common in her sister’s memory, said there was a “real brief moment in time when politicians said all the right things and said that things would change” after the shocking death of Jo in . But she warned that since then things had got “worse and worse” with a more and more ision then ever in the country and more poisonous language. She said: “If you watch parliament TV which I do regularly and I look at Jo’s plaque which is above where she sat and it talks about having ‘more in common’ and I see some of the behaviour in parliament and quite frankly it disgusts me.” But rather than blaming politicians she urged iniduals to step up and start bridging the ides themselves.     Kim said: “We shouldn’t be afraid of robust discussion and debate - that is one of the cornerstones of living in our fantastic country. We have to do that respectfully and we have to be prepared to listen.” She launched what she called a “call to action” telling the event “go out tonight and find someone you disagree with and sit down and have a really important conversation.” “Use kind language, use compassionate language use language of understanding not language of anger and hate because that’s just not helpful.” Kim said: “I’m still a long way from understanding what happened on that day and what’s happened to our family as a result.”    “I think back and I think ‘how can we live in a country where a woman like Jo who had all the goodness in her, is murdered ’ and it’s made me do some really deep soul searching into the kind of country that we have and the kind of country we want to live in.” She works to bring people together through the Jo Cox foundation, Great Get Together and More in Common Batley and Spen. She was speaking at a Britain Talks event hosted by the Mirror’s parent company, Reach” in Parliament alongside Labour MPs Lisa Nandy and Stephen Kinnock, Tory MP John Hayes, Mirror editor Alison Phillips and Sunday Express political editor David Maddox. The event was co-hosted with theAll PartyParliamentary Group on Bringing the Country Together Post-Brexit, and with My Le My Say, a youth democracy organisation. Retired nurse Ada Pratt from Rochdale, who has taken part in one of the Britain Talks conversations with Remainer Jon, said: “It’s very easy to blame everybody  blame the politicians, blame next door, blame everybody  but everybody needs to get off their backside and do something and it’s only by everyone pulling together old, young, black, white whatever that anything will ever be done.” Lisa Nandy said: “Ive been the MP for Wigan for  years and in that ten years I’ve basically spent half my time in Westminster and half my time in London and when I step off the train at each end it feels like I’m stepping into dferent worlds. “ Brexit wasn’t the cause of it, it’s been coming for a really long time but my God did Brexit blow apart that increasing ision, that polarisation in this country and I’ve seen a hardening of those attitudes over the last few years largely I think because of the lack of political leadership from anywhere across the political spectrum. “But I also feel that we’ve become part of the problem.

When we met a few weeks ago, I asked you to ban imports of hunting trophies. You declined.You claimed trophy hunting could be good for conservation. This is the absurd argument peddled by the trophy hunting industry.They will doubtless now lobby you furiously following your article.Don’t listen to their lies. Trophy hunters are not conservationists.They are people who kill animals for fun. They then make up excuses to try and justy their so-called ‘sport’. If trophy hunting was good for conservation, why have lion populations fallen from , in the s to just , today  Why have elephant numbers fallen from over  million in the s to just , today  Why are rhinos, cheetahs, leopards, hippos and giraffes ALL in serious trouble     Trophy hunters kill huge numbers of endangered animals every year, and – incredibly - this government lets them. You have to get an import permit from the government before going off to Africa to shoot one of them. Britain lets its trophy hunters shoot cheetahs. Even the Trump administration doesn’t allow that. We’re one of the worst countries in the world for hunting elephants. We’re also one of the worst when it comes to ‘canned lion hunting’. This is the disgusting practice of breeding lions in factory farms so that cowards can shoot them in enclosures. British values are all about fairness. There is NOTHING fair about shooting a tame lion in a cage. But don’t just ban canned lion trophies. We need to ban ALL wildle trophies. British hunters are shooting hippos, leopards, zebras, bears, baboons, and even monkeys. And the number of animals shot is climbing. What sort of legacy are we leaving our children     Britain is a signatory to CITES, the international law that prohibits trade in endangered wildle. But CITES says its rules don’t apply to trophy hunting. Why  Because apparently trophy hunting is not a ‘commercial’ industry. How is an industry worth  million not commercial  Trophy hunters can pay up to £, for their sick expeditions! You have rightly condemned poaching. We need to condemn trophy hunting too.When you poach a rhino, you kill it and take its body parts. When you trophy hunt a rhino, you do the same.The poacher sells the horn to make money. The trophy hunter sticks the rhino head over his fireplace.   It doesn’t matter what we label the killer. The fact is the rhino is dead. Michael, you worked hard to bring in the Ivory Bill. You introduced tougher sentences for animal cruelty. You have a chance right now to leave a lasting legacy.

The June  referendum did not create these isions - but Brexit has hardened the ides to the point where we are now a tribal society, with families communities, towns and cities riven, defined and stamped with one of two labels: ‘Remain’ or ‘Leave’. Remember the days when hardly anyone ever talked about Europe, when politics was about jobs, the NHS, social care, housing, transport and schools  Well, those days are gone, for now at least. A recent survey found that half the population identies with a religion and just under two-thirds feels attachment to a political party, yet % identy as a Remainer or Leaver - that’s % more than voted in the referendum.    The story of the last three years is the story of how a fringe issue has become the principal social ision of our times. Listening has been swept away by shouting, persuasion has been replaced by protest and co-operation, compromise and consensus have given way to conflict. We cannot go on like this. We’re in serious danger of tipping over into a culture war, and so we have to find a way of bringing some cohesion and common sense back into our politics.

Hospice volunteer Joanne Humphreys, , and her husband, Kevin, , spent nearly £, on a ten-night stay at The Holiday Village Montenegro.    They were accompanied on the trip by their children, Louis, , and Beth, , and the kids’ godparents. They say things went from bad to worse throughout the holiday - and the family were left in state of shock after seeing the state of their hotel room. Joanne and Kevin went into their local TUI store in Basildon, Essex, where they were recommended a brand new, all-inclusive -star hotel that boasted four restaurants and spa facilities. The couple parted with their money in exchange for a deluxe family suite at a complex which was being built as they booked.    “It looked amazing and the TUI store staff spoke so highly of the hotel, Joanne said. We were all really looking forward to it, especially our children. It had everything we’d want in a holiday bars, restaurants, a spa, gym and adult only pool areas. We thought TUI was a reputable company so we trusted everything would be as they described. To say it was a nightmare would be an understatement.” The hotel was due to open at the end of May this year and the family were arriving on June . Joanne said she became concerned that the hotel would not be finished in time for their arrival after doing research online. TUI customer care discussed her worries and assured her everything would be fine.    She said: “Our fears subsided until a couple of weeks before we were due to arrive, when I was informed that while the hotel would be completed, some of the facilities originally on offer were no longer going to be available such as the spa, hairdressers, the gym and the waterslides.This led me to look on social media. There was a Facebook page full of people complaining how bad it actually was and that the resort wasn’t anywhere near finished.People were cancelling their holidays left, right and centre. We made our way back to the TUI shop to bring this to their attention but they insisted everything was on schedule and it would be fine when we got there.” The couple knew that the children and their grandparents were really looking forward to the trip, so they hoped for the best. The family arrived in Montenegro, only to be met by their worst fears, they say.    Joanne said: “We stepped off the transfer bus to be greeted by the stench of sewage and building noise. The closer we got to the resort reception, the more we saw construction workers walking around with wheelbarrows. TUI reps met us at reception and we were taken to what was supposed to be a deluxe suite. On the way, we came across half complete stairs, loose paving slabs and dust everywhere. The first thing we saw when they opened the door was half eaten toast on the side and a bed that hadn’t been made. It was a sight for sore eyes. We went back to reception to explain the situation to the manager. We were tired from travelling all day and the whole thing was a mess. We were taken to ious other rooms which were not at all suitable for us or what we had paid for. In the end, we were told to wait while they cleaned the room we were first taken to.” And things continued to get worse, according to the family.  Joanne even claims that the shower head fell off while in the shower, supposedly hitting her foot and injuring her toe. “Everything kept falling apart, she said. The soap dispenser in the shower was not fully secured and kept coming off and the shower floor tiles were uneven. It was a disaster waiting to happen.” “We got to the point where there wasn’t a single day where something hadn’t gone wrong. The bedroom door didn’t close properly and on a few occasions, the safe would not open before we were due to go out. The key cards to our room were faulty and almost every night we had to go to reception to get this rectied”, she said. According to Joanna, the door handle to their room came off one evening and left her with bruising and cutting. The family claims the rest of the resort was full of hazardous conditions.  Joanne said: “It was very messy and noisy and not only ruined the ambiance of a relaxing holiday with lots of dust, but it was a health and safety hazard, especially for holiday makers walking around barefoot.  TUI told Joanne and Kevin that there would be a buffet restaurant and three a la carte restaurants available for unlimited visits, But they say they were told by their rep that only the buffet restaurant was available as the other restaurants weren’t fully ing. The Italian restaurant opened halfway through their holiday but the family was unable to ever get a table. “Again, it was not what was promised but we had no choice but to just put up with it, Joanne said. In actual fact, the buffet was extremely poor with very limited choice. There was raw food being served which made both myself and my daughter poorly.” After a number of complaints were made about the food hygiene, microwaves were put out for holiday makers to warm up their own foodit wasnapost fully cooked or had gone cold, claims Joanne. She added: In  years of going on adult holidays, I’ve never complained but we were at reception every single day complaining to the TUI reps. The maintenance worker must’ve been run off his feet with the amount of problems there were.

However, she told Yahooaposs Royal Box podcast that some are fed up with the monarchyaposs silence in response to stories about the Duchess of Sussex.   She said : Overall, Americans - I’m generalising a little bit - but they love the royal family.The love affair truly started with Diana. With Meghan in there they’re very proud - it’s one of their own behind palace walls. There is a sense, however, they feel that the Royal Family hasn’t done enough to protect Meghan. And that is a theme that is developing.    She continued: They find it hard to understand the Royal Family’s philosophy of ‘we don’t say anything because all that does is perpetuate the story’. There’s a sense there that she’s been under attack and that someone should have stood up and defended her.But the thing is - let’s say Prince Charles did come out and say something. It would fuel the story more and more and more."},{"url":null,"title":"more one six shops standing","story":"NewsMore than ONE in SIX shops are standing empty in town centresAccording to new research by business advisory group Duff  Phelps, more than , shops are emptyShareCommentsByGraham HiscottHead of Business:,  JUL Updated:,  JUL NewsThe Mirror has been highlighting the plight of our town centres \"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailMore than one in six shops are standing empty or boarded up, according to new research.

More than , people have shared the post in the last two days alone and itaposs received more than , comments, reports Manchester Evening News.    Among those to comment was Kay Lunnon, who said: Why can’t they just have it the same price all year round so it is more affordable for someone in the peak season too  I get that they have more staff to pay and more activities but surely it’s still the same number of accommodation that they rent out so why should it be double the price  It’s not fair as parents want to be able to take their children away but the prices are too extreme for some families. If they made it the same price all year round so that the off peak was slightly higher than it is now and peak is slightly less then it’s fair for everyone.  Sandra Phillips said: Just an absolute rip off, there is no justication for doing this, just pure greed, this should be tackled, terribly unfair for people who actually can’t take their kids out of school. Others called for greater regulation of holiday companies to prevent such price hikes, like Jayne Foxwell, who said: You may complain about the school holiday prices being extortionate but actually,government had better regulation of the holiday companies we may see a fairer system. Iaposve worked for a holiday company and now work in a school so Iaposve seen both sides of this coin. By the way, schools do not fine, the council processes them, so in turn this means the government. The very ones who are not making things fairer for families.  And some were eager to stress the number of teachers and school staff, who also struggle to afford holidays at peak times. Averil Hudson said: I think itaposs so unfair. And also for the teachers and their families, not like they can take time off either. I wish something could be done about this, like a cap put on it or something. The Manchester Evening News did its own search of the Center Parcs website to compare the prices of breaks at the nearest site in Whinfell Forest. It showed a similar price hike - costing £, for a four-night midweek break in August, compared with £ for the same accommodation in September.

The rare eclipse will reach its height at around .pm, the Royal Astronomical Societysaid. The stunning show will last more than five hours, ending at around .am, when the moon moves away from the Earthaposs lighter shadow. The redness will be caused by sunlight passing through the planetaposs atmosphere.    It happens when the Earth passes between the sun and the moon - which causes a large shadow to form. The eclipse comes  years to the day after the Apollo  mission blasted off from Florida. Four days later Neil Armstrong became the first man to set foot on the moon. Clear skies are expected, meaning the eclipse should be visible across most of the country. Experts say it is safe to observe the lunar eclipse with the naked eye.    Stronger atmospheric scattering of blue light means that the light that reaches the lunar surface is predominantly red in colour. So for observers on Earth, the eclipsed part of the Moon may be brick-coloured, rusty, blood red, or sometimes dark grey, depending on terrestrial conditions. For this reason, the lunar eclipse is often described as a Blood Moon - or in the case of a partial lunar eclipse, a Half-Blood Moon.

The man was rushed to hospital after the horric injuries which left his thumb, little finger, the tip of his index finger and a large chunk of his palm ripped off. He was reportedly operating a huge press which is used to condense plastic waste in to a cube in Samut Prakan, central Thailand, when the accident occurred. Doctors managed to piece the patientaposs hand back together in a -hour-long operation which involved the re-attachment of bone, ligaments, blood vessels and nerves.  Doctors were unable to reattach the tip of his index finger due to an embolism. Dr Wichit Siritattamrong, an orthopedic hand and reconstructive microvascular surgeon, revealed details of the surgery, which happened around three years ago, as he discussed some of his career highlights on Thursday. He said the patient initially was not happy with the result and asked him: Why didnapost you attach my index finger   Dr Siritattamrong continued: It upset me a little bit when the patient asked me about his index finger. Then I showed him the picture of his hand before the surgery and he realised how lucky he is to be able to use his hand again. After that he was grateful to all the team who had just saved him from being handicapped. The miracle surgery has meant the man has been able to use his hand and has had no complications since.

The Malaysian Airlines jet, which was travelling from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing, vanished without a trace on March , . To date several few pieces of the plane have been recovered off the coast of East Africa but none of its  passengers and flight crew have ever been found. There are multiple theories on what happened the plane - but now one man has highlighted something he believes could lead investigators to the cause of the disappearance. Ghyslain Wattrelos lost his we and two kids on the jet and believes there are a number strange findings surrounding the flightaposs cargo. He claims the new details were revealed in a new report from investigators. He told La Parisien: aposIt was also learned that a mysterious load of kg had been added to the flight list after take-off.    A container was also overloaded, without anyone knowing why. The expert draws no conclusion. It may be incompetence or manipulation. Everything is possible. This will be part of the questions for Malaysians. The startling claims add more credibility to the theory the flight was hijacked by a stowaway. The claims com after a conspiracy theorist claimed the plane was hijacked by Russian operatives who cut the on board air supply while wearing oxygen masks. Jeff Wise believes that the Russians then flew the plane to Kazakhstan as part of a plot to ert attention from the annexation of Crimea. In his explosive new book Mr Wise claims that that the planeaposs Satellite Data Unitwas tampered with. Mr Wise believes that his theory is backed up by the SDU being rebooted at ..    In one chapter the aviation pilot imagines the last moments of MHaposs pilots as they realise that their oxygen has been cut off: “The co-pilot and captain reach for their masks, but no air is flowing. What the hell is going on  Nothing’s working. “The co-pilot dials up the emergency frequency for Lumpur Radio. Nothing. The sat phone is dead, too. All of it. They’ve been cut off. “The air in the cockpit is noticeably thin. The captain feels like he’s sucking air. A desperate idea forms: the E E bay. “Something must be wrong in the E E bay. He rises, stumbles, throws open the cockpit door. “Two burly men wearing breathing apparatus block the way. He falls to his knees and passes out.” "},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/07/5d2d8435f22467.84122391-126x84.jpg class=attachment-small size-small wp-post-image ","title":"brechin city on the lookout for club historian in unique new role at glebe park","story":"Brechin City FC#s board are looking for a club historian to help catalogue the highlights of the side#s  years in existence.It is understood the volunteer role will include collating and digitising relevant parts of the club#s history, since Brechin Harp and Brechin Hearts merged in  to form Brechin City.The club moved to Glebe Park, famous for its hedge which faces the main stand, in .A statement on the Brechin City Facebook page said: #In a first-time club initiative, we invite interested iniduals to take on and develop a brand new role within Brechin City FC.#The Club is looking to join an ever expanding list of SPFL clubs who already have a Club Historian in place.#This person will lead on the collation of the signicant number of historic club artefacts we already have and continue to be offered.#Part of the role will be to use this to build the Brechin City FC history, work with club colleagues to digitise this, and act as a primary point of contact for enquiries of this nature.##Notications of interest for this unique volunteer role should be made to secretary@brechincityfc#"},{"url":null,"title":"times-past-memories-of-happy-days-gone-by-in-glasgow","story":"Images from the archives of the Herald and Evening Times."},{"url":null,"title":"irn-bru-cancel-noel-gallagher-branded-scotland-third-world-country-lewis-capaldi-spat","story":"Irn-Bru have CANCELLED Oasis legend Noel Gallagher after the singer took another pop at Lewis Capaldi in the pairs bizarre rivalry."},{"url":null,"title":"times-past-recognise-old-pictures-glasgow","story":"Images from the archives of the Herald and Times Group."},{"url":null,"title":"s-syndrome-no-barrier-teen-wants-make-difference","story":"HER bright smile is a familiar welcome to those visiting the Beatson Cafe."},{"url":null,"title":"m74-works-take-place-raith-10-days","story":"MOTORISTS are being warned to expect severe delays on the M for around ten days as essential works are carried out."},{"url":null,"title":"skunk-anansie-singer-skin-39-good-art-not-come-perfect-places-39","story":"THEY were the original British rock band from London - and  years later, Skunk Anansie are still in demand.

Apart from the cones on the street, we never had any issues with bad parking or disturbance from people attending the event.ldquoI could hear some music on the evenings but I liked the atmosphere and it certainly wasnrsquot a nuisance. We did attend the family ride on the Sunday, and while there was plenty of mud, I thought theyrsquod done a great job creating such a big event in its first year in Innerleithen.With the proposed plans to redevelop the old mill to create the Mountain Bike Innovation Centre, Tom added: ldquoI think its exciting times to be a resident in Innerleithen and I hope events like these continue to grow and do well here.ldquoI remember when Innerleithen was a poor cousin to Peebles and Glentress as an MTB and tourist destination, and I think itrsquos the hard work of local people who have brought Innerleithen to the fore. Most people are excited about the prospects and possible future developments here, and Irsquod hate people to get the wrong impression of the overall community support based on the reported views of a few people who were disturbed in the eventrsquos first year.ldquoHaving said that, I hope the organisers take on board the negative feedback and incorporate improvements into any future events. I know they were in touch with the community council earlier this year before the event, hopefully theyrsquoll keep up this close relationshipthey come back.Meanwhile, Allan Graham who has lived in the town all of his le said without events such as Transcend, the Innerleithen community has nothing.He added: ldquoThe mills have all gone and what we have is biking, walkers etc. Letrsquos embrace whatrsquos coming to us and make the most of it.Jamie Birks echoed this sentiment adding: ldquoThe town has a real and deserved opportunity to be a national hub for outdoor events such as this. So much talent and experience from so many organisations, coupled with truly amazing natural resources that could make such a positive impact on the town ndashwe all want it.Innerleithen Community Council has promised to pass on the complaints raised at the meeting to event organisers, Scottish Borders Council and Police Scotland.But Chairman Marshall Douglas said the community council ldquostrongly supports the Transcend Bike Festival and will continue to work closely with event organisers to ensure the future success of the event."},{"url":null,"title":"cops-ask-help-catch-boy-racers-galashiels","story":"POLICE in Galashiels have called on a local supermarket to help them catch boy racers.For months there have been reports made about young drivers gathering at the Tesco car park.And now officers have asked the firm to take down registration details to help them track down the culprits.PC James Harrison said: ldquoWe are still receiving calls about boy racers in the car park at Tesco on a Saturday night.ldquoIt seemed to get better for a while, but the problem is still there.

The beds are trimmed neatly with green paths of grass and only the odd weed or two can be seen to peer through the burgeoning beetroot and beans.Often yoursquoll also come across one of the volunteers, the gardener oryoursquore very lucky, one or more of the children who help to tend the plants.The Edible Garden is a community garden nestled in the beautul Tweed Valley at Innerleithen and run by a steering group and volunteers.Its aim is to inspire, motivate and build confidence in adults and children of all ages and abilities to learn how to grow their own food to promote a healthy lestyle, to encourage the community to prevent food waste, reuse recycle to reduce landfill and to reduce their carbon footprint.The St Ronanites are horticulturists turned eco warriors, providing a range of workshops for the community in how to grow, harvest and recycle.Lessons include guidance on composting, propagating, soil preparation, solar power for growing, food preservation, seasonal planting, and bugs pests in the garden, carbon footprint and food waste recycling.The vibrant goings-on have recently stepped up a gear with the efforts of the steering group of Shirley Spence, Lisa Kurowski Leslie and Alex Smithson to win a share of the Tweeddale Localities Bid funding.This has secured the future of the garden for years to come and means that the sht of responsibility from the climate change group lsquoYou Can Cookrsquo to the independent body known as lsquoThe Edible Gardenrsquo is now complete.Shirley Spence said the support of the public and the staff and children of St Ronanrsquos Primary School have been crucial to this success.ldquoIt will allow the steering group to provide a part-time gardener, Alex Smithson, serve the schoolrsquos Eco Group with practical experience of environmental issues and fund the supply of equipment, compost and building materials for the foreseeable future.However, for those of you who have yet to find the garden, perhaps it would be helpful to whet your appetite with some details of what the project has accomplished so far.Firstly, as well as offering expert gardening advice to the supporters, Alex plans and prepares the crops and liaises with school staff to provide classes for the children to teach them about their environment and carbon footprint.The classes look at areas from recycling and horticulture to microbes and ecology. This educational programme and the informal weekly gardening clubs allow both adults and children to experience a connection to nature in a supported environment and take home some of the produce theyrsquove grown too.Shirley explained: ldquoAll of the children at the school benefit from the fruit and vegetables grown in the enclosed garden but also from the orchard and the fruit bushes at the schools entrance. They can pick their own five-a day where the food hasnrsquot ever met a plastic tray or a supermarket checkout.The gardenrsquos outreach doesnrsquot stop at the food though. There are a number of initiatives that the group hope will compliment the ethos of environmental action.bull Innerleithen, Walkerburn and Traquair Rotary Club ndash The Rotary Club has sponsored The Edible Garden which has enabled them to get leaflets, brochures and posters to help promote their bid for the Localities Fund. They have agreed to continue to sponsor the Edible Garden to ensure that it thrives in the future.bull The Allotment ndash The Edible Garden, Innerleithen, will now be working with The Allotment, Innerleithen, who are sponsors.

The day after the crash, Superintendent Jim Guy of Strathclyde Police said there had been no evidence from the crew of any problems before the tragedy.He said the evidence available suggested an accident rather than terrorist attack. The scene of the crash was sealed off almost immediately and an air exclusion zone was imposed.Although most of the wreckage was left for accident investigators to examine, it is understood Royal Ulster Constabulary Special Branch officers removed boxes and cases containing secret papers on Friday morning.On Saturday,  personnel from RAF Machrihanish were drafted in to help find and catalogue debris from the crash.FIFTY YEARS AGOKintyre could be surfers# MeccaKintyre could become the major centre in Britain for surfingthe enthusiasm of two young men gets the encouragement it deserves.One of them, George Raynes, of Bishopbriggs in Lanarkshire, is secretary of the Scottish Surf Club, and with his treasurer, James Short of Glasgow, has just completed a preliminary survey of several of the Kintyre beaches with a view to exploiting them for the sport of surfing.George has surfed on beaches all over Britain and also in the Channel Isles and in Europe and he thinks that the beaches at Machrihanish and Southend could become the Mecca for British surfers and the venue for the British Championships.He was particularly impressed with the waves at Machrihanish but thinks Southend has great potential as well.He told the Courier: #The possibilities here are tremendous. These beaches are essentially accessible from the central belt of Scotland, in fact from all over Britain when one considers the air service, and the weather records show that there is plenty of sunshine and the water is warm compared to the waters off the east coast of England, for example.#In fact, I#ve been told that Kintyre topped the sunshine league in Britain last year.#The water is so warm, comparatively speaking, that the sport could become an all-year-round activity in this area. In the winter one would have to wear a wetsuit, of course, but the conditions are ideal and the wave forms have great potential # after all, they are coming straight in from the Atlantic over the north of Ireland.#What I#d like to see is a surf club established in Campbeltown. It could become a great asset from a tourist and amenity point of view.#And any Kintyre people who really took up the sport would have a great advantage over other surfers when it comes to competition because they have the benefit of readily available beaches all year round.#If this club gets going, the chances are that the British surf champions in the years to come will be Kintyre people.#ONE HUNDRED YEARS AGOOrr Ewing CupFootballers were favoured with beautul weather last Saturday and the games played on Kinloch Park in the Orr Ewing Cup competition brought together very large gatherings of spectators.The match in the afternoon was brought to a sudden termination by an unfortunate dispute over the award of a goal. The opposing teams were Kintyre and HMS Thames.Kintyre opened strongly and after  minutes# play had scored twice. The dispute arose over the award of the second goal, which Thames claimed to be offside.The referee, Mr Duncan McCallum, an old Hearts player, was of a dferent opinion, and on his allowing Kintyre the goal, the naval team without more do walked off the field.It is understood that the Thames team intimated to the league at the weekly meeting on Monday night their withdrawal from the competition.The teams were: Kintyre # Jas McKinlay: James Black and Archd Sharp: M Muir, A McCrank and T Cameron: R McGeachy and D Brown: Dan McNaughton: N Scally and J Donaldson.HMS Thames # Meese: Jesseman and Love: McCloud, Hirst and Fernie: Dunnell and Weekes: McGeachy: Slynn and Segrott.Referee # Mr D McCallum.In the evening, the opposing teams were Campbeltown and Kilbrannan. A week previously Kilbrannan had inflicted a - win over a naval team: against Campbeltown on Saturday they found the tables turned on themselves, and with the same score repeated they had to suffer the chagrin of a five-goal margin.It was hard game, but high scoring seldom adds to the vim or interest of any match and so it was here.Campbeltown from the kick-off may be fairly said to have had the measure of their opponents, but while they were the better , on play there was nothing like a - goal margin between the teams.Campbeltown owed their comfortable lead mainly to the masterly play of their centre forward, Archd O#May. This young footballer was home on furlough from the Rhine Army, and his display was undoubtedly the feature of the game. He is a fearless player with a rare turn of speed and a most deadly shot.At least three of six goals came from his foot, and were beautully taken, while he was the means of a fourth which he gave the right wing the honour of finishing.Kilbrannan#s solitary goal was well taken by Brown after a clever break through and an inidual run.Kilbrannan has material for the making of a team that should get much better results than they have so far achieved.The players are keen and inidually have a lot of football in them, but an almost entire absence of method both in attack and defence spoils their chances.The teams were: Campbeltown # A McCallum: G Quigley and Chas McKinven: D Kelly, J McDonald and John Martin: Chas Black and Arch Black: Arch O#May: W McKillop and James Martin.Kilbrannan # John McIntyre: D Bannatyne and Wm Gilchrist: J Short, N McKenzie and James Boyce: D Gilchrist and M Brodie: C Kelly: D Mathieson and J Brown.Referee # Mr W Mustarde."},{"url":null,"title":"letter open letter to dog owners","story":"While responsible dog owners take care to ensure their dogs are under control at all times, there are still a number who do not # and seem unaware of the potential consequences of their actions.There has been a disturbing rise in the number of sheep and other livestock attacks, and we are hoping to enlist your help in raising awareness of dog #worrying# which will, in turn, assist the authorities, farmers and land-users.If a dog worries livestock on any agricultural land the owner, or person in charge of the animal at the time, is guilty of a criminal offence.Section  of the DogsAct  defines #worrying# as:Such incidents cause distress to the animals and often lead to them being injured and or killed.

It is better than some human beings are treated ndash that is the sad truth.Mr Farnsworth was presenting an annual report on the racecoursersquos performance over the last financial year.The Beast from the East snow storm, an outbreak of equine influenza, and a long spell of dry weather all contributed to what he described as one of the worst years the course had been through in his memory.A number of key fixtures were cancelled and profits fell.In December, four horses died during one day of racing at the course but a subsequent review by the British Horseracing Authority ruled that the course and race organisers were not at fault.Councillor Gordon Mackett asked Mr Farnsworththe racecourse had been affected by animal welfare concerns.The course manager said: ldquoWe did have a horrible day when there were four fatalities however, these were all completely separate incidents.ldquoIn a sport like this you will get injuries and fatalities from time to time.

The availability of surviving records and evidence is one.The vast majority of what happened in the past is inevitably lost to us. This is true even for our own personal memories. So history is the small tip of the iceberg of events and times gone by, brought to the surface by the survival of some accounts more than others.And these records are never unbiased. Often historical records and evidence are purposely partial, influenced by ideology and personal allegiances. But all are biased in some way, as the limited viewpoint and interests of those recording events is based on their experience or motives.As a result, we can only see historical events through a narrow keyhole, with most characters and goings on out of view. Itrsquos the common people who are most always invisible in history. Our own ideological preference and belief in what is important will then affect how we interpret the limited evidence we have.This is why history is often subject to furious debate, and rightly so. Irsquod say itrsquos almost impossible not to allow our own perspectives, interests and values to influence the way we interpret the broader meaning of historical events and their signicance for contemporary society.Such a debate is being had in East Lothian just now, as to the name of the new town to be built on the Blindwells site, between Prestonpans and Longniddry and just to the north of Gladsmuir and Tranent.The name can be romantically translated to mean lsquohidden springsrsquo and it was across this once-marshy ground that the Jacobites crept stealthily at night to mount a surprise attack on the Redcoats on September , . That famous battle lasted  minutes and was a victory for the Jacobites, and the launchpad of Bonnie Prince Charliersquos march into England.Consequently, the Scottish Battlefields Trust has submitted a petition, as reported in the Courier last week, to name the new community Charlestoun and build a statue of Charles.When I was at school, he seemed a dashing and heroic figure. The songs and stories about him are infectious and I totally understand how the stories told about him have created a romantic and thrilling image.But then I studied the topic in more depth, at both university and afterwards. The period has suffered from the romantic treatment but there are fascinating stories of loyalty and sacrice to a man who, in reality, saw the common people chiefly as cannon fodder for his personal and family ambitions.It is for this reason I feel there are enough name places and statues to aristocratic and powerful men whose main historical role was to make and wage war, evenhe has a famous and romantic reputation.This is not to say we shouldnrsquot remember the fascinating history of the area, including that fateful day of battle when the Jacobites crossed the land.But itrsquos how we commemorate it and who we include. What makes the Jacobite period truly fascinating is the tapestry of stories of the many people involved, on both sides. It was a brutal time, in which there was certainly deep loyalty on both sides, but there were many other reasons why people found themselves on one side or the other. It was a brutal civil war, brought on by the aspirations of the exiled Stuarts.Do we commemorate the memory of the man who caused that war or do we commemorate those who were caught up in it  Is it really the case thatwe do the former we do the latter  Irsquom not convinced.There are other stories to consider of course for the site. There was coal mining there for generations. The lives of mining families, men, women and children who toiled in horric conditions, still remains mostly unheralded by history. Maybe itrsquos not lsquoromanticrsquo enough. Likewise with farming, which was a constant economic activity in the area for generations.There was also another unusual underground activity on the site after the early mine closed. Smugglers made an illegal whisky still deep down in the mine shaft once it was disused. It took a while for the customs men to realise East Lothian had an illicit whisky-making enterprise deep below ground in the old mine workings. When they finally raided the mine, they found the still, but no sign of the makers of the whisky. It kind of gives new meaning to the name lsquohidden springsrsquo!It is suggested the children in schools should have the final say in the new name, which is a great idea. But let our children be introduced to all aspects of our local history and allow them to understand how the way history is taught influences what we believe is important in contemporary society as well, and that there is no lsquocorrectrsquo view on this.Irsquod love to be part of that discussion and debate."},{"url":null,"title":"parents-launch-petition-school-bus-operator-change","story":"Families whose children attend two secondary schools in East Lothian were stunned to discover that local firm PrenticeCoaches would no longer be used to transport the youngsters when schoolsafter the summer.The news was broken to them by Prentice, which is based in Haddington, last week, sparking a furious reaction from a number of parents.Now a petition has been launched calling for Prentice to have the contract, which has allegedly been awarded to a rival firm, given back.One mother whose children attend Knox Academy in Haddingtonand are bussed in from Gford said that she was shocked by the news.She said: ldquoPrentice have been looking after our children for  years and they are being replaced with no consultation or discussion.ldquoParents know the drivers and trust them to look after their children.ldquoIt is beyond belief that the council would simply put a dferent company in place without even consulting with the families affected.A petition calling for theof Prentice has collected more than  signatures since it was launched online.It says: ldquoPrentice provide a community service where parents feel reassured and comfortable putting their children on the buses.ldquoWe believe East Lothian [Council] has chosen to put cost over service and safety.ldquoThere is absolutely nothing wrong with the current service.ldquoThis is simply a cost-cutting exercise which could potentially put our children at risk.Prentice provided bus services for Knox Academy and North Berwick High School but has now lost the contract for those services.Ross Prentice, the company boss, admitted that he was ldquodisappointed by the councilrsquos decision.The company said: ldquoIt is a sad day.

An insecurity that comes from knowing men arent really necessary. They are merely a decorative addition to the planet, their only purpose their reproductive aid to the female. Dont email me: its science.Last month scientists revealed that men would be unnecessary should we come to colonise Mars. Sperm, it turns out, suffers no ill effects from microgravity.Researchers from Dexeus Womenrsquos Health in Barcelona showed that once sperm is collected and frozen, it will survive quite happily the trip into outer space.NASA has previously, according to Helen Sharman, the first Briton in space, looked into the optimum dynamics of crews in long-term space travel.Its research found it was best to have all male or all female teams.Women, it was found, would be the better option due to our superior cooperation skills.The boys, you see, would all be fussing over who was in charge. While men are found to be better at short, goal-oriented missions, for a task as time consuming as colonising space, you need women.We also take up fewer resources, given our typically smaller size so need less food, less oxygen and produce less waste. We suffer less from the worst physical side effects of spaceflight, such as sight loss.Most importantly, you cant populate another world without the female of the species while the males contribution can be stored for later use without the worst physical side effects of having to put up with men during the journey.The future of humanity lies in an intergalactic matriarchy, and isnt that enough to make the menfolk inclined to overstate their worth The YouGov poll demonstrates women have a far greater grip on reality than men, perhaps because of constantly having to justy ourselves. Say, the American footballer Megan Rapinoe. Male footballers engage in a iety of outrageous behaviours but lads will be lads.Ms Rapinoe fails to make eye contact with a fan as she signed a football and shes lambasted. In an attempt at charity, perhaps the men are demonstrating an impressive optimism.But... optimism needs its basis in reality. Reach for the stars, yes. Blindly rely on the notion of male meritocracy  No.There must be some part of the male psyche that realises that, while they try to undermine and belittle women, this is because they cant cope with the notion that women might be more than their equal.On balance, though, Id be perfectly happy for men to live in a fantasy world where they might beat a pre-eminent female sportswoman at her game based on nothing but self-delusion.It might distract them just enough from the delusion they could successfully run the country."},{"url":null,"title":"letters-brussels-far-preferable-westminster","story":"As for his suggestion that Scotlands laws will be controlled from Brussels, well, try telling that to the French or Germans or any of the other independent nations of Europe.

If he or anyone  thinks that abandoning our EU membership will give the UK more control of its future when negotiating with the US or China then they have another think coming. We currently have a voice in Brussels, we will have none in Washington, Beijing or even Brussels for that matter.As for an independent Scotland taking its orders from Brussels rather than Westminster, well thats OK by me. From where I sit Brussels looks like a beacon of good governance, compared to the basket case which is the UK governed by an English parliamentat Westminster.John Jamieson, Ayr.THE dficulty of Alan Fitzpatrickrsquos letter is summed up in one sentence, ldquoWhy can they not come clean and admit that by the former what they are seeking is separation from the UK, and by the latter they mean the substitution of control from Brussels to that at present from Westminster Westminster and Brussels are by no means identical. Westminster is an all-encompassing political union which can legislate on any matter it chooses, but the European Union is a treaty-based economic union with powers limited and controlled by member states. These include product standards and composition, product labelling, rights of movement and residence of EU citizens, company law, banking regulation, consumer protection, animal welfare, farm payments and managing the fish stocks in member statesrsquo fishing grounds. This sounds like a lot , however its main purpose is to ensure trade can be carried out fairly, and that for instance, no country attempts to achieve success by limiting employee rights or producing goods and services to a lower standard than others. It does not, however, include such as education, welfare, defence or foreign policies.Mr Fitzpatrickrsquos claim that the EU is on a ldquomarch hellip toward an ever-closer union is hypothetical at best, requiring the future agreement of the member states. In contrast Westminsterrsquos powers, within the UK, are to all intents infiniteLastly, he raises the issue that ldquoin the UK Scotland doesnrsquot get the government that they themselves voted for, how is that going to change in the EU  and there is no doubt that there would be times when the balance of members we elect to the European Parliament will not be reflected in its final majority. That though is not the most important point.The fact that one member of the UK ndash England ndash constitutes almost  per cent of the population meansthat there is clarity there about their aims then, pretty much no matter what the other member states think, they will achieve their aims. This could be clearly seen in the EU referendum, when evenwe deduct the Leave vote in Walesand in Northern Irelandthere would still be a majority for Leave in the UK! To repeat,there is a dference of opinion between the member states of the UK, England is well large enough to get its own way eventhere is only a slight majority there. Even Germany lacks that power in the EU.

Whatever was decided, it would be Scotlands decision, no need to go cap in hand to Westminster to seek permission.That is taking back control: our decisions made by us and us alone.John McCallum, Glasgow.ALAN Fitzpatrick contends that Scotland would not be independenta member of the European Union by that reasoning, Mr Fitzpatrick must also believe that Denmark, Portugal, Finland, Estonia, Ireland and all the other EU member countries are not independent nations. I would remind Mr Fitzpatrick that during negotiations with the UK, every EU country had the right of veto, and all of them stood solidly behind Ireland in its particular set of circumstances, while Scotlands overwhelming vote to remain within the EU was pointedly ignored by the UK government at Westminster.And though membership of the EU is of vital importance to Scotland, there are other benefits of being an independent nation on the world stage Monaco, with a population of , actively participates in the United Nations, and is a member of many international organisations, including the World Health Organisation, and Unesco.

disposed of, reused or recycled over the next decade in the UK, at a cost of around poundbn.In the  Budget, Chancellor Philip Hammond announced a call for evidence on plans to make Scotland a global hub for decommissioning.The UK Government has argued Scotland will ldquopioneer the future of the global oil and gas industry, with the North Sea representing ldquoone of the first regions in the world to start decommissioning on such a large scale .This provides opportunities for innovation, while the challenging environment in the North Sea is also seen as an advantage in refining techniques.Earlier this year, a report by Westminsterrsquos Scottish Affairs Committee said: ldquoDecommissioning represents a signicant export opportunity for Scottish businesses.ldquoScotland has the opportunity to become a global base for the decommissioning industry.Mike Tholen, upstream policy director at Oil and Gas UK, said decommissioning is a growing market of which Britain is

first-mover advantage.ldquoThis will not only provide the supply chain with a steady workflow in the UK, but these competitive capabilities are exportable to a global market.ldquoAt the same time, we remain focused on providing security of energy supply through home-produced resources, providing energy sovereignty as recognised recently by the Committee on Climate Change in its net zero report.ldquoAll of this will ensure that we continue to provide highly skilled jobs, remain a major economic contributor and are best placed to become a key partner in the transition towards a low

would allow subsea structures to act as articial reefs, providing a refuge for a wide iety of marine le.A spokesman for the Scottish Wildle Trust said: ldquoDecommissioning of oil rigs, evencarried out sensitively, will cause some disturbance to the marine environment.ldquoThe alternative to removal is leaving the structure in place, which may seem like abandonment but there can actually be ecological benefits to leaving oil rigs in place because marine le tends to gather around large objects such asthe legs of oil rigs, using them asarticial reefs.ldquoImportantly, the decision on what

Concern about the future of humanity in the next  or  years is almost entirely focused on eradicating drinking straws, plastic bags and the use of fossil fuels, rather than flying cars around a Buckminster Fuller-domed city on Proxima Centauri B, while got up in some outfit reminiscent of Milo OrsquoShea or Jane Fonda in Barbarella.Thatrsquos a shame, I think. Worse, an error. In the grand scheme of things, getting a few people into space doesnrsquot look like a priority compared with avoiding nuclear annihilation, climate meltdown or trashing terrestrial ecostructures. And our record so far ndash a dozen white American men briefly visiting the nearest celestial body ndash is the smallest of steps for mankind.Evenwe try to fix it, though, therersquos a problem with ldquothe only world we have, as environmentalists like to put it. Leave aside the fact that extreme eco-alarmists have all been wrong in their predictions of the past  years about where we would be now. In , for example, Prince Charles told us we had  months to save the world. Two years after we all presumably died, he popped up again the other day to give us  months, asextinction were operating on some Brexit-style series of interminable extensions.The climate and ecology Jeremiahs may well, nonetheless, be right about some things. And eventheyrsquore wrong about the nature of the impending apocalypse, or whether itrsquos caused by human behaviour, over-consumption, pollution or something  that we might control or amend, it is a mathematical certainty and a scientic fact that the Earth is doomed.At the very least, the planet will fall into the Sun in . billion years. But plant le will be extinguished in a mere  million years, evennothing happens before then. Thatrsquos very unlikely in the past  million years, there have been at least five mass extinction events. These all happened before we came up with single-use plastics, so evenwe can avoid killing ourselves, something  will certainly do it.The most likely candidates are a massive asteroid collision , or some natural catastrophe, probably volcanic, tectonic, oceanic or geomagnetic. The average interval between the eruption of any active supervolcano is , years the last was about , years ago in New Zealand, but there are about  on the planet Yellowstone National Park, which is one, is about , years overdue to blow its top on the basis of its previous behaviour.In other words, the end is nigh. Unless, that is, we pay more attention to Elon Musk than Greta Thunberg: I grant you, not an immediately appealing prospect. The rationale is this: evenMiss Thunbergrsquos right, and we do everything she suggests, wersquore doomed, because sooner or later something over which we have no control will wipe humanity out. Whereas,enough of us get off the Earth first, as Musk suggests, therersquos the possibility that humanityrsquos descendants will survive.To do it, theyrsquoll probably have to become post-human in some way. But then, thatrsquos evolution. Space colonisation, perhaps with attendant genetic changes, or digital upload of consciousness, or some as-yet unimagined development, is currently the stuff of science fiction. A century ago, so were nuclear power, the computer, antibiotics, talking pictures, the ballpoint pen, frozen food, the jet engine, the contraceptive pill, transistors, the personal stereo, GM crops, contact lenses, mobile phones, DNA sequencing, suntan lotion and Velcro.

If anyone on the pro-UK side of politics had issued an equivalent and shameful and fear-mongering warning, just imagine the faux nationalist outrage.Coincidentally, at the same time as their latest fear mongering, it is revealed that Scotland, under the SNP, is fast becoming the \"drugs deaths capitalrsquorsquo of the planet. Its spinners will be madly trying to find out how this human tragedy can somehow be blamed on Westminster.No doubt there are many reasons for the startling increase in these horric deaths but an SNP administration, fixated on breaking up the UK and citizens assemblies and anything that may aid its search for the Holy Grail ndash leaving little or no time for the day job ndash does not help.Alexander McKay, Edinburgh EH.NEIL Mackay rightly rejects the idea of pursuing a route to independence outside of the law . Any route that smacks of pronouncing UDI is a bad look for a Government that wants to be taken seriously on the international stage.Yet Mr Mackayrsquos suggestion that the Scottish Government go to the Supreme Court or the European Court to try to overrule a UK Government refusal to grant a section  order for a second independence referendum is equally likely to end badly. He says ldquoitrsquos hard to see any court flouting the democratic will of the Scottish people, but that is surely the wishful thinking of an independence supporter.First, the court is likely to conclude that this matter is outside of its competence, with the decision to issue a section  order or not one that is fully the right of the UK Government. Secondly, any court will in any case be disinclined to get involved when, based on opinion polls, it is far from clear that there is majority support for having another referendum anytime soon. If such support were already overwhelming, then perhaps a court might be tempted, but instead, it is only the will of independence supporters that is being frustrated, not the will of the people of Scotland as a whole.Keith Howell, West Linton.LIKE Neil Mackay I am not a member of the SNP, but would like Scotland to be a self-governing country the international norm. Some points around his article, however.Plan B is not an original idea. It was first promulgated by Margaret Thatcher as the route to Scottish independence, and as such would be dficult for Unionists to argue was ldquobullying and illegal. All elections in Scotland for some years, driven by Unionists, have been fought only around independence and a referendum. The Supreme Court would certainly follow the English concept of constitutional law, and find Westminster sovereign. Its whythe Supreme Court was established: to override the Scottish constitutional view of ldquosovereignty of the people. Itrsquos time the Scottish media put pressure on Unionist politicians to give us their alternative to a second referendum, given many thought a second EU referendum was OK.GR Weir, Ochiltree.SO enthusiastic is Martin Redfernwith his obsession to denigrate First minister Nicola Sturgeon and the SNP, that he lets exaggeration of the rhetoric get in the way of the actualityndash even his frequent use of the conditional-tense phrase ldquoit would seem. . . does not get him off the hook.First, historically, it was Scotland being subjected to a Westminster government Conservative when it had voted otherwise Labour that was the main driver of the movement towards independence. Devolution, it was said, would kill nationalism stone dead ndash so what went wrong  Well, for a start, Tony Blair likened it to a parish council, so it can only be a stepping stone.But the flaws in Mr Redfernrsquos proposition are that it was not the nationalists that lost the  independence referendum, but the Yes campaign, which reflected non-nationalists too. And is he seriously suggesting that when a new first minister, or even a prime minister, is appointed as governing party leader, there should be a general election, which is the consequence of his assertion Douglas R Mayer, Currie.YOUR article about the impact of Boris Johnsons proposed reduction in rUK stamp duty on the willingness of people to remain in or move to Scotlandhighlights the problems the SNP has in adjusting taxes ndash especially income tax ndash while being joined at the hip with the UK.This is a situation that wont change with independence when, I assume, close economic ties and freedom of movement will be a main foundation of any SNP manesto and subsequent treaty.Far better to remain in the UK with harmonised fiscal policy and the equalising effect of the Barnet formula which compensates for regional iations, the benefits of which are obvious in the GERS reports which show Scotlands notional \"deficit\" is in effect an overdraft guaranteed by rUK which enables the Scottish Government to claim we balance our books every year.Allan Sutherland, Stonehaven."},{"url":null,"title":"issue-day-148th-open","story":"How old is The Open It was first played in  at Prestwick Golf Club in Ayrshire, which hosted the first  Opens.

This was a substantial commitment but was vital for Scotland’s long term interests, preparing ourselves for the challenges of an ageing population. We’ve recently extended free personal care to cover all those who are assessed as needing it, no matter their age.MSPs also charted a dferent course when, following a change of administration in , parliament voted to scrap tuition fees in Scotland, restoring Scotland’s long and proud tradition of free education.Similarly, the decision to abolish prescription charges brought to an end what was little more than a tax on ill health. The NHS of course is the greatest, and most valued, example of a universal service where care is provided on the basis of need and not ability to pay. Our health service, like others across the world, faces challenges. But it is a real achievement of the Scottish Parliament that we have resisted the marketization moves south of the border while ensuring that under the current government Scotland’s AE departments are the best performing in theUK.On other occasions, the Parliament has led the UK in making bold policy choices, such as the ban on smoking in public places. Our Climate Change Act includedthe most ambitious emissions reduction targets of any legislature in the world and, as Health Secretary, I was heavily involved in the campaign to introduce a minimum unit price for alcohol, which we knew would play a key role in tackling Scotland’s unhealthy relationship with drink – another world leading measure.data-src\"https:images-o.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.inverurieherald webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"As the Scottish Parliament prepares to celebrate its th anniversary, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon reflects on both its journey and her own.\"  First Minister Nicola Sturgeon reflects on  years of the Scottish Parliament viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"It took a decade of hard work to make this policy a reality and I am personally very proud of the campaign, working with stakeholders, to persuade MSPs to back minimum pricing, as well as overcoming a legal challenge that went all the way to the Supreme Court.I am personally committed to making sure every child and young person in Scotland gets the best possible start in le. We have already delivered an increase in free, high quality childcare for all three and four year olds and extending entitlement to eligible two year olds and will increase it further before the end of this parliament.Scotland has also become a much safer society under devolution. Recorded crime has fallen to some of the lowest levels seen since the s. In particular, non-sexual violent crime has fallen substantially, thanks in no small part to the excellent work of the Violence Reduction Unit, which was established over a decade ago with cross-party support and is now being copied across the UK.In recent years, new powers have come to the Scottish Parliament and with those powers come increased responsibilities for MSPs to deliver for the people ofScotland.Income tax policy is now a key feature of the annual Scottish budget. We’ve used these new powers to introduce a fairer income tax policy, with most people paying less tax than they would south of the border – while continuing to raise revenue to support investment in the economy and public services.Last year Parliament passed the wide-ranging Social Security Act, paving the way for devolution of a number of benefits, as well as creating a number of newbenefits such as increased carers’ support allowance and best start grants for families with young children – and a new social security agency to deliver them. This new agency has a culture of dignity and respect at its heart and early feedback from service users has been overwhelmingly positive.I also appointed the first gender balanced Scottish cabinet and we are encouraging more women to stand for parliament, and bring a better balance to ourpublic le.Over the course of the Scottish Parliament consistent action has been taken to ensure communities have the opportunity to own the land they live and work on.Many communities have benefited from the right to buy that now covers rural and urban communities.Of course, the foundation of our country is a strong and resilient economy. That’s why we have slashed or abolished business rates for , premises –saving almost £. billion for our small businesses.We have invested in our infrastructure with all governments building new schools and hospitals and, of course, the iconic Queensferry Crossing.And, to help make sure we have the workforce we need for years to come, we have delivered just over a quarter of a million Modern Apprenticeships in the lastdecade.In April this year, new legislation to tackle controlling and coercive behaviour came into effect, giving Scotland some of the most robust domesticabuse legislation in the world.I’m also proud of the many steps we’ve taken to make Scotland a fairer society, including the introduction of equal marriage rights – attending one of the first same-sex weddings in Scotland is a memory that will stay with me for a long time.And we all worked together over many years to help Glasgow successfully host the  Commonwealth Games. This helped to inspire Scots to get more active,delivered new facilities and put Scotland on the world stage. It was a sight to behold.My final achievement is perhaps harder to quanty. There is no doubt that the re-establishment of Scotland’s parliament has profoundly changed our political culture for the better, with our nation’s lawmakers much more accessible to those they represent. It has also enabled us to have conversations we wouldn’t have had and to debate our own future, with the  independence referendum generating an increase in democratic engagement.Looking ahead, we now face the signicant challenges posed by Brexit which, of course, Scotland’s people and parliament overwhelmingly oppose. Given the long-term damage that Brexit will cause to Scotland, and the material change in circumstances this represents, I believe it is only fair that people are given the choice of whether to become an independent country. Indeed, the current SNP Government was elected on a clear manesto commitment that people should be offered that choice should Scotland be taken out of the EU against its will. Polls consistently show that people living here believe the decision on whether to hold a referendum should be a matter for Holyrood and not Westminster. Twenty years after it came into being, that is an important measure of the way people in Scotland view the Parliament and one that the new UK Prime Minister would do well to heed."},{"url":null,"title":"https:wwworcadiancouk  \n","story":"July ,  at : pmPolice say they have increasing concerns for a missing person, James Scott.

And I understand that it is very unfortunate that this problem, while unrelated to the air traffic controllers’ industrial action, has coincided with it. However, that is not much consolation to frustrated users of the service.“The issue here is that this is a leline service and there are no alternatives for people who simply have to fly. Local people and businesses in the Northern Isles need a reliable service, and we simply cannot afford local service-levels to be reduced. We accept that we have to live with unavoidable weather events, but the recent disruptions have been workforce-related.“HIAL is a Scottish Government-owned organisation and one of the reasons for that is a recognition that it provides a strategically critical part of our transport infrastructure in the Highlands and Islands. It’s way past time for ministers to take a long hard look at the situation and reassure us that they are prepared to intervene on behalf of the travelling public.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The schemes are designed to protect electricity consumers in the North of Scotland from high costs of distribution in their area. In   this was done by providing an annual assistance amount of £ million to consumers in the area, which Ofgem estimates is worth around £ per household.Mr McArthur said: “It is simply unfair for islanders to be surcharged when so many households in our island communities already experience the highest levels of fuel poverty anywhere in the country.“If these plans are implemented, it will be good news for consumers across the highlands and islands.

The move is a result of a partnership with the organisation PAMISwhich campaigns for these facilities, and has been supported by Transport Scotland.The move comes as a result of research highlighting that , people in the UK need such special assistance and facilities. Users include people with profound and multiple learning disabilities and people with a range of other disabilities including Cerebral Palsy, Motor Neurone disease, Multiple Sclerosis, stroke, some older people and other specic disabilities.The requirements are set out in British Standards, and include:The new toilets are already open on deck six of MV Hjaltland and MV Hrossey, and will be available on board MV Hamnavoe by the end of the year.“This investment is another sign of our commitment to making our facilities as welcoming as possible to everyone in the community,# said Stuart Garrett, managing director at Serco NorthLink Ferries.#It will open up opportunities for many people with disabilities and their familes to visit some of the most beautul parts of Scotland. It also supports those living on the islands when travelling to and from the mainland for leisure and essential healthcare.”The move is the latest in a series of measures aimed at improving journeys for all travelers. Earlier this month the company became the first Scottish transport operator to introduce the pioneering Neatebox support service. This followed improvements to the NorthLink website, disability awareness training for staff, and a new partnership with a sign language interpreting agency.Mum and carer Jenny Whinnet, who helped to start the PAMIS campaign  years ago, said: #This is an exciting development for families and carers.#It permits people who need these facilities to travel further afield confidently and with dignity. This is very dferent to the early years of this campaign, when it was so dficult for me to travel with my son Craig because there were no Changing Places toilets available.”Jenny Miller, Chief Executive Officer of PAMIS added: “We’ve been very impressed with the commitment and consideration shown by Serco NorthLink Ferries in developing changing places toilets on their ferries.#They have really listened to the stories from the families and people we work with and who feel excluded from so many activities that we all take for granted. We’re delighted that the Orkney and Shetland ferries will be the first in the country, and possibly the world, to have a Changing Places toilet.”Paul Wheelhouse, minister for energy, connectivity and the islands is pleased to see the new facilities up and running.He said: #This type of improvement is exactly why we set up the Ferries Accessibility Fund.#We know accessible travel not only enables people to enjoy equal access to our beautul country, but it also enables people to fully participate in society and improve the quality of their lives, so we want to continue to identy and remove any disabling barriers which prevent people from making journeys or lead to them having an unpleasant time on board.#It’s very important that Scotland’s ferry services are fully accessible, offering the best passenger experience possible to everyone and this targeted investment marks very welcome progress on that journey.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

It is they, after all, who made history as ambassadors of humankind, setting foot onto a ­­\u2028far-flung celestial body. Michael Collins, Apollo ’s ­command module pilot, who watched on, fearful that catastrophe would intervene to ensure he would make theto Earth alone, played an integral part in the mission. So too did the many pioneers whose names occupy a mere footnote of history, despite the fact that without their expertise and composure, the disaster Collins feared – or much worse – would have almost inevitably come to pass. The semicentennial celebrations of the Moon landing is an occasion to remember those who occupy the foothills of the credits. One of the statistics surrounding Project Apollo, which seems to me both remarkable and entirely rational, is that around , people were involved in rendering the impossible possible.This army of engineers, scientists, programmers, mathematicians, and technicians defied technological limitations and bureaucratic wrangling to produce approximately five-and-a-half million parts which, working in unison, spirited Apollo’s crew to the Moon and back. : How moon landing conspiracy theories began and why they persist today – Professor Peter Knight:  years since the moon landing: why Scotland is the true home of astronaut Neil ArmstrongIn any other corporate environment, the prospect of workers on the ground feeling disconnected from the mission’s overall goal would barely warrant concern. But Project Apollo’s programme ­manager, George Müller, knew fine well the risks of letting such apathy go unchecked. He ensured the astronauts toured factories across America tasked with manufacturing the spacecraft components. This was no mere public relations exercise. It reminded workers that a single oversight on their part could kill the men standing before them, and it forged a sense of collective responsibility. Nowhere was this esprit de corps more evident than Building  of Nasa’s Johnson Space Centre in Houston, Texas, home to the Apollo mission operations control centre , where the spacecraft’s ­navigation, propulsion, le support, and communications systems were monitored with unflinching ­scrutiny.At any given time, between  and  men – and one trailblazing woman, JoAnn Morgan, the instrumentation controller – held in their hands the lives of three men a ­quarter of a million miles away. Their number included Stephen Bales, the son of a janitor and a ­beautician, who less than five years previously had moved from the farming community of Fremont, Iowa, to join Nasa as an intern, responsible for guided tours. In an interview with  Minutes to the Moon, a superb BBC World Service podcast detailing the graft, ingenuity, and composure which underpinned the final descent to the lunar surface, Bales recently reflected on the mission that would define his career. Without him, it would have probably ended in failure. As the Eagle craft neared the Moon, an alarm code known as  flashed on its on-board computer display. It was the only moment in the entire mission when a degree of urgency,not fear, could be heard in Armstrong’s voice.Bales, by then one of Apollo ’s guidance officers, saw the alarm four seconds later. Initially unsure of its signicance, he remembered the last simulation he and the flight controllers had carried out before the landing proper. Back then a similar code, known as , had appeared, prompting Bales to call an abort. In the subsequent debriefing, he immersed himself in the myriad alarms that could be triggered, working with Jack Garman, a computer specialist, to understand their meaning.In doing so, they realised a  referred to a software reboot which cancelled all the processes that the computer was running crucially, it happened so fast, no vital guidance or navigation data would be lost. So when the code appeared for real, Bales knew the mission could continue. It was a decision made in the space of  seconds – “an eternity,” said Bales – but it saved Apollo . There are countless other stories like his. Take that of John Aaron from Oklahoma, the son of a cattle rancher and a minister, recruited by Nasa at  without an interview. He felt ashe had walked into a foreign country where people spoke another language, on account of the dizzying number of acronyms being hurled around. After just six weeks, he contemplated jacking it all in. Fortunately for him, and the Apollo programme, he knuckled down. Only a few months later, his split-second decision making was credited with saving Apollo  after its rocket was struck by lightning. It is dficult to conceive of the pressure these men worked under, as they analysed the spaceflight while listening to three,not four conversations simultaneously on communication channels known as ‘loops’.The average age of those inside MOCR was just , and as Gerry Grfin, the flight director during Apollo ’s fraught re-entry into the Earth’s atmosphere, has pointed out, their youth counted in their favour. “It was the lack of fear,” he explained. “It wasn’t the lack of knowing it was risky.”It also means that, half a century on, many of them are still with us, able to reflect on an epoch-defining moment and receive our thanks for the part they played in it.©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"can you help theatre make the world a better place linda crooks","story":"Next month, Scotland will be at the epicentre of the global arts and culture movement as the Edinburgh International Festival and Fringe blossom into le once again.The Traverse Theatre is at the heart of this cultural celebration – both physically and figuratively – and we welcome the heightened exposure and attention these festivals bring to the work of our theatre and many others in the capital. As Scotland’s only theatre dedicated to new writing all year round, the Traverse is much more than the bricks and mortar of the building we occupy off Lothian Road.The Traverse is a place where artists and audiences are invited to meet and attempt to make sense of the world, to question, learn, empathise, and to encounter dferent people and experiences. Our influence extends around the globe with our productions of Ulster American, What Girls Are Made Of, Mouthpiece and Locker Room Talk touring to audiences in Australia, New Zealand, North and South America, Ireland and the UK already this year.: Joyce McMillan: The rise of the far-right in Europe is no Cabaret, old chum: Theatre review: Mouthpiece, Traverse, EdinburghTheatre is fundamental to a healthy democracy and we believe the Traverse – defined by a bold and unique body of work that harnesses the erse talents of everyone in the team here and the artists and communities we work with – is a force for good in this sense. We provoke and encourage debate and facilitate a fusion of disparate groups and ideas. To maximise the scope of those conversations we must ensure the Traverse continues to be accessible, attractive and welcoming to the many, not just the few.If we are to achieve that, we need to react to the many changes in the world around us and open up new pathways for people to come to the theatre, both as writers and as audience members.To that end, today we launch the search for two people who will be instrumental in shaping the work of the Traverse through to its th anniversary in  and beyond. After a period of consultation and reflection we are bolstering our leadership team by recruiting for a new artistic director of the Traverse Theatre Company, and a director of creative development. This investment will ensure we give equal energy to creating a vibrant programme of work that celebrates new material and developing routes into the theatre for new writers and audiences.The director of creative development will devote time and effort to strengthening those pathways by nurturing our relationships with communities here in Scotland and further afield. We believe creativity is an attribute everyone has and that everyone should be given the opportunity to explore their artistic talents. In creating a new role which has ultimate responsibility for that work, we will in turn enable and empower the incoming artistic director to focus exclusively on overseeing a new writing programme that represents an ambitious artistic vision for the Traverse.The people we appoint to these two roles will be joining a talented and determined team that has been instrumental in shaping this new structure and is eagerly awaiting this next phase in our growth. We believe these changes will not only help us deliver our vision, but meet our ambition to change the world we live in through the work we produce and the creative development programmes we champion. The Traverse exists to amply unfamiliar voices and to reach fresh eyes and ears with the work we produce all year round. If you feel as passionately about that as we do, we would love to hear from you.Linda Crooks is the Traverse’s executive producer.©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"national trust for scotland accused of supplier payment delays","story":"Sorry, were having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...The National Trust for Scotlandhas major issues at their finance department, with many suppliers not being paid for months, it has emerged.One supplier said he is now considering employing a debt collection agency to get payment for the thousands of pounds he is owed by the conservation charity, claiming he has been waiting months for the money owed.The NTS has cited problems with their new computer systems for the delays. However, firms waiting to be paid said the trust had also blamed computer glitches last year when problems arose.One supplier, who does not want to be named, said: “We’re chasing money at the moment. It’s a high four-figure sum. We’re only one of very many suppliers in the same position.“It’s slightly unbelievable that the trust is behaving like this. They assured us last year that all their IT problems had been fixed.“It’s not that they don’t have the money.

We have been working with the software provider to fix this issue and it is now resolved.“In the interim, we attempted to noty all suppliers of the issues.

To protect the integrity of the process, we will not be making any further comment and will update parliament at the appropriate time.”The spokesman refused to clary whether a buyer would have to repay the £. million of Scottish Government loans pumped in so far to keep the airport going.The sale documents state that evaluation of offers would include ”the price offered for the shareholding in PAHL [airport owner Prestwick Aviation Holdings Limited] on a debt free cash free basis ”.One respected aviation analyst was sceptical about whether a sale of the -acre site could be secured.John Strickland, of JLS Consulting, said: “In my view, it is likely to prove challenging to find a buyer for Prestwick given intense competition from Glasgow and Edinburgh and a slowing economic outlook.”Ryanair is the airport’s sole remaining airline, flying some , passengers in the year to March, the airport’s lowest for  years.

Daily Mail!! grow up. Ask yourself the following question, how does today#s GlobalWarming compare with the Global Warming scientically after and during the Second Ice Age  Anyone who cannot answer that question is too ignorant to hold an informed opinion on today#s climate change.Stops PC Plod and the band of merry men, from going in with batons to quell the grown-ups waffling on about, why their leader Comrade Corbyn inspires them with his words.How about giving them a half decent education concentrating on sciencesubjects. Then they would have an informed and considered opinion, not just the usual Greenwash so popular with the ignorant. If gted they may even go on to contribute with useful research and technological ideas so unlike are present green, ignorant and wholly ill-informed flock in thecouncil chamberAn area of industry which has not been looked into with any proper statistical information is thisof Agriculture. This industry produces more green house gases than the all of transportation. In fact, it is several times greater than transportation. The catch  scenario is this industry has had no regulation or legislation is regard to reducing greenhouse gases, infact, due to population growth, the pollution created by agriculture is vastly on the increase. Technology has played its part, but it is a situation where reducing pollution is very, very dficult to achieve given the nature of the industry itself. As the population increases, this will become more relevant in terms of the overall pollution created, and no doubt, something will have to be done. Whether sea based farming of certain foods may reduce the pollution, but much of agriculture is still based on land and the production of meat will still create problems related to greenhouse gases in terms of land used for meat production and or crop production as well. It is a dilemma which will become more relevant as the population increases.I can assure you these bairns weren#t pushed into anything. They were toldthey wanted to go they had to complete a form. One of mine wanted to go, the other didn#t. One asked a question at the Town Hall and I am very proud # not that she had to protest # but that she had the courage to do so, and silence many there.Well done young folk # out of the mouths of babes as they say.It hardly takes any courage to join a protest, especially one being encouraged and congratulated onby so many folk! The courage comes from not following the crowd herd and forming an independent and educated view. Jumping headlong onto the bandwagon is easy, understanding the science and striving to do something about it the hard bit. Joining a not fully educated and scientically ignorant caucus is just so stupid.Especially a meaningless strike from school, what child would not love a day off among mates  No doubt the pig ignorant and stupid will be so impressed. A bit like supergluing yourself tp a bus or train, outstanding!!!I didnt say it took courage to join a protest, I said it takes courage to speak at the Town Hall. Andit was about time off school, they all would have gone. Please have more respect for our bairns and young folk.And these bairns are, for your information, studying the stem subjects at school.It is not a case of having respect for the bairns, Johan Adamson. It is just a case of having absolutely no respect whatsoever for those who politicise them and drive them like sheep. Primary children used in a political strike!! Repulsive behaviour, you should be ashamed, so socialist, child exploitation is the words that come to mind.They had to complete a form, primary children! What next, form a political Union and become militant  Little Orwellian sheep bleating for the Pigs.These were AHS pupils Ian, not primary pupils, and no one has politicised them.Educated them yes, but then I forgot you have the monopoly on climate change education and stem subjects.The organisers were I think over , so young adults.The fact is I will always criticise revolting behaviourand ignorance and I am not referring to the children.Yes I do believe sixth year pupils are capable of organising thisWhy do you assume Ian that these bairns are not studying stem subjects and that only you know about climate change then Ian Infantile comments  Pot kettle springs to mind.Now just who printed these forms the children had to fill in  Which teachers OKed the strike and arrange for Brae and Aith schools also took part, as well as bairns from the Sound Primary School and organised and paid for transport  I do not believe that was AHS sixteen-year-olds for one second.Whether by accident or design this provides a very convenient fig leaf for the council#s lamentable performance on child poverty.Much was made of the #children#s march# at the SIC#s education committee meeting today however in a news report about the part of the same meeting that dealt with the council#s child poverty action report, it was clear that the council have done next to nothing since the Shetland Inequalities Commission reported in March .know. All these admirable young citizens are guilty of is taking a stand based on commonly accepted information. I could ask what special knowledge does Ian think he has that allows him to lord it over them# but nerves fail me.On Ian’s earlier point, it is self-evident thatwe need some people with a high level of competence in STEM subjects who can take critical stand on matters scientic. Gaining some depth in the Arts and Humanities, however, increases the likelihood of developing sensitivity and compassion, concern for humanity and the future of our planet, self-awareness and insight into common human foibles, hubris and self-aggrandisement included! Learners on this path can also become alert to common logical fallacies. Even those who like Ian, with a preference for physical sciences, can benefit. Happily don’t need to be much of a scholar to spot an ad hominem attack. With all due respect for Ian’s past achievements in the physical sciences, it would be nicehe could make his points without belittling others #kids included. That’s a normal standard “of decency and tolerance” btw.I so agree with these word #gaining some depth in the Arts and Humanities, however, increases the likelihood of developing sensitivity and compassion, concern for humanity and the future of our planet, self-awareness and insight into common human foibles, hubris and self-aggrandisement included!#. You do so hold yourself in such regard high Peter, now go glue yourself to a train or bus to prove your point!But just at that moment, as though at a signal, all the sheep burst out into a tremendous bleating of- #Four legs good, two legs better! Four legs good, two legs better! Four legs good, two legs better!# It went on for five minutes without stopping. And by the time the sheep had quieted down, the chance to utter any protest had passed, for the pigs had marched back into the farmhouse ”.And what are you doing Ian to save the planet And what would you suggest the AHS and the SIC do Ad Hominem attacks # playing the man not the ball # are often used by those who don’t have much of an argument to begin with. Instead of dealing with whether the young people have a point or not, generous-spirited Ian opted to have a go instead.Logical fallacies show lazy thinking, masking an absence of creativity and independent thought. Ian’s trollswipe above looks Ad Hominem in approach st first, but he is also using the Tu Quoque Fallacy. This is where you accuse the opponent of hypocrisy to avoid answering their charge. Self-effacing Ian thus avoids addressing the possibility of his own hubris or lack of self-knowledge.Should I have made things easier for him and asked what his actual beef with the climate protestors was  He says “Joining a not fully educated and scientically ignorant caucus is just so stupid”and demands that everyone should be able to answer “how does today’s Global Warming compare with the Global Warming scientically after and during the Second Ice Age ” before taking a view. Perhaps he will educate us by answering his own question # sticking to terms that demonstrate tolerance and decency of course. Nuclear Free Council, Declair Climate emergency,climate justice what a load of utter bunkum. Especially stop allowing political activists to exploit our children.I put forward the question : Is nuclear power the only solution to stop greenhouse gas emissions and the only way to stop climate change progressing further  It may be the worse case scenario in terms of our power demand solution, but what are the alternatives to our demand for energy without causing further environmental and ecological damage to the planet by in using fossil fuels or cleaner alternatives like wind or solar   It has been suggested the Sahara Desert could be used for solar energy to power Europe, but how much land would be required and could this be expanded  The alternatives to fossil fuels may be cleaner, but how would this affect global weather patterns or the depletion of species due to the destruction of natural habitats being replaced for energy production Very sadly the SG SNP has committed to wind energy with its catastrophic environmental damage and only intermittent supply, but that is the policy of the scientically ignorant and utterly stupid.Thank you for your comments, Ian. I fear humanity will have no choice but to go nuclear for its energy production in the future.Alternative resources, like wind or solar, may be the short term answer, but as mentioned, the downside to this is the large amount of land which will be required with the ability to vastly expand as demand increases. What would be the environmental damage and the destabilization of le on the planet have in the long term with such technologies  There is also the issue of economics dictating progress on future energy production, and would this be counter-productive due profits taking priority over progress and the reduction of the pollution into the environment  I agree with your comments Ian, in regard to nuclear based energy production. However, like many issues to do with progress, something catastrophic will have to take place before we realize we should have acted sooner.There it is again, the abusive and arguably ignorant use of that word “stupid”. Having reread all contributions above it seems Ali denies there’s a problem by saying there are dangerously low CO levels, John distracts by arguing the council should care more for child poverty, and Ian disparages, disparages and disparages again. Are all three attempting to harmonise from the same alt-right reactionary hymn-sheet Ian’s singular approach is getting between him and his key message. I’ve long been puzzling as to what makes the good doctorso determined to overuse petty insult so freely, but it would be helpful to know just whathis specic problem with climate change protests is. If he could but answer his own Ice Age question to Brian , his motive might become a little clearer. And apologies in advance to Ianhe has already made his point and I’ve missed it, but it wasn’t me who thought it smart to surround it with invective. Wouldn’t it be just lovelyIan could contribute tolerantly without using putdowns  It’s almost as though he needs them to build himself up# Oh. Hold on# Eureka!#Are all three attempting to harmonise from the same alt-right reactionary hymn-sheet # What a plonker, Peter, just cannot resist going political. Is thisLabour or SNP talking, he often points in both directions or is he now Green Maybe the characters on here who hate the idea of young people protesting about climate change should head down to the school and start shouting some of this stuff over the wall.But, then again, that might make them see . . . well . . . insane.Folk writing to the paper to have a go at the protesters is one of the most depressing contributions to local public debate imaginable.Hopefully, though, the usual naysayerswill only encourage them to do it more.There#s nothing wrong with anyone, of any age, having an opinion on whatever they like, and expressing it. But in their own time, only.The problem with this is that participation in this protest was permitted and facilitated,not encouraged by the education authority, which by default is an endorsement of the opinion being expressed in the protest and the timing method by which the protest was made, by the education authority.Education authorities and schools are supposed to be impartial, by granting #authorised absence# status to a politically motivated protest, that impartiality is now seriously called in to question and a dangerous precedent has been set.There was no reason other than a cynical publicity stunt for this protest to take place during the school day. If those still at school feel strongly enough to organise a protest like adults do, that#s fine, let them, but also like adults, it#ll have to happen in their own time, or they suffer the consequences of #unauthorised absence#, for it to be taken seriously.If they want to play in the big bad world, they play by the big bad world#s rules, not by special favours like this was.Only a few nutters are #impartial# about climate change these days.Do you mean that civil disobedience would have been better Well said Mark! The evident concern trollingis intended to deligitimise the voice of young people who, lets remember, are meant by right to have a say in matters that concern them. Scotland’s national curriculum intends younger learners become active and responsible global citizens. Therefore no one involved in supporting the reported protest has done any wrong, other than in the eyes of seemingly knee-jerk reactionaries who may well be hiding their true motives. Artfully comparing these identiable young people to Orwell’s unthinking farm animals, in order to subvert their point# well it more than lacks sensitivity and compassion. It is desperate, pitul and contemptible in equal measure. It may well also fall foul of observing normal standards of decency and tolerance that contributors to these pagesare meant to adhere to. Those joining the protest were not “stupid”, as has been claimed above. The overuse of that intolerant word may be though. I note you mention #Scotland’s national curriculum intends younger learners become active and responsible global citizens.# now could you explain how taking time off school and striking for the declaration of aclimate emergency makes the child an active and responsible global citizen  I rather feel they are being played by our Greeny ignoramuses and SNP political propagandists!

You could include it in your manestoyou stand for the council again.Well, Ray Purchase, it is already here.

Now do you think you could give a straight answer to a straight question  Physician heal thyself!If thorium proves viable, I would be happy for such a station in Lerwick. Safe, clean, small and less damaging than the district heating woodchip waste burner we have at present and infinitely less toxic. I also asked is that a bit too deep for you to understand  # So it seems to be!!Well done Ian, you answered the question! There was a lot of unnecessary waffling and needless aggression but you got there. So, in the incredibly unlikely event of a, totally safe, nuclear power plant being built in Shetland you’d still want it as far away from where you live as possible. Fair dos.Instead of nuclear power or gas have you ever put any thought into wind power  I’ve heard that they don’t cause any carbon pollution at all, so they’d be ideal. They’re very pretty too and scientic. Like an actual windmill, I’m a big fan.Sadly Ray, you are being misled. take Viking for example. Peat disturbance alone. over  kilometres of tracks, the ground footprint of over  square kilometres. A fair amount of COreleased there.

Just what is that carbon footprint  Laughableit was not so sad!How something you and Mark Ryan Smith may understand. The very latest scientic information on controlling climate change “Tree planting #has mind-blowing potential# to tackle climate crisis” , now would not planting a tree be a more rational action for these children  That would be the sensible, intelligent and educated option. PS, could someone please inform the SIC SNP SCT and Green Lunatics!No one here has denied climate change Brian Smith. Just a discussion on the merits or otherwise of the School children#s strike. Our youngsters being encouraged to jump on the #Greta Thunberg# bandwagon. There you really do have a sacricial lamb to the European Green lunatics but that is another really sad story!You mustcarefully, Mr T.Well, Brian, I have never denied Climate change. I just dispute the best way to combat it.Deft footwork here from Ian. His, and his hero Farage’s position # not that he cares to own up to it # is not that there is no climate change. Obviously the climate changes over time. What he is conveniently avoiding are the questions around cause and appropriate response.Please do not make up speculative little stories porkies Peter. Farage is not my hero, however, I find him infinitely preferable to Corbyn and Salmond, however, here is not the place to digress further.Will Hell freeze over before Ian tells us what he presumes the protestors are ignorant of  Answering the question he posed Brian is not too mammoth a task for him surely. I suspect he is trying to dodge it for a reason.Read and weep Peter. If your intellect stretches that far. !! In the most simple of Science, It is set out below. The protestors are ignorant of the very most basic understanding of carbon capture and the prevention of climate change. Trees!! Only the very most utterly stupid, like yourself cannot see the wood for them!It is not clear the protest had a position on biomass, however Ian has firmly stated the need for those taking any position to be able to answer #how does today’s Global Warming compare with the Global Warming scientically after and during the Second Ice Age #Ian has thus far excitedly cited three articles, none of which reference any ice age. The first: #Tree planting ‘has mind-blowing potential’ to tackle climate crisis#, has Professor Crowther emphasising #it remains vital to reverse the current trends of rising greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuel burning and forest destruction, and bring them down to zero# this is needed to stop the climate crisis becoming even worse and because the forest restoration envisaged would take - years to have its full effect##Reafforestation, necessary as it is, isn#t no silver bullet, nor a speedy enough solution, though many on the protest would likely love to plant some trees.The second and third articles focus on biomass, which is contested.To help Ian make his point, does he mean the Cryogenian, the second last ice age or the Little Ice Age  Again, other than to spread scorn and belittle, what is Ian#s actual point Sorrymy point is beyond you Peter. My question # “how does today’s Global Warming compare with the Global Warming scientically after and during the Second Ice Age ”That would require a thesis at post-graduate level to answer. Hardly space here! My point was that these children simple to not have the science to have a considered and informed opinion based on knowledge. The science is actually simple, I suggest you look it up and read it.Lest anyone thinking of studying the sciences, physical or social, be put off, Ian’s approach to advancing a scientic argument is far from typical. Thomas Kuhn made a very useful contribution by proposing that as a science advances some innaccurate claims will inevitably be made and indeed built on, but will later be corrected as sufficient contrary evidence emerges. Hawkins himself corrected some of his own foundational work. A settled consensus generally emerges over time through reasonable and reasoned dialogue and argument in which peer reviewed sources, research evidence and the thinking they provoke are made apparent.This is perhaps one reason why the Shetland Times asks contributors to observe normal standards of decency and tolerance for the opinions of others. It helps to bring forth the truth.It is, however, more than unusual for anyone taking themselves seriously to make a strong central scientic claim then refuse to back it up, clary it’s meaning or intent# unless of course Ian is proposing rhetoric, cant and distracting insult are now sciences, in which case top marks are due to the happy fellow.What a load of pretentious twaddle. You have outdone yourself here Peter. The word Science simply means knowledge, no more no less. It is just as simple as that.Whilst he remains intent on running away from clarying and substantiating his own point, here is an easier question for Ian: Why does he call Greens lunatics  There must be some point of disagreement between him and them, in his own head at least.That would be self-evident Peter. Read up the following. Bio-Fuels, palm oil plantation. Diesel fuel promotions, particulates. Germany non-nuclearpolicy,brown coal burning. Shetland exports clean gas imports polluting wood chip. Tree planting reverses CO build up, wood chip more polluting than coal burning and deforests huge areas. The EU % of renewable, Biomass .Greenies promote non-nuclear. more people killed in wind farm accidents in Uk than nuclear ever has. All the above would indicate a somewhat lunatic approach from the Greens. Now we have, using helicopters to survey Viking Energy sites as peat too unstable for tracked vehicles to reach, unbelievable!!! I hate to say the cult of #Greta Thunberg#,depression, eating disorders, and anxiety attacks,Asperger’s syndrome, high-ing autism, and OCD. She also suffers from selective mutism and self-harm. The sacricial lamb of the Greens across Europe. The inspiration behind the school strikes!!!!! Nowthat#s not lunatic, what is Ian’s position on global warming is either well grounded or is, well, hot air. He knows how this goes. Either he has a reputable theorist publishing an article in a reputable journal, or even a weblink to a news story referencing such, or he doesn’t. Because some vested interests have bought and paid for their own pet scientiststhere may be dferent opinions regarding whatever his as yet unclear point was with his unnamed and undated second ice age. If he really wants to be taken seriously he should put up or# consider his alternative.C’mon Ian, one reference to one reputable scientist backing up whatever it is you so obviously don’t want to say. You know you can do it.I am would be intrigued to opinions relating to climate change due to agriculture and what would be the answer to providing food but reducing or stopping climate change due to agriculture. I may be wrong but I believe agriculture produces  times more greenhouse gases than all of transportation put together, but this has, conveniently, been avoided by the media and scientic community. There is a terrible dilemma between producing food to this of attempting to reduce green houses gases and the progressive climate change taking place Both Ian and Greta Thunberg are right tho. We are not taking climate change seriously enough and we are confused.One minute providing grants to preserve Shetland#s peat carbon store, and the next proposing digging acres of it up, releasing all that carbon, to build Viking.Giving out paper straws in McDonalds with juice in a plastic cup .I mind askingabout planting trees on my croft. They said #oh we dont want these clumps of trees any more, not our landscape#, when I had always thought tree planting was good.Such a mixed message. Why dont we have a green rating system like we have for our washing machines. You could rate biomass, nuclear, windfarms from construction to operation in terms of green to red, so we would know where we are in the scale with our choices.Any way, still have a patch of high hill that would be great for a mini woodsI referenced Greta with a very heavy heart, a truly exploited child whose background would fire concern with any child specialist in the UK, psychologist or Social worker.Sorry, Johan, who isn#t #taking climate change seriously# Theresa May and the Tories are taking it very seriously, indeed, passing Mrs May#s unilateral # net zero# plan into law. The Treasury says it will cost over £ trillion , enough to fund the salaries of , nurses for  years.Too little for Greta Thunberg and her #Extinction Rebellion pals, apparently.This will find its way on to consumers# electricity bills, including those in fuel poverty, a clear majority of homes in Shetland #  percent, before the recent price hikes.The Shetland Labour Party that I grew up with was concerned with alleviating poverty, not creating it. They were not interested inwinning #Green Blue Peter Badges# for futile, bourgeois bagatelles like#tackling climate change#, without any hope of success.Britain, far less, Shetland, can achieve nothing alone.The only candidate to exhibit concern for Shetland#s poor is Ian Scott.Im confused. You state that the Tories are proposing  net zero and then you say Labour creating poverty.I am very seriously concerned about fuel poverty everywhere and especially in Shetland. I hope that there are no price hikes in our fuel bills, this is something we need to resist, and I also hope more help is forthcoming for retrofitting better heating systems and more insulation to improve housing quality.Please do not try to tell me what I believe.Johan, I don’t recall you ever mentioning fuel poverty before. Do you support or oppose “ net zero”, which was done in knee-jerk response to the campaigns of Greta Thunberg and her pals “Extinction Rebellion” Only, you have been supporting Ms Thunberg’s “climate emergency” campaign at local level, have you not Mrs May’s , nurses salaries for  years isn’t “emergency” enough for them, they want more.You can huff and puff as much as you like, the cost will find its way to the fuel poor, increasing their number.I put it to you that you cannot simultaneously support Greta Thunberg AND the fuel poor, whom you have now mentioned for the first time.Mr Scott has been arguing for Shetland’s poor since long before he became a councillor.No John I have not been supporting Greta#s campaign locally and yes I have mentioned fuel poverty before and I think I can support greener politics and the poor. It is an important point tho, how we are going to pay for it all. I heard somewhere the Tories are going to pay for it from the proceeds of G.Johan, I responded to your comment above that Greta Thunberg is right .You have also defended the Shetland schools strike “climate emergency” demonstration in this self, same thread.I quote: “Both Ian and Greta Thunberg are right tho. We are not taking climate change seriously enough#..etc..”That sounds awful like you think Mrs May committing  years’ worth of , nurses salaries isn’t “taking climate change seriously enough” If you are now saying that you do not support Greta Thunberg and do wish to tackle Shetland’s lamentable fuel poverty, will you be making a clear, prominent statement to that effect in your campaign literature Including your and Shetland Labour’s proposals for solving the fuel poverty The twisting of my words is really uncalled for, and completely ignoring the main point of my post which is that we need a green rating system to stop you all arguing about what is green and what is not # but then you enjoy the fight too much and would poo poo any system anyway I suppose.Strange move of support from Wir Shetland to Ian Scott  You#re scraping the barrel, now, Johan, getting personal. After your Up Helly-Aa performance, your comment about #enjoying the fight# is, frankly,a bit rich.It appears you are not prepared to make the campaign commitment I suggested. That#s ok.I#m not supporting anyone yet as I haven#t heard from all the candidates. I merely pointed out that Mr Scott is the only one so far to have shown any real concern for Shetland#s poor. He needs to say more about that. Under the present arrangements #climate emergency# will dump on the fuel poor. They have votes, too, of course # more than  percent of the electorate.Good luck with your campaign.Given his concern for the fuel poor John Tulloch will presumably be supporting whichever candidate puts the cancellation of Brexit first and foremost in their manesto  The largest driver of upward pressure on heating bills over the past two years is the devaluation of the pound following the Brexit vote. Greta Thunberg had nothing to do with it. In the event of further declines in the value of the pound post prime minister Johnson increased hard Brexit probability, the suffering of the fuel poor will continue to worsen as the wholesale price of gas becomes relatively more expensive when purchased in pounds sterling.The  dilemma that John Tulloch posed to Johan Adamson could equally well be phrased thus: I put it to you that you cannot simultaneously support Brexit AND the fuel poor.I apologiseI have gotten personal. Be as naesty as du wants, I just cant fathom why you need to be so  Breakfast TV only this morning were talking about how the market is not working, people not changing utility supplier and these people paying more as a consequence.Its surely not fairyour contract runs out that they are able to leave you on a higher rate Action on fuel poverty needs to include tackling the inequalities in the market as well as action to make our houses warmer.Ok, Johan. I’ve made my points about fuel poverty and there’snothing I want to add.So forgive meI don’t digress into bickering about who has or hasn’t been “naesty”. Readers may judge.Good luck with your campaign.Yes, Ian can answer a question when he chooses to. And there is sense in some of what he says. Wind farms on peat, for example, happen when commercial interests chase subsidies, so it is up to governments to get the correct approach. Not all that blame goes at the Green’s door, and they are either correct to claim there is a climate emergency or they are not.On the climate emergency Ian’s thoughts can only be guessed at. They have something to do with an ice-age, which is appropriate as progress towards getting him to answer his own question is, as yet, glacial.A big problem inside these debates stems from some people get beguiled by fake scientic claims. This is why genuine people making genuine scientic claims are generally happy to back them up by referencing the work of the real scientists involved. This offers folk who may or may not be less expert than Dr. Ian Tinklersome protection from charlatans with an axe to grind. Again,Ian is serious, rather than just being a contraryIan, he will reveal his ice-age source s. Or would doing so would reveal his actual movitation  C’mon Ian, youknowyouwantto.I actually sent them to the Times.

Maybe the bairns protesting about climate change holds a candle of hope up - -we are all going to need it.Graham Fleming, Thorium breakdown isotopes have short half-lives. Long term storage is nor an issue. Ask a standard grader that is beyond your understanding.Incidentally, the global stockpile of separated plutonium is about  tonnes. That is  tonnes too much, however Thorium reactors produce none at all. Sad you cannot get your facts straight Graham Flemming, so very SNP.Having read these pages for a long time Peter, it should be apparent by now that Ian is a dental surgeon by training and therefore qualies for Dr status.No need to have a PhDor any other bits of paper !Ok, well thanks to Ian, andthe Times did withhold the links as irrelevant to the school strike they maybe had a point. It was Ian that insisted to Brian Smith way back when that this issue was relevant, for whatever reason.I#m still not clear what Ian draws from these articles though, or why anyone would have to have this knowledge to take a view on the current level of threat, but I get that global warming isn#t about to lead to another ice age. I don#t recall the protest saying it would# It#s a welcome change to have Ian express himself without resort to petty insult though. Long may that continue. On his earlier point on science, however, I#m not sure most scientists would agree science means knowledge only, as Ian proposed, without including the search for it by using scientic methods.But here is the big unanswered question # whatever it is Ian take from these links # does he, or does he not, think we are facing a climate crisis  If we are then surely the kids are right to be concerned, especially as some government sponsored action on climate change is potentially green-wash.Slight problem with the colour test Johan.About % of men have problems when distinguishingbetween red and green .

The Loch Ewe farm has failed the required environmental standards for nearly  years. Mowi, despite virtually unlimited resources, were apparently unwilling or unable to make the necessary changes. broadcast in May.In January , the Scottish Parliament#s Rural Economy and Connectivity Committee agreed to undertake an enquiry into the state of salmon fishing in Scotland and in November  the regulatory body SEPA published proposals for a revised regulatory regime for the finfish sector. Within these proposals, SEPA said it would begin a programme of work to #modernise the regulation of existing sites#.Mowi#s head of environmental management, Stephen MacIntyre, said that the company wanted to #align its growth# with recent recommendations.

However,Mowi can provide evidence through EIAplanning and SEPA regulatory structure that the relocated biomass will have reduced potential impact on wild migratory fish, then we would be prepared to support biomass relocation on a conditional basis.#*A spokesperson from the Scottish Environment Protection Agency , said: “It is really encouraging to see that industry is proactively choosing to consider more sustainable locations for fish farms, away from more sensitive waters where pressures on the marine environment are greatest. “SEPA’s new regulatory framework for marine cage fish farming, launched on  June, , combines more accurate modelling and enhanced monitoring to encourage a more sustainable approach to the siting of fish farms. “In practice, we anticipate this will lead to fewer fish farms in shallower, slow-flowing waters and more fish farms in offshore locations where the environment capacity can better assimilate wastes. The new framework is designed to actively support operators who are seeking to relocate to more sustainable locations, and through improved practices and the innovative use of new technologies, reduce their impact on the marine environment.#They went on to add: “Indeed, our new framework provides exactly the type of flexibility and outcome-focus Mowi outlines it is looking for.Within this new framework, we will consider each inidual proposal on its merits against the legal standards.We encourage Mowi and other operators to work with us and other interested parties to explore their innovative proposals under our new framework.We look forward to doing so."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Kara-with-100m-IM-Gold.jpg","title":"inspirational western isles swimmer kara hanlon wins four gold medals at international island games in","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine July.And the -year old was not the only WesternIsles athlete to celebrate a podium place in the shadow of the famous rock, asmore joy followed in the pool and in the athletics stadium.Isla Budge won bronze in the -metres freestyle event, while in Thursday’s triple jump final Mary Macleod won silver and Heather MacKinnon took bronze.Eriskay jumper MacKinnon had won gold in the event in Gotland two years ago with a shorter jump than it took to win third this time around.Hanlon’s week of glory began on Monday whenshe retained the  metres breaststroke title she won in Gotland in .

Editor’s note: Robert Herbinson was born at Clonavon, Ballymena and is buried at Ration Farm Cemetery Annexe, Ploegsteert, Belgium and commemorated in Wellington Street Presbyterian Church. Ballymena Observer, September ,  - Miss Herbinson,  Hill Street, Ballymena, has been informed that her brother, Sergeant R. Herbison th Royal Irish Rleswas killed in action on Sunday, August th. Sergeant Herbinson was, prior to joining the colours, an employee in the Phoenix Weaving Factory, Ballymena.He was a member of the Ulster Volunteer Force and of Ballykeel LOL . His brother, Lance Corporal James Herbinson, Royal Irish Fusiliers, is serving at the front. A letter received from the Rev. A. Gibson, Chaplain to the Central Antrims, states that Sgt. Herbinson was killed while out on duty in no-mans land. He states:He was a most excellent soldier and a very good NCO and the regiment will miss him very much. He had done very fine work when the battalion went into action on st July and I have heard from his officers how nobly he did his duty that day. He was buried in a little cemetery near the firing line.Lt. W.B. Stuartwrote: Dear Miss Herbinson, I cannot tell you with what regret it is hat I am writing to tell you of the death of your brother. He was killed by a bullet passing through his brain so that I am glad to say that he suffered absolutely no pain. I have known your brother personally for nearly two years and I feel that I have lost a real friend as well as an excellent sergeant. I have never met anyone whom I trusted more than your brother. He was absolutely fearless and could always be depended upon to do anything.“Perhaps you have heard that he was recommended for bravery at the battle of the Somme, when, after three attempts had been made, he collected eight men of his platoon and was going to make another attack, when, luckily, he was stopped as the chance was hopeless. I was present at the funeral and he has been laid in a British cemetery just behind the firing line so there will be no dficulty in locating the grave after the war.

All the kids have been helping box the unorms, bag them, separate them out. We are still accepting donations up until next week until they are ready to be given out at St Peter’s [youth club],” he said.“We would just want to thank all those who have given their unorms, the community and Principal from St Oliver Plunkett, Mr McCabe, who put the message up on the school’s Facebook page and really ran with it.”Pastor Tony Meehan from the West Belfast Foodbank told the Andersonstown News that he had been “surprised” at the scale of the response.“The week the schools were closing no unorms had been given in, I was having a minor panic thinking people weren’t going to respond. But on the Thursday of the final week a couple of the primary schools had done a non-unorm day and told the children to bring their unorms in – two mini buses were filled full of bags of unorms,” he said. “Since then we been receiving donations every single day. We want to emphasise that there will be unorms from all schools, primary and post primary, in West Belfast available on the two days we have set aside for collection and to thank everyone who has donated so far.”Free school unorms will be distributed on July  from pm-pm and July  from am-pm at St Peter’s Immaculata Youth Club.

The portraits were removed and the offended party, a Mr Lee Hegarty, was consulted on what should replace them.”“He suggested that the portraits of Her Majesty the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh should be replaced with photographs of, at best, the Queen meeting people during engagements in Northern Ireland,\" said Lord Maginnis.“One such photograph features Her Majesty the Queen shaking hands with the former deputy first minister, Martin McGuinness, at the Lyric Theatre in Belfast.“I do not mind that what I mind is that the case brought by the complainant was settled secretly and that the sum of £, was handed over, presumably for hurt feelings and distress.“This settlement was signed off by the then secretary of state, Theresa Villiers MP, on the recommendation, I am informed, of her permanent secretary Jonathan Stephens.“I have been told to look at the annual accounts to find out where the money came from – but it is not to be found. That should concern us.”After some time had passed after the issue of compensation was settled, Lord Maginnis said that last year Mr Hegarty was promoted to become accounting officer of the Parades Commission.He said this contrasted with what he described as the years of delay in compensating victims of historical institutional abuse in Northern Ireland. He said they had been “shamefully left out in the cold when it comes to their justiable claims for compensation”.“This is scandalous. It is an indictment of the Northern Ireland Office and of this government,\" he said.“We have lost all sense of reality when a portrait of Her Majesty can cause offence to a civil servant but we do not bat an eyelid when we deny closure and justice to unfortunate people who have been abused in the most outrageous manner imaginable.“I urge the Northern Ireland Office not only to restore the original portraits of Her Majesty and the Duke of Edinburgh but to expedite payment of the comparatively paltry compensation due to the people who are more deserving than this opportunistic civil servant who, surely, must now be compromised in his position in the Parades Commission because of his bigoted stance over the Royal Family.”The Northern Ireland Office said in a statement: “We will not comment on inidual personnel matters.”"},{"url":null,"title":"dup hails open and constructive discussion on policing","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsThe TwelfthThe OpenNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday  Tour GuideFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

They have provided assurances that she will not be disadvantaged as a result of losing out on the experience of acting up nor will she be victimised in any way. The Board has also committed to liaising with the Equality Commission on appropriate training in recruitment and selection with specic focus on part-time workers.Anne McKernan, head of legal services at the Equality Commission, welcomed the result. \"This is a good result all round,\" she said. \"One of the main reasons we support cases is to effect change.\"While Catherine missed out on this opportunity, she has been able to secure a change in policy and practice that will benefit other teachers into the future. \"Its good that this has been resolved productively and amicably.\"Ms McKernan said the case should serve as a reminder to employers of the need to treat staff fairly. \"Were publicising this to remind all employers of the dficulties and dangers of disadvantaging people on flexible or part-time working arrangements, even unintentionally,\" she said.The legal expert pointed out that % of female employees work part-time in NI compared to % of male workers.Women make up % of part-time employees here. \"Because of the high concentration of women in part-time jobs, any measure which excludes part-timers from a particular post or promotion is likely to have a more adverse effect on women,\" Ms McKernan explained. \"Thats why it may amount to indirect sex discrimination.\" Ms McCormick, who will continue teaching at the grammar school, also welcomed the outcome which she believes has led to positive change. \"I love my job and am happy at the school,\" she said. \"So Im pleased that a new co-option policy has been put in place which will ensure that opportunities for career enhancement are dealt with in a formal and procedurally correct manner.\""},{"url":null,"title":"private jet numbers soar at derry airport for the open","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsThe TwelfthThe OpenNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday  Tour GuideFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

But, that short daily journey must have taken as least twice as long as it would have taken anyone  simply because almost everyone he passed knew him, stopped him and engaged in conversation with him.On the th anniversary of the school’s opening in  I was asked to help compile a book to mark the occasion. When I sat down to write a list of those who would have to be interviewed, John Dunne was the first name on the top of the pile.When I started to transcribe John’s interview it began like this: “In this era of media created ‘stars’, famous for nothing more than seeking fame-or infamy, in many cases-the tag of legend is one that is all too easily doled out.“Most people in their formative years can point to a mentor who influenced them greatly and provided knowledge and encouragement when these vital commodities were often all too scarce. More often than not, these people are unassuming and go about their lives in the same manner.“These people are society’s real legends and in the history of St Joseph’s, fewany, earned that accolade more than John Dunne.”That chapter of the book on St Joseph’s was entitled ‘One of nature’s gentlemen’, and there’s absolutely no reason to change that title for the purposes of this appreciation of John Dunne’s le because in my opinion its accuracy cannot be upgraded in any way.‘Big John’ as he was affectionately known to all former pupils of the school, made a positive mark on thousands of young lives in his four decades at St Joseph’s. It would be hard to find anyone that would disagree that the word big when applied to John Dunne not only represented his physical stature but also his intelligence and patience.By , the Dunne family had lived at Brandywell Road, Burnfoot and then back to Derry and more specically the newly developing Creggan estate.John Dunne began his career at St Columb’s College in  in the company of contemporaries such as Nobel laureates John Hume, Seamus Heaney.In  he told me: “I enjoyed the time at St Columb’s without really realising or wondering what le was about. There were people then who went back up to the College at six o’clock and studied until nine o’clock.“But, I and another man, Bill Smyth, who also ended up teaching at St Joseph’s, instead of going to the school, followed a great interest we had discovered-greyhounds. That was our main pursuit. Strangely, we both also ended up training as teachers at St Joseph’s College in Belfast which was linked to Queen’s University but separate in that it awarded its own accreditation.”It was at training college that John Dunne encountered a dilemma. Already well-known for his ability as a footballer, his lelong passion, he had to make the choice of whether he would pursue as a career as PE teacher.“I had distinct limitations, because when I was very young, I nearly died twice. When I was six months old and again when I was five, I caught pneumonia. I remember the second time and having to lie from about December to April before I came around.“I was in a sort of comatose state for a long time, but my mother God rest her, battled away and I survived. But, it left me severely limited in terms of stamina. In terms of pace, I was very quick off the mark, but I couldn’t sustain it. And, the further up you went in football, the more of a problem it became. I loved reserve football, but the full senior game was just too fast for me,” he said.In September  John began his teaching career at the newly opened St Joseph’s Secondary School in Creggan for the princely sum of £ per month. It was here that he spent the entire span of his professional le.The new school with its emphasis educating those who had not successfully navigated the old  plus exam, it was a ready-made home for John Dunne and many of his contemporaries alike. Like many of his era, John benefitted from easier access to grammar school system because of post-war changes to British education policy. But, also like many of his generation, John spoke candidly about his reservations on it. His words also revealed why he preferred the non-selective route through school.“The thing about going to St Columb’s is that we weren’t completely accepted. We were dferent somehow. The boarders who stayed there were the ‘real’ St Columb’s boys as far as the clergy were concerned.“There are things now that are still etched in my memory. Where I lived, there was a protest after a child lost a leg having been hit by a bus. The people were worried about the safety of their children so they weren’t prepared to let the bus keep travelling that route.“Anyhow, the protest could be seen from the College. A priest, who shall remain nameless said, ‘well, what would you expect from people like that ’“We took great umbrage at that. I had been through a kind of elitist system at St Columb’s, where you had to prove yourself in the first place by getting so many marks in an  plus exam, in English and Maths-and they weren’t easy. They were quite dficult examinations. I went to the Christian Brothers at they drilled us kept us on in the afternoon for an hour, got us up on Saturday mornings and drilled us and drilled us.“When I went to teach in a secondary school it was very dferent. You had children there that for one reason or another had fallen through the system. They hadn’t perhaps done themselves justice in the system that surrounded them. In my time at St Joseph’s there were children who should not have been there because they could not get anything out of the system at all, no matter how much we tried or how much sympathy we had for their position. But we did try.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refresh“I had been through a system where I met good teachers, people who had made a good impact on my le. So, what I did when I saw what they were doing was imitate them. I wove all the goodness in other people into a fabric that I could use myself, and I found that it worked,” said John.At the end of John Dunne’s first decade as a teacher, the Troubles erupted on the streets of his native city. St Joseph’s geographical location meant that major disturbances often encroached upon the school itself. It befell people like John Dunne to provide a calm backdrop to the mayhem outside the gates of St Joseph’s.In  he said: “It was a very, very strange environment to be working in, because all hell could have broken loose in the immediate vicinity of the school at any time. There were teachers out on the streets, acting as buffers, trying tom keep a lid on things.“In practical terms, I found it very hard because in summer time it was very hot and you had to open the windows to let a bit of air in. But, there were helicopters flying about and the noise was unbearable and the youngsters couldn’t hear you. A lot of young people became involved and some of them lost their lives as a consequence.”Apart from a very quick but understated wit, John Dunne was blessed with a fantastic voice, full of dramatic intonation, that would have been the envy of many stage actors.As a teacher of the English language John had the ability the bring the most boring text to le and kept his students enthralled. He could have been reading the contents of the back of a cereal box aloud, but when he spoke people listened.The ability to relate a story, complete with an array of accents when required, was one that he credited his grandfather John Downey with.“He was a great storyteller. I remember as a young boy he used to take me early in the morning for his pension. We used to go to Mass about seven or eight o’clock and then go to the train station on the Strand Road and out to Bridgend for his pension and then visit people in the area.“But when we were walking, he always told me stories about haunted houses, about what kind of flowers were at the side of the road.“There seemed to be no end to his knowledge and then he could deviate and tell me another yarn. I just thrived on his stories.“I think also it was the way I was taught at the Christian Brothers. They were very precise about language. It’s become too loose now. People are very loose, especially when using mobile phones.“I’ve even read about the use of the apostrophe being lost. I was taught these things were important when you wrote something. I stuck to it and I tried to instil it into youngsters without being overly heavy about it.”John Dunne’s dulcet tones were employed again when Derry City FC re-entered senior football in  and for many years after he commentated on many of the games played by his beloved Candystripes.This interview with John Dunne was conducted in  at Pilot’s Row community centre. At this stage he had been retired from teaching for almost two decades. But, the huge capacity that he had to retain swathes of information was still very much evident.Asto prove that very thing, in the later stages of this conversation a young boy, no more than ten or eleven years old walked past and said cheerily, ‘hello John!’Without blinking an eye, John Dunne recounted the boy’s family history and how many of his relatives attended St Joseph’s. That was proof that you could take the man away from St Joe’s, but not St Joe’s away from the man.The interview with John Dunne ended with him speaking about the five decades since the school opened.He said: “It’s been some fty years, especially for somebody like me who has finished up living in the Bogside. When I got here, I was a little bit apprehensive about being someone who worked in St Joseph’s and being accepted into the local community. But, it’s no bother. I am on first name terms with people.“I was walking over to Mailey’s pub one night in the summer about .. It was a beautul night. There was a group of young men sitting in a garden. I was walking in the middle of the road and one of them came out and addressed me by my name.“He said, ‘John, there are not many teachers that could do what you are doing and walked through this area untouched.“That’s good to know I said.”CAPTION: The late John Dunne."},{"url":null,"title":"operation motorman findings seamus bradley inquest made public next month","story":"The Inquest findings into one of the most controversial killings of the Troubles in Derry will be made public next month, the Derry News can reveal.Seamus Bradley was shot dead in highly disputed circumstances by the British Army during Operation Motorman in the early hours of July , .The Coroners Service for Northern Ireland has now confirmed that the findings of the Inquest will be announced by Judge Patrick Kinney on August  at Laganside Court in Belfast.

Durkan come after the latest public consultation attracted over  objections which he now believes will scupper plans for similar schemes in areas such as Rosemount and Bishop Street.Mr Durkan said the Department for Infrastructurehas been “extremely ham-fisted” in its handling of the consultation process.The parking scheme issue stretches back around ten years, with ious public consultations having taken place in that time. At one stage, it was expected to be introduced in  but had to be pushed back until .In  then Roads Minister Danny Kennedy gave assurances that, “in the absence of signicant objections”, the scheme would be in place no later than Spring .However, this week, after a consultation ended last April and a further information session was held in November, a spokesperson for the Department explained that the proposed Rossville Street Residents’ parking scheme received a large number of objections from the residents.Of the  responses received, there were  objections to the scheme.The DfI told the Derry News that key areas of concern coming out of the consultation included the number of permits allocated for visitors, access for family carers and concerns over costs.The Department has since confirmed that the resident and visitor permits would be free and that a special permit would be available for family carers, also free of charge.The DfI spokesperson added: “The Department acknowledges that there is still a need to manage car parking in the Bogside and is now considering how to progress matters.“Consideration is being given to advancing a smaller scheme within the Rossville area to include Abbey Park, Glenfada Park and Columbcille Court, possibly as a pilot. The Department would hope to commence consultation for a smaller scheme in September.“The Department will write out to all residents living within the limits of the original Rossville scheme as soon it is confirmed how an alternative scheme will be progressed.“The Department is not in a position to consider other schemes at this time.”StaggeringMark H. Durkan is worried that delays to the Bogside parking scheme will now hamper the roll-out of similar schemes.“The fact this is happening will now block progress on any residents’ parking scheme where in the city.“Bogside residents want a parking scheme so it must be the design of it that people are objecting to. It’s staggering that a much-needed parking scheme in an area where residents struggle and have been crying out for a solution to the problem of getting parked outside their homes during the day has been scrapped.“This scheme has been deliberated over for ten years and the department has brought proposals forward that have been met with such opposition. It begs the question, was enough done to liaise and interact with objectors, and could they respond in turn to these objections.“Bogside was identied as a key area, as was Bishop Street and the next was the lower Rosemount university area. But now it seems asthe department has pulled the plug on those schemes and there is no chance of progress.”Parallel schemesThe SDLP representative had enquired about the possibility of a similar scheme in other areas which are badly impacted by students such as Rosemount, and Abercorn Place and Terrace which are both affected by city centre workers.“These could have been done in parallel so that at least one scheme could be advanced. People in Rosemount are frustrated that they’ve been put on the back burner while this other scheme was being progressed, but they’ll be even more frustrated to see it isn’t being progressed.“Rosemount and Bishop Street will now be way down the line, the handling of this by the Department of Infrastructure seems extremely ham-fisted,” Mr Durkan added.The Rossville Street area Residents’ Parking Scheme would be the first such scheme for the City and involves over  residential properties mainly in the Rossville Street, Fahan Street, Little Diamond, Creggan Street and Chamberlain Street areas.A DfI publication in March stated that, proposals for the Scheme were first announced by the previous Minister for Infrastucture, and following informal consultations “there has proven to be signicant support from residents who are experiencing increasing dficulties parking outside their homes.”The Department wrote to all residents within the area and encouraged all interested parties to formally respond to the proposals before  April.If introduced as proposed, the scheme would have designated free of charge parking places for residents only between the hours of . am and noon and between . pm and . pm from Monday to Saturday inclusive.Visitors would have been able to park within areas designated for residents provided a valid visitor’s permit is displayed on the vehicle.

There needs to be swt action as an enhanced facility could alleviate the problem people are currently facing.A Department for Infrastructure spokesman said the current Driver and Vehicle test centre network was built around  years ago.ldquoMuch has been done to maintain and modernise the test centres in that time, particularly to meet the growing demand for vehicle tests. However, present and future legislative requirements, coupled with increasing and changing demands for testing services, mean that the current network is no longer sustainable, he said.ldquoAs such, we have been reviewing the network with a view to determining the most appropriate network of test centres to meet our future needs.

If Fascism hadnrsquot been beaten we would be living in a very dferent world today. ldquoWe would be living in fear of a regime which would not tolerate any descent. We are very lucky and should be thankful to those veterans who risked all and gave their tomorrow for our today.Cllr Hanna said the districtrsquos surviving veterans were small in number and well into their nineties, and that society owed a debt to them for their part in the battle to secure the freedom people enjoy today.He said he included the Merchant Navy in his proposal because many risked their lives on merchant ships to ferry supplies which helped win the war.ldquoThis was a cruel war where many lost their lives and I really hope we never have to face anything like this again. Those from Northern Ireland who fought and served during World War Two came from all sections of the community.ldquoBefore it is too late, I believe this council should acknowledge what these brave people did for us all by presenting surviving veterans with a silver poppy at a cross community service in November, said Cllr Hanna.He added: ldquoI hope that the council will support this motion as a mark of respect for the generation which has given us freedoms we take for granted.The SDLPrsquos Declan McAteer said he was ldquosomewhat dubious about the suggestion for the council ldquoto go out on a limb and procure silver poppy medals.ldquoI fully respect the sentiment of those wishing to identy with what is essentially a British symbol which wonrsquot by endorsed by all Irish men or women. The poppy, for better or worse, is associated with all conflicts that Britain was involved in from the First World War right through.ldquoI would say that perhaps thatwe do anything around this we

problems within the districtrsquos planning department have been laid bare in a Newry, Mourne and Down Council report which has been made public.The local authority mdash which is responsible for district planners mdash has revealed in its annual audit committee report that the current number of live planning applications in the system is just over ,.The confirmation comes after local politicians recently pointed to what they described as ldquoserious problems at council management level for not taking the planning backlog seriously enough.Politicians have expressed concern that planners are not responding to their telephone calls and emails, with people who lodge applications also concerned that they are not getting any information from officials.Elected representatives say while all the fault does not rest with planners, they are firmly of the view that there are simply not enough staff to deal with the huge volume of work.Concern has also been expressed that the planning department is having problems retaining staff to work in a department that receives the second highest number of applications across the Provincersquos  councils.Politicians say there is a need to ensure the planning department is running properly which the council explains in the new report is exactly what it aims to do.A major review of planning has already been undertaken and amendments made to the so-called scheme of delegation which is a set of rules which determines whether a planning application will be decided by the local authorityrsquos Planning Committee or planning officers.A critical look has also been taken at staffing structures in tandem with the arearsquos chief planner, with council officials conceding that while there are issues with staff turnover, positions are filled as quickly as possible.In addition, the council has admitted there is a communication issue within the planning department with the change that needs to happen something that cannot be achieved overnight.Signicantly, the new council report warns that failure to deliver timely planning decisions is a ldquorisk within the corporate risk register, with the number of live planning applications increasing, not decreasing, with the figure standing at , at the end of May.The report says an internal audit of the planningrevealed that there are a number of key controls absent from the local authorityrsquos planning system, in particular, its performance against legislative targets, the completeness and validation of documentation supporting applications and enforcement actions.The audit also points to a lack of clarity in respect of key performance indicators within the planning department and the lack of non-compliance by the local authority with its

leisure facility in Newcastle  ","story":"AMBITIOUS plans for a new community centre in the heart of Newcastle are expected to include an indoor water facility, it has emerged.Consultants have been appointed by Newry, Mourne and Down Council to complete a feasibility study on new leisure provision in the resort, with the current Newcastle Centre and adjoining Tropicana outdoor swimming pool the favoured site.Last October, the Recorder exclusively revealed that plans for a major new leisure facility in the heart of the town were back on the agenda, with consultants set to be asked to carry out a study of potential sites.Two locations were previously identied for a new multi-million pound leisure centre, with sports pitches at Donard Park the preferred option.However, councillors subsequently switched attention to the former St. Maryrsquos Girlsrsquo Primary School campus at Shanslieve Drive.Despite a number of attempts to secure the site and hopes that a deal could be agreed, it was bought by supermarket giant Lidl which recently secured planning approval for an ultra-modern new store.Recognising that Newcastle is one Northern Irelandrsquos premier tourist resorts, council officials are keen to deliver a new indoor facility which people can use all year round.Politicians are also keen for the local authority to take the lead and ensure a facility which has been talked about for decades is finally delivered in Newcastle mdash one that includes some form of indoor water facility.The council is keen to ascertain the proposed redevelopments costs for the entire Newcastle Centre site which includes the outdoor Tropicana pool and tourist information centre, the latter of which recently celebrated its th anniversary.Council officials want to know what the costs are so the scheme can be included in the local authorityrsquos capital development programme. They are keen to look at a mix of community facilities alongside some sort of indoor water leisure type facility which will replace the ageing Tropicana.In addition to plans for a new community centre, work is continuing on plans to secure a multi-million pound tourism bonanza for the resort through a series of innovative proposals.They are aimed at overhauling current tourist provision and signicantly increasing the number of overnight visitors to the resort as part of the City Deal initiative.A project board has been set up to help oversee the proposed investment initiative in Newcastle, with the local authority one of five councils paired with Belfast City Council, universities and the private sector who hope to bid for a share of a poundbn investment package to fund a series of future projects, including tourism.The local authority and its City Deal partners have committed poundm to help deliver a raft of schemes, with the remainder of the cash coming from the Treasury and Northern Ireland Executive. It is anticipated that the city deal initiative has the potential to help the councils create , new jobs over a -year period.City deals are designed to allow councils to take charge and responsibility of decisions that affect their area, do what they think is best to help businesses grow, create economic growth and decide how public money should be spent.Newry, Mourne and Down Council is hoping to secure poundm from the NI Executive and is committing poundm of ratepayersrsquo money to fund highly ambitious proposals in Newcastle aimed at shaping future tourist provision in the resort which form the core of its Mourne Gateway Project.Exciting proposals to signicantly enhance tourism attractions to draw international visitors to world class attractions in the resort include a gondola ride into the heart of the mountains and a visitor centre at the site of the old quarry at Thomasrsquo Mountain.Other proposals include an Alpine coaster ride enabling people to hurtle down the side of the mountain on a single track in a buggy, an indoor activity centre in Donard Park, elevated tree top walk in Tollymore Forest Park and a new visitor centre and bird hide at the Murlough Nature Reserve.The ious proposals remain at an early stage and continue to be developed, with the next steps involving the development of a full outline business case for the overall project..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Ross selected for youth leadership programme  ","story":"A CROSSGAR teenager has been chosen to join the first group to begin a year-long international youth leadership programme which will culminate with a once in a letime trip to Los Angeles.Seventeen year-old Ross Farrell, a Year  student at Wellington College in Belfast, has earned his place on the IGNITE programme, a joint initiative between Belfast City Airport and Cinemagic, which will provide potentially le-changing opportunities for  young people over a five-year period.He was one of several students nominated by their schools who were then required to fill in an application form.Successful applicants were invited along to a selection day at the airport where they participated in a series of role-plays, team-building exercises and an interview.Jay Roewe, senior vice president of HBO, West Coast Productions, who is widely accredited for helping to bring Game of Thrones to Northern Ireland, met with the students at the launch of the programme at the airport.Michelle Hatfield, director of corporate services for George Best Belfast City Airport, said that over the course of the year, participants will collaborate with youth organisations, foundations, charities, representatives from other businesses in the private sector and also recognised names in the field of sport, film and politics.She added: ldquoWhilst the trip will conclude at a VIP gala event in Santa Monica, it is hoped that the lessons learned and the connections made by the young people involved will last a letime.Lord Mayor of Belfast John Finucane offered his encouragement to the young people participating in the programme.He said: ldquoIGNITE holds the potential to build the confidence, leadership and social skills of every young person involved.

I also had the pleasure of meeting campaigners from across the UK as part of the Extinction Rebellion protests in Parliament.And I recently bumped into some students from Stanwell School who have been taking part in the climate strike movement and standing up for action on climate change and the climate emergency. I was glad to help get their and other constituentsrsquo voices heard on this in Parliament, because itrsquos not being debated enough - itrsquos getting lost behind other things.So whether itrsquos local action we can take on recycling and packaging, or global action on climate change and carbon emissions, we all need to do more to deal with an emergency thatrsquos going to affect us all for generations to come.I was out and about again in Penarth this weekend, along with a team of our fantastic Labour town and Vale councillors, talking to people about the forthcoming European elections. There was a lot of support for our clear Welsh Labour position backing a final say in a peoplersquos vote for the public on any Brexit deal.Following the mixed results in the local elections in England and Northern Ireland last week, there was much talk about Labour lsquobailing outrsquo the government. Let me be crystal clear on this ndash I will never lsquobail outrsquo the disastrous Tories on Brexit, and neither will the overwhelming majority of Labour MPs.We can resolve the situation, but not by any backroom stitch-up that would risk letting down both those who voted Leave and Remain. The only way forward out of this mess is to let the people have the final say on any deal. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

And under my leadership, a Conservative administration will proudly put the people of the Vale of Glamorgan first.ldquoNaturally, we are open to working with other councillors who share those ideals.ldquoOthers - including those who resigned from the Conservative party - will have to explain to voters where they stand on these issues - and I would urge them to back us, rather than propping up a Labour administration that was rejected by the Vale at the last election.Cllr Bailey said he had a six-point plan for the Vale.He pledged to deliver the Dinas Powys bypass stop inflation-busting council tax rises scrap proposed parking charges review the local development planto curb inappropriate development protect rural schools and oppose the Barry Biomass plant.Cllr Bailey said that he was also keen to improve engagement with the public, after a series of hugely unpopular decisions taken by the existing cabinet.He said: ldquoDuring the elections in , we promised to build a stronger relationship with local residents by consulting them on key decisions.ldquoUnfortunately, too many people feel that their views are simply being ignored and that Vale consultations are just tick box exercises. Take the proposals around car parking charges, or the closure of Llancarfan School. I donrsquot think anyone outside of the Civic Offices believes that those decisions werenrsquot already done deals, and thatrsquos simply unacceptable.ldquoAnother good example is the councilrsquos failure to listen to the public over Penarthrsquos original Victorian lamp posts.ldquoIrsquove been criticised for wanting to listen to the people who elected me, and I make no apologies for that. Under my leadership, thatrsquos exactly what would happen and whilst I do accept that there are dficult decisions to be taken, we have to take the public with us - not ignore their legitimate concerns. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Although a relative newcomer to the site, having previously taught in Newport, it is clear he is immensely proud of the students and staff.ldquoVisitors to the school often comment on the warm, friendly and purposeful environment that exists at Stanwell and, despite its size, they see how the school cares about the inidual child and their progress, he said.ldquoThe schoolrsquos Mission Statement is summarised as lsquoLearning to Excelrsquo and this is the vision for every child, whatever their starting points, interests or talents. The school thrives because we have a fantastic team of teachers, teaching assistants, support staff, parents and governors who help make this vision a reality.ldquoThis is what makes the school so successful because everybody gives so much.Wandering through a theatre the school uses to put on assemblies and biannual productions, Mrs Kynaston pointed out a section of floor that moved away to create an orchestral pit. The production value afforded to every department ndash theatre, maths, sports, English ndash was astounding.ldquoWe try to give our pupils the very best, said Mrs Kynaston. ldquoWe want them to truly reach their potential. To excel.Mr Brown agreed. ldquoOur amazing staff believe in every young personrsquos potential to succeed and really do go the lsquoextra milersquo for pupils, he said. ldquoOur pupils flourish academically but also as well rounded, confident young people ready to contribute to society.The extra-curricular provision at the school is broad and this really helps to develop our students confidence and skills beyond the classroom setting.That extra-curricular provision is a key focus for the school.Lessons finish at .pm, earlier in the day than most other schools, but that affords pupils plenty of time to take on other pursuits.The school offers a huge number of activities, ranging from the expected - rugby, football, hockey, theatre and orchestra - to the esoteric, like German Film Club or Cipher Club.School trips in recent years have taken students to such exotic destinations as Costa Rica, Iceland, Borneo, Morocco, Spain, Germany, France, and Italy, allowing students to soak in culture both at home and abroad.Clearly, a huge pupil base allows for a huge number of options.The schoolrsquos ability to bring such a population to the table, and keep them focussed, has produced excellent results.In the last fty years alone, it has produced Olympians, rugby internationals, Members of Parliament and television presenters.It has ties to Nasa, and men who walked on the moon have visited the school for talks.Its most curious claim to fame comes in the form of a mascot painted on a wall.Emma Davies, a former pupil of the school, had a design chosen as the official Welsh Wenlock ndash the Olympic mascot for the London  games.But Stanwell flourishes academically, as well.In its  GCSE results,  per cent of Stanwell pupils achieved at least their expected grades, compared to  per cent of the rest of Wales. The same story went for maths, with  per cent again hitting their expected target or better, against  per cent of Wales.       ,params: .pushAt A level,  per cent of all grades were A* or A, with  per cent of the year group achieving A* to C overall.A level results put Stanwell students amongst the top performers in Wales, with many iniduals securing exceptional grades.  of themachieved the equivalent of three A grades or better.Three of its pupils went to Oxford University last year, while another earned a place at Cambridge University.Mr Brown said: ldquoWe place a large emphasis on listening to our learners and and our pupils make a dference as leaders in the school, whether itrsquos through well established groups such as our school council, eco-committee or charity committee, or in aspects of teaching and learning where we have subject prefects and learner voice groups.ldquoThey help us evaluate our work as a school and plan for the future.ldquoWhat always comes through is how proud they are of their school.Rightly so. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log        ,params: .push-- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

The renaming of our on-air studio to ldquoThe John Wilce Studio was a popular choice to recognise his outstanding dedication.ldquoJune  wouldrsquove been Johnrsquos th birthday, so this we felt really was a fitting tribute and a lovely memorial to all those who knew him, as a constant reminder of his contribution to Radio Glamorgan.Mr Wilce regularly presented on Sunday evenings, often dedicating features to listeners. Without fail he played a Beatles track every time he was on air.When Mr Wilce was off-air, he oversaw and maintained broadcast equipment, actively engaged in fundraising and stood as a trustee, assisting with the day-to-day running of the station.Jamie added: ldquoI speak on behalf of everyone at RG to say it was a privilege to know John, not only as a fellow volunteer but as a friend. He always put everyone  first and his patience was beyond words. His music knowledge was phenomenal and the impact he had on everyone he met, not just at Radio Glamorgan has really come to light since his passing.Michelle Fowler, volunteer services manager at Cardf and Vale University Health Board, said: ldquoItrsquos such a wonderful tribute to rename the studio after John.

The coalition also includes Llantwit First Independents.This is where the new leadership stands on the key issues facing the Vale:Parking chargesCllr Moore said new parking charges proposed by the previous administration, which included town centre car parks, coastal resorts and country parks, will be reviewed.He said new parking charges are likely in the Vale, but they will be ldquorealistic.Cllr Moore said: ldquoWe have to be sensible. Some of the things put forward previously were off the wall, they went too far.ldquoIt will be a full revamp of everything. Whatever we do wersquore not going to fleece the residents of the Vale.ldquoWe may have to make some changes. It does cost money to provide car parking. There are things we will have to start charging for. It will be realistic and fair for everybody.School improvementsThe new cabinet says delivering on major new school buildings is a priority for the new administration.Developments in the pipeline include new builds forPencoedtre and Whitmore High Schools, and expansion and refurbishment of Ysgol Gymraeg Bro MorgannwgAgeing schools in the Vale are set to get a pound. million cash boost for repairs.Llancarfan Primary SchoolLlancarfan Primary School was set to be lsquoclosedrsquoand moved to a new pound million facility in Rhoose.The previous cabinet had approved the plans despite protests from parents and campaigners.Cllr Moore said Llancarfan School move was ldquopremature - but did not commit to scrapping the plan entirely.ldquoIf itrsquos justiable itrsquos justiable, he said. ldquoIf itrsquos not, we will look at alternatives.ldquoItrsquos not an easy decision to take. Itrsquos something we have to take some time about.ldquoWhat Irsquom not going to do is jump or kowtow to people who shout the loudest.Cllr Burnett has previously tweeted the closure of Llancarfan ldquowouldnrsquot be happeningLabour were running the council.New roadsWork continues on outline business cases for two major new roads being proposed ndash the A to M link around Pendoylan and Dinas Powys Bypass between Barry and Cardf ndash but no decision has been made whether either will actually go ahead.The future of both roads rests on whether Welsh Government and the council deem them viable, and whether ministers cough up the cash to fund them.But Cllr Moore said he doesnrsquot think Welsh Government will find the money required for the Dinas Powys Bypass.ldquoItrsquos out of our hands, he said.IncineratorCllr Moore said he believes Welsh Government will order the Barry Biomass incinerator to carry out an environmentalimpact assessment.Cllr Moore, who has previously attacked what he termed ldquoscaremongering and lies around the biomass plant, said he did not want the facility in Barry Docks.He said: ldquoWe opposed it vehemently, both as a council and as a party and personally. It shouldnrsquot be there.ldquoBut now it is there it has to operate within legal parameters.ldquoIf it does, therersquos nothing anyone can do about it.The council refused the original planning permission for the facility, but a planning inspector allowed it in  following an appeal. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

We believe it is important that all families feel welcome in the school. Education is a partnership between home and school with a shared responsibility based on trust and mutual understanding and the co-operation and participation of parents with our school in the education of their child is positively encouraged.ldquoA good relationship between school and home builds a childrsquos confidence, aids their learning and helps them to fulfil their potential in all areas.They stressed that the children had an equal say in their education, through the use of techniques like lsquoImmersion Daysrsquo ndash where pupils have a multi-sensory experience of any given topic.These learning opportunities have ied from using LEGO in building new robot designs and solving problems, to visits from STEM experts. businesses and education experts.The pupils develop a basis from these experiences from which to draw questions and interests, while the staff ask for pupilsrsquo ideas about how they would like to learn further.ldquoWe recently we had an Immersion Day on the topic of volcanoes, said Mr Gilbert. ldquoA few of the pupils mentioned ways they would like to learn more about the subject. When we followed their suggestions a few weeks later, they were incredibly enthused ndash it really focuses them, develops their engagement.These pioneering techniques of giving the children an equal say in their education have a proven record.Albert Primary featured in Estynrsquos lsquoRecognising excellence in education and trainingrsquo publication for its innovative approach.The publication said: ldquoThe school provides pupils with an excellent range of high quality learning experiences.Mr Gilbert said: ldquoMost importantly the inspection report captures the ethos of our school and, in particular, it confirmed that we are achieving our aim to make the school a happy and secure place in which pupils grow in confidence and independence.Albert Primary also earned an award for being the top performing primary school in Wales in recognition of their implementation of the Renaissance Reading programme, and the impact it has on their childrenrsquos reading progress.The staff were experienced and enthusiastic. During the tour, I was treated to a brief rehearsal of the schoolrsquos summer production ndash The Lion King. The youngsters performing looked genuinely thrilled to be involved, and were remarkably talented singers.There is plenty of sport provision, with the deceptively spacious grounds playing host to several open tarmac areas and courts. Football, basketball, rounders, cycling and more were on offer, along with chess, drama and music clubs. For those looking to go off school site, Belle Vue Park is feet away from the front entrance, and often works with the school.This year, Albert Primary has been awarded the prestigious Platinum Flag Award after previously gaining three Green Flag Awards thanks to the environmental education programme, Eco-Schools.But no school is without its problems.A major concern for Albert Primary is having to balance a large deficit budget. In order to do so the school has lost a number of agency learning support staff, with the deputy head taking on a greater teaching commitment next year to make up for the shortfall.Another blow came after four years of saving and planning to convert a disused toilet block into a teaching and community centre.The funds, totalling pound,, had to be used to offset the deficit budget instead. The proposal was to refurbish the existing outbuilding to provide a new classroom facility for the oversubscribed main school to use, alongside the community.The governors are currently creating a task group of stakeholders to address future funding sources.But the spirits of the pupils and staff have not been dampened by financial dficulties.ldquoI believe that we are extremely fortunate in Albert Primary to have created such a positive and vibrant environment in which our children can learn, said Mr Gilbert. ldquoIt is the dedication and commitment of its staff and everyone associated with the school that makes Albert Primary the school that it is today ndash successful, happy and continually improving.Albert Primary was founded in  to accommodate all ages of children up to school leaving age.Much of its original character has been preserved and it now holds Grade  listed status. The school has some unusual Victorian artwork by Norton Nante and parts of the school were designed by highly respected Victorian architect J Coates Carter.A Victorian mural on the front of the building shows several children hard at work. One of them is holding a pet mouse on a lead.It is clear that this quirky attitude to learning has been present and successful in the school for a long time.Long may it last. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Ulster Business speaks to director Clare Kelly about a burgeoning firm which is leading the way in more than just business, but connectivity, co-working and wellness for its members Eighteen years ago and in its early stages of infancy, Glandore began its le in one building at Fitzwilliam Square in Dublin – capable of hosting just  members.Fast forward to the present day and it’s an all-island business with an -strong workforce across nine locations in Belfast, Dublin and Cork – playing host to as many as , people. And it’s very much a family-owned and run business, led by founder Michael Kelly with daughters Clare, Fiona and Rebecca each as directors within the company.Glandore’s high-end flexible working spaces have been up-and-running in Belfast for  years – with capacity for  members across its two locations here. However, the family’s connection to the city dates back to , when Michael first bought - Arthur Street, now Arthur Place.It’s been at the forefront of attracting some of the leading international foreign direct investmentto Belfast, working closely alongside Invest NI to bring in cyber-security and technology firms from the US and beyond – first setting up here in . Glandore offers its members a wide iety of flexible office space, co-working and hot-desking – designed so companies can grow organically. But it’s also focused on bringing its members together, connecting indigenous and international firms, while also considering wellness in the workplace, and improving its green credentials. Clare Kelly is a director of the family business – a qualied occupational therapist and Trinity College graduate, who joined Glandore in .She’s now tasked with focusing on the key marketing and business development elements of the burgeoning company – attracting and retaining members, and ensuring there remains a strong pipeline of clients.“We offer our members a erse range of services,” Clare tells Ulster Business. That includes short-term hot-desking for small businesses with just a handful of employees, to providing flexible high-end office space for companies with dozens, or hundreds of workers.”And while the flexibility allows firms to scale from small numbers to a larger workforce – taking short-term space for as little as just three months – Clare says many of the companies stay for several years, orto Glandore further down the line in their own business journey.“We also host a range of events, and can bring everyone together through the network of our members. That has allowed us to cater from very early start-ups, right through to the largest multi-national company, or scaling FDI business,” Clare says.“The dference with Glandore is the flexibility. A company may wish to bring in one or two people, and then concentrate on recruitment – but they can then scale with their growth, from say  to  people. “That flexibility and scale is key. In terms of Glandore, we are offering high quality space, but also offering a range of business services to our members.”Across its two Belfast city centre flexible workspace buildings, Glandore’s expanding network means it can now host around  members – with locations at Arthur House and the nearby Arthur Place.It has six locations in Dublin, including the Silicon Docks and Central Business District, and has boasted a long list of foreign direct investment firms, including Facebook, Twitter, Dropbox and Smartbox, and has also opened its newest office space building in Cork city.Glandore has forged strong relationships with Invest NI – helping provide high-end working environments for rapidly expanding FDI businesses – along with Belfast City Council, the Belfast Chamber and Northern Ireland Chamber of Commerce and Industry.Some of its high profile international current, or former members, include cyber-security experts Rapid , digital marketing firm Bazaarvoice and global payments giant Cayan – a company which has now expanded into its Belfast headquarters at City Quays.The quality and bespoke nature of the offices are part of what helps Glandore stand out from the crowd. Clare says firms are able to specy exactly what they want, with a top-end design and fit-out team on hand to develop a specic working environment for each business.“When Glandore was set up by Michael in , he always focused on a high quality working environment,” Clare says. “We take premium office space in premium locations, and there is no expense spared in fit-out.“We provide a bespoke set up – whether they need a co-working space or a virtual office, for example. We can tailor that for each business. It’s not a cookie-cutter approach.”And while she says design and the aesthetics are important, behind the decor is the IT and security infrastructure to ensure that guests have the very best available to them.“We have always invested heavily in our network, and have our own on-site IT. We have an IT director, manager and team – so there is support even before day one. All of these things are important to firms of all sizes.”For Glandore, it’s not simply about putting guests on seats – there’s much more to the offering. “We have such a erse mixture of companies in the network and community, and we are able to mix the indigenous firms with the international companies, and actively, facilitate connections between our members.”That includes an alumni programme, which sees members past and present ing to celebrate their successful partnerships.“We bring back customers from the last  years, and representatives from Invest NI and Belfast City Council. It’s about making the connections between the current scaling members and those which have come before,” Clare says.“That support is invaluable. It can be very isolating in the those days when you are setting up, so it’s great to have someone you can bounce ideas off.”Glandore goes further still, with the introduction of both the Glandore Wellness Programme and Glandore Green Initiative – the latter focused on creating a greener and more sustainable office space.“We have been working with these companies for several years, and we get a bird’s-eye view,” Clare says. “One thing we have been very mindful of is the need for us to support from a wellness perspective.“We offer a complimentary wellness programme, which started in , long before it became a buzzword. It offers a way for our members to connect with each other, and help in retaining talent.”And while almost every business has experienced some Brexit-related impact, Clare says Glandore has reached its highest occupancy rate in its history – rising to % in Belfast.“It has been a very uncertain time and that has impacted businesses across Northern Ireland. There have been some delays in regards to FDI, but our hats go off to Invest NI which still attracting businesses into Northern Ireland.”And while there’s also scope for further growth in Belfast, there’s potential for that demand to move outside Belfast, with a potential to grow into the North West.“The hope is to continue our expansion as an all-island business, having operated on both sides of the border for  years, with capacity to grow the businesses in Belfast.“With the likes of Derry, that would be something on the agenda for Invest NI as part of its remit to win investment for outside Belfast. We will take the lead from the councils and from Invest NI, and we will look to see where we can add. If there isn’t space for a business to land, people will go where.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/nstreet1.jpg","title":"belfasts north street arcade to be redeveloped","story":"Posted on Tuesday  June  by John Mulgrew A former Belfast shopping arcade left derelict after being gutted in a blaze more than a decade ago could be brought back to le amid fresh development plans.

It’s been sitting empty for  years, but once played host to a range of popular Belfast stores, including DJ and local punk pioneer Terri Hooley’s record shop, Good Vibrations. The plans to redevelop the arcade are included in a revised scheme called Tribeca Belfast – formerly Royal Exchange. UK developer Castlebrooke is planning to redevelop much of the north side of the city centre as part of a £m scheme. It’s made a number of amendments and changes to the development, most notably revising back from a formerly retail-led scheme to one with fewer shops. Tribeca Belfast includes development around Royal Avenue, Donegall Street, North Street, Garfield Street and High Street. Castlebrooke Investments says it is now committed to bringing North Street Arcade back into use in a new format, with space designed for independent retailers. It has also been announced that architectural design firm Squire  Partners has been appointed to work on the amended proposals. The team from Squire  Partners will work alongside conservation architects from Belfast-based Consarc Design Group. Neil Young, chief executive of Castlebrooke Investments, said: “We are very pleased to be able to reveal our proposed amendments to our outline planning application for Tribeca Belfast, changes which we feel demonstrate that we have listened to feedback from the city. “We will continue to listen and today we have launched a voluntary public consultation process into these planned changes ahead of the submission of our application. Our community exhibition will provide an opportunity for anyone interested to see the new plans and we will be revealing more information about this in the coming weeks.” Murray Levinson, partner at Squire  Partners, said: “The mix of uses across the site – designed to attract a iety of retail, restaurant, cultural and workplace tenants – and the creation of new public realm, will ensure this part of Belfast will be active throughout the day and into the evening. Providing a large number of residential apartments with shared gardens, as well as a hotel, will create a new opportunity for people to live in the city centre.” And Graeme Moore, specialist conservation architect at Consarc Design Group, said: “Consarc Design Group is delighted that we continue to be involved with the proposals for Tribeca Belfast to offer our expertise in building conservation. As with the previous proposals, all of the listed buildings within this phase are to be retained, restored and adapted for a sustainable ongoing use within the masterplan, rooting the new development in the unique historical character of this part of the city centre.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/droad_1.jpg","title":"major new apartment building planned for dublin road","story":"Posted on Friday  June  by John Mulgrew The Dublin Road in Belfast A new serviced apartment building could be developed along Belfast’s so-called ‘Golden Mile’ on the Dublin Road, it can be revealed.

Peter Allen, partner at Deloitte, said: “For  years, the Technology Fast  awards have celebrated the success and growth of Ireland’s leading indigenous technology companies. “It is fantastic to be able to look back and see how some of the companies which appeared on the Fast  list in the early days have become global businesses and market leaders. “The likes of First Derivatives and Novosco, who were early stage tech companies when they first made the Fast , are now major employers and shining lights within the NI economy.” One of the few Northern Ireland companies to have topped the Fast , appearing in it  out of the  years since the ranking’s inception, is Newry-headquartered financial software company First Derivatives.

Among its key points, it says a ‘no deal’ “could lead to a sharp increase in unemployment, with at least , jobs at risk, based on EU export exposure”. “The impact of EU tarfs could reduce NI’s exports to Ireland by % and the inclusion of non-tarf barriers could see a decline of %,” it says.
