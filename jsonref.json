The vast majority of people live in rural areas, where the expansion of settlements and agriculture is slowly thinning the forest edge by cattle and plough. Preserved as an act of faith for centuries, these forests are proof of the power of spiritual ideas to create sustainable landscapes. Seen from above, the forests are demarcated by the stark boundary between sacred and secular, church and field, work and rest. They are places detached from everyday life yet central to it, informing human work and relationships within society. Like other objects within Orthodox traditions, the forests direct the worshipper to look beyond what is visible. Entering them, the arid silence of subsistence farmland gives way to the forest’s cool, fragrant air, filled with a cacophony of living song. The sounds of insects, birds and monkeys rise with human voices into the canopy and up to the heavens. Generations come and go under the same ancient trees as their ancestors. The symbol of the tree is at the heart of the Christian story, from the tree of life standing in the Garden of Eden in Genesis to its redemptive role in Revelation, bridging the river of life and bearing fruit for the healing of nations. The story of Eden has been shared in Ethiopia for millennia – well before the Aksumite kingdom adopted Christianity around 325AD, and even before a tree came to symbolise the global faith. Today, in Ethiopia, each church forest is seen by its s as a miniature Garden of Eden. The religious significance of the forest is equalled by the importance of its ecological function. These sacred oases raise water tables, lower temperatures, block destructive winds and are home to yield-boosting pollinators essential to surrounding agriculture. The forests are, therefore, genetic repositories vital for the future survival of human life in Ethiopia. Priests who do not protect these natural resources are deemed to have failed in their mission, and since understanding the global importance of the forests they care for, the priests have become even more committed to the cause. The vast church forest network, covering an area the size of England and Wales, has the potential to offer a significant barrier to desertification in this region. For now the task is to strengthen what remains by the simplest solution possible: building conservation walls around the forests that keep grazing cattle out and allow vegetation to regrow. Only 20 churches, all supported by church forest experts Dr Meg Lowman and Dr Alemayehu Wassie Eshete, have walls, and only a few hundred out of the many thousands are viable habitats. All need protecting. Yet, as unique as they are, these forest churches are not merely a localised cultural novelty: Ethiopia’s grassroots and spiritually motivated conservation efforts sit within a global context of efforts to resolve our ecological crises. In the secular west, we can easily overlook spiritual viewpoints as we seek ways to restore and protect the environment, despite the roots of the modern environmental movement being spiritual. As these photographs show, spiritual beliefs still have the power to conserve and heal.

He then visited the restaurant of Nusret Gökçe, Salt Bae’s real name, who posted the video to TikTok showing him feeding Lam gold-covered meat directly into his mouth. Meals at the restaurant, slated hilariously in an indirect review by my colleague Jay Rayner, can cost thousands of pounds. As Vice magazine put it: “There’s nothing more 2021 than Salt Bae feeding a communist party official gold-plated steak after a climate change summit.”Changes in behaviour are needed to tackle the climate emergency, the UK’s chief scientific adviser told the summit. He said behaviour change was starting to happen but needed to go further and said he now cycled to work, ate less meat and had taken the train to the climate summit in Glasgow.  He also said that the climate crisis was a far bigger problem than coronavirus and would kill more people if changes were not made now. Canada’s chief scientific adviser, Mona Nemer, said there would need to be a “profound behavioural and cultural change in terms of our relation to the Earth”. Speaking to my former  colleague Adam Vaughan, now at New Scientist, Vallance added: They point to the Hasdeo Forest in Chhattisgarh, home to a roughly 20,000-strong Aasi community, where two coal mines are already operational, and a third, Parsa, to be operated by the mining giant Adani, has been approved.In its own unique take on renewable energy, Glaswegian nightclub SWG3 is hoping to become the first in the world to create a heating system powered by the body heat of dancers. The human body emits 100 watts of heat when resting, and more when exercising.  SWG3’s Bodyheat project will see this heat captured through air conditioning and piped through to twelve 150m-deep boreholes beneath the venue. The energy can then be used immediately to cool the audience, or stored underground for months until it’s needed to heat the building.  “The great thing about this project is that it talks directly to our audience and it’s accessible where people can come to a gig or a club and contribute to this system,” managing director Andrew Fleming-Brown told the Scotsman. The venue had planned to trial the new technology during Cop26 but its completion date has been pushed back to early 2022.  “This is our innovative contribution to a global issue, and will help us to dramatically decrease our energy consumption – bringing us one step closer to becoming a carbon-neutral venue in the not so distant future,” said Fleming-Brown.Jonny Marsh from the group told BBC Radio Scotland this morning that the event theme “definitely falls under the umbrella of greenwashing”. “Some of the companies and people in that room such as Claire Perry, one of the directors and an ex-president of Cop, have known since the 80s about detailed research into climate change, so to have them posit themselves as the solution is ridiculous when they’ve known about it for decades.” Marsh added: “We were there to amplify the voices of those who haven’t been invited to such an exclusionary event, the indigenous folks of the world and the global south who are most affected by climate change don’t have a seat at the table.” There were 16 arrests at the protest.“This is the highest level of concern we have ever seen, almost certainly due to the impact of Cop26 on public awareness,” said Anthony Wells, director of YouGov’s political and social opinion polling. “What remains to be seen is whether climate change remains such a high priority once the conference moves on.”The former US president referred to Scotland as the “Emerald Isle”. Cue outrage. Next we’ll be hearing he doesn’t like Irn-Bru.The pledge will fit with the UK government’s commitment to the entire country being net zero by 2050. The NHS in Scotland has committed to being a net zero carbon emissions health service by 2045, while in Wales the ambition is for the public sector to be collectively net zero by 2030. The health and social care secretary, Sajid Javid, said: “As a health community, we cannot simply sit on the sidelines - we must respond to climate change through urgent action, with global collaboration at its core.” Speaking at NHS Scotland’s Sustainability Conference today, Scotland’s health secretary, Humza Yousaf, underlined the fact that the climate emergency is not just an environmental crisis but also a public health crisis.According to the FT, Volkswagen and Toyota, the two largest motor giants, are holdouts, with the former reportedly refusing the deal outright.  Two UK officials also said Germany, China and the US had not signed, although there is some optimism that the Americans might yet overcome fears of the domestic backlash and ink the deal. Various reasons have been given for not signing the deal, including the carmakers’ belief that the transition to green vehicles will not happen fast enough in some of their key markets. Volvo, GM, Ford and Daimler have all agreed to sign. The collective pledge would work toward ending sales of polluting car models by 2040.Modelled on the better known Fossil Fuel Treaty, the treaty aims to “put food systems at the forefront of combating the climate crisis”. It calls for a shift to healthier, sustainable, plant-based diets to mitigate the effects of the environmental damage caused by rearing animals for meat. Simon Kofe stood in a suit and tie to deliver his speech about Tuvalu’s struggle against rising sea levels. “We are sinking,” he said. “But so is everybody else.” Remember: the key goal of Cop26 is to keep the chance of limiting global heating to 1.5C alive. But there is much work to do to achieve this in the summit’s final week. Meanwhile, the news overnight is that a billion people will be affected by extreme heat stress if the climate crisis raises the global temperature by just 2C, according to research released by the UK Met Office.  The Met Office assessed wet-bulb temperature, which combines both heat and humidity. Once this measure reaches 35C, the human body cannot cool itself by sweating and even healthy people sitting in the shade will die within six hours.

Photograph: iStockIt’s hard to know if the companies that sit on this page’s bold step each week aren’t listening to what people say about them or just don’t give a rashers but one depressing thing a recent customer service report card makes clear is: it is worse they are getting and not better.The CXi Report has been released by the CX Company every autumn since 2015 and by its reckoning, the level of customer experience people get from the top 150 or so companies doing business in Ireland has declined by 10 per cent over the last six years.While many companies’ customer experience (CX) scores benefitted from something of a Covid bounce last year, as they worked harder to make things better in terrible times, the pandemic has dragged on and this year it is more a case of a Covid hangover.The overall CX score fell 4.4 per cent compared with the 2020 figure, making it the biggest year-on-year decline recorded since the survey began. It also means Ireland’s CX score is now at a seven-year low, having recorded a cumulative fall of 10.8 per cent since 2015. And it’s not like things were any good in 2015.Pharmacies and coffee companies have had a strong performance through Covid and make up seven of the top 10 companies, while supermarkets have also done well.However, the entertainment, delivery and telecoms sectors are among the worst performers in the survey, which was carried out by Amárach Research on behalf of the CX Company and based on a cross-section of Irish consumers who were asked for feedback on their experiences with 151 companies across 11 sectors.The identity of the company that featured on the bottom of the pile this year will not come as a surprise to many readers of this page, and the firms who finished just ahead of them won’t exactly shock people out of their socks either.Drum roll please. The worst company for customer experience in Ireland in 2021 was . . . Eir. It replaced Ryanair at the bottom of the heap, although there is no reason for Ryanair to get out the bunting, as it finished third-last just ahead of Facebook which was ranked as the second-worst company in Ireland.All told, almost one in two – or 44 per cent – of Eir’s customers said the company had failed to meet their expectations over the last year, while 25 per cent said the same about Ryanair.The Department of Social Protection and Irish Water were both on 24 per cent, while Sky also fared badly with 23 per cent of its customers saying it had failed to meet their expectations.The Passport Service, the National Lottery, Adverts.ie and Abrakebabra were among the other companies who did badly in their customers’ eyes, recording big falls in the annual chart.At the other end of the table, the credit unions finished on top of the pile for the seventh year in a row, making it the only brand to have maintained a constant presence in the top 10 since the survey began.Customer service proved to be no game for Smyths Toys which moved up 30 places to claim second, thanks – at least in part – to what CX Ireland describes as a “highly efficient pick, pack and ship operation which they created in record time”.Hickeys, McCabes, Lloyds, McCauleys and Boots all made the top 10, proof of the important role pharmacies played in keeping customers well – especially vulnerable patients – and in helping to battle the virus through the vaccination programme.Supermarkets continue to perform well – this year they are represented in the top 10 by Aldi, which replaced Lidl – indicating the important role they have played in the past year.Some of the biggest jumpers in the 2021 league table included Energia, Lifestyle Sports, Free Now and An Post Money.Two of the new entrants are coffee companies, Nespresso and Butlers Chocolates, who both devised novel ways of serving customers who still wanted to treat themselves.The chairman of The CX Company, Michael Killeen, described Eir’s treatment of its customers as appalling. “The telecom sector has been one of the poorest performers in our survey over the last seven years,” he says. “While Eir is the standout offender and seems more focused on making money for its owners rather than doing what’s right for their customers, its competitors Sky and Virgin would also recognise more work needs to be done to deliver greater customer experiences.”He noted that “entertainment and travel obviously faced huge challenges this year and this goes a long way to explaining their poor performance”.He added: “Logistics and delivery is a new sector this year and one where companies are struggling to keep up with increased demand. The other key issue for companies such as Fastway, UPS, Parcel Motel, DHL and An Post is managing the resolution of issues when they arise.“The financial sector hasn’t had a great Covid and its response to the current high levels of attempted fraud has been underwhelming to say the least. The public sector is another which could do better – the Department of Social Protection and even the HSE failing to meet customer expectations.”Post-Covid: ‘Goodwill is fading fast and customers have a lot less tolerance’ Cathy Summers of CX Ireland is the author of the report and she described, with a degree of understatement, the low score as “a concern”.She accepted that since early 2020 companies had been battling the effects of Covid, but said they now needed to “refocus their efforts on enhancing the customer journey and overall experience”.Summers suggested: “Post-Covid indecision and fatigue appear to be taking a toll on companies and their approach to CX. As a result, customers are losing out. Whereas these very customers were quite forgiving during Covid as organisations struggled to adapt to new processes and procedures, that goodwill is fading fast and customers have a lot less tolerance now. Especially if there are long delays answering or communicating with the organisation.”She added: “During Covid many companies invested in digital solutions to interact with customers as a necessity due to lockdowns. While these can work well and yield savings, sometimes, they can be more focused on the short-term needs of the company rather than the needs of the customer. In our report, we are seeing a real hunger from customers to get back to personal one-on-one interactions. They want empathy and reassurance sometimes they just want to talk to a fellow human being.”How the rankings work Summers also explained how the rankings work. People who take part are asked to rank the companies they have had dealings with out of 10, with any score over eight deemed to be an excellent customer service experience.In 2015 the average across all the companies assessed was 7.06, while this year it stands at 6.32. There are very few brands who got more than eight.She said the top ranking of the credit unions was a “phenomenal achievement”, even though their score did fall slightly this year when compared with 2020. They were still significantly ahead of the chasing pack and pointed to “a gap of 75 per cent between their score and the bottom brand score”.She said Smyths employees “went out of their way to help customers”, and suggested that often it was the little things staff did that made all the difference. “It might be a small thing but it made a big difference, and those experiences are driven by people, humans. I think one of the overall themes of this year’s report was that digital is important and customers want to do things digitally but, you know, they’re very much a transaction. There’s no emotional connection there – and that’s what you need to create that experience.”Summers said: “Doing the right thing is what customer experience is all about. It is about being able to empower employees to make those decisions to pick up the phone and ask somebody if they’re actually having problems, to take that common sense approach, you know, like imagining if it was your brother, mother, granny or whoever, what would you do to help them out?”She said too many companies trained their frontline employees “on processes and systems, and they don’t actually remember that their employees are people as well and there’s a really strong link between employee experience and customer experience – because if your employees aren’t having a good experience, you can’t expect them to give one to customers. A lot of it for me comes down to how much the employers trust the employees to actually, you know, do the right thing, use their common sense. And obviously, yes, they need support in terms of education, training, but being able to be empowered to do the right thing. And also know that if they do make a mistake, you know, it’s not the end of the world.”She pointed out that last year was a bad year for the Passport Service and the National Lottery. “It’s an interesting one,” she said, “because we also measure where companies have exceeded or failed to meet customer expectations, and the passport service actually score really highly on both counts. And I think, you know, they do a fantastic job but I think they struggled because of not being able to have the office open to provide that backup for people, particularly where they had emergencies.”And were people disappointed by the National Lottery because they didn’t win the Lotto? Or was that just Pricewatch? “Maybe it was because a lot of people couldn’t get in to actually play it in physical stores so they had to go online and that caused a challenge for them. I think that probably had quite a lot to do with it.”It should be noted that the Lotto app is very easy to use once you are set up and get the hang of it, so were people getting frustrated because they were struggling with the unfamiliar and then blaming the company? “Yes, absolutely,” she said. “Having to do things online if you’re not used to it or you’ve got a certain way that you like to do things and you have to change your behaviours and your habits and you feel like you’re being forced to do that, you know, can have a negative impact on how people view their experience – because customers do want to do certain things in certain ways with certain companies.”She said Ryanair improved its scores in 2021 compared with a terrible 2020 when it clocked up the lowest score in the history of the survey last year.“I think for some industries, particularly like travel, also the telecom sector, they had real struggles. It’s about equating the importance that some of these companies play in our lives. So, being able to travel obviously was a key one. We were restricted. But how that was handled, when it was opened up, was key.”When it comes to the telecoms companies, Summers said: “We are so dependent on being connected. And if we aren’t connected or there’s a problem, it’s a major, major issue. You go to the supermarket and you can’t get any milk – it’s not a big deal. You can just go somewhere else.”And how does a company address bad ratings? “It’s really being able to understand where the pain points are for customers. So what are the things that are causing the most frustrations, the most issues? So looking at each transaction or interaction that a customer has and where are the pain points for them?“I think a lot of companies have gone down the digital route and sometimes the technology isn’t fit for purpose. And they’ve done it to save money – so they’ve done it for their own needs, rather than the customer needs. And then what can happen is that the customers can’t use the technology or have queries and that generates more calls into the company as well.“And it’s really about being able to understand their customers. Think about them as human beings, understand what they need and be able to invest in improving the customer experience rather than just trying to save money.”"},{"url":null,"title":"cop26 world must step up now on climate action obama says","story":"Former US president Barack Obama, speaking at Cop26 in Glasgow, has lambasted those who would play politics to avoid acting on climate change, calling out Russia and China in the same breath as Republican politicians in America. Video: ReutersFormer US president Barack Obama and US Special Presidential Envoy for Climate John Kerry arrive at the Cop26 summit in Glasgow. Photograph: Jane BarlowPA WireThe world “has to step up, and it has to step up now” in response to climate change, former US president Barrack Obama has said in an address to the UN Cop26 summit in Glasgow.As the gathering faces into its final days of hard negotiation on a deal to limit the extent of global heating, Mr Obama said the climate crisis was the one thing that must transcend day-to-day politics and geopolitics.“What is also true, collectively and inidually we are still falling short. We have not done nearly enough to address this crisis, we will need to do more,” Mr Obama said in a speech to a plenary gathering.He declared “the US is back” at the forefront of global climate action after “stalling” during the Trump years, and went on to criticise Chinese president Xi Jinping and Russian president Vladimir Putin for not joining other leaders at the summit. He said he believed this suggested “a dangerous lack of urgency”.At a closed meeting of members of the “high ambition coalition” (HAC) – which includes Ireland – Mr Obama is understood to have firmly supported developing countries pushing for a climate deal limiting global heating to 1.5 degrees.In his speech earlier, Mr Obama acknowledged progress already made by negotiators in Glasgow but warned that gaps needed to be bridged in coming days.‘More at stake’The biggest force for facing up to the scale of action needed was among young people, he said. “The reason is simple – they have more at stake in this fight than anyone else... If those older people won’t listen, they need to get out the way.”Addressing HAC ministers including Minister for Climate Eamon Ryan, Mr Obama said: “What you are doing – what the HAC is attempting to accomplish – is vital.”Noting the coalition’s role in 2015 in ensuring the 1.5 degree target was written into the Paris agreement, he added: “The brutal tempests of the warming climate are making even clearer that we cross that line at our peril. Once again… it falls on the HAC to make that case.”“You’ve come together once again to speak to not only the need to get to 1.5 degrees, but also to provide the adaptation funding that’s necessary for those who may end up paying the steepest price for actions that they themselves did not take.”A draft statement from the HAC circulated on Monday notes “deep concern” over the gap between existing commitments on emissions made at Cop26 and far deeper cuts needed to limit global heating to within 1.5 degrees, “in this decisive decade”. Not all countries in the coalition have signed the statement, but 40 current signatories include groups of developing countries: the Alliance of Small Island States, the Least Developed Countries and the African Group.‘Diplomatic bullying’Bolivia’s chief negotiator Diego Pacheco Balanza has criticised a refusal by richer countries to discuss loss and damage or compensation at Cop26 as evidence of “diplomatic bullying”.“There’s been a systematic attempt by developed countries to remove all discussion about responsibility, compensation and direct climate finance from the negotiations, it’s shameful,” he said.“Instead, they want us to focus on carbon markets and their 2050 net zero narrative, which is completely meaningless. The net zero narrative is a big lie. We need to eliminate greenhouse gases now, not in 30 years.”The first draft of the “Glasgow decision text” published on Monday, which contains no mention of phasing out fossil fuels, was described as exceptionally weak by Jennifer Morgan, director of Greenpeace International.“Usually the text starts with some ambition, which then gets watered down,” she said. “To keep 1.5 alive, four words must be added: ‘fossil fuels phase out’, and countries must come back next year to close the gap.”"},{"url":null,"title":"heritage","story":"Another Life: Of some 240 known wetland species, almost 70 have been listed for Red List protectionStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"revised dublin transport plan sees costs double to 25bn and rail projects delayed","story":"The proposed Dart Underground line, linking Heuston Station to the Dart line by tunnelling under the city via St Stephen’s Green, will not be built before 2042, according to the NTA. Dublin’s Dart underground line has been shelved for at least 20 years, and no new train or tram lines will be built within the next decade, according to an updated National Transport Authority (NTA) strategy for the capital.The cost of implementing the Greater Dublin Area Transport Strategy for the next 20 years has more than doubled from €10.3 billion to €25 billion.However, planned major rail projects including Luas lines to Finglas, Lucan, Poolbeg and Bray, as well as the  and Navan rail lines, are not expected to be delivered until after 2031, with the long-awaited Dart underground excluded from the 20-year programme.The strategy sets out proposals for improving bus provision, cycling and pedestrian infrastructure, as well as the road network, but its central focus is on the expansion of rail.While planning permission for the link line from Swords and Dublin Airport to the city will be sought next year, the line is not expected to operate until after 2031, according to the strategy.In addition to the four Luas lines also due to be delivered post 2031, planning and design work will be undertaken on eight more Luas routes to Clongriffin, Balgriffin, Tyrellstown, Blanchardstown, Clondalkin, Tallaght  Kimmage, Tallaght  Knocklyon and UCD Sandyford. However, no construction is due to take place on these lines before 2042.Hopes were this year revived for the Dart Underground line, shelved a decade ago following the economic crash, when it emerged the NTA had engaged consultants to devise route options for the line.However, the line linking Heuston Station to the Dart line by tunnelling under the city via St Stephen’s Green, will also not be built before 2042 with the NTA committing instead to “preserve and protect an alignment to allow its future delivery subsequent to the strategy period”.Also axed from the strategy is the Eastern Bypass. The road, which in previous transport strategies involved an extension of the M50 under Sandymount Strand, has been consistently opposed by Dublin politicians.It is “not proceeding” the NTA said, but a “South Port Access Route which will link from the national road network at the Dublin Tunnel to serve the south port lands and adjoining areas is included”, it said.The transport strategy, which is updated every five years, has a stronger focus on walking and cycling measures than previously, with an aspiration to provide “traffic-free streets” in town centres where there are “benefits to transport andor the local environment  economy”.As well as increasing cycle infrastructure, the expansion and “interoperability” of bike sharing schemes and the ability to bring bikes on public transport, which is currently very limited, is proposed.There will be “no significant increase in capacity for private car trips” on radial roads within the metropolitan area, except where re-alignments or junction changes are necessary for safety reasons, it said, while road schemes will be designed to provide “safe and appropriate arrangement to facilitate walking, cycling and public transport provision”.Speed limits will be reduced and variable limits introduced, along with car-free zones, and a “reduction in Public Sector Parking in City Centre”, the report said."},{"url":null,"title":"evening bus service suspensions continue in belfast after two hijackings","story":"The burnt out double decker bus in Church Road near Rathcoole in Newtownabbey, Co Antrim, after it was hijacked and set on fire near a loyalist estate on the outskirts of Belfast.

We will be reviewing that later on today and if there is any change to that we will notify people, but people should, at this point in time, should expect the same level of service as they had last night.”Drivers gathered in the grounds of Belfast City Hall on Monday afternoon in solidarity with a colleague just hours after four masked men, armed with a hammer and a bottle of petrol, boarded a bus near the loyalist Rathcoole estate in Newtownabbey. The driver and passengers were ordered off and the vehicle was set alight.Last Monday, a bus was hijacked and burned in a loyalist area of Newtownards, Co Down, in an apparent protest against the Northern Ireland Protocol.Disorder also broke out at a community interface in west Belfast twice last weekMr Conway said the driver, Bobby, is recovering from the incident which he described as “very traumatic for him”.“He is at home with his family. We have a welfare support team who are supporting him on a daily basis.“It always takes time to recover from these incidents ... sometimes it’s later the impact actually occurs to people but he is getting good support and he is recovering well,” he said.He described the hijackings as an attack on drivers, passengers and the public transport service. – PAStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"q a what is article 16 and what could happen if uk triggers it","story":"     The speculation is that the UK may use the triggering of Article 16 to go further and to force other changes, which could spiral into a trade war and the collapse of the Brexit trade agreement. Ireland and the EU expects the UK to trigger Article 16 of the Northern Ireland protocol in the coming weeks. This unilateral action would effectively suspend the operation of the protocol and have far-reaching consequences for EU-UK relations. So what is Article 16? Article 16 is part of the Northern Ireland protocol, the section of the Brexit withdrawal agreement which deals with the North. The protocol avoided a hard border on the island of Ireland by placing a customs and regulatory border in the Irish Sea, which means additional paperwork and physical checks on some goods coming from Great Britain to Northern Ireland. A small number of items can no longer be imported to Northern Ireland from GB, and some suppliers in Britain have stopped selling to the North. Unionists and loyalists are opposed to the protocol, which they claim has changed Northern Ireland’s constitutional status as part of the UK, and has caused trading difficulties, and there have been repeated calls for Article 16 to be triggered to address these issues. In September the four largest unionist parties issued a joint declaration reaffirming their opposition to the protocol and their “unalterable position that the protocol must be rejected and replaced.” What does Article 16 say? Article 16 is the protocol’s emergency cord. If the application of the protocol leads to “serious economic, societal or environmental difficulties that are liable to persist, or to ersion of trade”, under Article 16 either the UK or the EU “may unilaterally take appropriate safeguard measures.” It stipulates that these measures “shall be restricted with regard to their scope and duration to what is strictly necessary in order to remedy the situation”, with the other party entitled - if the safeguarding measure employed creates an “imbalance between the rights and obligations” under the protocol - to take “such proportionate rebalancing measures as are strictly necessary” to remedy the situation. The UK government has already said - in its Command Paper in July - that it is “clear the circumstances exist to justify using Article 16” as there has been “significant” disruption to trade between GB and NI as well as political and community instability. What happens if it is triggered? Initially, more talking. Annex seven - which outlines how Article 16 will operate - states that where either the EU or the UK is considering taking safeguarding measures it shall notify the other “without delay”, providing all relevant information, and shall “immediately enter into consultations in the Joint Committee with a view to finding a commonly acceptable solution.” Neither party may take safeguarding measures until “one month has elapsed after the date of notification.” However, there is a caveat in the case of “exceptional circumstances requiring immediate action”, in which case the “protective measures strictly necessary to remedy the situation” may be applied “forthwith”. Given that the UK government has maintained the conditions for triggering Article 16 have existed for some months, it would be difficult to justify need for immediate action that said, it has already demonstrated its willingness to take unilateral action in regard to Brexit, so this cannot be ruled out. What will happen in that scenario? Practically, little is likely to change in the short term. Earlier unilateral action by the UK government to extend some grace periods indefinitely means the scope for change on the ground in Northern Ireland is limited. The speculation is that the UK may use the triggering of Article 16 to go further and to force other changes, which could spiral into a trade war and the collapse of the Brexit trade agreement. Inevitably, it will worsen the already strained relations between Dublin and Brussels on the one hand and London on the other, and will be seen as further evidence of “bad faith”, as Mr Coveney put it, on the part of the UK government. Strained relations - and indeed heightened tensions - over Brexit are nothing new in the North it will be seen as a short term win for opponents of the protocol, who have seen their demand to trigger Article 16 delivered upon, but in the medium to longer term it is hard to see how it will do anything to calm already troubled waters. Aodhán Connolly, the director of the Northern Ireland Retail Consortium, summed up the potential impact for businesses he could easily be speaking for society at large. “What article 16 does it the opposite of what business needs. Business needs stability, business needs certainty, what triggering Article 16 does is give us not only more uncertainty, not only more instability, but long protracted negotiations again.”Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"shared","story":"A new  series on the future of the island of Ireland begins todayFormer Fine Gael leader Enda Kenny eased the path for North\u0026rsquos re-entry into bloc in 2017Conversation about a shared island must have boundaries, many unionists argueStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"cop26 eamon ryan calls for rulebook on emissions commitments","story":"US climate envoy John Kerry warned that if emissions were not reduced enough by 2030, achieving net-zero emissions by 2050 would be impossible. Photograph: Christopher FurlongGetty ImagesThe Cop26 summit will generate significant momentum for climate actions across the globe if a detailed and precise rulebook on implementing the landmark Paris agreement emerges from Glasgow this week, Minister for Climate Eamon Ryan has said. Mr Ryan said that even if only a majority of countries supported a rulebook reinforced by “the same rules, the same reporting, and the same timelines”, it would “build momentum for the decisions you need to take in business, in transport and elsewhere”.The Green Party leader, who is heading the Irish delegation at the conference, took part in the Adaptation Fund Contributor Dialogue, an initiative aimed at scaling up funding to help countries vulnerable to climate change to adapt to its impacts. Ireland is to contribute at least €10 million by the end of next year in the form of grants for developing countries, he said.Adaptation challengeAddressing the adaptation challenge would require an unprecedented level of international co-operation, Mr Ryan said. “I believe it can be done and Ireland is determined to play its part, during the final days of Cop26 this week but also through our efforts at home.”Speaking at the same event, US climate envoy John Kerry said the coming week “can define the decade” in terms of global climate action, warning that if emissions were not reduced enough by 2030, achieving net-zero emissions by 2050 would be impossible. “The stakes here could not be higher,” he added. Mr Ryan told a press briefing that Cop26 would achieve a good outcome if the rulebook is “absolutely precise” on timelines for reviews and how governments report on their “national determined contributions” for reducing emissions. On reducing methane, he agreed it was the fastest and most effective way to cut emissions. While an international pact, backed by the Government, aiming to reduce global methane levels by 30 per cent by 2030 was not a national target, he believed Ireland would be “centrally involved in addressing methane arising from agriculture and land use”.OffsettingOn a push for carbon markets with options for big business to offset emissions in developing countries, he said he would be nervous about that given the chequered history of offsetting.Ireland has joined the National Adaptation Plan Global Network and committed €1 million to help developing countries build national adaptation plans and become climate-resilient. Minister of State for Overseas Development Aid Colm Brophy announced the funding, which will support small island developing states and the least-developed countries “to strengthen transparency, accountability and inclusion in climate action with a focus on tracking progress on adaptation”. He added: “Adaptation prioritises the needs of those communities most exposed to, and already living with, the impacts of climate change. As such, it is a core priority of Ireland’s international climate action. We are delighted to support the network and look forward to working with likeminded countries in delivering real impact through this group.”Mr Brophy said he hoped to see the commitment to provide $100 billion a year for developing countries as soon as possible underpinned by progress this week towards the target. Commenting on Cop26, he said: “I think there has been a sea change. It’s the first Cop where there is a real meaningful understanding and work with climate finance and adaptation at the heart of it... I hope that will build up trust.”"},{"url":null,"title":"inside politics sinn fein a party preparing for government","story":"At Sinn Féin’s ardfheis in Dublin last weekend, a motion in support of the non-jury Special Criminal Court was passed, representing a considerable shift in position and removing a significant hurdle to the party’s ambitions to lead the next government.

Photograph: Jan HetfleischGetty ImagesEuropean leaders from Copenhagen to Prague are under growing pressure to reintroduce tighter Covid-19 measures – across the board or targeting the unvaccinated – amid a surge in new infections across the continent.The World Health Organisation has warned that Europe could see another 500,000 Covid-19 deaths by February unless health authorities “reconsider easing or lifting measures at this moment”.Austria led the way on Monday with new laws excluding unvaccinated people from restaurants, hairdressers, cinemas and theatres as well as events with more than 25 people.The new rules apply to all residents over 12, with a four-week transition period permitting access for those with a negative test and proof of one jab. Austria’s infection rate is up 60 per cent in a week.New fines for breaches of the new guidelines include €3,600 for a restaurant, hairdresser or other premises that admits an unvaccinated patron, and €500 for the customer.In addition Austria’s Covid app, used to gain access to closed spaces, will now only consider someone fully vaccinated for nine months after their second Covid jab, to encourage people to get a booster shot.The changes had an immediate effect on Monday with queues before vaccination centres across the Alpine republic. Interior minister Karl Nehammer confirmed the aim of the new measures – policed by 800 dedicated officers on the beat – was to “increase the pressure” to get vaccinated.Intensive care“Whoever visits a bar or restaurant has to expect to be checked, sadly this has become necessary,” he said.Announcing the measures, Austrian chancellor Alexander Schallenberg warned of an “extraordinary dynamism” in infections, with “occupancy rates in the intensive care beds increasing significantly faster than expected”.The latest incidence rate data – the number of cases per 100,000 of population in the past seven days – reveal the scale of the fourth-wave Covid-19 spike across Europe.Of the top 10 countries with the worst outbreaks at the moment, six are in Europe with many registering a doubling or tripling of incidence rates in the last two weeks.Austria has a seven-day incidence rate of almost 600, according to the database company Statista, while Slovakia is leading the EU with 961, followed by Estonia and Croatia with 838 and 760 respectively.The Czech Republic, where just 59 per cent of the population is vaccinated, is another European Covid hotspot, with a seven-day incidence rate of 500 and a 59 per cent spike in Covid cases.“The hospitals are being flooded with Covid-19 patients more than even I thought possible a month ago,” said Dr Milan Kubeck, head of the Czech doctors’ association. Ireland has a seven-day incidence of 482.Further north in Denmark, which abolished almost all restrictions on September 1st, the incidence rate has reached 254 and continues to rise.Public health director Søren Brostrøm has demanded the reintroduction of the local Covid-19 vaccination pass – showing vaccinations or recent test results – for access to indoor dining and cultural events.Pandemic plansAcross the border, Germany’s seven-day incidence rate on Monday crossed the 200 mark for the first time since the pandemic began. Berlin’s would-be coalition partners have interrupted talks to focus on new pandemic plans, set to go before the Bundestag on Thursday.The proposals are expected to avoid new lockdowns and will fall short of the Austrian model. Leaked proposals include regular test requirements for care home workers, more sick days for parents and the return of free rapid tests for all, abolished last month.Given ongoing disagreement between Germany’s 16 federal states, which have frontline responsibility for health, some capitals are pushing ahead on their own. The eastern state of Saxony, where incidence rates are twice the national average at nearly 500, has adopted the Austrian approach.Some 54 per cent of Saxons polled by local broadcaster MDR support excluding the non-vaccinated from restaurants, cafes and cinemas. Some 62 per cent viewed it as a “mandatory vaccination by the back door”.Through her spokesman, acting chancellor Angela Merkel expressed her “serious concern” at the situation and urged “people, business and the various levels of state to do what is needed to get a handle on the pandemic”.West of the Rhine, France’s infection rates of 6,600 per day are roughly one third that of Germany’s. But in a live television address on Tuesday evening, French president Emmanuel Macron is expected to outline new pandemic measures including booster shots. An Elysée spokesman said Mr Macron was “very worried about the health situation in Europe”.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"inside","story":"Circassian heritage trampled and property rows continue as Winter Olympics city boomsKremlin criticised as most Russians reject vaccination and hospitals face huge strainKremlin changes tack on global warming and looks to vast forests to offset emissionsRussia and Japan co-operate on Sakhalin despite row over nearby Kuril islandsIndustry and struggling communities fear wildlife support could stifle Far East developmentCity with echoes of San Francisco is thrillingly original, yet tarnished by graft and neglectGrowing energy, security and diplomatic links between Moscow and Beijing worry WestDecembrist rebels and their aristocratic wives embraced \u0026lsquoreal Russia\u0026rsquo in Siberian exileFears for permafrost as tusk hunters feed Chinese market starved of elephant ivoryInside Russia: Melting permafrost threatens critical infrastructure and feeds global warmingStalin\u0027s popularity growing as Kremlin focuses on Soviet triumphs, not tragediesInside Russia: Party wonders how far it cane press Putin after years in soft \u0026lsquosystemic opposition\u0026rsquo roleInside Russia: More protests planned as officials reject calls to address e-voting complaintsMoscow Letter: Poet\u0026rsquos statue has been a magnet for generations of Russian dissentersOn the eve of an expected sham election, many of Putin\u0026rsquos political opponents are already jailed or dead"},{"url":null,"title":"two california couples give birth to each others babies after mix up at fertility clinic","story":"Daphna and Alexander Cardinale are taking a lawsuit against a Los Angeles fertility clinic. Image: TwitterTwo California couples gave birth to each others’ babies after a mix-up at a fertility clinic and spent months raising children that were not theirs before swapping the infants, according to a lawsuit filed in Los Angeles.Daphna Cardinale said she and her husband, Alexander, had immediate suspicions that the girl she gave birth to in late 2019 was not theirs because the child had a darker complexion than they do.They suppressed their doubts because they fell in love with the baby and trusted the in vitro fertilisation process and their doctors, Ms Cardinale said.Learning months later that she had been pregnant with another couple’s baby, and that another woman had been carrying her child, caused enduring trauma, she said.“I was overwhelmed by feelings of fear, betrayal, anger and heartbreak,” Ms Cardinale said said during a news conference with her husband announcing the lawsuit.“I was robbed of the ability to carry my own child. I never had the opportunity to grow and bond with her during pregnancy, to feel her kick.”The Cardinales’ complaint accuses the Los Angeles-based California Centre for Reproductive Health (CCRH) and its owner, Dr Eliran Mor, of medical malpractice, breach of contract, negligence and fraud. It demands a jury trial and seeks unspecified damages.Yvonne Telles, the office administrator for the centre, declined to comment on Monday. Dr Mor could not be reached for comment.The two other parents involved in the alleged mix-up wish to remain anonymous and plan a similar lawsuit in the coming days, according to lawyer Adam Wolf, who represents all four parents.The lawsuit claims CCRH mistakenly implanted the other couple’s embryo into Ms Cardinale and transferred the Cardinales’ embryo — made from Ms Cardinale’s egg and Mr Cardinale’s sperm — into the other woman.The babies, both girls, were born a week apart in September 2019. Both couples unwittingly raised the wrong child for nearly three months before DNA tests confirmed that the embryos were swapped, according to the filing.“The Cardinales, including their young daughter, fell in love with this child, and were terrified she would be taken away from them,” the complaint says.“All the while, Alexander and Daphna did not know the whereabouts of their own embryo, and thus were terrified that another woman had been pregnant with their child — and their child was out in the world somewhere without them.”The babies were swapped back in January 2020.Breaking the news to their older daughter, now seven, “was the hardest thing in my life”, Ms Cardinale said.“My heart breaks for her, perhaps the most,” she said.Both babies have been returned to their biological families. All four parents have since made an effort to stay in each other’s lives and “forge a larger family”, Ms Cardinale said.“They were just as much in love with our biological daughter as we were with theirs,” Alexander said.Mr Wolf, whose firm specialises in fertility cases, called for greater oversight for IVF clinics. “This case highlights an industry in desperate need of federal regulation,” he said. – PAStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"ex council chief found washed swedish coast five months going","story":"A retired council chief, who died after going windsurfing in 40mph winds, was found washed up on the coast of Sweden 600 miles away, an inquest heard.Chris Bamfield, 65, a highly experienced windsurfer, was seen out on his board on November 14 last year at Hunstanton, Norfolk.His wife, Vanessa, reported him missing at 5.17pm after he failed to return to their home in Middleton, near King\u0027s Lynn.Norfolk coroner\u0027s court in Norwich heard how six search and rescue teams, lifeboats and two fixed wing aircraft were launched to find the councillor.But the search, which covered the entire area of The Wash, was called off on the morning of November 16 when it was assumed he was lost at sea.His board and its red and white sail were later recovered in the North Sea around 21 miles off the Norfolk coast, and his body eventually washed up on April 6 this year on Stora Korno beach in Bohuslan, Sweden.Interpol told Norfolk Police on April 20 that a body matching the description of Mr Bamfield had been found.The inquest heard that DNA tests confirmed the remains were those of Mr Bamfield, who had recently retired as executive director of King\u0027s Lynn and West Norfolk Borough Council.A post-mortem conducted in Sweden gave his primary cause of death as drowning, but found that he had also had circulation issues.Reports from Mr Bamfield\u0027s GP confirmed he had been diagnosed as having high cholesterol, but had declined statin medication as he wanted to treat himself through diet and fitness.Norfolk area coroner Yvonne Blake recorded a conclusion of accidental death due to drowning while windsurfing.Ms Blake said: Although he had slightly high cholesterol, it didn\u0027t seem to be in the dreadful range. As I understand, it was not heart attack territory.She added: He was going out doing something he enjoyed. He had been doing it for many years and had all the proper equipment.It seems to me that quite a large search was launched and some time later he was found in Sweden and identified by his DNA profile.Speaking to Mr Bamfield\u0027s widow and daughter who were at the hearing, Ms Blake expressed sorrow that it had taken nearly five months for his body to be found.She said: I am sorry about the loss and all the uncertainty.

This was the latest incident in a week of disorder linked to the Northern Ireland Protocol.Last Monday, another bus was hijacked and burnt out in Newtownards. Then, on Wednesday night, at a peace wall in West Belfast, loyalist and nationalist rioters attacked the police, after a protest against the Irish Sea border degenerated into violence.These incidents reflect growing anger in loyalist communities at the lack of progress in dealing with the Protocol.This morning, the Progressive Unionist Party (PUP), which is politically aligned to the paramilitary Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF), published a statement claiming that there is no longer a “basis for unionist support” for the Belfast Agreement. It’s leader, Billy Hutchison, said the Protocol damages the “principle of consent” that underpins the Good Friday deal and guarantees Northern Ireland’s place in the UK, until a majority decides otherwise through a border poll.The PUP is a small party, with no representatives in the Stormont Assembly, but its belief that the protocol damages the principle of consent which underpins the Good Friday agreement echoes the thinking of more mainstream figures, like the Conservative peer and former Ulster Unionist leader, Lord Trimble. Mr Hutchison stressed that he remains a “firm and dedicated” supporter of peace in Northern Ireland, but ministers will be worried that a group with historic links to paramilitaries is expressing frustration so publicly.The recent violent incidents in unionist areas were self-defeating and will only undermine the case against the Irish Sea border. But, though they are entirely wrong, you can understand why some extremists believe they will be listened to only if they create disorderDuring Brexit negotiations, the Dublin government, EU officials and sympathetic remainers all encouraged the idea that hardening the Irish land border would effectively invite terrorism by Irish republicans. At one meeting, the Republic’s then prime minister, Leo Varadkar, brandished an old Troubles press clipping about an IRA attack on a customs post, to emphasise his point.These tactics were successful at the time, but now they provide a twisted rationale for violent hotheads who oppose the Protocol. Throughout the Brexit process, nationalist politicians, Irish officials and their EU allies felt free to use inflated, even hysterical language about the UK, and the threats it was perceived to pose, while telling unionists and British officials to “dial down the rhetoric”.Today, for example, the frequently shrill and preachy SDLP MP, Colum Eastwood, urged Lord Frost and the DUP to choose their language about the Protocol carefully. Meanwhile, a senior EU diplomat told the Daily  that, if the government triggered Article 16, “We are ready for peace but prepared for war.”Ironically, people in Belfast will know this translation of a Latin adage best from a famously UVF mural, daubed on a gable wall beside an image of two masked gunmen during the peace process. It would be hard to come up with less appropriate, more provocative, more threatening language, in the context of Northern Ireland.From a unionist perspective, the problem with the Northern Ireland Protocol, as with the backstop before it, was that it prioritised nationalists’ desire to pretend that there was no land frontier on the island of Ireland over Ulster unionists’ right not to be separated from the rest of their country by a new economic and political border. To many unionists, it seemed that the nationalist case was backed up by poorly disguised threats of violence, as well dangerously hostile words.The recent incidents in Northern Ireland are unjustified and they are highly unlikely to achieve anything positive. While unionists in the province are currently at one in their opposition to checks and paperwork for goods crossing the Irish Sea, moderate pro-Union opinion is likely to become alienated from the anti-Protocol campaign, if it is associated with violence.However, people in Northern Ireland have every right to be angry about the Irish Sea border. Given the province’s bloody history and its long-standing constitutional dispute, there has, if anything, been a relatively muted response to its separation from the rest of the UK by an internal border - thank goodness. Hopefully, for the most part, that will remain the case, and the government will deal effectively with the issues.We shouldn’t forget, though, that it was people like Leo Varadkar who first raised the spectre of violence to boost their case on Brexit.

Mr Pollard said: “The amendment the minister has cited in lieu of the Duke of Wellington amendment is confined to storm overflows and not the sewage system as a whole. “There’s no specic duty on Ofwat or the Environment Agency to ensure compliance – and there should be – and we need to have a focus on reduction on harm rather than adverse impacts. This looks like looking busy without making a real dference.” Tories Philip Dunne and Neil Parish rebelled against the government in the last vote, but supported ministers on Monday.  Surfers Against Sewage said after the vote: “We’re hugely disappointed that the government has decided not to back the tougher Duke of Wellington amendment, which would have given them greater powers in tackling the sewage pollution emergency in our rivers and ocean. “Just last week, UN secretary general, António Guterres, warned world leaders at Cop to stop treating nature “like a toilet”.The government has failed to fully seize the opportunity in the most urgent of environmental decades to make an example of water companies to say, ‘If you pollute, you fix it, you pay.’ The vote comes after Peers backed a bid by the Duke of Wellington to compel firms to improve their sewage systems “as soon as reasonable”.  Ministers were forced into a climbdown in a row over levels of raw sewage being dumped into rivers and seas. Environment Secretary George Eustice said a new legal duty would be imposed on water companies to progressively reduce the amount of sewage pumped into waterways from storm overflows. Martin Salter, of the Angling Trust, said this new amendment did not go far enough.“At a time when public trust in politicians has once again been shaken, we hope MPs will stand firm, and insist on clarity and action by ministers to create a pathway out of pollution.” Comment MORE ON Politics\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

There is no cap on what MPs can earn on top of their parliamentary salary - which starts at £, excluding expenses and other perks - provided that all income is declared in official registers and no work relates to lobbying parliament. But this rule is controversial - with some politicians and campaign groups arguing MPs shouldn’t be allowed to take on any other paid work. We analysed the Commons register of financial interests to see which ten MPs have declared the largest earnings from the private sector since the  election. . Theresa May- £.m Unlike her predecessor David Cameron, the former Prime Minister refused to give up her Maidenhead seat when she was forced out of office in July .She signed to the prestigious Washington Speakers Bureau later that year and, on average, she declares  times as much a year from talks as she earns as a backbencher. In February , she was paid £, to speak to a women’s forum founded by the Dubai ruler Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum despite ongoing international concern about the UAEaposs human rights record. During her visit, May was pictured shaking the hand of Al Maktoum, who has been accused of kidnapping his daughters and abusing his estranged we. And the pandemic didnapost put a stop to her lucrative speaking gigs - during lockdown she was charging around £, for speeches delivered on Zoom.Mrs Mayaposs speaking earnings are paid to the Office of Theresa May Ltd.On the register of interests, she declares: These sums are used to pay employees, maintain my ongoing involvement in public le and support my charitable work. The Office of Theresa May has paid the former Prime Minister a salary of £, a year since September last year. . Sir Geoffrey Cox- £m  Former attorney general Sir Geoffrey Cox has made a fortune working as a barrister while representing Torridge and West Devon in parliament. And heaposs no stranger to controversy over his huge earnings. In , he resigned from the House of Commons standards committee when it was revealed he failed to meet the deadline for declaring £, he’d been paid for legal work. The committee found he had committed a serious breach of parliamentary rules but accepted it was not intentional and he made a public apology. In the same year, he unsuccessfully tried to claim p for a pint of milk on Commons expenses but this was rejected by the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority. In response, he said: “In collating the office expenses for me to sign off, my staff had failed to notice that the rules had changed in May so as to place these costs outside the scope of IPSA’s scheme. “Once the error was identied, it was ed by Ipsa and immediately cancelled by my office.” He gave up practising law temporarily when he was appointed attorney general in , but has made more than a million since leaving the cabinet and resuming legal work in February . . Sir John Redwood- £k  Sir John Redwood, a former Tory leadership candidate and secretary of state for Wales, has several roles with private investment firms. The bulk of the Wokingham MP’s earnings come from his role as chairman of the investment committee of Charles Stanley - which has netted him £, per month since the last election. The firm also pays him bonuses on occasion. Despite his wealth, he once charged the taxpayer £ for reseeding the lawn at his constituency home in Berkshire. He was ordered to pay the money back - and moaned that the decision was unfair because he felt it was an honest and accurate claim. . Fiona Bruce- £k  Lawyer Fiona Bruce is the Prime Ministeraposs envoy on the human right to freedom of religion or belief. The Congleton MP has continued to work for her own Cheshire based firm, Fiona Bruce and Co LLP, since being elected in . Ms Bruce said the four largest of the  payments she listed were “almost entirely tax payments not receipts by me” but “for technical reasons have to be declared.” . Andrew Mitchell- £k  Former international development secretary Andrew Mitchell makes a tidy sum from private investment companies while representing Sutton Coldfield in parliament. This includes SouthBridge, an African investment bank based which pays him £, a year for just nine days’ work. Yet in the past some of his expense claims have raised eyebrows. When thebroke the story of the MPs’ expenses scandal in , it was revealed heaposd claimed £, for cleaning, decorating and gardening - even billing the public purse for a duvet stuffed with goose down. He told the paper he’d acted within the rules, insisting the sum claimed was “less than the cost that I have incurred maintaining my second home and is less than the amount I would have been entitled to claim. . Sajid Javid- £k The Bromsgrove MP resigned as chancellor in February  following an explosive bust up with Boris Johnsonaposs former top aide Dominic Cummings.But just months after leaving office, he was handed two roles with a combined annual salary of over £,. In August last year, he began a £, a year role with bank JP Morgan. Due to the fact heaposd served in the cabinet within the last two years, he had to consult the governmentaposs Advisory Committee on Business Appointments about his roles. The committee warned Javidaposs privileged access to information as chancellor meant accepting a job with JP Morgan carried potential risks but ultimately allowed the appointment to go ahead. Two months later, he signed up for a role with software firm C.ai, paying an annual salary of £,. He also consulted the committee about this role. In addition, he made money from speeches. He quit both JP Morgan and C.ai after less than a year, ing to the cabinet in June to replace Matt Hancock as health secretary. . Richard Fuller- £k Mr Fuller represented Bedford from  to , when he lost his seat to Labour, and took up a role as chief executive of software company Impero Solutions.He ed to parliament in  to represent North East Bedfordshire and quit his post with the company. Impero gave him a severance payment of £, at the end of March  - but allowed him to continue as an advisory director, paying £, a year for just two hours work a month. He also has a string of roles advising other firms, in the fields of software, security and venture capitalism. . Owen Paterson- £k  The MP at the centre of the furore made his money as a consultant to Randox and Lynnaposs Country Foods, netting him north of £, a year on top of his backbench salary. The former environment secretary refused to accept the standards committeeaposs findings that he had lobbied on behalf of both companies, in contravention of the rules. A government bid to reform the standards process - which would have allowed him to appeal - backfired. He resigned this week in the wake of the controversy, a decision which will trigger a by-election in his North Shropshire constituency. . Sir John Hayes- £k  The South Holland and the Deepings MP served in a range of ministerial posts under both Theresa May and David Cameron. Since leaving government in , he’s made money in a number of dferent ways. He has a lucrative contract as an advisor to oil company BB Energy paying £, a year. He also delivers lectures on political studies. . Nadine Dorries- £k  Culture secretary Nadine Dorries makes her money writing books on the side - mainly based in her home city of Liverpool - and has sold over . million to date. Sheaposs written  titles in total and regularly receives royalty payments, as well as advances for new work. Her first book was published in  - nine years after her election to parliament.

Aaron Bell, the Tory MP for Newcastle-under-Lyme, said some Tories in the apos groupapos a nickname for the apos intake have been “beating themselves up” about siding with the Government. Mr Bell who opted to rebel on the matter, said his colleagues were put in an “invidious position” by the Government. “It churns you up beforehand and leaves you a little shell-shocked afterwards. Perhaps next time it will be easier.” And Tory MP Mark Fletcher, a member of the Standards Committee, urged people to not paint all Tories with the same brush as he insisted many are desperate to stay within the rules.Mr Fletcher told the Commons he would vote against the billhe had to today.  “I think that two years here is more than enough to know the dference between right and wrong, Mr Fletcher added. He urged the Government to avoid ordering Tory MPs to vote a certain way in future matters on standards, before thanking politicians on all sides for checking up on him following his decision to rebel. Their remarks appeared to show a deepening ide within the Tory party, with newer MPs expressing their fury over senior memberaposs handling of the Owen Paterson case. The Standards Committee had recommended former Tory cabinet minister Mr Paterson should be suspended from Parliament for  days after committing an “egregious” breach of a ban on paid lobbying by MPs.  But Mr Paterson quit Parliament before he could be suspended.Mr Bell even quoted a WhatsApp message sent by Tory MP Jill Mortimer, who was elected to represent Hartlepool in May. He told the House: “She said ‘this was a colossal misjudgement, it should not have been whipped, you should have been allowed to vote with your conscience on this’. “I couldn’t agree more and I hope the Treasury bench is listening. Let usto the convention where House business is not whipped.”  And former Tory chief whip Mark Harper urged Mr Johnson to demonstrate leadership and apologise in the Commons. He said: “I hope ministers can rule that out, I think that would be a mistake and most regrettable. “Theydeserve that decisions are well thought through and soundly based and , on occasion, as on this occasion…the team captain gets it wrong, then I think he should come and apologise to the public and to this House, that’s the right thing to do in terms of demonstrating leadership.” Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer slammed the PM for running scared.  He told the Commons: This week he had the chance to clean up, to apologise to the country and finally accept that the rules apply to him and his friends. “But instead of stepping up he has hidden away. Instead of clearing up his mess he has left his side knee-deep in it. Instead of leading from the front, he has cowered away. He is not a serious leader and the joke isn’t funny any more.”  Instead of making the apology on behalf of his party, Mr Johnson was pictured walking brazenly through a Northumbria hospital, maskless next to NHS staff who all wore face coverings. Number  insist Mr Johnson was following the rules and that he could not make it back to London in time for the debate.

Although she no longer has a budget, shes still shopping for cheaper options - to benefit the environmentVictoria has shared her top tips for having a frugal Christmas Image: PA Real LeByHarriet BulloughJessica TaylorReal le features writer:,  Nov Updated:,  Nov | commentsA bargain-hunting mum who has made it her mission to have a sustainable, low-budget Christmas admits she starts her festive shopping in January. Community worker Victoria Billington, , who lives with husband Simon and kids, five-year-old Teddy and three-year-old Elisabeth, has been bargain shopping for years. She first started looking for cheaper gt options a few years ago when money was tight and she had  nieces and nephews to buy for. In the past, the frugal mum has sted through books in charity shops to pick up novels for as little as p and even made a dollaposs house for £. In a bid to be as eco-friendly as possible, she also makes her own recyclable wrapping paper and reuses her homemade advent calendar every Christmas. She said: My husband and I used to be freelancers so we couldnapost always rely on how much income we were going to have at that time. For more of the news you care about straight to your inbox, sign up for one of our daily newsletters here So about five years ago, I started making a gt for each of the children on my list as it will be meaningful but wonapost cost anything. Now, it’s not really about the saving for us and more about being as eco-friendly as possible. She added that, of course, Christmas works out cheaper when sheaposs buying second-hand presents too, but she puts a lot of effort into carefully selecting each gt. Victoria, who has four sisters, said her family always valued thoughtful gts over expensive ones. My mum always said sheaposd rather have a bar of soap wrapped up than a really expensive present, she said. So we grew up with this idea of being generous at Christmas, but that doesnapost have to be extravagant.  In order to keep track of her bargains, Victoria has to be incredibly organised, and starts a checklist for all her recipients every year. I start as early as January, she said. I used to lose track when I started, so now I keep a list and write down what I’ve got everyone as I go. I really think about what each person wants. I don’t have a spend limit - I just try and make it meaningful to that person. Although she has no budget these days, Victoria still sets out to find bargains and scours charity shops for gts she thinks will suit her loved ones well. At some charity shops, you can get brand new, unread books for as little as p, she explained. So I grab a few of someone’s favourite books and their present costs me like p. I also found one of my nieces a doll that retails at £ for £, so Iaposm definitely saving a lot of money. Plus it saves any last-minute panic buying! After having kids, Victoria says she became much more aware of environmental issues around fast fashion and buying lots of new things all the time. “It broadens your horizon that itaposs not just about yourself. You start thinking, ‘What are we leaving for our children ’ “Iaposve always been quite thrty and Iaposve always looked to find a bargain. But especially in the last few years, Iaposve been thinking about where I spend my money. It made me realise charity shops and small businesses will benefit more from my spending as well as being more sustainable. As well as charity shops, Victoria finds gts on websites like Olio and Facebook Marketplace and often upcycling items to create cool gts.“I canapost draw so I wouldnapost call myself creative in that way,” she laughed.“I suppose I have the time. When I’m making things, I usually start with an open Google search to find out how to use a material or how to make a particular toy.“I got a lot of crafting supplies from Olio. I think for me that was one of my most exciting finds. Last year, Victoria bought a second hand dollaposs house for £ - and spent several weeks decorating it before gting it to her kids. She said: It was their big present so weaposd got it early and weaposd planned ahead so we were able to spend a while decorating it. Thereaposs tiny little bunting, made from paper and string, that we put on the walls. Victoria has a felt advent calendar that she reuses every year, putting chocolates and bad Christmas jokes in every day for the kids to enjoy. She also enlists hubby Simon to help making presents. Victoria said: My husband is actually very creative so he draws pictures that we can then frame and gt to people. We also make decorations out of pine cones. By just adding festive ribbon or felt greenery, you can make a wreath with a timeless Christmas feel. And none of their arty work is thrown away come January - instead it is carefully stored away in the airing cupboard in a reusable shopping bag, ready to use every Christmas. Although sheaposs proud of her eco-friendly traditions, Victoria doesnapost want to pressure other parents into copying her. I recognise I have the privilege of time,” she explained.Do you plan Christmas months in advance  Email jessica.taylor@reachplc“What we don’t spend in money, we do spend in time and I know not everyone has the ability to do that. “But for us it makes Christmas more special and itaposs really enjoyable to see everyone love the gts you’ve put so much time into. Victoria’s top tips for a sustainable Christmas * Don’t leave it too late – Get started early so you have plenty of time to look out for bargains. * Shop local – Reduce delivery and shipments by shopping in your local area. You don’t have to wait and can guarantee your presents will arrive on time. * Charity shops are great for a bargain – Many businesses donate brand new items to charity shops. Not only do you save money but the money you do spend goes to charity. * Watch how you wrap – Not all wrapping paper is recyclable and making your own can be a fun activity with the kids. Make it a family activity using stamps to create fun recyclable paper. * Don’t follow trends – You don’t need to change your decorations every year or follow the latest fad. Make decorations that are timeless that you can reuse every year.

The man, who is thought to have fallen in the Ogof Ffynnon Ddu cave network near Penwyllt, has been trapped for two days having hurt his back.He has received medical treatment in the cave, and have been in contact with both the internationally renowned rescuers and other cavers.But this scary saga is far from the first crisis to take place in the Brecon Beacons, with a list of terrying accidents having befallen the sprawling mountainous national park. Where are the Brecon Beacons   Stretching from west to east Wales, the range is home to iconic mountains Pen y Fan, the Black Mountains, Dan yr Ogof all in a rugged and wild that in places seems devoid of human le. The range sits along the border of mid and south Wales, while the bigger still  square mile Snowdonia sits in the countryaposs north west. The  SAS tragedyIt comes as little surprise then that this expansive, remote landscape is the training ground of choice for the SAS Pen y Fan is notorious for its gruelling aposFan Danceapos hike, a  mile long walk used in the selection process for much of Britainaposs special forces.But the special forcesapos love affair with the Beacons is riddled with tragedy.  In  three soldiers - Corporal James Dunsby, , Lance Corporal Craig Roberts, , and Lance Corporal Edward Maher,  - undertaking the selection process to become SAS reservists died on a  mile exercise in the mountain range, leading to y investigations into whether there had been negligence on behalf of the SAS in protecting the men.Earlier this year the Mirror reported that as many  service people had died in the Beacons since , almost one every other year.But itaposs not just rigorous SAS training that have claimed lives people in  square mile park it has a terrible record for plane crashes. Canadians in the Second World War In , in the latter stages of the Second World War a bomber carrying six Canadian service men crashed at Carreg Goch - much of the debris from the crash can still be found around the area as can two plaques honouring the dead can be found in the area. Two years prior to that a Spitfire came down, killing fellow Canadian -year-old Sergeant Donald Perry Carruthers - it took nine days to recover his burned body. Six further Canadians died in two further crashes during the war. The post-war Jet crashesIn the Black Mountains area of the Beacons in , a de Havilland Vampire jet fighter crashed killing pilot John Raymond Baldock, and then  years later in  a Vulcan bomber crew crashed at Fan Bwlch Chwyth all five crew on board, according to Ystradgynlais History.A friend of a family living near the Vulcan crash site said at the time: “As one can imagine the plane had broken up on impact over a wide area and amongst the debris were the remains of the crew.

The online sellers are also offering iety boxes of Wotsits and Quavers on eBay for around £ that normally cost around £ from sold-out supermarkets. One eBay trader from Leicester, where Walkers crisps are originally from, is listing a .g pack of Walkers Salt  Vinegar crisps for £. that would usually cost about p.  Another opportunist is trying to sell a g bag of Walkers Salt  Vinegar Squares for £.. It comes as Walkers warned suppliers that their products may not be back on shelves for another month due to an IT problem. A Walkers spokesman said: “We’re doing everything we can to increase production and get people’s favourites back on shelves. “We’re very sorry for the inconvenience caused.” Supermarket shelves have been pictured with few Walkers crisps around the country and they are out of stock on Tesco, Morrisons and Ocado websites. The Walkers crisp shortage has now been going on for several weeks and a spokesman for the Poundstretcher group recently said they had seen deliveries of Walkers products plummet. He said: “They had a change to their systems and the change has taken much longer than expected. “In our last order, instead of getting  pallets – which is equivalent to a truckload – we received seven cases, which is not even a pallet full. It is that bad. “I was in Tesco the other day and the crisps shelves were empty, so I think the bigger supermarkets are being affected more severely as their sales are higher volume.” Crisp aisles are the latest to be hit with shortages, with retail experts also warning people may be hit this Christmas by a lack of trees, toys, booze and food including traditional favourites such as pigs in blankets.

He spent eight months in intensive care and then two months on a ward which adds up to  days in total, MyLondon reports. After a five-week induced coma and a le-threatening lung collapse, Andrewaposs health deteriorated to such an extent that in February, doctors called his family to tell them they were considering turning his ventilator off. Recalling when he first became unwell, Andrew said: A week before Christmas , I started to feel il. “I wasn’t eating and I was losing weight, but I thought it was just the anxiety getting to me. When I was admitted to hospital with Covid I initially responded well to treatment, but then my oxygen levels started to drop and I was taken for a CT scan. That was when I was told that I had a pneuomothorax, which is a split on the lung.  “I was on my own as this was the height of Covid, with no visitors allowed, so it was a lot to take in. By this point I was crying my eyes out, on the phone to my sister Hannah and my we Hayley, but I didn’t want to tell my mum or my dad. I couldn’t bring myself to tell them.” After overcoming a second lung collapse, fortunately, Andrew’s lungs begun to improve and he was able to come off the ventilator in June . Andrew’s family, including his we Hayley and sons Jack, six, and Joshua, three, were able to visit, although he could only communicate by pointing a stick at letters on a board.  In addition being on a ventilator in ICU for so long meant that Andrew had to learn to talk and walk again. “I kept thinking ‘why me ’,” he said. “It was very hard to stay positive. But I remembered how when I was going through my chemotherapy I was told to look forward, set myself little goals and when I’d achieved them set myself another one. So that’s what I did.” The last two years have been particularly traumatic for Andrew. Read more He was diagnosed with lymph cancer in October  but chemotherapy treatment had been successful and a few months before his Covid diagnosis, he was in remission and on the mend. He spent the majority of  carefully shielding due to his cancer fight. Doctors, nurses, physios and speech and language therapists at the hospital got to know Andrew during his stay.  They all turned out to say goodbye to Andrew on October . Andrew said: “The care has been fantastic but my journey is nowhere near finished yet. Going home is one major goal, but then that just starts another road in my recovery. I started walking just four weeks ago, and my next goal is to walk to my son’s school and back by Christmas.” Comment MORE ON HospitalsCoronavirus\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily coronavirus email newsletter with all the news you need to know direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Lincoln Crown Court heard harrowing details that Grzeszcz stabbed his defenceless victim in the neck, chest and abdomen before he tried to decapitate Roberts in woodlands in the Fishtoft area of Boston, Lincolnshire. Mr Justice Jeremy Baker sentenced Grzeszcz to a minimum term of  years in custody before he is eligible for release and removed reporting restrictions that allowed the young killer to be unmasked. The judgeaposs decision means more details about the teenager killer can be revealed for the first time. Grzeszcz was expelled from primary school at the age of  after threatening a girl with a kne. The killer had taken a blade with him to class and threatened the terried youngster at St Nicholas Primary School in Boston, Lincolnshire, the Sun reports. Grzeszcz was moved to Haven High Academy but was kicked out for selling drugs and sent to a pupil referral unit.  A mum, who used to take Roberts to primary school with her children, told The Sun: “It’s not his first incident with a kne. “When he was at primary school he took one into class to threaten other kids. He threatened a girl with it and was excluded.” Roberts was a pupil at Haven High Academy and was two days from his th birthday when he died in Grzeszczaposs hands. Grzeszcz refused to talk about the circumstances of the murder but the court heard it was a planned and premeditated killing. Brendan Kelly, QC, mitigating for Grzeszcz, told the court it was accepted that at some point he formed an intention to kill Roberts.  But Mr Kelly argued there was some evidence to suggest that was not the entire plan and something went wrong. Mr Kelly said while it was no excuse, the boy was a troubled young man who been through a period of chaos during the whole of  with his parents, and perhaps unwittingly the authorities. The net effect a troubled young man, Mr Kelly explained. Grzeszcz, who lived near to the grassy area where Roberts body was found, was found guilty of murder at a trial earlier this year but could not be named until Mr Justice Baker lted an anonymity order at his sentencing hearing today. Grzeszcz was today given a sentence of detention at Her Majestyaposs Pleasure and must serve a minimum term of  years in custody before he is eligible for release. The defence opposed an application for the boy to be named, telling the court that both his parents were in court, and were concerned about him being identied.  The court heard Robert had suffered wounds consistent with an attempt to remove his head before his body was found. Passing sentence at Lincoln Crown Court, Mr Justice Jeremy Baker, told Grzeszcz, now , that it was an aggravating feature that he had made a substantial effort to remove the deceasedaposs head.Mr Justice Baker told him: I am sure that as the attack progressed, given the number of serious injuries you inflicted on the deceased, there came a point where you decided to kill the deceased, and you did so. He added: There was a signicant degree of planning and premeditation, including luring the deceased to the scene, and taking the kne with you. Mr Justice Baker said the killing was further aggravated by Grzeszczaposs attempts to conceal evidence - with police finding both the murder weapon and other knives hidden around his bedroom. He noted Grzeszcz was also still unwilling to talk about the circumstances of the murder.  Roberts, who was born in Latvia, lived with his father Edgars just a short walk from where he was killed. He was a pupil at the local Haven High Academy and was due to celebrate his th birthday a couple of days after his death. His father watched on from the public gallery as Mary Loram, QC, prosecuting, gave details of their le in the UK. Miss Loram said: Father and son moved to England from Latvia when Roberts was seven. He made friends easily, learned English and initially at least did well at school. He took up sports, judo and football. It is clear his father worked hard. In his previous statement he says aposhe didnapost have much, but they made sure Roberts had what was needed.apos Miss Loram also read out a brief further victim impact statement from Robertsapos father. In the statement Mr Buncis described how do I put into words what happened to Roberts. His death at the hands of another boy, over what, drugs, fighting, girls, it doesnapost make sense. Mr Buncis added: Iaposve lost my destination, my purpose, my le is in the cemetery. Miss Loram said it was the prosecution case that it was a planned and premeditated killing, with no evidence to suggest Roberts was armed as well. For an adult the starting point is  years, as we say the defendant carried a kne to the scene. However it is important to state that given the defendantaposs age the starting point is  years. That is set down by law.  Mr Kelly said a letter from Childrenaposs Services at Lincolnshire County Council also explained their concerns on naming Grzeszcz for his welfare and that of his family. The jury heard Roberts was found on ground off Alcorn Green in Fishtoft, near Boston, two days before his th birthday. Pathologist Prof Guy Rutty, who examined his body, said he had identied  sites of injury across the neck, chest and abdomen, some containing up to  separate injuries. As well as an attempt to decapitate Roberts he said there were also injuries consistent with someone trying to remove the hand or fingers. Prosecutors said the defendant used such force the tip of the kne broke off and was later found embedded in Robertsapos skull. Giving evidence, the teen claimed he had met up with his friend to hand over a stash of drugs for him to sell, but began arguing when he did not receive the £ payment he was expecting.  Following the attack, Grzeszcz ran home and tried to hide the kne and burn the clothes and gloves he was wearing. He later messaged a friend saying things went wrong and this wasnapost supposed to go down like this. Miss Loram said Grzeszcz had previously discussed a plan with Roberts to rob a shop in order to get money to set himself up as a drug dealer. But, she said, Roberts described the proposal as too mad and refused to be involved. She told the court Grzeszcz feared that Roberts would snitch on him. During the three week trial the jury heard the Grzeszcz also had a collection of knives in his bedroom and had been excluded from his primary school for taking a kne into class.  The jury was told by a fellow pupil that the Grzeszcz routinely carried a kne and would take a blade into his secondary school. At the time of the murder the boy had been excluded for drug dealing in the school. He had previously discussed with Roberts a plan to carry out a kne-point robbery of a shop to get money so he could set up as a drug dealer. The robbery never happened after Roberts described the proposal as “too mad” and refused to be involved. But five days before the murder Grzeszcz carried out a street attack on another boy who was punched and kicked on his way to school. Miss Loram said Grzeszcz intended to set up as a cannabis dealer, and apparently feared that Roberts would snitch on him. He messaged another boy saying “Rob’s a liability” which was met with the response “If he snitch, smack time”. Det Chf Insp Richard Myszczyszyn, of Lincolnshire police, said: “This is an utterly tragic case. I would like to pay tribute to the people who loved Roberts, and had to deal with losing him in such brutal and horric circumstances. Their support for our investigation has been unwavering, and their bravery has been an inspiration. Nothing could bring Roberts back, but our commitment was to try to find some semblance of justice for a grieving family and community. The act was utterly senseless and the consequences, devastating. It will be remembered by officers and staff as one of the worst and saddest cases we have ever dealt with. The level of violence, and that it involved children, makes it almost incomprehensible. “Roberts’s future was stolen and that is an injustice that cannot be undone. We hope today’s sentence might at least offer some closure to those affected. “It’s a stark and chilling lesson on the potential devastation of kne crime.

Hannah, a -year-old mum-of-two took her boys to the stock car racing evening, promising them it would be a night to remember. But she has now told of how they begged to go home, after the cars got stuck in the mud and they were left sitting cold and bored in the overcrowded stadium waiting for the entertainment to continue. Hannah, from Brighouse in West Yorks, spent £ on tickets for her, her children and her mum at the event at Odsal Top on Saturday night.She told Yorkshire Live there must have been “around , people there along with a lot of disappointed children”.I had been bigging it up to my sons aged eight and two, telling them how great it was going to be but all they kept asking me was when could they go home,” she said. It was meant to be stock car racing, banger racing, monster trucks and £, of fireworks. The whole thing from start to finish was a disaster and should have been brought to a close a lot sooner than it was. Were you at the event  Email webnews@mirror  It started at .pm and ended at .pm and most of this time we were just sat around cold and bored waiting for the tractors to pull the cars off the track as it was a mud bath. There were four races that lasted a small amount of time due to all the cars getting stuck in the mud then an hour waiting for the tractors to get them all off the track in-between each. The monster truck was cancelled due to health and safety which I can not understand when itaposs a lot bigger than the tractors that are absolutely fine on the track. The children were bored as there was nothing to entertain them at all. Rather than put another two races on the fireworks should have just been done early and the event ended early. Forty-five minutes before the end three-quarters of the people attending had left - thataposs how bad it was. We spoke to a few stewards who all agreed what a shambles it was and that the event should have been ended earlier. We waited until the end as after sitting in the cold for hours of no entertainment we thought we might as well see the fireworks.”  But the family ended up wishing they had gone to a standard bonfire, in which Hannah said the fireworks would have been just as good. We were utterly disappointed with it all and felt it was a complete waste of money, especially for the price we paid,” she said. “Iaposm pretty sure everyone  who attended would agree which clearly showed how many people left early.” Hannah said the “poor stewards” were being abused by attendees unhappy with their experience, which she said was “also unfair”.And another man wrote on Startrax Stockcar Racingaposs Facebook page: Last night was horric, badly organised, half of the event didn’t even happen, no monster truck as advertised, the apos£, firework spectacularapos was far from it, staff were rude and swearing in front of kids, yet to see a race take place.The commentator did his best to build excitement at what can only be considered a disaster but the odds were against him. Waste of time and money. And a woman wrote: My family go often to watch the racing here and itaposs been amazing! Tonight was appalling. Total embarrassment to the sport. Poor kids are gutted. No monster trucks and not much racing. I feel sorry for the drivers too. The staff stewards attitude was beyond ignorant and rude. Nowhere to stand, the younger kids couldnapost see. A refund is definitely needed! Startrax Stockcar racing manager Steve issued an apology on the eventaposs Facebook page saying the company apologised “unreservedly”. Let us assure you, we have been involved in motorsports and Odsal for  years and indeed promoted at Odsal until its closure in ,” he said. We also invested heavily in itsfor . It has put on this far  successful events in  including the World Stock Car Final only last month.We do care passionately about what we do and, trust us, we are devastated and apologise for the weather and we had invested heavily to put on a great show.It was deemed Health  Safety-wise unsafe for the Monster Trucks to participate, which we announced but as advertised only a part of the show. I make no excuses, it was with the weather not a pleasant night for your family or ourselves and we apologise to your family and friends. In a second post on its Facebook page he wrote the evening will haunt me as a bad memory into retirement, and he firmly denied that his company was out to make a fast buck saying its reputation was extremely important to them.

Jessica Thompson, , had an intense food phobia and would suffer anxiety and panic when presented with most foods, but she was ok with beige items and lived mostly on processed chicken nuggets. Her mum, Julia Cain, , was so concerned she sought out professional help and soon the young girl was diagnosed with avoidant restrictive food intake disorder. At her witsapos end, Julia booked a hypnotherapist to help Jessica, and the treatment was so effective that the youngster now loves eating fruit and veg.  What do you think about Jessicaaposs miracle transformation  Let us know in the comments... Julia, from Swindon, Wiltshire, said: She was eating all her baby food and she was trying lots of new food. Then it just stopped, and she would only eat chicken nuggets. Sheaposd have about three or four with fries as a meal but usually didnapost finish it. People would always say, aposshe will grow out of itapos, or apos you donapost give in sheaposll get hungry and eat what you give herapos. The problem is, Jessica would literally rather starve than eat some foods. Sometimes she would crawl into a ball to get away from the food. We knew she was more than fussy but we never thought she would spend a decade of her le eating chicken nuggets.  Jessica was branded as aposfussyapos by doctors over the years, and over the years stuck to beige foods like nuggets, plain bread, and fries. Julia continued: They would all say sheaposs just being fussy, or sheaposs having tummy troubles. As a parent, all you want is for your child to eat. People really donapost understand that it is an illness, not just fussiness. Julia eventually contacted hypnotherapist David Kilmurry, who diagnosed her with ARFID.  For more of the news you care about, straight to your inbox, sign up for one of our daily newsletters here. After just three weeks with him, listening to relaxation MPs before meals, and using an achievement chart, Jessica can now enjoy a roast with her family. He said: Julia contacted me worried and concerned about the limited foods that her daughter Jessica was restricted to, just chicken nuggets and very little . Chicken nuggets are not a whole food group and Jessica came to me extremely unwell, lethargic and anxious. Trying to get Jessica or any person with ARFID to consume is like trying to get an arachnophobe to hold a spider. It sends panic through a persons body retching, gagging and vomiting - just at the thought of an unsafe or new food. For relieved mum Julia, Jessicaaposs achievement means for the first time in  years the whole family can sit down together and enjoy a meal. Julia said: Itaposs nothing short of a miracle that Jessica can eat a full plate of food now. We hadnapost eaten a meal together as a family for years, and now we can. Sheaposs tried  new foods, and even though she hasnapost liked all of them, this is a massive step forward for her. Do you have a story to share  Weaposd love to hear all about it.

Paul Deery spent three nights at the Royal Albion Hotel in Brighton last month, but claims his horrendousapos room had an unmade bed, tobacco left on the table and pubic hair left in the bath. The -year-old had book to stay with his friend, Paul Mallon, , and paid £ for their stay. But they say the manager of the three star hotel only offered a % refund for their stay. Have you stayed at the hotel  Let us know about your visit, email webnews@mirror  When he doubled down, Paul was given a final offer of a % discount on his next visit to the hotel - which Paul deemed aposcheekyapos as he wanted a full refund and didnapost want to negotiate, norto the venue. Both Paul and Paul were so disgusted by their stay they felt compelled to take COVID tests - which came back negative. Which  magazine slammed the hotel as one of the worst hotels weaposve ever inspected in  and relisted it as such in , condemning the venue with . out of  stars for cleanliness and the same on food. Their brutal review told holidaymakers to avoid at all costs and said the regency-style hotel makes Fawlty Towers look like the Ritz. Paul, a recruitment business boss, said: It was on the seafront, it was like £ for three nights, so it wasnapost cheap. So we get to the room and itaposs cold and damp. My friendaposs bed wasnapost made so it was pretty obvious that it hadnapost been cleaned beforehand. Thataposd be bad enough, but during Covid times, itaposs unacceptable. Especially when on their website, they guarantee all rooms are following Covid regulations and have regular housekeeping. There was blood and urine stains on my friendaposs mattress. My friend actually hadnapost noticed the stains at first, because they were underneath the top sheet. The sheet came up a bit and thataposs when we saw it. There was what I can only gather to be pubic hair in the bath. There were tobacco remains on the table. The whole thing was horric really.  Me and my friend went down to see the manager, but he wasnapost available. We left a message and were told that somebody would be in touch with us, but it didnapost happen. Because we were there for a mini-break, I didnapost want to spend all my time that weekend trying to chase down the manager. We had no other alternatives, everywhere  we checked was booked up so we had no choice but to stay there. We would have moved, but there were no other hotels available. Plus we couldnapost get a hold of the manager so we were in a bit of a stalemate. They said there was daily housekeeping, but our room wasnapost cleaned once. Me and my friend took Covid tests after our stay, just in case. Tests came back fine, thankfully. Paul took the issue further and emailed the hotelaposs manager, hoping to get a full refund. Paul said: When I emailed the manager, he came back saying aposThis isnapost part of our usual high standard, weaposll make sure this never happens againapos, and offered us a % refund, which would have worked out at about £. I was a bit insulted by that, and I emailed back saying aposThataposs not good enoughapos. Then he came back with an email titled aposFinal offerapos, which I thought was a bit cheeky, aswe were in some sort of negotiation. He once again offered the same % refund, and % offwe were to stay again. I sent an email back saying aposI wonapost be staying at the hotel again, so the % doesnapost apply. I want a full refund.apos I didnapost hear from him after that.  Itaposs a bit insulting that weaposre just being ignored. The whole experience was horrible. Iaposm into complaining normally, but this was just horrendous. It wasnapost something silly like a crack in the window, this was blood and urine stains. We didnapost spend too much time in the hotel over the weekend for obvious reasons. Itaposs completely unacceptable, especially for the price I paid. The Britannia website boasts that the -room Royal Albion is aposone of the most popularapos in Brighton and claims it aposoffers character and style in a premier positionapos while being aposproud of its reputation as a family hotelapos.

Her parents, Prince Edward and Sophie Wessex, previously said they would allow their children to decide whether to become senior royals at the age of . Lady Louise has not confirmed yet whether she would like to become a senior royal or not, but an insider said the teenager is likely to continue her studies and go to university, the Daily Star reports.What are your views on this story  Let us know in the comments below If she decides to become a senior member of the Royal Family and take on royal duties, Lady Louise may fill a gap left by Prince Harry, Meghan Markle as well as Prince Andrew.The Duke and Duchess of Sussex announced they would step down as senior royals in January , and after that they moved to the US, where they now live with their two children, Archie and Lilibet. Before that, the Duke of York had announced he would step back from royal duties for the foreseeable future because of the Jeffrey Epstein scandal. When Harry, Meghan and Andrew stepped down as senior royals, other members of the Firm had to step up and take on extra duties.

Itaposs incredible to have learned first hand from him and definitely made us closer, I think. She continued: After a competition, he would always ask how it went. His eyes would light up because he just gets so excited when he talks about it. When we would go carriage driving, first of all, he would take me on a dferent route every day, I do not know how he managed to do that, but tell me all sorts of anecdotes about absolutely anything and everything. Heaposs honestly one of the most interesting people, Iaposve ever met. Discussing the Duke of Edinburgh awards, that her grandfather pioneered, Lady Louise added: aposIaposd always wanted to do it because of the skills you develop as a result. My favourite part was my expeditions, just having that level of independence and self-sufficiency and having that sense of achievement when it was finished.

Louise is the daughter of Prince Edward and Sophie Wessex and the youngest granddaughter of the Queen and the late Prince Philip.She is currently studying for her A-levels with her mum keen for her to go on to university. But some royal experts believe she could play a key role in the Firm going forward and won over many royal fans with her moving words about her late grandfather earlier this year.  Here we look at how she is becoming, as one royal expert put it, precisely the kind of person the Queen can rely on. Growing up Louise, who officially becomes an adult today and is th in line to the throne, was born prematurely in November . She was born after mum Sophie suffered a placental abruption and was rushed to hospital. Her dad Edward was not present at her birth as she arrived early when he was on an official visit to Mauritius.

The family live in Bagshot Park, just a few miles from Windsor Castle, and Louise was joined by a younger brother, James, Viscount Severn in .Her first major royal appearance came aged seven when she was a bridesmaid at the wedding of her older cousin Prince William to the Duchess of Cambridge in .She also accompanied her parents on a tour of South Africa in  but public appearances as a child were few and far between. aposFavourite grandchildaposEven though she largely grew up out of the spotlight, Louise has a very close relationship with the Queen and the late Prince Philip. She and her brother James are said to have spent a lot of time with their grandparents due to living close to Windsor and being around at a time when Her Majesty and the Duke of Edinburgh had largely stopped travelling internationally. In fact, growing up, Louise had no concept that her grandmother and the Queen were the same person.Mum Sophie once said: I mean Louise had no concept really that the Queen and her grandmother were one and the same person. “It wasn’t until she was at school that other children were mentioning it and saying, ‘Your gran is the Queen’.Sources have said the Queen and Philip were particularly fond of Louise due to their shared love for the outdoors. An insider previously told the Sun: The Queen loves the fact that Louise and James relish their time at Balmoral, and she has become particularly close to Louise, who seems to have become her favourite grandchild, closely followed by James. Meanwhile, Louise also took up her late grandfatheraposs favourite sport of carriage driving, and recently spoke about they bonded over their love of the hobby. Speaking on the documentary Prince Philip: The Family Remembers, she said: The Duke of Edinburgh has been so involved in my driving, but itaposs slightly scary as he invented the sport pretty much. But itaposs incredible to have learned first-hand from him and it definitely made us closer I think. Family fans But it isnapost just the Queen that Louise has endeared herself to - other royals were also said to be impressed by her during their get-togethers at Balmoral.She is said to have helped out Kate and William by looking after their children while at the Highland estate, and even sat patiently with Princess Charlotte - helping her to draw pictures of the wildle.A source previously told the Sun: Because of her obvious artistic skill, the Queen allowed Louise to look through some of the collection of Queen Victoria’s Highlands sketches which are kept at Balmoral but are rarely dug out these days.Public debut  Now, itaposs not just her family who think highly of the -year-old - Louise won over new fans during her public speaking debut in September.In the documentary Prince Philip: The Family Remembers, Louise spoke fondly and movingly about her late grandfather.Sharing her experiences of taking part in the Duke of Edinburghaposs Award scheme, she said: Iaposd always wanted to do it because of the skills that you develop as a result. But there was certainly an element of making my grandfather proud and honouring him by taking part in the award that has been so much of his leaposs work. And I definitely hope that I have made him proud. Viewers were touched by Louiseaposs comments and one took to Twitter writing: I thought the star of this programme was easily Lady Louise. What a lovely girl she is.Another said: Wow how good was it to see Lady Louise Windsor in her first documentary. While another added: Lady Louise has such fabulous memories of her grandfather, it was a beautul interview and they must miss him very much. Title and royal work Now sheaposs turned , Louise will now have a big decision to make - and it regards her title. When she and her younger brother James were born, their parents decided against them using their HRH titles. However, mum Sophie revealed in an interview last year they do indeed have the titles, and it will be up to them when they turn they want to use them.Speaking to the Sunday Times, Sophie said: We try to bring them up with the understanding they are very likely to have to work for a living.“Hence we made the decision not to use HRH titles. They have them and can decide to use them from , but I think it’s highly unlikely.”  But despite Sophie saying itaposs unlikely Louise will use her title, some experts believe she could be an asset to the royals.Expert Phil Dampier told theLouise could be a secret weapon adding: She seems to be very mature for her age and she’s shaping up to be precisely the kind of person the Queen can rely on in the future. Could there be a role for her in a slimmed-down monarchy  The Queen and Philip had , patronages between them.“You have to ask yourself who is going to continue their legacy with Harry and Meghan and Prince Andrew off the scene  There’s a huge workload there.”While another expert, Richard Fitzwilliam, previously told the Express : Lady Louise has kept a rather charming but low profile.With the number of working royals now fewer and most being from the older generation until George, Charlotte and Louis are able to take on royal duties, there may well be charitable ventures she may wish to support in future years and from that may follow occasional royal engagements. Immediate future  However, now sheaposs turned , itaposs unlikely that Louiseaposs role in the royal family will change quickly.She currently attends a private school in Ascot, where she is studying for her A-levels. And it seems her mum is hoping she will attend university, saying: I wouldn’t force her, butshe wants to. She’s quite clever.She also told BBC Radio : I would hope that she can go on with her studies, which I think she probably will want to do, and I hope that she and her friends will protect her from anything that somebody might want to do.But I have to let her live her le. Itaposs not mine to live. I can only equip her the best that I can, and then she has to make her own choices. “But I hope for the next few years, at least, she will still be able to be as private as she wants to be.And in the same interview, Sophie also revealed how Louise has shunned social media and added: I wouldnapost deny her going onto it. But sheaposs not really that interested in it.“There are a few s that she talks to her friends on. But thataposs basically it. She doesnapost put anything out about herself at all. Sheaposs very private. Sheaposs got her eyes fairly wide open.

Ken Smith, , has shunned traditional le since he was  after being attacked on a night out and left unconscious for  days with a brain haemorrhage. Doctors told him he would never be able to speak or walk again, but wanting to prove them wrong and having struck up an interest in wilderness living, Ken travelled to Canada.  While there he says he wondered what what happenhe just exited off the highway and went into nowhere, so he decided to find out - walking , miles on his own before ing home to Derbyshire. But when he got back his world was turned upside down after finding out both his parents had died while he was away. In his grief Ken walked theof Britain before reaching Rannoch in the Highlands.He told a BBC documentary: I cried all the way while walking. I thought where is the most isolated place in Britain I went around and followed every bay and every Ben where there wasnapost a house built.  Hundreds and hundreds of miles of nothingness. I looked across the loch and saw this woodland. In that stretch of wilderness- a full two hours walk from the nearest road - Ken knew heaposd found his new home. Ken built his own cabin from scratch after experimenting with dferent designs using sticks, and for the last  years that has been his haven from everyday le.All these years later the building does have a roaring log fire, but no running water or electricity, the BBC reports.  To feed himself Ken forages in the forest and and grows vegetables, but his main source of food comes from the loch after he taught himself to fish. His days are spent quietly living alongside the loch, and for the past two years he has allowed BBC documentary maker Lizzie McKenzie to film him at his home. But tragedy struck just days after the documentary director Lizzie left Ken, as he suffered a stroke while in the snow in February . He was able to call for help with an GPS personal locator beacon he had been given just prior to the stroke, which in turn sent a signal to Houston, Texas, where operators informed the Coastguard in the UK.  He was rushed to a hospital in Fort William where he spent seven weeks recovering, but despite doctors insistence he shouldto civilisation, Ken refused, just wanting toto his home. A year after his stroke, Ken was injured again after a log pile fell on him and had to once again be airlted to hospital. But in the months after his stroke Ken has been more open to receiving help, and the head stalker of the estate Ken lives on will bring him food every few weeks, paid for out of Kenaposs pension. Aware he is not getting any younger, Ken admits he is no worried about future, and wants to spend his final days at the cabin.

Camilla Tomineysaid that the couple were aposstuck on the sidelinesapos and other royals had beaten the Susssexes at their own game. She made the remarks on aposRoyal Insightapos after the Sussexes spoke about the environment in recent days.While the pair voiced their concerns, senior members of the royal family actively participated in Glasgowaposs COP summit, reports the Express.Because of the distance, the Duke and Duchess are struggling to remain relevant, sparking an identity crisis, the expert claims. Describing the coupleaposs approach, Ms Tominey said: “The Duke and Duchess of Sussex are in self-promotional mode which puts them in a problematic situation when it comes to being relevant during Cop.” In a video discussing the situation, Ms Tominey said that the Sussexes’ are “growing their bank balance” which she claims makes it problematic as they try to bolster their image as “global change leaders.Speaking of how other royals are outshining the Sussexes’, the Daily aposs Associate Editor said: “The Royal Family have some good history when it comes to speaking out on the environment, they have a legacy, starting with the Duke of Edinburgh, and the Prince of Wales who covered environmental matters before they were fashionable.”  She also praised Prince William in his role in the Earthshot Prize. She claimed it made the royals more credible than some politicians who attended the summit and aposfailed to make an impactaposapos. Ms Tominey said politicians were in it for the election impact, yet it was less easy to criticise royals who have been campaigning on the matter for decades. She then claimed senior royals have stolen the limelight from Harry and Meghan, as their role is on the “sidelines” of the summit has had little impact. Ms Tominey went on to say the Duke of Edinburgh was the “original green eco-warrior.

Mr Parke said: “Giving people the option to display their pronouns at work is really important as it encourages them to show allyship towards trans and non-binary colleagues. “Many of us already include our pronouns in our email signatures, but when you’re talking to people in person it’s useful to know how they want to be referred to in order to help everyone feel comfortable and avoid any misgendering. “Right now trans people in the UK are facing more abuse and discrimination than ever before, and so it’s up to all of us to create an inclusive culture and make sure everyone gets the respect they deserve. “It’s great that MS is proactively taking these sorts of steps to support and celebrate LGBTQ+ colleagues.” Sasha Misra, associate director of communications and campaigns at Stonewall, said: “It’s great to see an increasing number of businesses offering the option of badges with pronouns for staff. “Creating an inclusive workplace starts with everyday actions, and having pronouns on badges is a simple yet impactful way to make sure LGBTQ+ identities are respected – for employees and customers alike.” Comment MORE ON Marks  Spencer\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Linzie Mathieson, from Kingswells in Aberdeen, was rushed to hospital when her waters broke at  weeks and she was put on antibiotics to prevent infection before being sent home to rest.When she went into labour in August this year she was warned her sons Alfie and Harry were unlikely to survive after they were delivered by emergency C-section, the Daily Record reports. She said the boys were delivered and whisked away to the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit where they were worked on for a few hours to stabilise them. Both were placed on ventilators and Harry was given Nitric. At this point, Linzie was told that the next  hours would be critical. Poor Harryaposs lungs were underdeveloped and he needed a lot of help in the first few weeks of his le. Alfie came off the ventilator before his brother but had to be put back on a week later as the pair fought hard and battled every hurdle in their way. The boys have since spent eight weeks in intensive care and four weeks in high dependency after their birth.  They are now receiving treatment on a specialist care ward but due to improvements Linzie hopes to welcome them home soon.

Hours early, and on board BA’s flight, there was a chorus of applause as it, and Virgin Atlantic’s jet took to the skies together in a first for two commercial services.You could also hear the palpable sigh of relief from the airline bigwigs present that this moment had arrived, and with it their hope will make a fightback from what has driven other competitors to the wall.  It is also important for those businesses that can finally meet others face-to-face. And it is a big day for tourism chiefs in the Big Apple banking on aof the big spending British shoppers. But yesterday was never really about the firms involved, it was about the iniduals on board - and those who have rushed to book flights - counting down the hours, the day the weeks until they can embrace precious loved ones again.

Kennedy Airport. Almost lost for words, she said: “It’s been heart wrenching. It is so overwhelming.” Louise, her make-up running from the tears she was shedding, said: “It’s been  days to the day since we’ve last seen each other. “She’s missed so much.”  Along with Louise, who now lives in Connecticut, was daughter Denaine, , who held aloft a sign saying “We missed you” and son Bowie, five, with his message: “Do I look bigger,  days missed” and surrounded with love hearts. Kushnahar Islam,  and her daughter Nicola Islam, , travelled from Kent to meet sister Aisha Methew, , her husband Vincent Methew and their two kids Adam and Aaron. It was the first time Mrs Islam had met the youngest grandchild, Aaron. Aisha, from New Jersey, said: “It’s been eighteen months but it feels like it has been  years.  “It is so wonderful to be back together. “It feels so surreal that we are finally here. “We are just so happy.” The first British Airways flight - and another by Virgin Atlantic - took off simultaneously from dferent runways at Heathrow Airport in what is believed to be a first. The flights, and a fleet of others that jetted off from the UK to other US destinations, marked what travel bosses are hoping is a milestone in its long journey back to recovery from the Covid crisis.  Yesterday’s change to US entry requirements follows the UK Government’s decision in the summer to lt quarantine restrictions for fully vaccinated US customers when travelling to Britain. In ,  million people travelled between the two countries, along with , tonnes of cargo. The same year saw £.billion spent by Brits travelling to and in the US, and vice versa. While today signalled the lting of the ban, only double vaccinated passengers are being allowed in.  Another of those counting down the days to yesterday was Maria Butter, , who finally meet up with best pal Mario after  years apart. The pair grew up together in their native Columbia, and Maria, who now lives in Manchester, was due to fly to Mario’s wedding in spring , when the pandemic saw the US impose a ban on UK nationals arriving. “Despite being apart for so long, we were so close,” Mrs Butter, a Spanish teacher told the Mirror. “He is like an uncle to my daughter. “Not being at his wedding was so upsetting. “During the pandemic you realised who was important to you.  Christian Marcelia, , said he was “excited and a bit nervous” to fly to New York to visit his girlfriend. He said: “My girlfriend lives over there, so we’ve been sort of long distance for two years. “I’m going there to meet her family for the first time.” They have been a couple for nearly two years, he said, spending most of that time on dferent continents due to pandemic-induced travel restrictions.“  Phil Drummond, , was on one of the last flights to leave the US before the ban came into force in March last year - and was on the first possible flight back to meet his sister Bobbe . During that time his brother-in-law in the US contracted Covid-, and thankfully recovered. “She would have come to us last Christmas but obviously that couldn’t happen,” he said. “It’s just brilliant to finally get to see her again.” Bobbe were there to greet him, along with her six year old son Ben, who was holding a colourful “Welcome Back Uncle Phil” hand written sign he had made and a red big apple balloon.  “It is so, so strange,” she said. “It is surreal. “In some ways it’s like I only saw him yesterday.” The ban on Brits has devastated many airlines, but few more so than British Airways and Virgin Atlantic which relied heavily on the lucrative transatlantic routes. Sean Doyle, BA chief executive, said yesterday: “We have been hibernating for a lot longer than any of us feared when the pandemic started, so it is great to have an important milestone today. “The emotional toll of the pandemic has been huge, but so has the toll on business. “The amount of business done between the two countries is huge. “You need to get in front of people to build relationships and build economic activity.” Travellers to the US still need to conduct costly Covid tests before arrival. Mr Doyle backed calls for the testing to be ditched. “The evidence we have seen in Europe where double vaccinated travellers don’t have to do testing is…no dferent to what we are seeing,” he said. “With the vaccine programmes I would say we shouldn’t have testing for fully vaccinated passengers.” The BA flight was also billed as its greenest ever for long-haul , and the first directly powered by sustainable aviation fuel. With the focus still on the out of the COP climate summit in Glasgow, some % of the jet fuel used came recycled cooking oil. BA is % of its jet fuel to come from less environmentally damaging sources by .

But it has ided some film fans and royal experts, with some calling the accuracy of some of the scenes into question - even though the director described the film as a fable from a true tragedy rather than a biopic.However, one of the more bizarre scenes in the movie sees Dianaaposs character being weighed on her arrival at Sandringham. But having to stand on the scales both on arrival and departure from Sandringham is apparently something the royals actually do. Royal expert Ingrid Seward once told Grazia the Queen ensures that the guests weigh themselves on a pair of antique scales in a tradition that dates back to Edward VII.Edward wanted to ensure his guests were fed well and any visitors to Sandringham were required to sit on the device and be weighed upon arrival and departure to seethey had put on pounds during their stay. However itaposs unclearitaposs something the royals still do today, oritaposs something to stay in the history books. Love the royals for the Mirroraposs daily newsletter to get all the latest news on the Queen, Charles, Kate, Wills, Meghan, Harry and the rest of The Firm. Click here to sign up.But regardless of whether they monitor it or not, thereaposs a good chance they might put on a bit of weight given the lavish food available for the royals to eat - especially on Christmas Day. Darren McGrady, who used to work in the royal kitchens, has previously said: After church, thataposs when they have a big lunch that includes a salad with shrimp or lobster, and a roasted turkey, and all of your traditional side dishes like parsnips, carrots, Brussels sprouts, and Christmas pudding with brandy butter for dessert. They stick with the same meal year after year. Later they are said to enjoy tea and cake before tucking into a candlelit dinner later that evening.This year, the Queen is said to be “totally committed” to entertaining her loved ones at her Norfolk home this Christmas after missing out last year because of the pandemic. She is currently in the middle of a period of rest and is not set to undertake any public engagements until at least the weekend for the annual Remembrance Sunday service.Last year restrictions meant the Queen and the late Prince Philip had a quiet Christmas alone at Windsor Castle.But after losing her husband of  years in April, it is understood Her Majesty really wants to see everyone together. A Palace insider said: “This year, more than ever, it is incredibly important to Her Majesty to be surrounded by her loved ones. “The Queen is totally committed to hosting everyone as she hopes to make it back to full health in the coming weeks. “Her Majesty is resting under doctors’ orders with the intention of being able to fully enjoy the company of her extended family over the holiday period. “After being forced to cancel a host of engagements, the family get-together will be the perfect tonic.” Comment MORE ON Princess DianaChristmasRoyal Family\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily royal round-up direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Liane Greenly, , decided to get organised while preparing for an upcoming shoulder operation. She wanted to cook and freeze meals in advance, so her partner wouldnapost have to do everything while she was out of action.She spent £ at Aldi - and managed to make everything she bought stretch for three months, the Liverpool Echo reports.Liane, who lives in Lincoln, made everything from cottage pie to cardamom biscuits to ensure she and her partner would have a delicious home-cooked meal every night while she was recovering. She said: “I had an upcoming shoulder reconstruction surgery booked. “With my partner working full-time and doing a science degree on his days off, there was no way he’d manage all that, plus helping me, cooking and cleaning. So I made a list of our favourite meals, a list of the ingredients, and tubs required to house them. Then I bought a chest freezer. Granted I bought one too small - my maths needs work. I then did what partner calls the ‘anti-shopping list’, where I checked off in my cupboards what I already had in.  I batch cooked the main meal element for our evening meal. Any rice, pasta, vegetables and other sides would be bought and cooked as needed. Batch cooking was a necessity to help us both whilst I faced three months of recovery. It turned out the surgery got cancelled and so we are now using the meals. But as and when the surgery is re confirmed I will re-do all this again. Liane says she used the same base ingredients for ious meals, LatestDeals reports. She continued: “For example, spaghetti, lasagne and cottage pie are all similar until the last few ingredients. Some pasta sauces could be made in minutes, so I quickly whipped them up in a lunch break. We froze everything. I even pre-made marinated fajita kits frozen raw, ready to defrost and fry up. Liane says batch cooking is not only cheaper than cooking nightly, but also makes feeding her and her partner much easier and quicker. She added: My current plan is to [do] batch cooking every two or three months and to restock the chest freezer. “Batch cooking has helped us save at least £ a week easily on our food shopping.” Tom Church, co-founder of LatestDeals, said: “I recently had my first child and I found batch cooking to be a saviour when you’re tired and without much time to cook. “It’s amazing how Liane managed to make her £ shop last for so long. Her cooking looks really delicious too.“If you want to do the same, a quick Google search elicits millions of results for batch cooking recipes.“All you need is some freezer space, some plastic tubs, some tasty ingredients and a bit of time on your hands, and you too can be well on your way to batch cooking success, saving you time, money and hassle.

Anti-hunting campaign group Hertfordshire Hunt Saboteurs published a clip showing a woman being aggressive towards the animal after it ran into a road. In the footage, she can be seen kicking the horse and then punching the animal before pulling it by the reins into a vehicle. The rider, dressed in cream breeches and a navy jacket, is believed to be part of Cottesmore Hunt, a foxhound pack based in Rutland. The RSPCA - the largest animal welfare charity in the UK - launched an appeal for information after the video was shared on social media at the weekend.  Several people contacted the charity to urge them to investigate the incident.A person tweeted: This is unacceptable!!! That poor horse was hit and kicked. Every day more shocking evidence emerges of the violent cruelty these hunts inflict on innocent animals. Ridiculous that they are allowed to get away with it.One replied: Totally agree with you something seriously need to be done about it no animal should be treated like that. Another person said: As a horsewoman myself, nothing makes me angrier than seeing footage such as this. It is shameful. There is absolutely no excuse for this behaviour.  No matter how frustrated you are, no matteryou’ve had a bad day. Horses are so sensitive. What a way to make them head shy. Following the incident, Cottesmore Hunt reportedly said it did not condone the actions shown in the video under any circumstances.The Hunting Office condemned the actions of the woman, saying she is not a member of the hunting associations. The RSPCA said in a statement: This footage is really upsetting. We will always look into complaints made to us about animal welfare. We would urge anyone with first hand information about this incident to contact us on   . A spokesman from the Hunting Office said: The Hunting Office expects the highest level of animal welfare at all times - both on and off the hunting field - and condemns the actions taken by this inidual, who is not a member of the hunting associations. The Mirror has contacted Cottesmore Hunt for comment.

Lee-Joshua Hodgson, three, had groin swelling and a cough when his parents took him to a GP in March last year. He was then taken to hospital, but sent home with antibiotics after doctors decided the odd ailments were caused by a virus, Liverpool Echo reports.Some months later dad Josh found a lump on the back of the toddleraposs knee when he fell over. Doctors initially thought it was a cyst and booked the youngster in for scans in December.The family were sent home on Christmas Eve with the belief all would be okay. But a further scan ruptured the familyaposs le when it showed an extremely rare and aggressive form of terminal cancer.  The cancer - which is called a metastatic rhabdomyosarcoma alveolar - is usually found in the bodyaposs soft tissues.On Boxing Day the youngster underwent major surgery to remove a tumour latched on to his spine.The growth stopped him walking and the cancer in his bones had also caused his hip to break. The cancer - which is called a metastatic rhabdomyosarcoma alveolar - had spread across his body and the little one was given between just five to  per cent chance of survival. Dad Josh said: He had  rounds of radiotherapy which he had to be put to sleep for and six-months of the most intense chemotherapy.  He responded well to it and then was put on maintenance therapy but he was complaining of pain in his back and head and for a long time nothing seemed to get done. I believe the surgery he had on Boxing Day opened a gateway for the disease to spread to other parts of his body. The family was given more devastating news in October of this year when they found out that the cancer had spread to his brain, with one lesion being close to the brainstem. Doctors told the family the cancer was terminal and they do not know how long the three-year-old has left to live.  Josh added: They told me it is terminal, but thataposs the NHS opinion. From a parents point of view, we believe we will find something and we are still looking.Whilst he is still here fighting, we will keep fighting for him. Heaposs the strongest kid Iaposve ever met in my le. Since his terrible prognosis, heaposs been much better in himself. We were told he wouldnapost walk again but we got him walking ourselves. This is a soft tissue cancer, it will pop up everywhere and anywhere because the whole body is soft tissue so why werenapost the right decisions made and scanning done sooner  A fundraiser was set up earlier in the year to help the family to fund specialist, private treatment abroad.Bringing in more than £,, the family said they were in talks with doctors in Spain to discuss options. Josh said: The one we were waiting for, we were told will no longer work for him and we are just waiting to hear back about another combination of treatments. Heaposs on a type of chemotherapy now on the NHS and they think he will respond well to it. It wonapost cure him, weaposve been told we will lose him to this disease but hopefully it will shrink it. Thereaposs a trial thataposs not available here yet, we havenapost got the time, but hopefully this treatment will give him long enough until this trial pops up. In a bid to help the family through this awful time, Kirkby residents Franny Briggs and Jay Murray decided to sleep on the streets from Friday evening to Sunday morning armed with portable phone charges and sleeping bags. Franny, who is recognised in the community for helping those in need, said: We originally wanted to raise funds to help baby Lee travel for treatment but now thataposs not possible as his cancer is too far gone. So this money is to make the family more comfortable with the time they have left. Weaposve done all kinds to raise money but this time we wanted to do something dferent so decided to sleep rough. We didnapost leave the town centre at all and relied on donations given to us on the day, we only had our phones to keep an eye on the fundraising. We raised £, which is great. It was was very cold but we battled on and we had lots of food from local shops and businesses, so we shared that with the real homeless that were there. Anyone wishing to donate can still do so online. Josh added: Franny and Jay said the money was to spend on memories, whatever we decided as a family. Itaposs fantastic, unbelievable what they did. They are brilliant in what they do for the community. Iaposve never even met them before and what theyaposve done for us is crazy. We have that many people to thank but we would like to thank everyone for their support. A gang of kids did a car wash aged three and four and raised £ which was touching, itaposs kids helping kids. The whole community is rallying together. Even people in Huyton. As fantastic as it is. money wonapost change the look on my face but hopefully it will do something when something does pop up.

A group that scours derelict buildings around Scotland shared pictures online of the factory - but they have not revealed the exact location.Images show huge piles of dried-up plant cuttings in the attic, as well as rows of bags of soil, the Daily Record reports.The bar area still has tables laid out with drinks and cutlery, as well as an untouched wedding cake on display. Half-empty bottles of spirits remain on the bar alongside unopened packets of crisps, while boxes of fertiliser are stacked in the back.  The explorer posted images of the “abandoned weed pub” to a social media group with more than , members. They wrote: “When drink runs out, let’s get high.” Despite several requests by social media users to find out where the pictures were taken, the explorer refused to give out the location. Urban exploring has become massive with more and more bloggers posting on YouTube and social media.  But the pastime has prompted debates on the legalities of accessing private property and appeals from emergency services over safety issues.Over summer, an urban explorer digging through a creepy abandoned house in the Scottish Highlands uncovered the mummied remains of a cat in the kitchen.The empty family home was described as being frozen in time by YouTuber Adam Mark Explores , in a clip that sees him take his k subscribers on a tour of the decaying building. Upon entering the house, Adam described the “dark and eerie” atmosphere, as well as a silence which he said put him on edge as he made his way through.  The video showed the rotting house scattered with old books, magazines and newspapers, dated between the s and s. Speaking over the eerie footage, which panned through the dferent rooms of the house, Adam described the thick layer of dust that coated the furniture and the decayed antique dolls. Most of the windows were stained glass which looked amazing with the sun beaming through projecting the colours into the rooms,” Adam said. Scenes from within the house included a dining room table, covered in dirt but miraculously still set with plates and cutlery.

The “friend” who thinks knowing us insulates them from the charge of racism when they are being just that. Ex-England cricketer Gary Ballance admitted in a statement last week he’d called Yorkshire teammate, Azeem Rafiq, a “P***” – but said it was done “in the spirit of friendly banter” . Ballance has come clean because, in August , Rafiq gave an interview in which he spoke about the racism he experienced at Yorkshire, including an “openly racist” captain and a dressing room in which racist comments were seen as humorous. The club effectively stuck its head in the sand, but an independent report has blown the whole thing wide open. Sponsors have withdrawn their cash, chairman Roger Hutton has resigned and English cricket’s most successful county has been banned from hosting internationals.  But back to Ballance. He claims to be incredulous that calling an Asian person the P-word could cause the kind of hurt and anguish it did to Rafiq. “If I’d believed it, I would have stopped immediately,” said Ballance. “He was my best cricket mate and I cared deeply for him.” Just not enough to stop using this horrendous racist slur against him. It is easy to believe this is a story just about Yorkshire, cricket or even sport. It isn’t. Go into any office, factory, shop floor or football club you like and you’ll find at least one dinosaur convinced that racist abuse can be used as a term of affection. ‘Can a racist term ever be defined as banter ’ trilled the Twitter account of the BBC’s Question Time. Yes, really. It may as well have asked whether slapping your partner is ever justied. Or whether political corruption is ever justiedthe money is for a good cause.  If ever we needed a snapshot of the institutional racism that infects this country to its core, the past week has provided it. Ironically, there is more outrage and anger directed at those who call it out - as Rafiq has found to his cost - than at the issue itself. Yet the fact remains, across any number of industries and sports, iniduals like him iniably find themselves one of the only Black or Asian people in the room at the mercy of the bigots. Across the country you’ll find iniduals pulling the emergency ripcord defence that their workmate, best friend, neighbour, partner, even husband or we is black. Asthat allows them a free pass to use the kind of language or go down the routes that would otherwise see them vilied. The Government does it even now. Prime Minister Boris Johnson surrounds himself with gatekeepers such as Kwasi Kwarteng, Kemi Badenoch and Priti Patel, believing it protects him from stick for describing Burqa-wearing women as looking like letterboxes. Or describing black people as ‘picaninnies’. Question Time is no exception. Presumably pointing to whatever black or Asian members it has on its production team. And no, it is no defence that the offensive question tweeted was one posed by an audience member to spark debate. Rafiq’s forthcoming appearance in front of a parliamentary select committee may well bring the rest of Yorkshire’s house of cards down. But the shock waves are already reverberating way beyond cricket. PS: You’re not someone’s friendyou’re using racist language towards them.

Alexander Cardinale, , and his we Daphna, , welcomed a little girl in September  and became immediately suspicious because the baby had a darker skin tone than theirs.Initially, they put their thoughts aside as they trusted the IVF process and started raising the child as they fell in love with her. However, two months after the birth, they decided to carry out at-home DNA tests, making the shocking discovery that the girl was not their biological daughter and they had been raising someone aposs child. The tests also meant that another couple had been raising the Cardinalesapos biological child. Together with the couple who had been affected by the mix-up, the parents decided to swap the girls and start raising their own babies - after missing out on their births and first months of le.  This week, they announced their decision to sue the IVF clinic where the alleged mix-up happened. Mrs Cardinale said her familyaposs heartbreak and confusion canapost be understated, adding she was robbed of the ability to carry my own child.The lawsuit explains that the couple sought help from the Calornia Center for Reproductive Healthand In VitroTech Labs, an embryology lab, in the summer of .In VitroTech Labs allegedly inserted the embryos into the wrong women. The legal document reads: Daphna was surgically implanted - against her will or knowledge - with the sperm and egg of a man and woman who were complete strangers to her. Meanwhile, Daphna and Alexander’s embryo was transferred to that same couple, Couple Two, a few weeks after Daphna’s transfer procedure. Couple Two carried to term and gave birth to a baby girl - Alexander and Daphna’s biological child - and raised her for months before Defendants’ mistakes were uncovered and proven.  The lawsuit adds that when Mrs Cardinale gave birth to a daughter that was not hers, her husband felt like something was wrong. The document explains: He expected to see a fair child, much like their older daughter. Instead, their Birth Daughter came out with much darker skin and jet-black hair. It was so jarring that Alexander actually took several steps away from the birthing table, backing up against the wall. According to the document, some friends and family members also started questioning the couple about the babyaposs appearance. The situation led to disconnect between the couple as Mr Cardinale - a musician - was worried his we was in denial.  He was so upset that he would stay up at night, staring at their newborn child, wonderingshe was truly theirs, the lawsuit adds. The document says: After learning this, Daphna insisted they take the DNA test, expecting that the results would put everyone’s mind at ease. After several rounds of DNA tests, the Cardinales found out the truth and on December ,  contacted the couple who had been raising their biological child. When they met at a lawyeraposs office, their meeting was terribly uncomfortable, the legal document says. On December , the couples met with their children and for the first time they got to see their biological daughters.  The following day, the Cardinales told their older daughter about the mix-up and she was crushed and terried of losing her birth sister, begging her parents not to switch the babies. About two weeks later, the parents officially switched their children, which took an emotional toll on the whole family. The lawsuit states: The horror of this situation cannot be understated. Mrs Cardinale, who works as a therapist, and her singer-songwriter husband have had to seek help for symptoms of anxiety, depression, and PTSD, the legal action explains. Adam B Wolf, a lawyer representing the Cardinales, said the second family also plans to sue the IVF clinic but wants to remain anonymous. In vitro fertilisationis one of several techniques available to help people with fertility problems have a baby.During IVF, an egg is removed from the womanaposs oies and fertilised with sperm in a laboratory, the NHS explains.The fertilised egg, called an embryo, is then ed to the womanaposs womb to grow and develop. It can be carried out using your eggs and your partneraposs sperm, or eggs and sperm from donors. The Mirror has contacted CCRH and In VitroTech Labs for comment.

Veronika Rajekaposs social media profile are regularly reported as being fake, she has claimed. The -year-old believes that aposle is harder for beautul people and that she so hot people just think Iaposm fake. Others allegedly bully the former Miss Slovakia  finalist for having had plastic surgery, which she insists isnapost true. People don’t even believe I exist, Veronika said. It’s pretty discriminatory that other women can do the same thing as me and I can’t, and I just get deleted because of my looks.  I call myself an alien as people don’t believe I’m real. They think I’m an AI robot or a catfish online. People say beautul people have it easy but I have it worse as people make it harder for me because I’m beautul.The model, based in Vienna, Austria, travels the world making content for her Instagram – and claims people are always surprised when they meet her for the first time.Veronika claims she receives hundreds of messages from women body shaming her on a regular basis and that many claim she uses filters to advance her looks.  Veronika, who has . million followers on Instagram, said: I get messages from men who donapost think Iaposm real but the worst messages on my Instagram are from women asking me why I’m pretending and asking for proof. I don’t make any adjustments, shaping or filters – I use a skin smoothing tool but I think that’s normal. Skinny girls are body shaming plus-sized models but I’m being body shamed too as they donapost think I’m natural.  I get more abuse from women as they are jealous and they think I want their boyfriend. Only women can hurt other women so strongly. I donapost think I’m perfect but I’m natural in real le, but people are scared of me and donapost want to talk to me. To end the rumours of plastic surgery and claims sheaposs a catfish or robot, Veronika has resorted to desperate measures. She is planning to get a scan of her breasts to prove people wrong. The model paid £ for a breast examination while in Dubai in October, which included a quick scan. She said: I was forced to do this check-up to get people to believe me. People question the naturality of my breasts so I went to a doctor to get a breast examination and proof that they’re real, with no enhancements, objects or scars. My doctor was really surprised as she thought I’d had surgery too and said I had the most beautul natural breasts.  I worked out so much at teenage years that I developed muscles which make my breasts a nice shape. I’m not trying to be sexual, I just have big boobs. God gave me these gts and I want people to believe me. Veronika takes good care of her body - not drinking or partying, instead working out five times a week. But her beauty has also come at a price. She added: ‘I don’t have many friends but I feel good. If you feel beautul the way you are, then you are beautul. If you feel confident in your body and you are plus-sized, then just be confident. “If you have had plastic surgery, just be honest. If you take care of yourself, you can be beautul too.

A reunion filled with joy and emotion. Charlene travelled to South Africa in March for a conservation trip but her prolonged absence from Monaco had seen her and Albert face calls to revealtheir marriage was on the rocks following rumours all was not well in their relationship.According to the , her trip to South Africa came shortly after reports surfaced that her husband, , was facing a paternity suit after being accused of fathering a love child early in their relationship. He already has two children out of wedlock.

Charlene, , failed toto Monaco to celebrate her th anniversary with her husband in July but said she wasnapost allowed to travel due to a serious ear, nose and throat infection and has since had several surgeries. In August, Albert flew out to South Africa with the coupleaposs children and they posted images of themselves enjoying time as a family on social media. But despite the pictures, French media questioned their relationship, with respected Madame Figaro magazine asking: How long will Albert II of Monaco go on bearing this affront, which is becoming ridiculous Later, both Charlene and Albert vehemently denied the rumours about their marriage, with Albert telling PEOPLE in September: She didnapost leave Monaco in a huff! She didnapost leave because she was mad at me or at anybody . She was going down to South Africa to reassess her Foundationaposs work down there and to take a little time off with her brother and some friends.It was only supposed to be a week-long, -day maximum stay, and [she is still there now] because she had this infection all these medical complications arose. She didnapost go into exile. It was absolutely just a medical problem which had to be treated. While Charlene told a South African TV news channel: Albert is my rock and strength and without his love and support I would not have been able to get through this painful time.  Albert and Charlene met in  - the same year Charlene represented South Africa in the Sydney Olympics in swimming. They married in July  but there were reports before they tied the knot that she tried to leave Monaco andto South Africa. The Palace dismissed the claims as ugly rumours.The couple also spent their first days of the marriage apart with the pair staying in separate hotels in the South African city of Durban - due to Albert attending a meeting of the International Olympic Committee.The palace later said they made up for their time apart on a secret honeymoon - thought to have been in Mozambique. Three years later Charlene gave birth to twins Prince Jacques and Princess Gabriella. In the past, she has spoken about missing her native South Africa.She told Eyewitness News : I am African and this is my heritage. It will always be. It’s in my heart and in my veins.I have the privilege of having this le, but I miss my family and my friends in South Africa and Iaposm often sad because I cannot always be there for them.

Thomas refused to accept as true what they told him, insisting that unless he saw him with his own eyes and touched him with his own hands, he would not believe Jesus was alive.For him, seeing was believing.Later, Jesus once again appeared to the apostles and, this time, Thomas was present. Now Thomas believed. Jesus rebuked him for his unbelief and said: ‘Blessed are those who have not seen yet believe.’We believe lots of things, not because we can see them for ourselves but by accepting the word of those who have.Christians believe in Jesus, not because we have seen him with our own eyes, but because of the reliable word of the apostles who physically saw the risen Jesus with their own eyes.I

Lost in Translation, which was followed by a Japanese whisky-tasting session led by Mark and Kate Watt of Watt Whisky.Tomorrowmorning, children aged between eight and  can get a taste of monster model-making courtesy of Jim Parkyn, lead modelmaker at Aardman Animations, the studio behind Wallace and Gromit and Shaun the Sheep.Jim will help the youngsters create their own monsters, inspired by the likes of Godzilla, the original kaiju – Japanese monster – on film.The children could see their own creations tearing up the Wee Toon as the models will then be used to create a special monster movie which will be screened the following day, on Hallowe#en itself, alongside Gamera: The Giant Monster.Parents are welcome to sit in on the workshop which will last  minutes and will include a chance to ask questions and hear about the master model-maker#s work.The £ workshop ticket includes entry to Gamera: The Giant Monster but spaces are limited and those interested are advised to book as soon as possible.On Saturday afternoon, there will be family anime with Studio Ghibli#s multi-award-winning Spirited Away, considered to be one of the greatest animated films.In the evening, for

scrapped.Argyll and Bute Council agreed to continue the Ring and Ride service whilst it takes time to look for an alternative.Councillor Rory Colville, community spokesman for Argyll and Bute Council, said: #We are responding to the concerns of the people who need this service most.#It will continue in its current form for as long as it takes to make an informed decision about changes and we will make people aware of what will be provided in the future.#No timescale was given as to whether this would be before next May#s elections.In last year#s budget, the service was earmarked for the axe at the time, but the council gave assurances alternative arrangements would be put in place.Councillor John Semple said: #I am glad to see that finally some common sense seems to be filtering through – only three weeks ago the administration voted to continue with this cut.#I will continue to look after the interests of the most vulnerable people in this community as the administration#s plans materialise.#Argyll First councillor Donald Kelly was a prime mover in establishing and expanding the service and is totally against the withdrawal.He told the Courier that this is only a stay of execution for this service and assurances are needed that the service will be retained in the long-term.TWENTY-FIVE YEARS AGOThe MP for Argyll and Bute has pressed for additional facts about the ferry service between Campbeltown and Ballycastle.During last Friday#s Scottish Questions in the House of Commons, Mrs Ray Michie pressed the Secretary of State for Scotland, Mr Michael Forsyth, for more information.She said: #I welcome the announcement, at long last, of the ferry service, although I am disappointed Caledonian MacBrayne was not allowed to run it.#She went on to ask: #For how long does Sea Containers have the contract  Is the Secretary of State expecting the service eventually to run all year, so that we can build up not only a good tourist service, but a good import and export trade #Mr Forsyth responded: #It was important for the new route to be established. It was possible to achieve that with a private sector operator taking the risk, which means that CalMac#s available public capital and running costs can be deployed on maintaining other services and introducing new ones.#It must be the right approach to use the state#s nationalised service and the scarce resources available to it as wisely as possible.#That was what lay behind our thinking.#He went on to say that he would write to Mrs Michie regarding the contract.Mrs Michie commented: #It is important we get the full facts about this service so that we can judge whether this really is value for money as the government claims.#FIFTY YEARS AGOEmergency sea rescue services in the Firth of Clyde could have been victims of another hoax on Friday.For the Campbeltown leboat, three naval vessels and a Dakota aircraft spent nearly six hours searching Kilbrannan Sound and its approaches for a boat reported to have been sinking off Campbeltown.The drama began at lunchtime when the Campbeltown leboat mechanic, Mr Alistair Gilchrist, intercepted a wireless message which read: #Mayday Boy Danny sinking  degrees off Campbeltown.#Kildonan Coastguard Station, Troon Leboat Station and Portpatrick Radio also picked up the call the boat#s name, however, was not mentioned in the message received by the other three stations.Then a full-scale search operation swung into operation. Along with the leboat, the warship HMS Eastbourne, Fishery Protection vessel Vigilant and the US Navy ship Victoria began combing the area between the south of Arran and Kintyre.They were joined later in the search by a Dakota aircraft from Prestwick.An RAF patrol vessel stood by at Campbeltown.Campbeltown leboat reported the discovery of a large piece of timber. It was, however, too heavy to lt aboard and it was not thought to be part of possible wreckage.Then, after six hours, the search was called off. The plane and boats had covered an extensive area of sea.Coastguards using mobile equipment searched along the shores of Arran and Kintyre.Nothing was seen.Police in Campbeltown began investigations into the matter shortly after the leboat put to sea their enquiries are continuing.ONE HUNDRED YEARS AGOAuchencorvie United, one of the teams that came into being in the rural area as a result of the formation of sports clubs among agricultural workers, made their first appearance in local competitive football last Saturday afternoon.Drumlemble supplied the opposition and had a comparatively easy victory by four goals to nil.Auchencorvie had several players of some promise but, as a whole, the team was sadly wanting in science and judgement and the lesson of their first experience should impress on them the fact that mere lusty vigour is not sufficient to win on the football field.In the first half, Drumlemble did not press their undoubted superiority unduly, being content with a one-goal lead at the interval. James Munro was the scorer.In the second half they added three more to the total, D Thomson having two and A Kerr one.At the opening concert of the winter session of the Scottish Clans# Association of London Mr Charles Kelly, a well-known Campbeltown vocalist, sang with much success.His pieces were The March of the Cameron Men, The Lea Rigg, I Passed By Your Window and Until.In all these numbers he

homeliness about them which appeals greatly to the newcomer."},{"url":null,"title":"late late show as pupils cruelly lose out","story":"Campbeltown Pupils were left to rue the loss of another late goal last Saturday after an th-minute strike resigned the Kintyre Park side to a narrow defeat away to St Peter#s.Playing at Renfrew FC#s impressive New Western Park, the McFadyens-sponsored Pupils started the match brightly, despite another y injury list which saw several established first-team players ruled out and others unavailable due to work commitments.The Pupils took the lead before the -minute mark when John McCallum, playing at right wing in a --- formation, reacted quickest to Craig Lamont#s long throw-in, which bounced up on the dry synthetic surface, to guide a deft looping header beyond the reach of the St Peter#s keeper.The Kintyre side had efforts from left winger Scott Souden and lone striker Sean Grady go wide of the target – the latter#s promising effort deflected wide of goal – while McCallum was released by Grady and rounded the hosts# keeper only for his cutback to be cleared for a corner, away from the feet of the waiting Souden.At the other end, the Pupils had a new-look combination in defence, with full backs Craig Lamont and Michael McKinlay, and Ross Souden in central defence partnered by -year-old debutant Antonio Akoulli, studying in Scotland and hailing from Thessaloniki, Greece.The four had to be alert to the efforts of St Peter#s wingers Menzies and Lewis on either flank, and did so very well for the opening  minutes until a lapse in concentration saw Scott Lewis – signed from fellow WoSFL side Benburb FC for a transfer fee – ghost along the edge of the box and slot home a fine finish across keeper Alasdair Ferguson with his weaker left foot, into the young keeper’s bottom left-hand corner to make it -.Impressively, the Pupils rebounded from this setback and scored with  minutes played when Liam Renton, playing as an attacking midfielder, latched onto a ball from Scott Souden just inside the hosts# box, and turned his marker sharply before guiding a left-footed shot beyond the keeper#s grasp.All the while, the Pupils# deep-lying midfield pairing – a real contrast of experience levels between skipper Keith Mitchell, and Conner Brown beside him making his club debut – continued to break up play and keep the Feathers Inn-sponsored side moving forward.Despite this, there was a further scare in the visitors# penalty area when St Peter#s hit the bar from a powerful volleyed shot on the stroke of half time, but the Pupils# lead remained intact.Into the second half, though, the Pupils were pegged back in the opening few minutes of proceedings, a clever turn and precise shot beyond the grasp of Ferguson providing a fine equaliser.Admirably from a Pupils point of view, there was no onslaught from the ision#s third-placed team, also boasting a loan signing from Greenock FC, another semi-professional side, in their midfield ranks, and smatterings of semi-pro experience across their starting .However, what followed instead was a gradual build-up of pressure which the Pupils had to work increasingly hard to contain, the home side#s willing forwards continuing to probe for openings in the visitors# defence.The hard-working pair of Matthew Lang and Calum Houston were introduced in attack for the Pupils with  minutes remaining, with fresh legs required as the embattled visitors# energy levels began to wane.But even the dismissal of Lewis for the hosts, hitting out at Renton in reaction to a robust tackle from the latter, which earned the Pupils man a booking, couldn#t deny the Paisley side a late, late winner, a long ball going undefended in the Pupils ranks, and slotted home in the box by a St Peter#s midfielder to give them all three points, and in turn deny the Pupils a probably deserved draw.The Pupils# management team conveyed thanks to the travelling players for their efforts, even in defeat, and will surely take consolation from giving experience to young talent in the side, with four club debuts made in the space of week – after -year-old Andrew Renton#s appearance against Rossvale on cup duty – and within that clutch, a potentially very useful defensive addition.Tomorrow , the Pupils are at home to Glenvale FC, from Paisley, again on league duty, with kick off at pm.For more information, visit @PupilsAFC on Twitter or Campbeltown Football on Facebook."},{"url":null,"title":"leader october 29 2021","story":"More must be done to prevent the continued spate of

It was the lockdown which entrenched this: screens were the way to connect with people, friends, family and even school learning.They became the default activity and I believe itrsquos become an unhealthy addiction for us and as the nights have drawn in, with less opportunity for outside activity and walks in nature, this addiction has the risk of becoming even worse.I know screens are not all bad, they have benefits and advantages too. . . hell knows, I spend so much time on screens myself.I think we can be too hard on ourselves at times and Irsquom aware of that. Irsquod go to say that some screen time is now important for a iety of reasons. I also recognise that in the last two years they have become a leline for many people.But lately I have been trying my best to practise what I preach as a storyteller. I want to find ways to wean my kids, and myself, from screens to find a healthier balance, a more personal connection which lts our mental health rather than sapping it.Itrsquos not been easy. When the kids are asked to come off screens, they often explode with what I call screen rage. Itrsquos aswe are cutting an umbilical cord and removing their le support system, and they must fight and protest to restore it. The drama is predictable and tiring, but the good news is itrsquos usually relatively short-lived. Irsquove discovered that kids are eventually glad when they have been taken off excessive use of screens.The trick is to have something engaging to replace it with, as well as to model it myself. Thatrsquos the thing, itrsquos so easy to be a hypocrite to tell my kids itrsquos the end of screen time, while using my phone or writing on my laptop.ldquoBut you are still on a screen, dad! was the rebuke from my astute eight-year-old daughter recently. And she was right, so the rules have to apply to me and my we too.We are slowly getting there. We have no screens before bedtime now, instead a family storytelling session. The hardest part has been establishing the routine with so much to do. But now the kids look forward to it and help make the living room cosy in preparation.And I feel the benefits too. It helps me close down that ruminator in my head, which constantly reminds me of how much I have to do, emails I need to reply to, deadlines I need to meet. Instead I become focused on the moment, on the fact Irsquom sharing the attention of my loved ones and we are all telling stories.I know this now does sound overly romantic, but the thing is nothing can compare to these moments of connection, such as the magic of listening to my wee boy tell another spontaneous chapter of his tale of the haunted pizzeria, or listening to my girls weave a story rooted in their experiences of the day or a favoured fable from their earlier childhood. And Irsquove discovered my we Kate is a good storyteller when given the opportunity.Maybe it felt awkward at first, that we were doing it because I thought we should be rather than because we all wanted to. But that awkwardness soon gave way to excited expectation and genuine enjoyment of the experience. And the darkness helps, itrsquos a blanket which adds atmosphere and allows us to use fairy lights and candles, so in that sense the cold and dark of this time of year is a huge advantage: itrsquos the season for cosy storytelling.The flicker of screens still shine more regularly than the storytelling candles in our house. But the balance is slowly changing. Hallowersquoen helped, it seemed such a natural time for storytelling. And I think I can say we have now established our storytelling sessions as a regular family tradition. When it happens, it feels like ancient magic has entered our house.I run storytelling sessions with parents and many share the challenges I recognise in my own family.

books on local history and witchcraft, and derives from the report on Spott written by the parish minister for the late th century lsquoOld Statistical Accountrsquo.In his report, the minister John Martin says that the Spott Kirk Session minutes record the referral of Marion Lillie to the civil magistrate in  on a charge of supposed witchcraft and that in  the minutes record: ldquoMany witches burnt at the top of Spott Loan.Mr Martin was, however, wrong.The Spott Kirk Session minutes are exceptionally legible and clear, and they make no reference whatsoever in  to witch burning at Spott Loan or anywhere .Nor is there any mention of Marion Lillie in .However, in , Marion and her son complained to the kirk session that she was being slandered as a witch.A y investigation followed in which it came to light that Marion did indeed have that reputation locally.Since kirk sessions were not qualied to try witchcraft cases, the session passed the matter on to the civil magistrate, as they were required to do.However, there is no evidence of the case being taken any further and the Spott records show that Marion died a natural death in April  and was buried in Spott kirkyard with the usual ceremonial trappings of bell and mortcloth.Unfortunately, many writers on Scottish witchcraft make the mistake of simply repeating what other writers have written, instead of going to the original records to see what was really going on.Poor Marion has thus been slandered in print as an executed witch for over  years, when half an hour spent actually reading the church records of Spott could have revealed the truth.Until recently, a plaque at the Witchesrsquo Stone stated that Marion Lillie was burnt there, but this has now been replaced by one which makes no mention of her.It may well be that the Witchesrsquo Stone marks the execution of a witch, or witches, but the victim was not Marion Lillie, and any such execution was neither in  nor in , which in any case would be

of the graph, while the time is along the bottom of the graph.A red alert means it is likely an aurora will occur, while an amber alert means a possible aurora.Earlier in the day, the site had reported a red alert meaning that an aurora was likely, however this has decreased as the day has gone on.Meanwhile, Met Office space weather expert Krista Hammond also confirmed there was a chance of

Small beer for them, inflation for the rest of us.GR Weir, Ochiltree.* FORMER Prime Minister Sir John Major says that the current Government in Westminster is behaving in a very \"un-Conservative\" way. I disagree. Itrsquos behaving exactly as I would expect of a Tory government: arrogant and sleazy, with a firm belief that laws and regulations are only for the little people.Doug Maughan, Dunblane.HOLYROOD STANDARDS ARE HIGHERAS parliamentarians are only human, all parties have miscreants but it is how they deal with it that matters, and Richard Allisonfails to acknowledge that Holyrood is vastly superior to Westminster in this regard.Scotlandrsquos standards are higher and much more transparent under the LobbyingAct . In the Scottish Parliament paid advocacy as undertaken by Owen Paterson is a criminal offence and would be reported to the Procurator Fiscal.In the case of Derek Mackay, Mr Allison doesnrsquot seem to know that political parties have no control over what iniduals claim and Mr Mackay left the SNP before being expelled, whereas recently the Tory MP Rob Roberts was allowed back into the Conservatives after sexually harassing a member of staff.Apart from the numerous examples of Tory sleaze and cronyism, we have lost count of the number of times Boris Johnson and co have misled Parliament. The UK Government lied to the Queen to prorogue Parliament, was willing to break international law in a ldquolimited and specic way, forced the PMrsquos own standards chief to quit by overruling him and breached Covid lockdown rules while expecting others to follow them.Outnumbered  to one, Scottish MPs have little or no influence at Westminster and the sooner we get out of that cesspit, the better.Mary Thomas, Edinburgh.I DOUBT ANYTHING WILL CHANGEFIRST, can I thank you for publishing two excellent letters on Saturday , from Bob MacDougall and from Richard Allison. I am aware that letters are often referred to as \"excellent\" purely because one agrees with every single thought or statement written in them. Well, yes, in this instance I did, and your first contributor mentioned above finished his letter succinctly and encapsulated todays political situation in the UK: \"The world of politics would surely be a better place without the shilly-shallying Mr Johnson and the isive Nicola Sturgeon.\"As I have often mentioned in your columns, I have the unfortunate situation to stay within the First Ministers constituency ndash a constituency which Ms Sturgeons new bestie, Greta Thunberg, appears to have missed in her tours, and therefore missed the rubbish, the rats, the broken roads and pavements, the tons of litter dropped at random and more.I grew up in Mount Florida, where we had the wonderful local MP Teddy Taylor representing us, and he was what a true MP should be ndash looking after his constituents as best he could. I always remember the story he often told against himself, saying that two of his constituents who lived in Castlemilk were interviewed for a local newspaper, and was asked did they vote Conservative  They laughed and said certainly not, they had always voted Labour, and would continue to vote for the wonderful Teddy Taylor.Sir Teddy, like Sir John Major, would surely dismiss this pathetic apology of a Prime Minister and urge that his toadying party should get rid of him right away. Meanwhile silent SNP ministers sit behind the First Minister every week, and applaud everything she says ndash and thats a lot.I doubt very much that anything will happen soon. After all, we are only the voters, wherever we live.Walter Paul, Glasgow.SNP WILL STRUGGLE IF PM QUITSIF BORIS Johnson resigns because of the Owen Paterson scandal and Rishi Sunak takes over, the nationalists will have lost their greatest asset and will find it dficult to get personal with Mr Sunak.On the other hand, Scottish pro-UK politicians should hang their heads in shameNicola Sturgeon resigns over one of the many scandals swirling around her and they cant lay a glove on Humza Yousaf, John Swinney, Kate Forbes or Angus Robertson, one of whom is her likely successor.It should be like shooting fish in a barrel.Allan Sutherland, Stonehaven.I HAVE FAITH IN SNP POLITICIANSI NOTE that once again Kevin McKenna has chosen to denigrate First Minister Nicola Sturgeon,  members of the Westminster Parliament and  members of the Scottish Parliament, whom he portrays as money-grubbing iniduals who are only interested in their salaries and pension entitlement . He is of course entitled to his opinion, but as a member of the SNP for more than  years along with tens of thousands of others, I have every faith in the SNP members of both parliaments to hold the Tories at Westminster to account for the manner in which they are ruling over Scotland.Given the current sleaze scandals and dark money swirling around No  and Westminster, it is ludicrous to equate Ms Sturgeon and the Scottish Government with the actions of Margaret Thatcher and the Tories in the s.Ms Sturgeon has worked tirelessly over the past  months in dealing with the current Covid pandemic as well as bearing the task of running the country and while no inidual is perfect, she has done this to the best of her ability. This has not been an easy task, bearing in mind  years of Westminster-contrived austerity and the constraints of the devolution settlement.I would ask Mr McKenna: why is it the GMB alone which has been holding Glasgow to ransom at this particular time, when COP is in town, while every other local authority area in Scotland has refuse collectors working normally I write as a past member of two trade unions all my working le and support the refuse collectors in their bid for improved pay and conditions, but there is a whf of cynicism in the way the GMB and the Anas Sarwar have politicised this industrial dispute.Alec Oattes, Ayr.TWO CONTRASTING LEADERSHIP STYLESTHE contrasting leadership styles of the First Minister and the Prime Minister have again been strikingly apparent around COP.During the pandemic the FMrsquos daily public briefings were commonly regarded as a model of good communication and her willingness to take questions from journalists and others an example of how to handle sometimes-dficult scientic detail and to admit its limitations where appropriate.The failure of the public to engage fully with the day-to-day affairs of COP has been partly due to the absence of a clear morning briefing of the programme and its hoped-for outcomes and a further briefing at the end of the day of what has actually been achieved. This surely is part of the role of the chair of the conference.In other walks of le outside politics the FMrsquos acknowledged communication skills would have been utilised to raise the profile and public understanding of the conference to the benefit of the country and wider world.Jim Aitchison, Milngavie.SCOTTISH IS NOW TOXICLAST weekend I attended a superb concert by the Ayrshire Fiddle Orchestra and Dalmellington Brass Band. Catch themyou can. My enjoyment was momentarily lessened by the first bars of a Scottish piece, not because it was not excellent, but with everything \"Scottish\" now appropriated by the separatists, I realised I have become to dislike my own heritage because of the now-toxic association. So it is \"hands off our heritage\", Nicola Sturgeon, and come up with an economic argument,you can. But you cant.John Dunlop, Ayr.CANT WE HAVE HUMANITY IN POLITICS I READ with disbelief the reported tweet from Kirsty Blackman relating to the tragic death of Owen Patersonrsquos we .

Fingers crossed nothing develops later in the day.ldquoGeorge came off having felt a rib in a scrum, which can be uncomfortable, a pretty sharp pain, he added. ldquoBut therersquos been a huge turnaround with him this morning and hersquos bouncing about as normal. George is a resilient character and its good news. Wersquore pretty sure hersquos going to turn it around quicker than we thought yesterday.There is an obvious temptation to reward the players who got the job done against the worldrsquos third ranked team, in the cut-throat world of professional rugby,nobodyrsquos place in the teamis guaranteed.ldquoWersquove got to pick the right team to complement the challenges wersquoll face against South Africa, stated Dalziel. ldquoThey are very dferent to Australia who have that attack focus and want to play a lot of rugby, whereas with the South Africans it is a physical battle. Straight up and down. They are coming straight through the front door at us.ldquoSo, tactically, and selection-wise, wersquoll look at that.A lot of guys who were maybe quieter in that Tonga game [two weekends ago] have now put their hand up and performed.But when you look around the squad there may be guys who werenrsquot involved at the weekend who might be suited to this challenge, so no doubt there could be and probably will be a few changes around that.ldquoThe squad is growing all the time, and wersquore blessed as coaches to have the group wersquove got now through the good work which is going on at the pro teams and through the age grades, he added.ldquoWersquore able to keep building on that and young players are bouncing off each other.

It is understood that at least one class within every year group except P is affected by the spread.The two authorities confirmed, this Thursday evening, that any decision to shut the school would be a collective one — but it has not yet reached that point. The only caveat to this is in the eventuality that staff numbers are so depleted, the council has no option but to close Papdale, or reduce teaching hours.As of early this afternoon, only two members of staff have been confirmed to have the virus.In a statement this evening, OIC#s executive director of education, leisure and housing, James Wylie, said: “The school remains open, and the situation is being managed and monitored with the advice and guidance of NHS Orkney Public Health.“Our aim is to keep the school open as long as possible to provide learning for those pupils who are well. We are working on a daily basis with Public Health evaluating the numbers and should it reach a point whereby it is felt necessary for a partial or full closure, then that decision will be made collectively.“However,staffing falls to a point whereby it is no longer possible to safely manage the pupil numbers in school — as happened in Stronsay Junior High School recently – then we, as the council, can take the decision to close or offer a rolling programme of reduced hours across the school.“I, again, thank everyone for continuing to answer our plea for children who are well and not displaying any COVID symptoms to still attend at school as this is vital for their education and social wellbeing.”The authorities have confirmed that a further ten PCR tests have also been requested in connection with Papdale Primary at this time, and contact tracing is ongoing. Parents with children attending the school have been urged to undertake twice-weekly lateral flow testing on both themselves and their little ones.Of the  pupils at the school,  pupils were absent on Thursday from the school — a drop from  on Wednesday. According to OIC, the reason many of these pupils remained at home was due to the COVID- situation —  whether for the purpose self-isolating, or because they are symptomatic and awaiting a PCR test. A small number of parents have also chosen not to send their child children to school.Warn and inform letters have now been sent to the parents and carers of children in all affected classes within P, P, P, P, P and P, in line with Scottish Government and Public Health guidance.In addition, Papdale#s head teacher, Wendy Bowen, has written to all parents to reassure that all necessary mitigating steps are being taken.Across Orkney, a total of  new positive cases have been reported in today#s daily figures.According to NHS Orkney, these cases are a mixture of household contacts, travel and working environment contacts amongst others.

A further four members of staff are awaiting the results of a PCR test.It was announced yesterday evening that the school would be partially closed today, due to a lack of staff. Today,  pupils who were able to attend school did so, while  were provided online learning from home. A further  pupils were absent from school for a iety of reasons. Some remained at home due to developing COVID, or for self-isolation purposes, while others were kept home by parents due to concerns over the current situation.Orkney Islands Council has confirmed this evening that four classes will not be ing to school until at least Thursday. These are PM, PE and PE and PM.Papdale Nursery is also closed in full until the same date due to all staff having been contact traced.Authorities have said that the situation is being kept under constant review by NHS Orkney Public Health and OIC and daily updates are being provided to parents, staff and the wider community via the head teachers and communications on the council website and social media, and local media outlets.Online learning to those pupils having to remain at home is being provided by the school.OIC executive director of education, leisure and housing, James Wylie, said: “The situation at Papdale is changing at pace and I must commend the Head Teacher and her staff for doing all they can to ensure learning continues for pupils whether that is in class or remotely during these extenuating circumstances. My same thanks must go to the Nursery manager and colleagues for also going the extra mile to work through the challenges.“Orkney has been very lucky up to this stage with comparatively low numbers of COVID-, however we are all now facing a very dferent picture – the waves which have hit other areas are now on our shores. I must also praise parents who have, on the whole, been very supportive of the staff at Papdale and recognise the tremendous efforts they have been putting in to try and follow the Public Health guidance and ensure the most appropriate and safe plans are in place.“As already said, we continue to meet with Public Health, Environmental Health, Safety and Resilience and Education staff to evaluate the present situation to influence the next steps. As a result of staffing issues due to COVID we have no alternative but to keep the P classes closed for Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday. We will update all parents as soon as possiblethis position changes and further closures are required.“We do understand that there are dfering opinions on this some parents are anxious about sending their child to school where there have been positive cases and there are others who feel that given the enhanced mitigating measures in place, that routines and learning should continue whenever possible.  What we must do as educators is look to the advice and guidance of Public Health and collectively, in a multi-agency way, find the balance.“I joined an Environmental Health colleague from the Council, along with the Head Teacher,  this morningon a walk through the school to evaluate the mitigations in place. For all those that may be concerned Environmental Health are confident that appropriate measures are being taken.“There is no doubt that the virus is not going to disappear in the near future so we must adapt as best we can. Our children deserve an education and that is what we will strive to provide. Please continue to follow the guidance which is outlined by our colleagues at NHS Orkney.”NHS Orkney say around one in three people with COVID- don’t show any symptoms.The health authority has emphasised that it’s more important than ever to take your two free COVID lateral flow tests every week and record your results, evenyou are fully vaccinated and don#t have symptoms.Lateral flow test kits can be collected from community pharmacies and local test sites or ordered online at nhsinform.scot testing.  You can access the direct link to order LFD tests here: https:www.gov.uk order-coronavirus-rapid-lateral-flow.Recording both positive and negative results allows the NHS to track the presence of the virus in our communities.Find out more at nhsinform.scot testingIf you, or anyone in your household is displaying symptoms of COVID, which include a continuous cough, temperature and loss in taste or smell, or you have a positive Lateral Flow testyou MUST self-isolate immediately and book a PCR test by calling  .copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

I sense every step of that journey.In , Borrodale school closed for that last time. And yet,we listen, we can still hear from Borrodale, forever young and in timeless cèilidh.Put in this kind of context we can sense how community relationships are deeply connected to change. The continuity of change, both backwards and forwards, gives us insight, and proximity with dferent and creative ways of being in place.Times change and culture continues. It is important to be hopeful in this and to not perceive the shadows of the past as a fading le force but as an index pointing to future relationships.The second social experience is of course relates to the typical excitement of guising at Oidhche Shamhna. Originally, Oidhche Shamhna was integral toour sense of place and the cultural relationships of le cycles, including time itself.Oidhche Shamhna is ‘the night of summer’s end,’ and in our older understanding of the festival, it reveals that new le begins in darkness and is born into light similarly, just as days used to begin and end at dusk, the move to the darker half of the year is also the continuation of a cycle and is equally about new beginnings.In the deeper memory of Gaelic cosmology, this is the beginning of the new year, and of course, November is still called ‘an t-Samhain’ in Gàidhlig.My earliest memories of guising would be like those of many, our dad taking my sister and I for a few easy visits to long-standing neighbours and family friends. Even though we would only go to a few houses in those early days, the intensity and excitement of the initiation on a cold dark night was largely experienced through the warmth and kindness revealed in the relationships that emerged in the evening.Guising, then, is a form of cèilidh, where the encouraging and nurturing of the gt of exchange is more intangible than we always appreciate. It is that dimension of sustaining or developing relationships that seems most important to me.One of the first homes we would have visited on my first Oidhche Shamhna will have been that of Angus and Effie Ross in Fàsach. In my early years it was a home that we probably had more time in than any house outside of my family.It was a home I visited everyday day walking home from Borrodale school. My errand was to collect our newspapers from the post office, but it wasn’t a job, it was a relationship.Our family had a strong connection with these Rosses. In , Angus Ross’ great-uncle Alexander Ross had been nominated to deliver the prepared statement for the Fàsach croftersto the Napier Commission.In it he testied specically to the clearance of my great-great-grandfather from Ramasaig , who was removed along with all the families from Ramasaig around -, to make way for sheep, congesting further the land in Fàsach. So, it is from at least that time that our family had been friends.Alexander Ross’s brother, Kenneth Ross, also Fàsach, had among his eight children a first son called Neil and a second called Norman, both being young boys during the land wars....I did know Margaret but I never did met James Ross as he had a fatal accident in the early s in Glasgow, outside the BBC.Angus Ross and Seanair worked together on the County lorry . We saw Angus and Effie a lot and my mum credits him with telling her and her siblings about their Cameron origin story in Glendale.A mysterious tale of a man with long grey hair and a beard living in a cave at Scornandaoine on the east side of Loch Poolteil. He had arrived from Lochaber, in the mid to later s, likely a refugee from any number of social problems in the Gàidhealtachd of that time.Even now it still sounds like a good Halloween story. Certainly, my mum has never been a fan of beards in the family, but we were always welcomed by the Rosses in the ceilidh ethic of everyday relationships., Tobraichean a’ Gluasad .Here, ‘Tuam’ talks about his knowledge of local wells the necessity to move between dferent wells for sustenance, and so there will be times when a well in one place becomes dry while water would be plentul in another well.A resource such as Tobar an Dualchais helps us think about our many and ied relationships with culture, place, and time.Part of the intangible gt to be found within the archives, and also with the people and places around us, is how the wells of culture will be found popping up with all their potential, anywhere and everywhere, carried through the voices and relationships we nurture and come to know.Importantly, this can activate new dialogues, experiences, and gestures of cèilidh, and to embrace these for all in our communities, our futures, wherever the wells emerge."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/20211103_133201-scaled.jpg","title":"climate action group to hold skye bridge march and vigil in","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine, which formed shortly before the pandemic, is inviting people to show their solidarity with activists across the world in highlighting the need for urgent change to tackle the existential threat of climate change.Speaking to the Free Press during the first week of the COP UN Climate Change Conference in Glasgow, Skye Climate Action coordinator Anne MacLennan described the summit as “critically important” and was keen to emphasise that Saturday’s event should take place in a peaceful and respectable manner.#Saturday is the Global Day of Action for Climate Justice, and the themes are that we need to act, and act urgently, and there is also the huge justice issue,# she said.“The idea for the march is for us to leave the Kyleakin-end at  noon and to walk over the bridge by the pavements and walk back again.#It is really important that the event is peaceful, family-friendly, and respectful of everyone # I think it is a demonstration of the kind of society we want to head towards being, so we can live in a sustainable and equitable way.

But as a writer, he seemed to have been almost entirely forgotten – at least until recently. Thankfully his literary reputation is now being restored, with a reissue of his novel F For Ferg, a collection of his short stories in preparation, and a biography soon to be devoted to him.During the s and s, Ian produced an impressive run of six highly original and widely acclaimed novels. Despite moving to London as a teenager, his books drew almost exclusively on the language and characters of his childhood in Dromona and Cullybackey, a territory he explored in his fiction with fresh insight and irrepressible humour. Ian was born on November ,  at Moylarg, the middle child of five. The family lived in a terrace of three small houses, known as the Carry Row due to its proximity to the weir on the River Maine adjacent to Dromona Works. He was taught at Tullygrawley National School by R.L. Russell, an unusually progressive master who encouraged his pupils to express themselves through art, poetry and prose. Ian appeared to take little interest in school, and left as soon as he could at the age of , but his teacher’s ideas clearly took root at some deeper level. Russell encouraged his pupils, above all, to closely observe and describe their local surroundings, and this is exactly what Ian went on to do in his writing.On leaving school, Ian entered the local linen plant, Fraser and Haughton’s at Hillmount, enduring  hour shts in the bleaching department. Never particularly suited to paid employment – as he would have been the first to admit – he lasted less than a year at the mill, before taking up a series of equally short-lived occupations, working on a sheep farm, as a stable-boy looking after race horses for local trainer Hugh Dunlop, and as a petrol-pump attendant at what was then Watt’s garage in Cullybackey.Ian’s adolescent years were also a time of changes and challenges. In the mid-s, the family moved from their little cottage at Moylarg to a brand new four-bedroom property in the recently constructed Ard-na-Maine estate in Cullybackey. At their old house, the Cochranes had kept chickens, grown their own vegetables, and drawn water from the well. By comparison, this new development of  houses felt almost like a city, and the resulting sense of upheaval and dislocation is something Ian explores in many of his novels and stories.It was at this time, too, that he began to observe a deterioration in his eyesight. While working at Watt’s garage, he noticed he was unable to read the petrol-pump dial, or to tell the time on the clock of Buick Memorial school as he walked home along Main Street. His vision worsened to such an extent that experimental surgery was carried out in Belfast, which not only proved futile but caused further, irreparable damage. It was only much later in le that Ian’s condition was identied as Leber Hereditary Optic Neuropathy, a rare genetic disorder also subsequently suffered by his brother Drew, nowadays well-known locally as a champion blind golfer.Ian had by this time developed a real passion for reading, devouring books at the home of his friend Dermot McTrusty, whose father had an impressive library – “I thought I was in heaven,” Ian later recalled. He now set about learning Braille, fearing the onset of total blindness, although the illness would thankfully never quite develop to that stage. After attending a training centre for the partially sighted in Torquay, Ian took the bold decision to move to London to follow a course in piano tuning. He set off in , at the age of , and would live there for the rest of his le. By Ian’s own account, as the ferry left Belfast he threw his white stick overboard into the Irish Sea, symbolising his intention to defy disability and live le to the full in the capital. During the s in London, just as he had done as a teenager in Cullybackey, Ian flitted from job to job at a dizzying pace, working as a lt attendant, addiction counsellor, domestic cleaner, telephone sales agentand switchboard operator. After several years of ‘scribbling’ for his own amusement, he finally began to take night classes in creative writing in the late s at Morley College in Lambeth, where his striking narrative style and authentic voice were quickly recognised by his tutors, and his first published story, The Hawk, was printed in the college magazine in . Further stories soon appeared in two highly prestigious anthologies of new writing, Faber’s Introduction and Penguin’s Modern Stories  .The s and early ’s were Ian Cochrane’s heyday. His first two novels, A Streak of Madnessand Gone in the Head , both set in a thinly disguised Cullybackey, won him great praise – his work was proclaimed as “the creation of an extraordinarily gted artist” by The Listener – and he was now able to devote himself full-time to his true vocation. His third novel, Jesus on a Sticktook his boundary-pushing dark humour to new levels Ladybird in a Loony-binexplored mental illness with heightened experimentation and ambition, and F for Fergdepicted the passions and frustrations of village le with a new-found clarity and precision of style. His final novel, The Slipstreamis an entertaining, deliberately aimless tale of unemployed chancers adrt in West London bedsit land.Ian’s novels are all told by a young first-person narrator, in a vernacular voice which deliberately tightens the focus of the action and lends his fiction its peculiar intensity. His originality hinges on a winning blend of the sublime and the ridiculous -rightly described him as “a serious comic novelistever there was one.” He undoubtedly expanded the Ulster ‘literary imagination’, breaking away from the more formal approach of predecessors such as Forrest Reid or Sam Hannah Bell and introducing a more earthy and irreverent tone. His conversational style is rooted quite naturally in the excitable talk and bawdy banter of his native place, but his real achievement was to channel this rich resource so successfully into a literary format. In his later years, Ian continued to write on a near-daily basis, but was unable to find a publisher for the work he produced during this period. Changes in British publishing from the s onwards, when the industry became more profit focused and less editorially driven, made it increasingly dficult to find a place for less obviously commercial fiction, just as his own work, ironically, became more personal, dense and challenging. Yet he remained very much a writer by profession, for whom the practice had a vital therapeutic activity, and he described himself as happiest when hard at work at the old wooden desk in his top-floor flat, warmed by the gas fire, rain beating against the window, blissfully engrossed in his fictional world.Often overlooked and underappreciated during his letime, Ian has recently been afforded some much deserved attention and reassessment. Turnpike Books in London reissued his novel F For Ferg in , followed by a  discussion of his fiction at the Seamus Heaney HomePlace in Bellaghy. A collection of his unpublished short stories is currently in preparation, as is my own book on his le and work. A biography of this kind is long overdue: from his isolated rural upbringing to the world of literary London, undaunted by blindness or by his lack of formal education, Ian’s journey is certainly a fascinating and inspiring one.And a new generation of authors has also begun to find inspiration and influence in his writing. Ballymena-born novelist Jan Carson, at the forefront of a new wave of Northern Irish writers, has spoken of how Ian’s books helped her to find her own fictional voice, rooted in her native environment. “What I loved about Ian Cochrane’s work,” she explains, “was the playfulness, and the idea that my local culture was just as ripe and ready for the fantastical, the absurd, the strange, the grotesque.”And as his great friend and fellow County Antrim novelist Maurice Leitch says, “I’m delighted Ian is now getting some of the critical acclaim he truly deserves. It’s just a pity he isn’t with us to bask in all the posthumous accolades, he’d be thoroughly revelling in it!”Anyone who has memories of Ian Cochrane is asked to get in touch with the author, Philip Taylor. Any details, however small, will be useful in building the bigger picture of Ian’s unique le and personality.

That’s our role and it’s a huge regret we have to withdraw services. We don’t want to be in this situation. We will have a meeting every lunchtime with drivers and every morning with the PSNI and community groups, and we’ll make a decision every day to try our best to start reinstating these services.“Drivers are saying to us as well they want to be back... they don’t want to be suspending services.

It is a crisis and challenge shared by all on this island it will require collaboration, research and innovation across all sectors of public, private and civil society. We are stronger working on this together.“The solution-based research of the All-Island Climate and Bioersity Research Network has never been more critical and I have every confidence in the important work it will undertake.”Switching to a green economy based on biological resources rather than fossil fuels and a circular economy which uses resources efficiently, regenerates value from wastes, and invests in nature will provide signicant employment and business opportunities as the world moves rapidly towards carbon neutrality.Read MorePupils from across NI debate climate crisis at StormontAmong the experts involved in the project, Professor Derek Jackson, a coastal geoscientist at Ulster University’s School of Geography and Environmental Sciences and specialist on climate change impacts on coasts, said there has never been a more critical time to pool resources to tackle what is a common problem faced across the country.“There has never been a more important time to pool our expertise and resources to tackle a common problem,” he said.Our shared environment is facing unprecedented pressures and the only realistic way of addressing the resulting impacts is to assess issues through joint approaches and mitigation.This network is a sensible conduit through which we can achieve this.”Professor Jenner McKinley, Director of the Centre for GIS and Geomatics in the School of Natural and Built Environment at Queen’s University, added: “Delivering excellence in research and training that brings substantial environmental, societal and economic benefits is at the centre of our ambitious interdisciplinary Network to deliver whole-system solutions.We bring together environmental research with the physical and social sciences, with experts from across the UK, Ireland and beyond.“Together we will co-create, co-deliver and apply, real-world holistic integrated and systemic solutions that achieve results.”Related topicsCOPUniversity of UlsterQueen’s UniversityMore On COPNorth-south project to bring together top academics from across Ireland for first time to tackle climate issuesPupils from across NI debate climate crisis at StormontActivists gather in Belfast for climate change rally PremiumIvan LittleOpinionClimate is still frosty between Sinn Fein  DUP PremiumAndrew MaddenOpinionThe weekly political spin: From a plague of pigeons to Sammy Wilson the ‘environmentalist’Most ReadDavid Tweed’s daughters reveal the ‘monster’ he really was after years of sexual abuse at hands of late rugby star fatherPUP leader Billy Hutchinson says unionists ‘can no longer back Good Friday Agreement’UUP’s Doug Beattie demands apology from EU for ‘prepared for war’ commentTranslink suspendsservices in Belfast following violenceBelfast bus drivers to withdraw services from pm Monday‘safety assurances’ cannot be metTop VideosPlayReformed former prisoner Rosie Bradley creates artwork for north Belfast cross-community boxing clubPlayExplainer: What is the Northern Ireland Protocol PlayVideo: Bus hijacked and burnt in RathcooleLatest Northern IrelandViewpointOpinionCity of Music status is richly deservedFive police officers injured after car driven at constableBelfastbus service suspension continues as Translink chief calls for political leadershipEvening bus service suspensions continue in Belfast after two hijackingsShot fired at door of family home in east BelfastLatestWhistleblower warns of potential impact of Facebook’s metaverse projectMum of -year-old killed by dog pays tribute to ‘beautul’ and ‘sweet’ boyNZ ‘look back fondly’ on  World Cup final but now focused on next challengeViewpointOpinionCity of Music status is richly deservedMore than , extra deaths at home in England and Wales since pandemic began,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

It could be nothing but get yourself checked out. “I went to the GP who took bloods and suggested I do a FIT test. The results of the FIT test showed that something wasn’t right and within two weeks I was referred to the Endoscopy unit to have a colonoscopy. “This test showed up something in the bowel.

She co-founded successful online learning company Learning Pool in Derry in . Today, she works extensively with start-ups and scaling tech companies. She is one of the co-founders of cross-border social enterprise and female founder community AwakenHub and she is part of the EU’s flagship EIC Accelerator innovation team. googletag.cmd.push -------------------------------------------- A few weeks ago Digital DNA’s Simon Bailie asked me to write a short piece about Derry for DDNA’s Top Tech Companies in NIreport. Simon asked me to cover the Derry tech scene – how it’s altered in the almost  years I’ve been working in the city and perhaps more importantly, what the missing ingredients are that would make the Maiden City’s tech scene really sing. I enjoyed writing it and was surprised to find that no-one  has written about this. Here’s what I had to say in full. How much has the Derry tech scene changed  I began working in Derry in . I moved from Belfast where I’d been global CFO in one of QUB’s semiconductor IP spinouts.I’d spent a good bit of my time in the early noughties in Silicon Valley and Derry in  couldn’t have been further from San Jose. The only similarity was that the streets were completely deserted by .pm. When I told my friends in Belfast that I was taking a job in Derry they all tried to talk me out of it. I remember trying to recruit a team in  and talent was very thin on the ground. Most of the local workforce were lers in one of the FDIs or they commuted to tech jobs in either Belfast or Letterkenny. The local tech scene back then was dominated by the prominent FDIs Seagate  Allstate , big fish Singularityand a never-ending raft of call centres and it was populated by revered avuncular middle-aged men like Bro McFerran and Dr Alan McClure. Anyone calling the HP or Expedia customer help lines back in the day would’ve been greeted by a Derry accent, way before it was trendy. We started Learning Pool in London in  and quickly moved the company to Derry because it was bootstrap-affordable and because of the ready talent graduating from Magee. We couldn’t afford to hire an experienced team so we recruited new graduates with the right attitude and trained them. We didn’t have an office so we took a few desks in theshockingly haphazard co-working space at the university. Even though the space was supposed to be reserved for new startups, a few companies had been renting in there forever so we ended up with desks dotted here and there in random parts of the floor. No-one in our team could sit together and the co-working space manager constantly shushed us whenever we took phone calls and harped on forever about the washing-up. We had a desktop PC in the corner with a paper notice sellotaped to the top of it which read DO NOT SWITCH OFF  Today there’s a stable of promising scaling tech companies choosing to base themselves in Derry. Established companies likeElemental Software  Newer entrants like medtech company Respiratory Analytics, cyber security companyITUSand caretech challenger startupInCharge. Many companies keep one foot in Derry and the other in Donegal, thus preserving their EU status for access to customers and funding. Catalyst Incopened its doors in  on the historic Fort George site just outside the city and has been a great formal addition to the fabric of the local ecosystem. Other active startup supports likeStartacusand new island of Ireland female founder community AwakenHubare anchored in Derry. Today, the local tech scene is younger, more female, less formal, more global, well educated and informed and definitely ambitious. A lot of newer founders have lived away from Ireland for a while but are electing tohome and settle down, build a business. Catalyst’s Co-Founders programme has uncovered some interesting nascent companies. Some of those new graduates that I recruited back in  or  have gone on to found their own startups. That’s how ecosystems work. The FDIs are still present but they’re less dominant today. They don’t have a lot of employee churn and just tick along in the background, largely behind closed doors. They bring employment to an area of Northern Ireland that badly needs it and they sponsor the odd event and programme. Many of the call centres seem to have been bought over and have disappeared. Innovation and all the interesting stuff happens in the smaller, agile companies around the edges and this is what we need more of. As well as the FDIs we now have the presence of indigenous scaleups like Kainosand FinTru. It would be great to see a few more like these moving in but high quality office space is an issue. Maybe not so important in the future we’re facing post-COVID. The traditional talent pool has extended from the Bann well into Donegal and in Derry I’ve worked beside people who’ve commuted daily from as far afield as Ballycastle and Creeslough. Missing Ingredients If it was Christmas morning and I could have three wishes to improve the tech sector ecosystem in the North West this is what I would wish for: - An ambitious cross-border university named after the late John Hume with campuses in both Derry and Donegaland strong links into the powerful North West diaspora that stretches from Philadelphia to London to Singapore. I’m always impressed by the vibrant startup scene that exists in Letterkenny as a result of the numerous overseas students and researchers who come to LYIT for academic reasons and end up staying. This new university to be fastened at the hip to a well funded and well resourced startup, student and alumni accelerator regime like Oxford University has withOxford Foundrywhich in turn connects firmly into sources of venture finance, a bit likeEDEMin the marina in Valencia - A Derry-Letterkenny- Sligo-Galway Economic Corridor along the Wild Atlantic Way to mirror the Belfast-Dublin corridor that was formally announced in the east of the island last month. This to connect the opportunities that will naturally flow from the new Magee Medical School to the vibrant medtech cluster of companies and investors in Galway and to link in with the newly reinvigorated Western Development Commissionand the string of Atlantic hubs the Irish State has invested in over recent years. I am encouraged by news of a new cross-border scaling hub led by Catalyst Inc  LYIT which will be built in the image of thePortershedGalway model - A focus placed on determining how Derry and indeed all of Northern Ireland can tangibly and quickly benefit from being so close to an EU border in the post-Brexit world. Can Derry compete with Belfast  This was a provocative question posed by Simon in his brief to me. In my view, this is not the right question and shouldn’t be part of anyone’s ambition. Any venture starting out in the new world should instead think about opportunities presented as a result of global changes that the past  months have fast tracked. It’s now genuinely possible to be a global company from Day  and utilise talent from any part of the globe. Barriers no longer exist. Cities and regions need to start thinking this way too. To ask Derry to compete only with Belfast would not be setting a big enough challenge. So, in conclusion,you’re looking for a friendly and affordable university city to start your tech business, where it’s possible to be in both the UK and the EU, an hour from London by air, where   of the population is aged - and is well educated, where government startup funding is readily available, close to some of Europe’s finest beaches, with top class local state schools and a long history and culture … then maybe you should take a look at Derry. And my final call to action, on  April  Jayne Brady started in a brand new post at Belfast City Council as Belfast’s Digital Innovation Commissioner. An engineer and former Venture Capital Partner, in the  months since Jayne started she’s made a massive dference and she represents Belfast at the digital and innovation negotiating tables in both Westminster and Dublin. In truth, although she works for Belfast City Council she does her very best to represent all of Northern Ireland. Isn’t it time we appointed a Digital Innovation Commissioner to do the same and really own this agenda for the NW region of Ireland and its citizens, present and future ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this archived article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log   isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Derry resident, Anthony Murray, wants to thank the NHS after his recent diagnosis and urges others to get checkedDerry News“To hear that GPs are under performing, in my eyes, is nonsense.” overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Monday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Minister Hargey announces pound.m funding boost for DerryDerry Newspound.m funding boost announced for Derry overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  HomeDerry Death Notices - Monday, th November  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at DerrysBar \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at DerrysBar  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  HomeFamilies moved from homes in Derry security alert overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Out and About @ Dormans Magherafelt \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Out and About @ Dormans Magherafelt  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Tuesday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Sunday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Frontline key workers employed with the Apex Housing Association will now received three months full sick pay and three months half pay in any  month periodLocal NewsApex frontline workers win sick pay rights overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. --googletag.cmd.pushMultimedia \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Out and About @ Dormans Magherafelt \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Out and About @ Dormans Magherafelt  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent.

Its clothing perfectly suited to the GAA fan looking for something slightly dferent, without club crests and sponsor logos.Fergal, along with his twin brother Fergal and friend Paul Hughes – Chairman of Derrytresk– is happy with how their brand has progressed. Originally, they had planned to launch for Christmas, but a change saw them get the ball rolling in April, in time for the twins th birthday celebrations.“It gave us something to focus on and one of the jumpers has  on the back, to signy the year we were born,” Fergal told the County Derry Post.There was always an interest in designing and a clothing brand was never far from his thoughts. During his playing days, hed never be far away when new kits were being deigned. A retro jersey released as part of Slaughtneils gear range had his fingerprints on it.“We are from a farming background, it is not the sort of thing youd associate us with...getting into fashion,” Fergal jokes.“But, its always something we have been interested in. I just think a lot of the GAA gear is based on playing members and wanted to do something dferent to appeal to our non-playing members as much as players.“A lot of it will carry club badges and sponsor logos, whereas not everybody wants to wear that kind of product to go to games.”Still playing for the clubs recreational team, he coaches the U footballers and hurlers. There is a pride in pulling into Emmet Park and seeing the Gael Foacutersa range, across dferent ages and colours. Interchangeable caps. Beanies. Shorts. Sweatshirts. T-Shirts. Half-zips. From black to white and green to mango, there is something for everyone. “I am not necessarily going to pull on my club gear, but I still want to pull on something that will associate you with the GAA,” he explains of their brands unique selling point.The name – Gael Foacutersa #WeAllBelong – was spun out of that inkling he had all those years ago.“I always had it in my head, thatI ever did start up a brand, that Gael Force would be the name I would go with,” Fergal explains.“We wanted to keep the Irish slant on it as well. It is very important to the club and community.”And so, Gael Foacutersa – True Gael – was born. After some scribbling with the lettering, the logo eventually came to le by accident. “The plan was to launch it on the lead up to Christmas”, Fergal adds. “Then we thought, the idea is there and well get something out there. Me and Francis, it was our th birthday in April, wed give ourselves a date to work to, to have the product launched.“We are very thankful for the support we have got from everybody. You now notice now the orders coming in, even from other counties, so it definitely seems to be going the right way.”Nestled deep within the brand is the importance of knowing that the game is much more than being part of the squad and taking to the field. It is about identity. A sense of belonging and inclusivity. Being part of a community of like-minded people with a mutual love for traditions and heritage.“So much of our young children and adult lives have become about the constant need to train, to diet, to play, to watch, to support, to belong but ultimately to win,” Gael Foacutersa outline in the story on their website.“Gael Foacutersa is about getting away from these pressures and the responsibilities of the game.We want to take it back to the basics. It’s about the enjoyment of it all and putting smiles on peoples faces.“The Gael Foacutersa range offers high-quality, comfortable and eye-catching men’s and ladies leisurewear. It aims to reinforce the customer’s sense of identity. To be more than just about the game. It’s about being part of something bigger.” googletag.cmd.push For the full range, check out their website: www.gaelforsa.ieADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this archived article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log   isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Derry resident, Anthony Murray, wants to thank the NHS after his recent diagnosis and urges others to get checkedDerry News“To hear that GPs are under performing, in my eyes, is nonsense.” overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Monday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Minister Hargey announces pound.m funding boost for DerryDerry Newspound.m funding boost announced for Derry overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  HomeDerry Death Notices - Monday, th November  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at DerrysBar \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at DerrysBar  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  HomeFamilies moved from homes in Derry security alert overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Out and About @ Dormans Magherafelt \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Out and About @ Dormans Magherafelt  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Tuesday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Sunday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Frontline key workers employed with the Apex Housing Association will now received three months full sick pay and three months half pay in any  month periodLocal NewsApex frontline workers win sick pay rights overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. --googletag.cmd.pushMultimedia \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Out and About @ Dormans Magherafelt \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Out and About @ Dormans Magherafelt  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent.

Cllr Harkin, who represents the Foyleside ward, was speaking after Saturdays Global Day of Action rally in Derry where many turned out to march – in unison with other world cities – to send a message to politicians that too little is being done to halt climate change. googletag.cmd.push Many figures from the Executive parties in Stormont have commented on how environmental changes need to be enforced to curb rising temperatures that could have a disastrous effect on the world with many land area at risk of being submerged by rising sea levels. However, Harkin claims such talk is nothing more than hot air and that politicians need to make good on their words with action. He said: “We commend all those who joined climate action now rallies in Derry and Belfast, across Ireland and across the world yesterday. “It was a powerful global day of action in defiance of the superficial proposals of elites gathered in Glasgow at COP. “All five of the Stormont Executive parties ran to the exclusionary Glasgow conference to join the political establishment in an attempt to showcase their newly found environmental credentials. “As Greta Thunberg said its been more blah blah blah from elites. “Rather than acting as a protector, the Executive has spent the last two decades doing immense damage to our environment. “What the Stormont Executive parties say and do is very dferent. “Just months ago the SDLP Minister for Infrastructure rammed through continued corporate gouging of Lough Neagh over the opposition of environmental campaigners. “The entire Executive allowed the DUP to run riot with the climate destroying going for growth agribusiness strategy for over a decade. “Sinn Feacutein and others said nothing because profits were high and it was good for elites. The same inaction is true for the RHI cash for ash debacle. “The same action gap is clear when it comes expanding rail and public transportation. “The lack of urgency from the DfI Minister means it could be a decade before the Derry rail upgrade happens –at all. And there are constant threats to slash funding for public transportation in order to open it up to privatisation. “The same inaction applies to cleaning up the toxic Mobuoy dump, air quality and toxic mining in the Sperrins. “There are real solutions to address the climate crisis. This requires challenging capitalisms drive for profit no matter what the consequences are for communities and nature. “The political establishment in the Stormont Executive, the Daacuteil and Westminster are not up for this because it means challenging elites, challenging inequality and challenging the status quo. “If Stormont manages to finally pass a Climate Act, the Executive cannot be trusted to ensure even its limited goals will be acted on. “We need a real alternative to the bluff and bluster of the Stormont Executive parties. People power is the key to seeing real action on climate change that can deliver a green transition protecting workers and making sure no one is left behind.” ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this archived article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log   isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Derry resident, Anthony Murray, wants to thank the NHS after his recent diagnosis and urges others to get checkedDerry News“To hear that GPs are under performing, in my eyes, is nonsense.” overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Monday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Minister Hargey announces pound.m funding boost for DerryDerry Newspound.m funding boost announced for Derry overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  HomeDerry Death Notices - Monday, th November  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at DerrysBar \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at DerrysBar  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  HomeFamilies moved from homes in Derry security alert overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Out and About @ Dormans Magherafelt \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Out and About @ Dormans Magherafelt  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Tuesday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Sunday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Frontline key workers employed with the Apex Housing Association will now received three months full sick pay and three months half pay in any  month periodLocal NewsApex frontline workers win sick pay rights overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. --googletag.cmd.pushMultimedia \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Out and About @ Dormans Magherafelt \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Out and About @ Dormans Magherafelt  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent.

Padraig Delargy, Cllr Sandra Duffy and Cllr Emma McGinley are also in attendance.Reporter: Matthew Leslie Nov Email: matthew.leslie@iconicnews.ie  addthis, Foyle Sinn Feacutein MLA Ciara Ferguson has launched a blistering attack on Environment Minister, Edwin Poots, demanding he “end his dithering and delaying and his half hearted approach to tackling the global emergency”. As the COP conference looking at climate change enters its second week in Glasgow, Ms Ferguson said that more should be done by the Executive to show that the North of Ireland is playing its part in halting the rise in climate temperature. googletag.cmd.push She stressed the need for progressive views to come to the fore at Stormont and that Mr Poots, who once served as DUP leader for three weeks, should step up to the plate and push through “ambitious legislation” on climate change. Ms Ferguson said: “It’s important across the globe that we send a strong message to world leaders that there must be immediate and decisive action to deal with our climate emergency. “This is a global crisis that requires a global solution, and everyone has a role to play in halting catastrophic climate change. “The DUP minister responsible for the environment is dithering and delaying on climate action and his approach has been at best half-hearted. That’s unacceptable.  Northern Ireland Executive Minister for Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs, Edwin Poots “Civic society, environmental groups, legal experts have come together along with progressive political parties and politicians to shape and launch our own climate bill. “Hopefully these progressive views will translate into a majority for real action on the floor of the Assembly. “The North needs ambitious legislation and it needs it before the end of this political mandate in April. “We need net zero targets which enable our businesses, agriculture, infrastructure and energy providers to plan for the future in a transformative way for our society and its population that creates opportunities for green economic growth and jobs. “But we can leave no inidual, community or sector behind in our pursuit of a sustainable future for ourselves and those that come behind us. Nor can we cannot expect the least well off or the vulnerable to pay the cost. “The climate crisis must be tackled on the premise – and with the promise of a just transition. “The climate emergency recognises no borders and we must respond with an all Ireland approach to the climate emergency. That is just common sense.”ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this archived article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log   isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Derry resident, Anthony Murray, wants to thank the NHS after his recent diagnosis and urges others to get checkedDerry News“To hear that GPs are under performing, in my eyes, is nonsense.” overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Monday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Minister Hargey announces pound.m funding boost for DerryDerry Newspound.m funding boost announced for Derry overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  HomeDerry Death Notices - Monday, th November  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at DerrysBar \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at DerrysBar  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  HomeFamilies moved from homes in Derry security alert overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Out and About @ Dormans Magherafelt \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Out and About @ Dormans Magherafelt  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Tuesday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Sunday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Frontline key workers employed with the Apex Housing Association will now received three months full sick pay and three months half pay in any  month periodLocal NewsApex frontline workers win sick pay rights overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. --googletag.cmd.pushMultimedia \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Out and About @ Dormans Magherafelt \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Out and About @ Dormans Magherafelt  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent.

The measure means that all essential frontline key workers employed with the Apex Housing Association will now received three months full sick pay and three months half pay in any  month period. googletag.cmd.push This announcement has come as a huge relief and means these local workers and their families have a signicant degree of protection in the event they are unable to attend work due to ill health and reflects the importance of being in a trade union. Along with this new contractual improvement, UNISON trade union representatives working in Apex also successfully negotiated a Covid- recognition payment for all frontline workers. Niall McCarroll of UNISON said: “This recognition agreement between UNISON and Apex Housing Association has only become a reality as a direct result of local workers joining UNISON, becoming active in their workplace and organising towards achieving better working conditions and improved pay and terms and conditions of employment. “Local trade union members mobilising with the support of their union and changing the very ethos and culture across their place of work. “Across Apex Housing Association there are currently  workers in UNISON with workplace reps, health and safety reps and workplace contacts operating across the entire workforce, providing support and expertise when the need arises with the focus being, to leave no worker feeling isolated whilst building up a culture of solidarity, strength through a genuine unity of purpose. “There is much still to achieve within Apex Housing Association but with the growing numbers of workers joining UNISON, it will only be a matter of time before UNISON and Apex deliver on the outstanding issues. I would encourage any local worker employed in the Community and Voluntary Sector to make contact with UNISON Community Branch. “Together we can make positive changes in your workplace and begin the process of you being valued for the work you complete within the community. “Do not let any employer tell you there is no point in being in a trade union.” ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this archived article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log   isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Derry resident, Anthony Murray, wants to thank the NHS after his recent diagnosis and urges others to get checkedDerry News“To hear that GPs are under performing, in my eyes, is nonsense.” overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Monday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Minister Hargey announces pound.m funding boost for DerryDerry Newspound.m funding boost announced for Derry overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  HomeDerry Death Notices - Monday, th November  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at DerrysBar \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at DerrysBar  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  HomeFamilies moved from homes in Derry security alert overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Out and About @ Dormans Magherafelt \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Out and About @ Dormans Magherafelt  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Tuesday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Sunday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Frontline key workers employed with the Apex Housing Association will now received three months full sick pay and three months half pay in any  month periodLocal NewsApex frontline workers win sick pay rights overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. --googletag.cmd.pushMultimedia \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Out and About @ Dormans Magherafelt \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Out and About @ Dormans Magherafelt  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent.

Available exclusively in Attitude Black paintwork, the new Sport Black Edition brings a distinctive sporty look to Toyota’s fth-generation RAV, and is available in front-wheel-driveguise only.  googletag.cmd.push   However, for buyers looking for the added security of an all-wheel-drivedrivetrain in their new RAV, there is the option of AWD in Sol, Sport and Platinum iants, while the entry-level Luna model is FWD only.Petrol Electric PowertrainLike every iant in the RAV range, the Sport Black Edition is powered by a .-litre four-cylinder petrol-electric hybrid powertrain, which produces bhp and Nm of torque and enables the five-seat family SUV to sprint from -km h in just over  seconds. Standard across the entire RAV range is a suite of safety features which offer maximum protection for all occupants, while providing the RAV driver with the latest technology in driver assistance systems.     Collectively called Toyota Safety Sense  , features include Pre-Collision Assistance , Speed Assistance , Lane Keepingand Automatic High Beam Assist.Gracious Exterior, Spacious InteriorThe exterior design of the new RAV is more appealing and less anonymous that its predecessor, and this is gained by way of boxy wheel arches, a squared-off nose with a large grille, and angular edges and creases in the bodywork. I feel that Toyota has done a great job of making the new RAV look and feel more ‘premium’ than ever, while also offering more interior space than any of its predecessors.Cabin quality is exceptional, with sturdy and durable materials used throughout, while overall passenger space is generous in every respect. This has been made possible by placing the front and rear axles mm further apart than before, and even tall adults will be able to sit in the rear seats comfortably, with plenty of legroom and headroom on offer.The RAV’s battery is located under the floor, but its boxy dimensions help to hide it well, with a slightly higher boot floor the only clue to what lies beneath.Compared to its predecessor, the RAV’s boot capacity has grown to -litres , with a massive ,-litres available when the rear seats are folded down.The RAV was awarded a full five stars by Euro NCAP in  and that was thanks in part to an upgrade to the second-generation of Toyota Safety Sense for the latest model.Test CarMy test car was a RAV Sport Black Edition which drew lots of admiring glances due to its terric road presence and distinctive design details.An impressive array of standard equipment includes TEX leather black upholstery with heated front seats, powered driver seat, auto-dimming interior mirror, front and rear parking sensors, rear view camera, auto lights and wipers, LED front light guide with daytime running lights, LED projector headlights, electrically operated boot door, ” Toyota Touch multimedia system, dual zone climate control, rear privacy glass, satellite navigation, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, black headliner cloth, paddle sht, light blue ambient lighting, and illuminated entry along with many more comfort, convenience, safety and infotainment features.As is the case across all models in the RAV line-up, fuel consumption as low as .l km is achievable on a WLTP combined driving cycle, while Co emissions of between  and g kmensures low annual road tax in addition to low overall running costs.Toyota’s advanced hybrid technology ensures that the RAV’s petrol engine and electric motor combine seamlessly to deliver extra performance and outstanding fuel efficiency, while remaining ultra-smooth and extremely quiet when driving in electric mode.Toyota claim that up to % of the time you drive a Toyota Hybrid, you are in electric mode, with the added advantage that you never have to plug the car in to charge the battery.Toyota’s self-charging hybrid harvests the energy normally lost from deceleration and braking into a small battery. This unit doesn’t have enough capacity to propel the RAV alone for any considerable distance, but it does offer the convenience of being able to charge itself without any input from the driver.The RAV sits on Toyota’s New Global Architecture, which is also used in the Toyota Prius, C-HR and Corolla models. It brings big benefits in ride and handling, with more sophisticated suspension than the old model, so the RAV is capable of turning into corners with a surprising amount of poise and precision, with plenty of grip while resisting dramatic levels of body lean.The RAV’s CVTtransmission is smooth and slick in its operation, while a well-insulated cabin ensures that on-road refinement is top class. When travelling through towns and cities at low speed, the RAV’s electric motor is barely audible, with the engine shutting off entirely when stationary in traffic.

Hyundai’s newest offering is an appealing small SUV, which slots into position between the new i and new Kona in terms of its exterior dimensions.Hyundai claim that the Bayon is a ‘small on the outside, big on the inside’ urban crossover SUV that is designed to make a lasting impression. Boasting best-in-class safety and connectivity features, the Bayon comes with lots of smart technology as standard.  googletag.cmd.push   Eye-Catching ProportionsWith its sharp lines and eye-catching proportions, the new Bayon really stands out from the crowd. Sleek and stylish, it elegantly combines Hyundai’s award-winning SUV heritage with a visually stunning interpretation of Hyundai’s new Sensuous Sportiness design language — defined by the harmony between proportion, architecture, styling and technology.The arrow-shaped headlamps and wide grille harmonise with the sleek air intake band and narrow LED daytime running-lights on top, to give the front a purposeful, unique look. A dynamic shoulder line provides visual drama to the Bayon’s sporty wedge-shaped profile while, at the rear, arrow-shaped LED rear lights are connected by a red accent line. Positioned far out to the sides, the rear lights enhance the visual impression of width.     The new Bayon is shorter, narrower and lower than its Kona sibling, but stands a fraction taller than the i supermini upon which it is based. While the Kona is offered with an all-electric version, the new Bayon is powered solely by a .-litre MPIfour-cylinder petrol engine across all iants.The ingenious MPI system injects fuel at each cylinder, allowing much greater control over how much fuel the engine burns, leading to impressive fuel efficiency.Well-Appointed Trim LevelsThe new Bayon is available in a choice of three trim levels, namely Comfort Plus, Executive and Executive with a two-tone roof. Standard features from entry level include a rear spoiler, roof rails, sports-style driver and passenger front seats, driver seat height adjuster, height and reach adjustable leather-wrapped steering wheel, air-conditioning, auto light control , temporary spare wheel, cargo net, multi- steering wheel controls, central door locking, Bluetooth, DAB radio, cruise control, and a tyre pressure monitoring system, along with a host of safety features for peace-of-mind motoring.Upgrade to the Executive trimand additional standard features include ” alloy wheels, chrome belt line finisher, body coloured bumpers, shark-fin ariel, aluminium foot pedals, heated front seats, heated steering wheel, automatic air-conditioning, automatic window defogging , power-folding electric mirrors, rear privacy glass, auto wipers, remote central locking, voice recognition, Android Auto  Apple CarPlay, ” audio display, .” LCD supervision cluster, USB charger, wireless phone charger, rear parking sensors, and a rear view camera with dynamic guidelines, along with additional safety tech.Test CarMy test car was a new Bayon Executive .litre MPI, which was finished in elegant Aurora Gray Pearl paintwork that compliments its strong SUV design.Producing PSand Nm of torque, the Bayon can reach km h in .-seconds, while ing up to .mpgon a WLTP combined driving cycle.A low Co emission figure of g km translates to annual road tax of just €.On the road is where the new Bayon really excels, with a terric mix of comfort, control, poise and precision on offer. Road imperfections are dealt with swtly, while noises and knocks from the suspension are well isolated from the cabin.For a relatively small car, the Bayon’s motorway refinement and stability are impressive, while the car corners keenly on twisty roads. A precise steering response ensures that the Bayon is a delight to drive around town, while the standard rear parking sensors and rear view camera in my test car made parking a doddle too.The family-friendly cabin space in the new Bayon is impressive, with rear legroom deserving particular praise.Interior storage comprises a of a deep glovebox, front and rear door bins that can accommodate a large bottle, and a flat shelf for a smartphone at the bottom of the well-constructed dashboard.Boot capacity of -litres can be transformed into a ,-litre space when the rear seat backs are folded down, while an intelligent trunk cover can be stowed away safely within the boot when not in use.The new Hyundai Bayon is available in a multitude of stylish exterior colours, along with the option of a two-tone roof and matching door mirror housings in Phantom Black to create a car perfectly matched to inidual taste. The new Bayon truly is ready to reach new heights in the competitive small crossover SUV market segment.Hyundai’s comprehensive -year unlimited mileage warranty comes as standard, as does a -year AA Roadside Assistance and Free Vehicle Health Check package.

Based on the A-Class of the time, Mercedes-Benz gave its smallest model some SUV flavour with clever body cladding and a raised ride height.  googletag.cmd.push   More SUV-Like Than EverLaunched in , the second-generation GLA also shares its DNA with the latest A-Class, but it gained a more traditional SUV shape. Standing cm taller than its predecessor, the new GLA’s wheel arches are more squared-off in shape and are clad in protective black plastic. Its wheelbase has also been increased to create more passenger space, while the wheels are pushed out to each corner, resulting in much shorter front and rear overhangs.Pitched directly against rivals like the BMW X and Volvo XC hybrids, the new GLA  e uses the same powertrain as the plug-in A-Class— a .-litre petrol engine and bhp electric motor, drawing power from a .kWh battery. The fuel tank in the GLA  e is located ahead of the car’s front axle, which leaves space under the boot to fit the hybrid battery. Importantly, this means that the GLA avoids the awkward box-shaped intrusion into the boot area seen in some plug-in hybrid cars.     Specication DetailsThe new Mercedes-Benz GLA  e is available in a choice of two generously-equipped specication levels — Progressive and AMG Line — both of which come with standard features such as stylish five-twin-spoke light-alloy wheels, parking sensors with reversing camera, LED high performance headlamps, Light and Sight package, hard-disc navigation, MBUX multimedia system, digital radio, Android Auto, Apple CarPlay, Seat Comfort package with heated front seats, automatic climate control, roof liner in black fabric, Mercedes-Benz emergency call system, galvanised steering-wheel gearsht paddles, Easy-Pack tailgate, Dynamic Select, acoustic ambient protection, Active Lane Keep Assist, and Speed Limit Assist, along with many more comfort, convenience and security features.Additional AMG Line specication includes lowered comfort suspension, AMG body styling, carbon-structure trim, ” AMG -twin-spoke light-alloy wheels, Artico leather Dinamica microfibre black upholstery, and AMG floor mats.Test CarMy GLA  e ‘Progressive’ test car was finished in Night Black paintwith contrasting Macchiato Beige Black Artico leather upholsteryfor maximum impact.With a % battery charge, my test car estimated its own electric range to be km’s. The car defaults to Hybrid mode when started up, so you proceed in zero-emission fashion at speeds of up to km h, as long as the battery has charge and you accelerate gently.When the petrol engine cuts in performance is strong, as it and the electric motor combine their power in a smooth and orderly fashion. With a combined power output of bhp and a mighty Nm of torque, the GLA  e can sprint from -km h in as little as . seconds, and can achieve a top speed of km h .The petrol engine only really makes its presence known when you ask for more performance, while neat handling and sufficient grip from the driven front wheels provides great confidence on the road. The car’s steering is light but direct, and the ride is more than comfortable enough to deal with rutted road surfaces and speed ramps with ease.Cabin space is impressive, with excellent head, leg and elbow room available for all occupants, while a -litre boot capacity will be more than adequate for most families. However, the GLA’s standard split-folding rear seat backs allow for the transportation of larger items when called upon, with up to ,-litres of space on offer in this mode.The cabin of the new GLA certainly feels vastly improved over the original GLA in every respect. This has been made possible by the latest Mercedes-Benz MBUX interior layout, with crisp digital displays replacing the analogue instrument dials and flowing across onto the dashboard.Buttons have been largely replaced by a controller ahead of the gear-lever and voice control, which uses articial intelligence similar to that found in home smart devices to recognise more natural speech and commands. The turbine air vents from the original GLA have been retained, but the dashboard has been slimmed-down for a more spacious feel.VerdictOverall, the new Mercedes-Benz GLA  e is a competent all-rounder that offers a decent electric range, low emissions, predictable handling and a luxurious, technology-filled cabin — encased in a stylish and practical premium compact SUV body.

On Saturday night, Derry once again flocked to enjoy a night of the Undertones – but this time it wasn’t just their music - but their big screen debut that was getting the masses excited. The legendary band and their family, friends, and fans gathered to indulge in a celebration of their musical careers in the premier of a fitting tribute documentary, featuring the man who made it all possible – DJ John Peel. The documentary, produced by local man Vinnie Cunningham and directed by Tom Collins, traces the band right back to their first performances in school halls, when the lads had barely swapped their nappy rash for pimples.  Dr. Sid Dempsey, third from right, Head Consultant, Royal Belfast Hospital for Sick Children with members of the Undertones, Billy Doherty, John and Damien ONeill. Also included are Manus and Majella Martin.  The youngsters from Derry, who supported the Clash on their tour of America, never really appreciated how good they actually were, revealed Damien O’Neill - just one of the frank admissions that litter the documentary. The film is liberally interspersed with old video footage of the band as they bopped from the legendary Casbah to Top of the Pops - and features all the greats from ‘Teenage Kicks’ to ‘My Perfect Cousin’ to ‘It’s Going To Happen’. The fundamental ision between Feargal Sharkey and the rest of the Undertones is very apparent, although John O’Neill maintains that there is no real animosity against the singer who eventually caused the band to split. “The way we see it, he was one of our school friends and we eventually drted apart, the same thing that happens to everyone at some stage,” he said. “We really have no bad feelings towards him.” The banter throughout the showing had the audience in fits of laughter as the boys admitted some of their more embarrassing moments, and some revelations came courtesy of others. Caroline O’Neill certainly dropped husband John in it when she let slip that he had dumped her in the hope that fame and fortune would drive the chicks wild. “He’s going to kill me for saying this,” she said. “But he arrived two days later banging on my door and begging me to take him back.” Not so good-natured abuse The laughs were balanced by some more disturbing highlights of the lestyle that saw the boys also abused and often attacked because of their good fortune. “There were nights when we came out of the Casbah and had to leg it up the street,” admits Damien O’Neill. And Feargal Sharkey spoke of the animosity towards them when they were at home: “It was terrible having to face friends in Derry. You couldn’t buy people a drink or wear fashionable clothes because people thought you were being flash.” The Strand Multiplex was packed full of Derry people who have supported the lads over the last  years, and enjoyed reliving the highs and the lows with them all over again. Paul McCloone who now has the job of filling Feargal’s shoes described the documentary as “brilliant, really enjoyable”. John O’Neill, meanwhile, was about as enthusiastic as John gets: “I think it’s great. The most important thing is that the humour really comes across, and the sense that we were just five ordinary guys that managed to make it big.” The screening was held in aid of the N. Ireland Cancer Unit, and donations on the night, along with the money offered instead of an after show buffet, came to over pound.

Also included are Manus and Majella Martin. uc strong ue uc p ue r n ucp ue u uc p ue r n ucp ueThe youngsters from Derry, who supported the Clash on their tour of America, never really appreciated how good they actually were, revealed Damien O ursquoNeill - just one of the frank admissions that litter the documentary. uc p ue r n ucp ueThe film is liberally interspersed with old video footage of the band as they bopped from the legendary Casbah to Top of the Pops - and features all the greats from  ulsquoTeenage Kicks ursquo to  ulsquoMy Perfect Cousin ursquo to  ulsquoIt ursquos Going To Happen ursquo. uc p ue r n ucp ueThe fundamental ision between Feargal Sharkey and the rest of the Undertones is very apparent, although John O ursquoNeill maintains that there is no real animosity against the singer who eventually caused the band to split. uc p ue r n ucp ue uldquoThe way we see it, he was one of our school friends and we eventually drted apart, the same thing that happens to everyone at some stage, urdquo he said.  uldquoWe really have no bad feelings towards him. urdquo uc p ue r n ucp ueThe banter throughout the showing had the audience in fits of laughter as the boys admitted some of their more embarrassing moments, and some revelations came courtesy of others. uc p ue r n ucp ueCaroline O ursquoNeill certainly dropped husband John in it when she let slip that he had dumped her in the hope that fame and fortune would drive the chicks wild. uc p ue r n ucp ue uldquoHe ursquos going to kill me for saying this, urdquo she said.  uldquoBut he arrived two days later banging on my door and begging me to take him back. urdquo uc p ue r n ucp ue ucstrong ueNot so good-natured abuse uc strong ue uc p ue r n ucp ueThe laughs were balanced by some more disturbing highlights of the lestyle that saw the boys also abused and often attacked because of their good fortune. uc p ue r n ucp ue uldquoThere were nights when we came out of the Casbah and had to leg it up the street, urdquo admits Damien O ursquoNeill. uc p ue r n ucp ueAnd Feargal Sharkey spoke of the animosity towards them when they were at home:  uldquoIt was terrible having to face friends in Derry. You couldn ursquot buy people a drink or wear fashionable clothes because people thought you were being flash. urdquo uc p ue r n ucp ueThe Strand Multiplex was packed full of Derry people who have supported the lads over the last  years, and enjoyed reliving the highs and the lows with them all over again. uc p ue r n ucp uePaul McCloone who now has the job of filling Feargal ursquos shoes described the documentary as  uldquobrilliant, really enjoyable urdquo. uc p ue r n ucp ueJohn O ursquoNeill, meanwhile, was about as enthusiastic as John gets:  uldquoI think it ursquos great.

They also provide underage hurling via St Patricks, an amalgamation with their parish neighbours St Colms Drum.When Derry won the All-Ireland title in , the countys most successful era, Richard Ferris was part of the winning formula and scored a goal in their opening round against Down that season. Joe Irwin won an Ulster medal with the county and Eunan Rafferty was also on Derry teams in that era.The clubs recent underage development work has provided Michael Mullan to Derrys Ulster minor winning team of , with Tiarnaacuten McHugh, Dara and Ruairi Rafferty part of the group who repeated the feat two seasons later on their way to the All-Ireland Final.Current senior captain Tiarnaacuten Woods has represented Derry at minor and U level, with McHugh and Ruairi Rafferty – who have played senior hurling with Kevin Lynchs – having also played the wee ball game for the county.On the camogie field, Una Rafferty and Aoe Kelly have represented Derry at minor and U level respectively. It has all comeas a result of the work being done at the club.“It is great to have Richard Ferris back involved again,” Shane adds. “He has set up a winter programme in place for the players in first to fth year , with the older players getting looked after under the senior  with their strength and conditioning.”The current senior group has benefited from the influx of youth as they have one eye on the Derry IFC Quarter-Finals later this month.McGonigle paid tribute to those who have sat on club committees down through the years and it has been bolstered with new blood coming on board in recent years to help with the clubs progression. Another great development has been an influx in new coaches coming forward at primary school level. Every bit helps. Like many other clubs across Ireland, Drumsurn reaches deeper into the locality. They are more than just GAA. Its a social hub that knits everyone together, regardless of age. It offers an identity.On top of their day to day club activities and s. Fitness classes, male and female, are a valuable facet of the club, while they also host Irish dancing and bowls.The club has also recently formed a mental health committee and have put in place a full winter program to complement this initiative. There are also plans for Irish language classes. There is never a dull moment. The clubs heart beats strong.“We as a club are very community focused,” Shane stresses. “In the past year we have brought the Action Cancer big bus for two days and also provided a defibrillator in a cabinet for our communitys use.”Since moving to their current premises, Billy Doran Park, in , they have added a training pitch and a club gym.The Club Committee set out a three-phase ground development plan in . The first phase of a new kitchen plus internal and external toilet blocks was completed in  with the changing rooms refurbished in .Phase , currently going through planning, includes a walking track, new floodlights and ball-wall. It all leads into Phase , a floodlit G pitch.“Our proposed ground developments are going to cost in excess of pound,,” McGonigle points out. “For a club of less than  members, this is a massive undertaking.”Drumsurn have set themselves a target of having phases two and three complete for their Centenary Year in .“Unfortunately, as with many other aspects of le, Covid has put a stop to conventional fundraising activities for the moment,” Shane outlines. “So we decided to set up Drumsurn GAC Competitions as a way of raising some much needed funds.” For more information and details on how to enter Drumsurns competition, visit www.drumsurngaccompetitions  ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this archived article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log   isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Derry resident, Anthony Murray, wants to thank the NHS after his recent diagnosis and urges others to get checkedDerry News“To hear that GPs are under performing, in my eyes, is nonsense.” overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices -

Reporter: Gary Ferry Nov Email: gary@derrynews.net  addthis, Institute  Dergview  It was another opportunity missed for Institute as they could only draw with Dergview at the Brandywell. It is now seven games without a win for ‘Stute who overcame a half time deficit, but despite some good chances, could not turn the game in their favour. A ‘Stute mistake gave Derview the lead early on. Goalkeeper John Connolly yelled for his defender to leave it as Cathal Farren’s cross came in, but he dropped the ball straight into the path of the league’s top scorer Benny Igiehon, wo simply put the ball into the empty net to make it -. googletag.cmd.push It should have gotten worse for the home side on the half hour when Niall McGinley broke down the left, and he picked out Farren in the middle, but the former Derry City striker scuffed his effort wide of the target with just Connolly to beat. The home side were thrown a leline just before the hour mark when they were awarded a penalty. A cross into the Dergview box found Aaron McGurk, whose touch took the ball away from him. Both McLaughlin and goalkeeper Buchanan went for the loose ball and it looked asthe goalkeeper got there first, but not according to referee Harrigan, who pointed to the spot. Dergview were baffled by the decision, but after their protests, McLaughlin kept his calm to score his first goal in  games and his th for the season overall to make it -. ‘Stute had a great chance to take the lead in the game for the first time on  minutes when McGurk did well to work his way into the area, and although his shot was blocked, the ball fell out of the sky right onto the foot of McLaughlin, who volleyed wide with the whole goal to aim at. Those missed chances almost cost ‘Stute as Dergview began to get on top for the first time in the second half as the game entered the final ten minutes. Jamie Browne had his head in his hands after he dispossessed Jamie Dunne just outside his own area, but the striker was denied at the last second by the ‘Stute man, who made amends by deflecting the shot behind for a corner. From that set-piece, ‘Stute were lucky to survive as the ball bounced around the area, and it took a few brave blocks to keep the ball from reaching Connolly’s goal with Dergview players lining up to put it in.

Reporter: Gary Ferry Nov Email: gary@derrynews.net  addthis, Institute  Dergview  It was another opportunity missed for Institute as they could only draw with Dergview at the Brandywell. It is now seven games without a win for ‘Stute who overcame a half time deficit, but despite some good chances, could not turn the game in their favour. A ‘Stute mistake gave Derview the lead early on. Goalkeeper John Connolly yelled for his defender to leave it as Cathal Farren’s cross came in, but he dropped the ball straight into the path of the league’s top scorer Benny Igiehon, wo simply put the ball into the empty net to make it -. googletag.cmd.push It should have gotten worse for the home side on the half hour when Niall McGinley broke down the left, and he picked out Farren in the middle, but the former Derry City striker scuffed his effort wide of the target with just Connolly to beat. The home side were thrown a leline just before the hour mark when they were awarded a penalty. A cross into the Dergview box found Aaron McGurk, whose touch took the ball away from him. Both McLaughlin and goalkeeper Buchanan went for the loose ball and it looked asthe goalkeeper got there first, but not according to referee Harrigan, who pointed to the spot. Dergview were baffled by the decision, but after their protests, McLaughlin kept his calm to score his first goal in  games and his th for the season overall to make it -. ‘Stute had a great chance to take the lead in the game for the first time on  minutes when McGurk did well to work his way into the area, and although his shot was blocked, the ball fell out of the sky right onto the foot of McLaughlin, who volleyed wide with the whole goal to aim at. Those missed chances almost cost ‘Stute as Dergview began to get on top for the first time in the second half as the game entered the final ten minutes. Jamie Browne had his head in his hands after he dispossessed Jamie Dunne just outside his own area, but the striker was denied at the last second by the ‘Stute man, who made amends by deflecting the shot behind for a corner. From that set-piece, ‘Stute were lucky to survive as the ball bounced around the area, and it took a few brave blocks to keep the ball from reaching Connolly’s goal with Dergview players lining up to put it in.

Pic by Mary K Burke. Reporter: Michael McMullan Nov Email: sport@derrypost  addthis, Relief. That was Hugh McGrath’s take on finally getting over the line as Steelstown won their first Intermediate title at last.He admitted it wasn’t this side’s best showing of the season. Nor were they cohesive. And they didn’t play the brand of football they wanted. But there was only one currency Steelstown were dealing in. Silverware. That’s all Saturday was about.“It just matters that you are ahead at the end of the game,” said McGrath.“I wasn’t nervous in any way,” he told his side before the club’s historic hour. “I was jealous that they got to get the chance to go out and show what they were worth and show what was inside them.”And, coming back from last season’s defeat and in the manner which they did, that – in McGrath’s opinion – is the Steelstown’s calling card.“It tells you all you need to know about the group,” he said.The burden of three final defeats didn’t come into the narrative. It was a new management team, with a sprinkling of new players.At dferent times this year, McGrath beat the drum of a new beginning. Donncha Gilmore is now an All-Ireland winner. Five championships goals later, Morgan Murray has arrived on the scene and like Oran Fox, he benefitted from a league campaign that McGrath treated as gloried friendlies.It wasn’t about hard luck stories or flashbacks from yesteryear.“All we could base any chat around was what we done this year so far,” McGrath again stressed.“We were confident that we’d get ourselves in enough positions to take chances, that we’d create enough chances to get ourselves over the line.“We knew it would be tough, you don’t play the champions and get it easy. We knew it would be tough all the way through and it was about grinding it out.”Points from Jason McAleer and Eoghan Bradleyhad Steelstown three points clear after eight minutes, but the sides were levelat the break.“We weren’t panicking because we knew these things happen,” insisted the Steelstown boss. We went a couple down at the start of the second half. Maybe there was a bit of panic and you are going to feel that pressure when you have a couple of forwards like Greenlough have.”But McGrath trusted their leaders. Skipper Forester. Impact man Mickey McKinney. Midfielder Ryan Devine. All players from the  minor team he coached when he arrived at the club.“You have confidence that you have a group that will drive you on and get you over the line and that’s the way it panned out,” McGrath said.The fact they were still at the coal face of their title bid spoke volumes. McKinney was crying with total elation. “Is this real ”, bellowed Forester amid the pandemonium.“To go so long until now, it shows the type of characters that they are. They hung in there and had the belief in the group that was coming behind them,” McGrath added.“They are emotional. It shows how much the clubs means to them they have a desire to win.”And on the weekend that marked the thanniversary of Brian Oacuteg McKeever’s death. The club now carries his name.For McGrath, the final quarter told the story of the McKeever family.“That’s the way he would’ve played his game. If you look at the way Neildrove out, Eoghan Concannon hammered everything that was near him.“That was Brian Oacuteg McKeever, that’s what he did and there are plenty around here that know that’s what he did.“They were part of him, they saw him do it and the young people coming through are now aware of it too.”“He is never too far from our thoughts and Charleneas well, she played exactly the same way.

Pic by Mary K Burke. Reporter: Michael McMullan Nov Email: sport@derrypost  addthis, Relief. That was Hugh McGrath’s take on finally getting over the line as Steelstown won their first Intermediate title at last.He admitted it wasn’t this side’s best showing of the season. Nor were they cohesive. And they didn’t play the brand of football they wanted. But there was only one currency Steelstown were dealing in. Silverware. That’s all Saturday was about.“It just matters that you are ahead at the end of the game,” said McGrath.“I wasn’t nervous in any way,” he told his side before the club’s historic hour. “I was jealous that they got to get the chance to go out and show what they were worth and show what was inside them.”And, coming back from last season’s defeat and in the manner which they did, that – in McGrath’s opinion – is the Steelstown’s calling card.“It tells you all you need to know about the group,” he said.The burden of three final defeats didn’t come into the narrative. It was a new management team, with a sprinkling of new players.At dferent times this year, McGrath beat the drum of a new beginning. Donncha Gilmore is now an All-Ireland winner. Five championships goals later, Morgan Murray has arrived on the scene and like Oran Fox, he benefitted from a league campaign that McGrath treated as gloried friendlies.It wasn’t about hard luck stories or flashbacks from yesteryear.“All we could base any chat around was what we done this year so far,” McGrath again stressed.“We were confident that we’d get ourselves in enough positions to take chances, that we’d create enough chances to get ourselves over the line.“We knew it would be tough, you don’t play the champions and get it easy. We knew it would be tough all the way through and it was about grinding it out.”Points from Jason McAleer and Eoghan Bradleyhad Steelstown three points clear after eight minutes, but the sides were levelat the break.“We weren’t panicking because we knew these things happen,” insisted the Steelstown boss. We went a couple down at the start of the second half. Maybe there was a bit of panic and you are going to feel that pressure when you have a couple of forwards like Greenlough have.”But McGrath trusted their leaders. Skipper Forester. Impact man Mickey McKinney. Midfielder Ryan Devine. All players from the  minor team he coached when he arrived at the club.“You have confidence that you have a group that will drive you on and get you over the line and that’s the way it panned out,” McGrath said.The fact they were still at the coal face of their title bid spoke volumes. McKinney was crying with total elation. “Is this real ”, bellowed Forester amid the pandemonium.“To go so long until now, it shows the type of characters that they are. They hung in there and had the belief in the group that was coming behind them,” McGrath added.“They are emotional. It shows how much the clubs means to them they have a desire to win.”And on the weekend that marked the thanniversary of Brian Oacuteg McKeever’s death. The club now carries his name.For McGrath, the final quarter told the story of the McKeever family.“That’s the way he would’ve played his game. If you look at the way Neildrove out, Eoghan Concannon hammered everything that was near him.“That was Brian Oacuteg McKeever, that’s what he did and there are plenty around here that know that’s what he did.“They were part of him, they saw him do it and the young people coming through are now aware of it too.”“He is never too far from our thoughts and Charleneas well, she played exactly the same way.

I was going to talk about the NI Music Prize when the predictable happens and rant on deaf ears about the unfairness of it all, but I continually vote in it, and it has been quite spot-on in the past, so, maybe I might wise up. Probably not like. Anyway. googletag.cmd.push For those not familiar and familiar with the process Aaron Cunningham, deputy editor at Chordblossom Addison Paterson, Alastair Simpson, Andrew Lemon, The Thin Air Brendan McKeown, Mr Brian Coney, editor at The Thin Air, Chris Corrigan, head of music Queens University Belfast, Carolyn Mathers, Director of Snow Water middot Christopher McBride, Ciara McMullan, photographer Erika Clarke, Chris Flack, Colin Harper, Colum Fitzsimons, David Roy, Dan Hegarty, Davy Sims, Rachael Campbell Palmer, director Black Box, Dolores Vischer, Monk, Edwin McFee, journalist Gerry Sheppard, Hannah Anderson, Hannah Gibson, Mark Hornby, James Ayo, Robert Brown, Editor at Chordblossom middot John DArcy, Jamie Taylor, beautul Everton fan, Janis Leaden, Amy Nolan, Jimmy Devlin, Joe Dougan, Johanna Leech, Jonathan Stewart, Josh Henry, Jo Wright, Kate Barry, Keely, Keith Millar, Me, Les Hume, Lisa Flavelle, Dylan Murphy and Jack Rapanakis, Mari Jackson, Mark Millar, Brendan McGoran, Meghan Gilleece, Thee Micky Ferry, Thee Nance Hall, Nattassa Latcham, Niall Byrne, Olga Kaye, Patricia McConville, Paddy Craig, Music Peter Cinnamond, Phil McCarroll, Ralph McClean, Roisin McNickle, Rory McConnell, Ruth McCarthy, Sara Champ, Sarah Kiely, Sean Kelly, Sean McCann, Simon Oliver, Siobhan McAndrew, Stephen McCaulay of the wonderful taste, handsome Stevie Lennox, Steve Stockman, Stuart Fletcher, Stuart Bailie obviously, Geoff Topley, Thomas Camblin and Saul Duffin have decided that Andrew McGibbon’s Northern Gothic, Arvo Party’s Inheritance, Bicep’s Isles, CATALAN!’s Veritas, Danni Larkin’s Notes For A Maiden Warrior, Hannah Peel’s Fir Wave, Jealous Of The Birds’ Peninsula, Joshua Burnside’s Into The Depths Of Hell, New Pagans’s The Seed The Vessel The Roots And All, Peter J McCauley’s Amnesty, Saint Sister’s Where I Should End, This Ship Argo’s Always The Bees Never The Honey, TRUacute’s No Fixed Abode and Verse Chorus Verse’s What If We Won have all been nominated for the best album at the Northern Ireland Music Prize and Amy Montgomery’sIntangible, Bicep’smiddot Apricots, Cherym’sListening To My Head, Dea Matrona’sStamp On It, Enola Gay’sSofa Surfing, Invaderband’sI Wont Remember You, Jordan Adetunji’s Wokeup! and Waldorf  Cannon’sWe Are Your Governmenthave been nominated for best single at event. There hasn’t been enough gigs this past year to have a best live act, how they arrived at a conclusion last year is strange but then I may be misinformed. There’s obviously no new bands to speak of so it’s just the two awards this year. I suppose it’s as close to democracy as we can get, but as with everything in the parish, the archaic powers that be hold way too much influence and are too stuck in the past. I’m the guiltiest and have no real business having a say and will keep my opinions to myself from now on. Well after I say that to my ears Andrew McGibbon’s Northern Gothic and Verse Chorus Verse’s What If We Won are the best albums on that list to me and Waldorf  Cannon’s We Are Your Government is the best single. I think we should all sit back and appreciate that Hannah Peel’s Fir Wave was recently up for the Mercury Music Prize kiss of death, sadly not winning butit was two out of two losses an outsider would be thinking that there is something really weird going on within the chambers of power up at the Oh Yeah Centre. I named the  nominators to remind myself that my taste really isn’t that important, and I should read my above statement about keeping my opinions to myself. Waiting for things to change in the parish is just something we are great at here. What next, I hear you ask, well there is a group that meets around a table and weighs up the options for the best albums, I’d like to think they do this in a fair manner and once they reach a consensus then the world, who will undoubtedly be waiting with bated breath, will get their answer The same is not true for the single, that is voted for by the public, you, and that’s why those bands were urging you to vote recently. The public vote is now closed so I suppose they know who’s won it by now but they’re not letting on. Rascals.

We wanted to celebrate that and also remember our dear friend and past pupil, Sonia Kinsella, who died of cancer last year.ldquoWhen we think of her strength and her courage and more importantly, her optimism, this play seemed so appropriate. We hope it pays tribute to Sonia as I think the sentiments this play evokes were embodied in that remarkable lady.ldquoThe play celebrates the strength of female friendship and the incredible support women experience from each other. I think our audiences will find themselves laughing one minute and crying the next.I am so proud of what has been achieved not only in the fact we havenrsquot fallen out despite the dficulties you face when you are trying to work with friends but also the time these busy women have devoted to learning lines and rehearsing while working full time and coping with family responsibilities. It has been hard work but I truly feel audiences will really enjoy the performance.Proceeds from the performances will be in aid of Marie Curie and Assumption Grammar Schoolrsquos sister schools in South Africa.Marcelle said: ldquoThese schools struggle financially anyway but they are experiencing great challenges during lockdown. The money we raise will make a huge dference to many lives there, allowing girls to get access to education and to be offered a meal each day.The provision offered to these students in South Africa can make all the dference to their future.She added: It is wonderful to see the fruition of all our hard work that all stemmed from a conversation during lockdown and that will hopefully benefit others in dferent ways.To purchase a ticket the production, please contact the school reception on   . Tickets are pound each with all proceeds being ided between the two charities. Those unable to make it, can still donate by going to the JustGiving Page..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/3November2021_kites.jpg","title":"Birds of prey finding a safe home  ","story":"BIRD feeding for the majority of people means putting out some seeds and nuts but Stephen and Karen Malcomson have taken this to the next level and beyond.At their farm in the townland of Dechomet in Ballyward on the western slopes of Slieve Croob, the couple have developed a wildle sanctuary mdash The Red Kite Retreat mdash with a custom built hide for guests to observe the fantastic aerial displays of the Red Kites.The retreat is the only Red Kite feeding station and bird hide in Ireland, located on the Malcomson family farm.Although the Red Kites were persecuted to extinction in Ireland over  years ago, they were successfully reintroduced in  when the RSPB Northern Ireland, the Golden Eagle Trust and the Welsh Kite Trust mdash in conjunction with local councils mdash began an ambitious reintroduction project to help bring the magnicent birds back to Northern Ireland.The Malcomsonsrsquo farm lies at the epicentre of their habitat in Northern Ireland and visitors can now sit in the newly constructed bird hide and watch these majestic birds feed and soar through the skies.In addition, a planning application has been submitted for a caravan and camping site on the farm, with a classroom for education and conservation events.ldquoWe are now officially open, said a delighted Karen.ldquoIt has been a long road and we wish to thank you everyone who has helped us get to this point. The website is now live. It is www.redkiteretreat and we are regularly updating our Facebook page @redkiteretreat. For more information please pay us a visit on Facebook, like and share the page.Red Kites were in the area and over a year ago and Stephen started feeding them and as this continued more and more started turning up daily.Red Kites are a bird of prey and have a huge wingspan of up to . metres they are reddish brown with black wingtips and a grey head.They have a distinctive V-shaped tail which they use like a rudder as they twist and turn through the air on thermals and their call is a long whistle.Red Kites are primarily scavengers and a big part of their diet is made up of dead animals , including road-kill. They also follow tractors when ploughing and swoop down to grab any small animals that have been killed by the mowers or brought to the surface.They are no threat to livestock and the largest animal they have the power and speed to kill is a young rabbit. Red Kites, like all other birds of prey, are protected by law and to harm, disturb or kill them is a criminal offence.The new Red Kite Retreat bird hide has already become very popular with wildle photographers and bird watchers and booking a slot is essential.Three generations of the Malcomson family have also helped to plant some of the first of , native trees on a -acre site to create The Warriorrsquos Wood on Dechomet Mountain.The main contractor, Scottish Woodland Ireland Ltd, managed the forest expansion and farm ersication project and planted Irish Oak, Hazel, Holly, Scots Pine and Downy Birch. Stephen and Karen also created two new ponds to encourage wildle and sowed a new wildflower meadow.Warriorrsquos Wood is the initial habitat enhancement works which form part of the new eco-tourism development known as the lsquoRed Kite Retreatrsquo.Stephen and Karen are the projectrsquos co-founders and wanted a means of ersying their farm business to ensure future sustainability.Currently, Stephen has a pig and beef unit on the farm but said ldquofarming enterprises have to adapt and evolve to ensure sustainability for future generations of farmers. I see no reason why modern farming practices cannot go hand in hand with conservation, environmental enrichment and encouraging bioersity.The Red Kite Retreat project aims to create a unique tourist and visitor facility and focuses on conservation and education about the Red Kite bird of prey, with the creation of the Warriorrsquos Wood the first step in the project.The Wood has been designed to mimic ancient woodland with species adapted to grow in elevated and exposed locations, with the planting including Scots pine, oak, birch, aspen, rowan, hawthorn and juniper.The Scots pine is favoured by native red squirrels which it is hoped will be reintroduced once the woodland has matured, while Juniper is also being established on the site.Updates in the Red Kite retreat are available on Facebook @redkiteretreat, by logging on at www.redkiteretreat or telephone .prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/3November2021_espie.jpg","title":"Castle Espie receives plaudit  ","story":"THE Castle Espie Wetland Centre on the shores of Strangford Lough, which recently hosted the popular BBC wildle programme Autumnwatch, has been praised for its ongoing conservation work.Ards and North Down deputy mayor Robert Adair visited the centrersquos base recently and met BBC programme presenter Gillian Burke and Castle Espie manager Paul Stewart.Cllr Adair said after the huge success of Springwatch at Castle Espie, the television programmersquosfor Autumnwatch has shone the spotlight on the rich wildle of the borough and Castle Espie as an icon of sustainable green tourism.In addition to hosting Autumnwatch, the visit comes as the charity is currently celebrating with a Winter Migration Festival at Castle Espie which includes a series of bespoke events for adults and children alike and runs until November .Cllr Adair said the international importance of Strangford Lough and its exceptional bioersity is a real asset to the environment.ldquoCastle Espie provides a window on the lough with the Winter Migration Festival and filming of Autumnwatch being a fitting way to introduce people to this wonderful asset on our doorstep, he added.Mr Stewart said the centre has been celebrating the natural resource and theof the Brent geese with events in and around Autumnwatch aimed at connecting people with nature.ldquoFrom sunrise yoga, art workshops, walks and talks, to nature focused activities for children, they are all aimed at connecting people to this wonderful place, he explained.ldquoThe worldrsquos wetland habitats like those at Castle Espie actually sequester more carbon than all the worldrsquos forests despite occupying only a fraction of the area around the globe.ldquoAs well as helping to deal with the effects of climate change, wetlands are one of the most bioerse habitats on Earth, protect us from flooding, filter pollutants and help improve our mental health.The Wildle and Wetlands Trust works around the globe, protecting wetland habitats and migratory bird flyways and operates  wetland centres across the UK with Castle Espie the only one in Northern Ireland.The charity recently launched a new lsquoWetlands Can!rsquo campaign, urging people to get behind the leading conservation charityrsquos call for creating , hectares of healthy wetlands in the UK to help combat the climate crisis.Mr Stewart added: ldquoIf the Covid crisis has taught us one thing, itrsquos that we canrsquot go back to how things were before.

The manager of the local service has confirmed that the incident is the first deliberate attack against an on-call GP service in Northern Ireland in the past five years.Mr Mark Armstrong described the

Hynds produced a peerless display aside from that concession, a former Poc Fada competitor, her restarts were struck with precision to wing forwards Katie Black and Niamh Galloway, who in turn fed team captain Joanne Sloane.Straight away, Sloane would angle deliveries into the mobile Maguire. Sloanersquos slick stickwork was impressive, and she had a fine contest versus Bernie Convery throughout.The key battle however, was the dual between Dearg centre back Grainne Glendenning and Belfastrsquos Jessica Rush.With her luminous green boots and helmet, Rush would stand out in any game, but she has the class to back up the bright colours.Winning a huge amount of primary possession, Jessica lsquos jinking, probing runs and vision to find Nicole Clerkin and Niamh Dolan was causing huge headaches for an experienced Ben Dearg defence.Kilcliefrsquos breakthrough goal came in the th minute with Burns finishing brilliantly past Lara OrsquoHare.Clare Kelly and Aacuteine Moynan made timely and brave blocks from Nora Maguirersquos goalbound efforts. The midfield battle was an intriguing and crucial one.Dual star Cara Doran has been on a scoring spree in the football championship this year and she continued her hot streak, with some exceptionally well taken scores from tight angles.Eimear Dorrian was everywhere, covering every blade of grass, never static, always roving, trying to create and make things happen. Dorrianrsquos dynamism and Doranrsquos deadliness contributed hugely to the green and reds display.Niamh McGuigan produced an equally impressive display for the Belfast side. McGuiganrsquos magnetic ability to gain possession in the tightest of spaces is remarkable.Never rushed, despite the chaos around her, she has that precarious talent of always having time, allowing her to scan and assess options, a luxury that only the very top operatorrsquos have.All season, Niamh Daly has also operated at centre field, but cruelly missed out on this final through injury.Brigid Scullion cleverly ped deep to forage for possession, picking up loose ball and linking well with half backs McErlain and Mathers. Kilclief thundered into action with another brace of points from deadly Doran.Her score in the st minute was worthy of the admission fee. Still only  years of age, a career in county colours surely beckons for this gted youngGael.Eimear Breen was a constant outlet for her defence to hit, a player who uses her pace effectively at the right times.With  minutes remaining, Kilclief were edging the contest with a five point cushion. Management Brendan Breen and Seaacuten Paul Doran madetactical tweaks to thwart the increasingly dangerous Clerkin and Dolan axis up front.A double sweeper system was swtly put in place, Cliona Shields and Catherine Deegan were tasked with shutting up shop forming a highly effective shield in front of Ballinascreen stalwart Nicole Clerkin.Nicolersquos space was greatly reduced, but still she battled as hard as possible to cut the deficit. McMullan and Mastersonrsquos masterclass in creating space for goalkeeper Hynds to aim towards, were signicant.McMullan typied the fight and character within the Ben Dearg outfit, as did the industrious Catherine Deegan. Yet, East Belfast pressed with an astounding intensity and relentlessness.That huge work rate comes from having dual players with fierce commitment and blocks of fitness from constant competing, but also from their Bainisteoiriacute Ciaran Hughes and Seaacuten Coulter who encourage their team to play with flair, and they certainly do that, but intense work ethic is paramountyou are to retain a place in this highly motivated team.That competition for places has ensured consistent performance levels all season.Niamh Dolan cleverly created precious space in the congested final third in the th minute, but her angled drive was superbly blocked by Cliona Shields, then swept up bravely by the heroic McMullan, who swtly transitioned to the always available Dorrian.Testament to the synchronisity that is within this Ben Dearg side, Dorrian didnrsquot have to look up to spot the expertly timed run of Burns who showed a deftness of touch to control the sliotar and sail it straight over the black spot.It was a score that comes from playing training together over many seasons. At the other end Aacuteine Moynan and Shannon McWilliams made important blocks, just as Joanne Sloan and Niamh Galloway were about to raise green flags.Clodagh Hanvey made a strong contribution after entering the fray. Maguirersquos maturity and decision making is exceptional for a Gael just turned .With Cara Doran the same age, the future is bright for this Kilclief team. Breen too, displays a shrewd tactical brain, dropping into spaces, covering runs, causing havoc.Doran was awarded player of the match, for her scintillating display, though a case could also have been made for East Belfastrsquos Niamh McGuigan.Niamhrsquos link up play with Jessica Rush was a joy to watch, but equally impressive was her willingness to help team mates in trouble, a true team player.With both teams featuring strong and dynamic forward units, this game was always going to be decided by which defence came out on top.Ultimately, the craft, guile and experience of the Kilclief reargaurd ensured that they closed the game out and got the Championship title they so craved, especially after last yearrsquos heartbreaking defeat to Attical.Euphoric scenes and emotions were unleashed as referee HP McCusker blew his final whistle.Team captain Joanne Sloane spoke from the heart, with a speech that did her club proud. A huge roar went up from the Ben Dearg support whenever she lted aloft the Liam Mac An Ri championship trophy.Each age group at juvenile and now senior level has collected silverware this season, testament to the solid work taking place at their fantastic new facilities in St Malachyrsquos Park.Lorraine MacCartanrsquos priceless contribution in the development of players at the club was highlighted, and deserved praise was duly given to this exemplary East Belfast side.The Ulster Championships now beckon for Kilclief.Referee: H P McCusker .prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/3November2021_kilmore.jpg","title":"Kilmore navigate their way past Maze  ","story":"KILMORE Rec welcomed Lower Maze to Robert Adams Park in the third round of the Peaky Blinders Irish Cup and produced a barn storming second half comeback to progress to round four.With Kilmore two goals down at half-time, having been harshly reduced to ten men after  minutes, the odds were stacked against them.However, a tactical change and a second half performance full of hard work and passion epitomised by man of the match Paddy Grant saw Michael Carvillrsquos men defy those odds and produce one of the most memorable comebacks seen at Robert Adams Park in recent times.Kilmore started brightly but after just eight minutes they failed to clear their lines from a corner, allowing Lower Mazersquos Alex Scott to pick up the ball  yards out and fire through a crowded goal mouth past an unsighted Chris Turley in the Kilmore goals.The task in hand got harder when the referee adjudged Kilmore captain Niall McCarthy to be the aggressor in a midfield confrontation and, to the astonishment of all in the ground, deemed it a red card offence.The injustice of the sending off galvanised Kilmorersquos ten men and they took the game to Lower Maze, dominating possession and creating chances.The first of these saw Caolan Conlon burst through from midfield. His shot was well saved and the rebound fell to Gary Kennedy who fired towards the net only to see Maze lsquokeeper Heron produce a great double save.Cai Gemmel, who was magnicent throughout, saw a goal bound effort deflected wide of the head of a Maze defender as it seemed destined for the top corner.As the chances came and went Kilmore got caught with a sucker punch in the nd minute.Bradford made his way down the left and his mis-cued cross beat a stranded Turley to leave Kilmore two down at half-time and up against it.Carvill changed the shape of the team at half-time and went with a front two of Paddy Grant and Josh Smyth.This change paid idends in the th minute when Grant weaved his way into the box, although it appeared he had been forced too wide, but the forward still managed to fire a rasping drive to the roof of the net.In the th minute a sustained period of Kilmore pressure brought the equaliser, with Grant again involved when his clipped cross was nodded in at the back post by the energetic Josh Smyth.Kilmore continued to dominate and press for the winner, as it seemed as though the game was destined for extra time.In the th minute the pressure finally paid off when Carvill whipped in a corner and that man Grant was on hand to hook the ball home from close range to send the Kilmore faithful into raptures.As Lower Maze then threw everything at Kilmore in injury time, the Blues defence of Magee, Larkin, Kennedy, Stewart and lsquokeeper Turley remained steadfast.Kilmorersquos substitutes of Dagen and Lynas had a chance each on the break for a fourth, but it wasnrsquot to be.Carvill spoke of his ldquoimmense pride in the resilience and determination shown by his side after the match.It came as no surprise that the Kilmore supporters man of the match went to Paddy Grant for his two goals and an assist in a match winning performance.This win sealed double delight for Kilmore, as the club recently secured approval for the installation of a new G football pitch, complete with floodlights, dug-outs, pitch side fencing and associated pathways.Kilmore: Turley, Smyth, Stewart, Larkin, Magee, Gemmell, Conlon, McCarthy, Kennedy, Carvil, Grant.

While Downpatrick has the Fountain Foodbank, Banbridge has a Christian ministry group called J based in the old cinema which will be supporting  families this Christmas..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/20October2021-GoDigital.jpg","title":"McKee stands down from UUP  ","story":"MOURNES Ulster Unionist councillor Harold McKee has quit the party.The veteran politician and former South Down MLA has resigned, saying that Doug Beattiersquos leadership of the party is at odds with his religious beliefs.Cllr McKee, who will remain an independent member of Newry, Mourne and Down Council, criticised Mr Beattie for advising members to ldquoleave their Christianity at the door.His resignation comes ahead of next Mayrsquos Assembly election when his wide network of connections across the Mournes area would havebeen a key part of the UUPrsquos drive to secure a seat in South Down.Cllr McKee has confirmed that he intends to serve as an independent ldquoat this point in time with some suggesting that he could potentially be approached by the DUP to join its three councillors on the local authority.He has attacked his former party leader over his stance on abortion, same-sex marriage and a recent vote at Stormont on gay conversion therapy.ldquoIn relation to same sex marriage which Mr Beattie is keen to endorse, I cannot go against the infallible word of God that marriage is between one man and one woman, said Cllr McKee.ldquoI am saddened to observe that these views seem to be of little value in the UUP of today but, rather, a stance of celebrating left-of-centre liberalism seems to be the only acceptable viewpoint.His resignation statement said Mr Beattiersquos leadership was ldquoa far cry from the UUP roots and ldquothe party of Carson and Craig.When Mr Beattie succeeded Steve Aiken as UUP leader earlier this year, he pledged to have a dferent style that would be ldquoable to reach out to all people in Northern Ireland regardless of what your religion is, sexual orientation or ethnicity.Cllr McKee said it was ldquobecoming very dficult to endorse a leader who is constantly to the fore promoting liberal issues while conservative values were being squeezedout. A UUP spokesperson said the party was sorry that Mr McKee had decided his political future no longer lay with the UUP.ldquoWe would like to thank Harold for his service and wish him well for the future, the spokesperson said. ldquoThe party will continue to hold out the hand of friendship as Harold takes a new path.Slieve Croob Ulster Unionist councillor Alan Lewis has described the decision by his former colleague to quit as ldquodisappointing.He continued: ldquoThere are many things that I find myself disagreeing with in all parties, not just my own and sometimes I find that it is better to continue to lobby, talk through and progress these issues from the inside, rather than walk out the door.ldquoThatrsquos democratic politics. Nobody is going to call for the gallows just because your opinion dfers, no matter how rigorous the debate. Unionism demands cohesion with the avoidance of ision.Cllr Lewis also thanked his former colleague for his ldquohelp, support, wisdom and guidance since he was elected to Newry, Mourne and Down Council.He added: ldquoI will always consider Harold a friend and fellow unionist. He has overcome personal turmoil and, like many of us, has a strong faith which has encouraged and supported him through dficult times.ldquoI genuinely wish him all the best in whatever he chooses to do next.Earlier this year, DUP councillors Glyn Hanna and Kathryn Owen quit their party over concerns following the election of Edwin Poots as leader.Mr Poots was subsequently replaced by Sir Jeffrey Donaldson MP and a short time later Cllr Hanna, who also represents the Mournes area, and Cllr Owen, who represents the Rowallane area, rejoined the party..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/3November2021_pitch.jpg","title":"New £12m sports pitch at Ballyhornan ‘fantastic facility’ for local community  ","story":"BALLYHORNANrsquoS new G sports pitch has been officially opened.The pound.m investment mdash which includes floodlights and ultra-modern changing facilities mdash has been funded by the Northern Ireland Executiversquos Social Investment Fund and Newry, Mourne and Down Council.Located adjacent to the Ballyhornan Family Centre, the new pitch is already widely used and has brought a number of benefits to the community.The Social Investment Fund contributed pound.m to the new development with the remainder provided by the local authority, with the Ballyhornan Community Association playing a pivotal role in helping secure the funding for the new pitch which was completed in October last year.Designed to increase access to community and leisure services by providing a fit-for-purpose, safe and structured environment to meet the needs and expectations of the Ballyhornan community and surrounding area, the new pitch will make a major contribution to help improve the health and well-being of people in the area.Ballyhornan and District Community Association chairwoman, Patricia Curran, expressed her delight to finally have a completed facility after years of rallying to secure funding for the G pitch which can be used all year round.ldquoWe are very grateful to all the statutory bodies and the local council who supported us throughout this campaign. Without them, we would not have achieved our goal, said Mrs Curran.ldquoThis pitch will be a great asset to Ballyhornan and outlying communities and we are very appreciative of this opportunity to provide a top of the range sports facility.Mrs Curran extended thanks to several people who worked with community officials to secure agreement for the new pitch and deliver it.Special thanks were extended to former local council officer Liam McLernon, Cllr Dermot Curran and former councillor Naomi Bailie for their ldquoimmense support.Mrs Curran also highlighted the support of Celtic Bhoys Football Club which uses the new pitch for its home games. She said the clubrsquos support was essential ldquoin making the project a success.Council chairwoman Cathy Mason, who performed the official opening, said one of the organisationrsquos key objectives was to improve the health and wellbeing of everyone in the district and reduce health inequalities.ldquoThis new facility will become a thriving hub that will have a hugely positive impact on the local area, benefitting the health and wellbeing of people of all ages by offering improved access to modern sporting facilities, she said.ldquoThis fantastic new facility is an excellent example of partnership working between statutory and voluntary groups and the health and wellbeing impact on our community will be immense.South Down MLA Colin McGrath said the official opening of the new pitch was ldquotestament to the work done by Mrs Curran and the team at Ballyhornan, working alongside officials from a number of organisations and elected representatives.ldquoItrsquos a real joy to see a picture of the late Eddie McGrady in the community centre in Ballyhornan who officially opened the building, he continued.ldquoThis latest development should serve as a reminder as to what can be delivered when communities, political representatives and government bodies work together in a common effort. I can only hope we get to see more of these good news stories in the time ahead.Cllr Curran said he was ldquodelighted to attend last weekrsquos official opening ceremony and thanked the funders of the new pitch for their respective contributions.ldquoThese investments are investments in our community and something we should all be very proud of. However, none of this would have happened without the hard work and determination of Patricia Curran and her team, he continued.ldquoGetting to this point over the past  years was a hard road with plenty of potholes, but Patricia never gave up. I am delighted that with help she get over those hurdles. However, had it not been for her dedication, this new pitch development simply wouldnrsquot have been possible..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/3November2021_billy.jpg","title":"Politicians say ‘no’ to plan for school  ","story":"A NUMBER of politicians and school principals are opposed to creating a new integrated education college in the area.The proposed -place Mid Down Integrated Collegewould replace Blackwater Integrated College in Downpatrick, providing sixth-form places.Public consultation into the development proposal brought forward by the MDIC steering group ended in September and the Education Authorityhas already given its response to the parentsrsquo group behind the proposal.However, DUP politicians and three of four post-primary schools in the area mdash Saintfield High School, St Colmanrsquos High School and Sixth Form College in Ballynahinch and St Colmcillersquos High in Crossgar mdash have publicly voiced their concerns for the first time.Strangford MLA Harry Harvey said: ldquoI am disappointed that despite widespread opposition locally, the Education Authority continue to press ahead with these proposals. The nearby Saintfield High School, a school supported by the entire community, is in dire need of funding for expansion and refurbishment.ldquoI would call on the EA to listen to the local community and support a truly cross community educational establishment that is already in existence.Cllr Billy Walker, who represents the area, said he will not supporting the development proposal, which he described as ldquoill-thought.ldquoAs an elected representative, I will not be supporting the call for an integrated college in the Mid Down area, he told the Recorder.ldquoFirst and foremost, I want to put on record that I am not opposed to integrated education in any shape or form.Cllr Walker said along with Strangford MP Jim Shannon, they lobbied for a new integrated primary school at Drumlins in Ballynahinch and were also instrumental in helping to get the funding to turn Killyleagh Primary School into an integrated school.He continued: ldquoMy credentials speak for themselves. My concern is that we have four post-primary schools in the Rowallane area that have been very successful in the last number of years.ldquoThe four schools are totally opposed to it as this will put serious pressure on these schoolsa new integrated college opens.ldquoThese schools have an excellent track record in working together in a cross-community basis which I have seen at first hand.The councillor claimed he had seen figures to show that Blackwater College was under-subscribed by pupils and local people have made representations to him about the development proposal.He and Mr Shannon recently met with the principals of the four local schools, including The High School Ballynahinch, to hear their concerns.ldquoHow can you honestly push for another integrated school in the Mid Down area when you have another one already under-subscribed, Cllr Walker continued.ldquoIf Blackwater wants to expand, hopefully in the near future Down High will get the go-ahead for its new build which would leave a site for Blackwater to move to. Thatrsquos something I could add my support to further down the line.ldquoBut I will not be quiet on this any longer. I have given a commitment, as has Mr Shannon, to the four schools we have visited that we are % behind their very robust case against which has been submitted to the Education Authority.Tim Jackson, co-chair of the MDIC steering group, said that the development proposal was looking at the future need for an integrated college.The group had already collected  expressions of interests from parents who would send their children to the school,along with  parents who are supportive but donrsquot have children of school age year.He also stressed that the schools had been consulted before the end of the last school year and the public consultation completed by September.ldquoWe feel that people have not understood what our approach and what our proposal is trying to achieve, continued Mr Jackson.ldquoWe are very much about increasing the provision of integrated education in the area, not at the expense of other schools but to support and reflect the support for it in the area and Northern Ireland as a whole.ldquoWe are not about trying to compete with other schools but are trying to deliver something that supports that demand of integrated education. We have had lots of support from local primary schools, many of which are integrated themselves and from other integrated colleges, who you could argue we would be in more competition with.He said that the group had written to every MP and MLA in the area and pointed out that Cllr Walker had not yet been briefed by them.ldquoHe did not take up the opportunity for us to brief him which might have assuaged some of the concerns he has highlighted, said Mr Jackson.ldquoAnd while we are hoping to establish a sixth form, we are not aware that the other local schools have also applied to do something like that.He added that the group were looking at the EArsquos response to the development proposal ldquoin detail as we think that some of our assertions have not been fully understood or appreciated as the EA looks at historical data while we are looking into the future as the urban and geographical landscape changes.Mark Morgan, principal of St Colmanrsquos, described the proposal as a ldquosolo run that disregards accepted protocols and should be dismissed.He added: ldquoIt is imperative that any proposals for change in any sector of the education system must be aligned to the area planning process.Saintfield High School principal Sarah-Lucy Hynds pointed out that irrespective of the proposal, her school would continue to strive for its own expansion.She said: ldquoSaintfield High Schoolrsquos campaign to grow has remained the same for decades. The challenges we face as a result of our capped enrolment at Year  must now be addressed as a matter of urgency.Mr Seamus Hanna, principal of St Colmcillersquos, said he was disappointed with the lack of ldquoproper consultation.ldquoOn a very basic level, the proposal ignored the reality that our staff and students already come from erse faith backgrounds and our ethos is and always has been, pupil centred, welcoming and respecting every pupil, regardless of faith or academic ability, he said.ldquoOn a higher level, it ignored the reality that schools must work in partnership to place student needs above institutional interests. An inclusive and imaginative solution would have received our whole-hearted support, but this current proposal unfortunately fell short of this vision..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/3November2021_smell.jpg","title":"Smell in Downpatrick causes stink with MLA  ","story":"A PERSISTENT foul smelling odour which is prevalent in a large part of Downpatrick is to be addressed by Northern Ireland Water.The utility company is to invest in a permanent dosing plant that will be added to sewage before it is pumped for treatment, with the news welcomed by South Down MLA Colin McGrath.He said he had been lobbying for the odour issue to be addressed and had been working with NI Water to come up with a solution to the problem,The foul smell is noticeable in a large part of Downpatrick including the Ballymote Centre and parts of Killough Walk, Glebetown Drive, Bishops Brae Gardens, Mallard Road, Braeside Drive, Vianstown Road, Cathedral View, Pemberton Park and Pegasus Walk.ldquoEssentially we are looking at a quarter of Downpatrick affected by this odour issue, said Mr McGrath.ldquoIt has been a long road to get to this point, but NI Water is working to come up with a solution.

While all babies are dferent, it can be helpful to think about working towards a routine by doing the same things in the same order each night so that baby learns what is coming next.Think about your little onersquos sleep environmentIt can be helpful to black out bedrooms, something that can be especially important in the summer months. Temperature is also important the Lullaby Trust, the baby sleep charity, say that the safest temperature for our little ones is - degrees celsius.Looking at how your little one falls asleep can help them get a more settled nightIt is very normal for your little one to be fed, rocked or cuddled to sleep, however this can be dficult to maintain. Practice other ways of getting your baby to sleep in their own sleep space to help find a method that suits you, your baby and your parenting style.Watch out for signs of tirednessWhile there are typical s of time that babies will happily stay awake for, the most important thing is getting to know your baby. By observing your baby, you can try to get them down for naps during the day before they get overtired. It is also important not to try to force naps when they are under tired.Fresh air and exerciseGetting out of the house for a bit will blow the cobwebs away and help your little one to burn off some energy. Inside the home your little one will also benefit from lots of time on the floor to keep them moving, while for small babies practising a bit of tummy time can be really helpful.Donrsquot always rush inhellipSometimes your little one will babble or make noise while they are asleep, and by going in too quickly we can disturb them. Equally they can sometimes wake and be happy in their sleep space. If your little one doesnrsquot need your assistance it is important to give them the space to get themselves back to sleep independently.Take care of yourself and donrsquot be afraid to ask for helpTherersquos no shame in not being able to do it all, all of the time. Being sleep deprived can be incredibly challenging and feel very lonely. Please know that is very normal for sleep to be dficult, especially in those early days. Please remember being a parent doesnrsquot always feel easy, because itrsquos not!

Photo: PacemakerUpper Bann MLA Mrs Kelly was quoted in a newspaper article as saying this week’s PSNI th anniversary was the perfect opportunity to recommit to the principle of a shared police force. The SDLP policing board member also said the creation of the PSNI was a “signicant departure from the institutionalised sectarianism represented by the RUC”.Those comments led to the NI Retired Police Officers’ Association penning an open letter to Mrs Kelly, in which the NIRPOA chairman called on the MLA to withdraw her remarks, and to apologise for the “gross offence” caused.The letter states: “I am writing to seek your immediate withdrawal of that remark, and an apology for the gross offence you have caused to the thousands of members of the Royal Ulster Constabulary GC who served this community in the most challenging of times.”Mrs Kelly responded, saying: “The SDLP has previously paid tribute to the sacrices made by many RUC officers and their families.“The fact remains that there were severe institutional problems within the RUC and this is a matter of public record. That many retired police officers continue to refuse to cooperate with legacy investigations to this day speaks for itself.”Mrs Kelly added: “The transformation of the RUC to the PSNI has been an outstanding success and whilst policing continues to be challenging I think the hard work and efforts of the those involved in implementing Patten’s recommendations deserve credit.”Ulster Unionist policing board member Mr Nesbitt said he believes his SDLP counterpart should “reflect on her comments and the hurt they have caused and apologise”.He said: “The RUC were the barrier between Northern Ireland and complete anarchy. They bravely held the line throughout the Troubles.“Dolores Kelly’s comments have caused great hurt to former officers, their families and friends. Police officers didn’t wake up hoping to hurt someone, but every terrorist did, and it was police officers who were targeted simply because they were trying to protect society and save lives”.Mr Nesbitt added: “Nobody disputes that the RUC could have done with more Catholic officers within its ranks.“I have no doubt that many more would have come forward had it not been for the fact that the IRA made a special effort to target those Catholics who did join the RUC”.Mike NesbittPSNI  \"       \"  Most PopularPortadown school contacts PSNI after TikTok accounts aimed at humiliating teachers condemnedNumber of COVID patients in Craigavon Hospital doubles in two weeksMan lost consciousness after being struck from behind in Lurgan attackCraigavon men facing charges of aggravated burglary after pensioner was confronted in his Tandragee homeTeenage boy stabbed at Halloween Fireworks Display in CraigavonMost PopularBuilding firms from across NI offer jobs after JMC Mechanical and Construction Ltd, goes into liquidationMike Nesbitt joins calls for apology over MLA’s ‘sectarian’ RUC commentsHalloween hooligans’ rampage in Lurgan ‘terried’ residentsStephen Barriskill killing: PSNI charge -year-old man with murderRoad repairs branded ‘diabolical’                       This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us on    ExploreNewsSportWhats OnLestyleMore from Portadown TimesAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsArchiveReaders Charter \" fill\"#ea\"  ©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-dqBHgY sc-gxMtzJ bAegnq\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policyModern Slavery Statement  News you can trust since News\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessEducationHealthPeopleRead ThisCoronavirusSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      SportFootballOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      LestyleCarsHomes and GardensMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessPublic NoticesFree Happy AdsFollow us      "},{"url":"http://www.tyronecon.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/1632989885154.jpg--top_tips_for_safe_student_accommodation.jpg?163298989300","title":"top tips for safe student accommodation ","story":"With freshers week around the corner and thousands of young people in Northern Ireland set to start University or new career paths, many will be on the hunt for rented accommodation. Northern Ireland has experienced a .% increase in average rental values this year[]. With the price increase, OFTEC, representing the liquid fuel industry in Ireland, is concerned that students may take cheaper accommodation options without properly inspecting the property. With this in mind, OFTEC has issued advise to help students ensure their accommodation is safe before they sign the dotted line. Raise the alarm – Currently, it is not a mandatory requirement for private landlords to provide smoke and carbon monoxide detectors, but the HSENI recommend that they do. It is a legal requirement to fit a carbon monoxide detector when a fossil fuel appliance has been replaced. Carbon monoxide is potentially lethal as it has no smell, taste or colour. Without a working alarm, it is impossible to identy carbon monoxide leaks. OFTEC’s advise is to ensure that there are working fire and CO alarms in the property, and that they are tested on a regular basis.Heating requirements - The Health  Safety Executive recommend that all boilers should be serviced annually and tenants should ask for evidence of recent servicing. If you have concerns, ask for a CD  Landlord Oil Installation Check which is carried out by an OFTEC registered technician and will give you peace of mind. For a gas heated property, ask for a copy of the annual gas safety check.Look for damp – It is easy to hide damp patches with a coat of paint, soyour house smells musty or you see evidence of mould, find out how the landlord is planning to fix the problem. Mould has no place in the home as it can cause respiratory problems and headaches.Furniture and fittings – Ask the landlord for a list of everything that is included and make note of any damage that is there before you move it. Check any beds, sofas and chairs are in good condition.Secure your home – burglars may target student areas because of lax security. Ask your landlord to fit key operating locks on the windows and lever deadlocks on external doors.  OFTEC Ireland Manager, David Blevings, said: “Quite often the excitement of moving in with friends can overshadow the concerns about the accommodation itself. We are urging students to play it safe this year and carry out these essential checks before signing a lease and moving in. “Asking a landlord about safety may seem awkward, but it could prevent you from living in a potentially dangerous property for the next  months. It’s vital that your new home is not a burden as you start your time at university.
