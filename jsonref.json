On 27 May I had just finished documenting the first active protest in downtown LA when later that evening I saw on the news that the city of Minneapolis was bracing itself for a second night of vast protesting. I booked a flight and flew out the next morning,” he said.“Surprisingly, when I hit the ground and began photographing, I felt a deep sense of acceptance,” Bell continued. “Everyone embraced me as if I were their own. Different men would say: ‘Let this black man through’, or ‘go ahead, black man’. I felt that the community embraced the fact that I was a black man who genuinely desired to tell their story as a whole.”Millis is a senior photographer with Thomson Reuters based in Washington DC.

It also called for mining companies to introduce a voluntary moratorium on acting on existing approvals, under section 18 of the Western Australian legislation, to destroy sites.“How many Juukan Gorge catastrophies are lurking on working schedules around the country? We don’t know because there are still existing legal regimes that permit various companies to destroy them,” senator Pat Dodson told the Senate after the interim report was tabled on Thursday.“Whilst our report is called Never Again, it’s in a legislative environment where there’s still capacity for an organisation or a company to destroy such a site. So we have a serious problem.”The report recommended the Australian government outlaw the use of gag clauses in agreements between mining companies and traditional owners, which prevent traditional owners from speaking publicly against the destruction of their heritage.It also recommended that:Dodson said the failures that led to the Juukan Gorge disaster “did not happen out of the blue”.“These failures were symptomatic of the ‘don’t care’ culture that infected Rio Tinto from the top down,” he said. “It had gone through a rapid decline in the way it did business.”Dodson said it was “a mistake” for Rio Tinto board member Michael L’Estrange to conduct the company’s internal review into the disaster. “His report is full of mea culpas and corporate lingo,” he said. “It was an unsatisfactory piece of work. It didn’t get to the heart of the drift and rot that was allowed to corrupt Rio Tinto’s formerly good practice.”He said that First Nations people were “seriously disadvantaged” when dealing with mining companies, failed by state and federal heritage legislation that required “serious overhaul”, and failed by the “ineffectual Native Title Act”, which he said had “delivered nothing of substance to protect the interests of First Nations”.“If Eddie Mabo were with us he would be deeply distressed to realise that what he had fought for so vigorously has delivered so little.”The inquiry was led by the LNP MP Warren Entsch, who wrote in the forward that while the interim report focused on the actions of Rio the committee would continue to investigate the actions of other mining companies and failures in state and federal legislation.The report said the WA legislation was “outdated, unfit for purpose and in urgent need of replacement” and noted that while the state government had begun reviewing the laws in early 2018 it continued to use the same approvals process. It also raised concerns with the proposed new laws stating “the experience of the PKKP with Rio Tinto, and that of other Aboriginal groups, would suggest that the bill’s focus on agreement-making needs careful consideration”.The WA Aboriginal affairs minister, Ben Wyatt, said the recommendation to introduce a moratorium on new section 18 approvals until the replacement legislation was introduced was “not a practical solution in light of their use across a vast array of different projects most of which are uncontentious”.“As minister, I won’t be considering applications for Section 18s where native title parties have not been appropriately consulted,” he said.Wyatt cited the dissenting report from the WA Liberal senator, Dean Smith, who argued that the proposed moratorium could prevent upgrades and maintenance of public infrastructure including the $3bn project to upgrade Perth’s train network.Smith also said it was “disappointing” that the majority report “creates an impression that Rio Tinto’s behaviour is reflective of the values of the entire Western Australian mining industry”.But he agreed with the rest of the committee that Rio Tinto should be subject to further scrutiny, telling parliament the company, including its chairman and board, “are still on notice”. “They should not allow themselves to believe the investigation into their culpability has concluded,” he said.Rio Tinto’s global CEO, Jean-Sébastien Jacques, and its Perth-based chief executive of iron ore, Chris Salisbury, both appeared before the inquiry before resigning over the issue in September. They both appeared again alongside the head of corporate affairs, Simone Niven, who also resigned, in October.All three had previously lost their annual bonuses following an internal review that blamed the destruction on “shortfalls in linked-up decision making”, but will keep their long-term bonuses on exit from the company. The internal review has been criticised as “inadequate” and lacking transparency.Smith criticised the “golden handshakes” granted to the outgoing executives and questioned Jacques’ assertion that he had been unaware of the significance of the shelters until after they were destroyed on 24 May 2020. “This is also difficult to believe,” Smith said.Rio’s global chairman, Simon Thompson, on Wednesday said the company would review the report’s recommendations. He also repeated his apology to the PKKP.“We are committed to learning from this event to ensure the destruction of heritage sites of such exceptional archaeological and cultural significance never occurs again,” he said.PKKP Aboriginal corporation spokesman Burchell Hayes said they were grateful the committee had conducted a “full, thorough, and transparent investigation”.“We hope the inquiry’s preliminary findings prompt a fundamental reset of the sector, particularly in the relationships between traditional owners and mining companies and pave a way forward for more equal partnerships fostered by greater respect and mutual benefit,” he said.“We have started the long road to healing and repairing our relationship with Rio Tinto but … Rio Tinto now needs to turn its words into actions.”The PKKP people told the inquiry in October they were “devastated” by the destruction of the two rockshelters, one of which had been described by an archaeologist paid for by Rio Tinto as one of the most significant archaeological sites in Australia.The inquiry was called in June, three weeks after Rio Tinto blew up the 46,000-year-old Aboriginal heritage site.Senior executives from BHP, Roy Hill, Woodside and Fortescue Metals were also called before the public hearings. All defended their own relationship with traditional owners. But Aboriginal corporations in the Pilbara said that the issues outlined in the destruction of Juukan Gorge were widespread. They include agreements with gag clauses that prevent traditional owners from speaking out against mining companies, and a heritage system that is geared towards mining companies and does not allow for review once more information about a site is discovered."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ab91218e454329a3cf52b16b6056ff42e4e96090/0_2039_3208_1924/master/3208.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=86606537c49f7d154b77fbf3c0a5e708","title":"uk drops eu tariffs on boeing as it seeks post brexit trade deal with us joe biden","story":"Move aimed at smoothing relations as president-elect Joe Biden prepares to take officeThe UK has abandoned EU tariffs on the plane manufacturer Boeing in the hope of securing a quick post-Brexit trade deal with the US.The UK’s move puts it at odds with the EU, which imposed retaliatory tariffs on US imports worth $4bn (£3bn) after the World Trade Organization (WTO) ruled that the US had given illegal state aid to Boeing, its aerospace champion.The UK government acknowledged that its move was aimed at smoothing relations between the UK and the US as the president-elect, Joe Biden, prepares to take office in the White House in January.The Department for International Trade said the decision was “an effort to bring the US towards a reasonable settlement and show that the UK is serious about reaching a negotiated outcome”. However, any attempt by the UK to extend the EU tariffs after Brexit could potentially have faced a US legal challenge because the WTO ruling did not account for the UK’s departure from the EU.The prime minister, Boris Johnson, is among the many senior Conservative politicians who have touted the opportunity for a trade deal with the US as a key aim for the UK after it regains full control of trade policy on 1 January, when the Brexit transition period ends. However, hopes of a quick win for the UK government were dealt a severe blow last week when Biden said he wanted to make investments in the US before looking at trading arrangements.Under the new post-Brexit approach to trade with the US, the UK will renew retaliatory tariffs on US steel after the US under Donald Trump said steel imports were harming its national security.Liz Truss, the UK’s international trade secretary, said: “Ultimately, we want to de-escalate the conflict and come to a negotiated settlement so we can deepen our trading relationship with the US and draw a line under all this. We are protecting our steel industry against illegal and unfair tariffs and will continue to do so, but are also showing the US we are serious about ending a dispute that benefits neither country.”The UK said it could still reimpose the aerospace tariffs if a deal was not reached."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e59217da045bd91b9ad125daf75edc9dbb5c5889/0_232_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f310dc0034e095873f62f36882037eee","title":"markets shares pound ftse 100 brexit talks economy ports supply chains business live","story":"Rolling coverage of the latest economic and financial newsExporters are also reporting that the cost of pallets has jumped, as they need to be heat-treated or cleaned to meet EU import standards, reports the FT’s Peter Foster:Trade bodies have been warning for months that Britain does not have enough of the right sort of disease-resistant pallets to trade with the European Union once the Withdrawal Agreement ends.ISPM 15 standards don’t apply to trade within the EU, so the UK is short of the kilns which can heat pallets to 56ºC for 30 minutes to kill bugs and pests, and meet the phytosanitary requirements.Speaking of the ports... Kent Online points out that temporary traffic management has been introduced on the route to Dover, to handle the high volumes of lorries.Kent’s roads once again are beginning to resemble a lorry park as drivers queue to access the Port of Dover and Eurotunnel.Dover TAP, short for Traffic Access Protocol, was implemented on the coastbound A20 at Aycliffe due to high volumes of freight heading towards the port yesterday for the fourth time in two weeks and is once again in place today.It means a 40mph speed restriction will apply to all vehicles approaching Dover from the west via the A20. When traffic reaches high volumes vehicles will be held at temporary traffic lights until space becomes available.The Port of Dover also tweeted that they were busy this morning:Escalating problems at UK ports are likely to drive up costs for consumers, experts are warning, whether a Brexit free trade deal is reached or not.Honda’s struggle to get necessary parts to its Swindon car factory is just part of a wider congestion problem. As a result, freight costs are soaring... which could feed through to consumers in the shops.David Lowe, partner at law firm Gowling WLG, says the usual supply chains are being tested.Practical arrangements for getting goods in and out of the UK are usually invisible, because they normally work. The current delays in containerised imports, and the price increases that come with that , brings home that you cannot take it for granted. There is limited resilience in the supply chain. That resilience is being tested by the impact of Covid-19, and is going to be further tested by Brexit, especially as with 3 weeks to go we do not know what Brexit looks like.Whatever the deal struck on Brexit delays at the border and increased costs will be inevitable, at a time when the economy is already weakened.The BBC also warns that price rises are likely due to the shipping crisis, saying: On top of skyrocketing shipping rates, carriers are adding congestion charges for imports to Felixstowe and Southampton, because of severe delays.The logistics industry has written to the Department for Transport calling for it to help clear port backlogs.One freight director said the UK’s ports are currently “broken”.Property news: The riverside 1960s building currently occupied by failed department store chain Debenhams in Guildford, Surrey, has been sold for £20m to investment and development company Native Land.The 233,700 square foot (22,000 square metre) building, located on 1.4 acres next to the River Wey in the affluent commuter town, was put up for sale by M\u0026ampG Real Estate at the start of the year for a guide price of £20m, billing it as a “unique property development”.Native Land said it is exploring a range of development options for the site - including homes for sale and rent, as well as retail and commercial outlets “to unlock and enliven the river frontage”.The Guildford Debenhams outlet was originally slated to close in 2020 but given a reprieve until 2021. However the entire collapsed department store chain will be wound down after Christmas unless a last-minute buyer cuts a deal with the administrators.The UK has abandoned EU tariffs on the plane manufacturer Boeing in the hope of securing a quick post-Brexit trade deal with the US.The UK’s move puts it at odds with the EU, which imposed retaliatory tariffs on US imports worth $4bn (£3bn) after the World Trade Organization (WTO) ruled that the US had given illegal state aid to Boeing, its aerospace champion.Our Politics Live blog flags up that Michael Gove has played down the prospect of te Brexit trade deal being finalised at tonight’s Brussels dinner.EU officials have also been stressing that Boris Johnson and Ursula Von Der Leyen will look for a reason to “move forward hopefully”, rather than actually agreeing a deal over pudding.In an interview this morning Michael Gove, the Cabinet Office minister, suggested the best he was hoping for was “further political momentum”. He told Times Radio:I’m hopeful that the prime minister will be able to lay out, over the course of dinner, where movement is required. The conversation between the prime minister and the president tonight, I hope, will create further political momentum, which will make sure that we do reach an agreement.His language is very similar to this statement on the prospects for the JohnsonVon der Leyen dinner released to the media last night from a UK government source.It’s clear that some political impetus will be required for the talks to make any more progress. If we can make progress at a political level it may allow Lord Frost and his team to resume negotiations over the coming days. But we must be realistic that an agreement may not be possible as we will not compromise on reclaiming UK sovereignty.Here’s his PoliticsCovid-19 UK liveblog:The pound is continuing to climb, now up almost a cent against the US dollar today at $1.345.That’s its highest level this week, since worries about the UK and EU would fail to reach a trade deal began to rise.Last Friday, optimism of a deal helped to drive sterling to its highest level against the dollar since May 2018 (with the dollar wilting against most major currencies).The actual crunch dinner between Johnson and Van Der Leyen is still many hours away, though.Ultimately it takes a little bit of politics at the end and both sides to move a little bit at the end. But I think that is possible,” But Varadkar also suggested that the UK would need to compromise on the level-playing field rules, on issues like labour and environmental standards.“Is (British Prime Minister) Boris Johnson willing to make concessions in those areas? I think he probably is...I think his natural instincts are actually much closer to the more liberal London mayor that he was than the more conservative Brexiteer.”(thanks to Reuters for the quotes).UBS Global Wealth Management reckon that the London stock market should perform well in 2021, whether a Brexit deal is reached or not.Dean Turner, Chief Eurozone \u0026amp UK Economist, and Caroline Simmons, UK Chief Investment Officer, say:“On the whole, we see value in UK assets, especially in UK stocks. The UK is currently our most preferred equity region, benefiting from a relatively high exposure to stocks and sectors that have so far lagged the recovery.Even in a no-deal Brexit scenario, we expect UK stocks to perform well.”Here’s how they see 2021 playing out:European stock markets have also opened higher, pushing the Stoxx 600 index to its highest level since February.Last night, Wall Street closed at fresh record levels (again), after White House proposed a new $916bn stimulus package to Congress, which would reportedly include new checks for families to help them through the pandemic.The offer was rejected by Democrats, though, as it provided much less funding for unemployment benefits than the bipartisan package which lawmakers are trying to hammer out.But as USA Today points out, Congress needs to reach an agreement soon, otherwise millions of US families face a grim end to 2020.A potential deal is coming down to the wire as 12 million Americans are set to lose their unemployment benefits the day after Christmas.Eviction moratoriums for renters and protections for student borrowers are also set to expire, as well as a federal program for paid family leave.While all eyes are on Brexit today, vaccines are still the “magic wand” lifting investor confidence, says Neil Wilson of Markets.As the UK’s vaccination programme begins, the Oxford University and AstraZeneca vaccine has been confirmed as being safe and effective in a Lancet study. The news further underpinned confidence in the reopening trade.Meanwhile the FDA has confirmed the efficacy and safety of the PfizerBioNTech vaccine, clearing the way for its imminent approval for use in the US. Vaccine optimism is also lifting shares in London this morning.The start of Britain’s vaccine rollout yesterday has lifted confidence of a return to normality in 2021.Investors are also hoping that US regulators will sign off the Pfizer vaccine soon, after the US Food and Drug Administration said its trial data was in line with its guidance on emergency use authorization.Richard Hunter, Head of Markets at interactive investor, explains:The US health regulator noted no concerns on the PfizerBioNTech vaccine, while Johnson \u0026amp Johnson threw its hat into the ring, announcing that it could obtain late-stage trial results for its vaccine in January.Alongside a roll out which has now begun in the UK, expectations are increasing for a relatively early solution to the human and economic problems which the pandemic has caused.Shares in UK housebuilders are up this morning, reflecting optimism that a disruptive no-deal can be avoided.Howdens supplies kitchens and bathrooms, so is probably benefitting from the surge in house sales in recent months, as well as the boom in DIY.Traders are encouraged to hear that Michael Gove has also floated the prospect of compromise over fishing rights -- one of the three outstanding issues to be resolved (along with the level-playing field, and the governance of the deal).Reuters has the details:Britain sees scope for a compromise on fishing in Brexit trade negotiations, one of Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s most senior Brexit-supporting ministers said on Wednesday.“I think there can be scope for compromise but the compromise exists on the way in which European boats can continue to access UK waters,” Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster Michael Gove told BBC radio.“But what is not up for compromise is the principle that the UK will be an independent coastal state, and that it will be a matter for negotiation between the UK and the EU, with the UK in control of our waters,” Gove said.“You know, countries like Iceland and Norway, even jurisdictions like the Faroes have control over who enters their waters,” Gove said.“Now, I think we can be very generous with that. I think that we can reach arrangements with European countries that allow a staged process so there can be a degree of certainty, so that they can manage that,” Gove said.Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business.It’s crunch time for the UK-EU Brexit talks. And stocks and the pound are both moving a little higher this morning on hopes that Boris Johnson an Ursula von der Leyen can hammer out a breakthrough at their dinner in Brussel tonight.Senior cabinet minister Michael Gove has told Sky News this morning that yesterday’s agreement on implementing the Northern Ireland protocol should help, saying“I hope that we will secure a free trade agreement. Matt Weller of Gain Capital explains how this agreement over Northern Ireland’s treatment has lifted hopes of a free trade deal.Essentially, the UK and EU have been in parallel negotiations over both a trade deal, which has been more in focus lately, and the implementation of the 2019 treaty over the Withdrawal Agreement and Irish Protocol to avoid a hard border with Norther Ireland.It’s this second negotiation that has now been ostensibly resolved, potentially paving the way for a broader trade deal in the days to come. Shares have also opened higher in London, where the FTSE 100 is 34 points higher at 6591 - close to last week’s nine-month high.But, anxiety is also rising that UK supply chains could buckle when the Brexit transition period finishes at the end of December. Honda is reportedly pausing production at its UK factory as it’s struggling to get car parts into the country, with Brexit stockpiling adding to Covid-19 disruption."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a817121a2977238efeebd4bfb884c153baf83585/0_596_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n\u0026s=9d1fd608713e61f90bc9c63d93204494","title":"teachers in the uk coronavirus what has this term been like","story":"We’d like to hear from teachers and parents about their experience of managing this term during the coronavirus pandemic The start of this academic year has been unlike any other, with teachers managing student bubbles, staffing problems, and additional hygiene rituals.

But after a swift circuit around the levels, I picked them up and headed down the lane behind my home to look for a stonechat I’d seen the day before.The stonechat had moved on possibly because of the presence of a male merlin – the first I’d seen here in Somerset for a decade. I first noticed the bird as he flew away from me, and resigned myself to the usual brief views. But moments later, he landed on top of a tall hedgerow.As I freewheeled slowly closer, I feared my luminous yellow cycling top would spook him.

The prime minister, Boris Johnson, recently announced a green industrial revolution plan, but the CCC said further action was needed now from the government to set the UK on the path to ending emissions by 2050.The CCC route map forecast people’s energy bills remaining level, before falling after 2030 as cheap renewable energy expands. Electric cars will also save drivers money but a phase-out of gas boilers will mean some households will require government help to install more expensive low-carbon heating systems, the CCC said.The cost of offshore wind power has plummeted in recent years and the CCC sees it as “the backbone of the whole UK energy system”, with all electricity being renewable or nuclear by 2035. The UK will become an electric nation, the CCC said, with double the current amount of power being generated by 2050, but with hydrogen expanding to fuel heavy industry and transport and warm some homes.Getting to net zero emissions is “ambitious, realistic and affordable”, said Lord Deben, chair of the CCC. “The price is manifestly reasonable. It will be the private sector that will do much of the investment but it will be the government that sets the tone.”“It now has to set out in detail the steps required,” he said. “As we emerge from the Covid-19 pandemic, this is a chance to jump-start the UK’s economic recovery.” But Deben added the costs of the transition must be distributed fairly across society. The government has accepted all previous carbon budgets proposed by the CCC and has until June 2021 to accept the new one.The CCC analysis found it is cheaper to transition to electric cars and vans than to continue with petrol and diesel vehicles. “That’s an amazing new insight, because it has major implications for the overall cost of achieving net zero,” said Chris Stark, chief executive of the CCC.Prof Rob Gross, director of the UK Energy Research Centre, said the CCC reports were hugely significant. But he said the major expansion of both renewable energy and electric cars would be challenging: “The speed with which we would need to get charging stations sorted out is a real challenge, if we are to avoid alienating motorists.”Clara Goldsmith, at the Climate Coalition, said: “The government must accept this advice and unleash a decade of ambitious action. There is no downside to embracing this plan. It can transform our society and create hundreds of thousands of green jobs.”Doug Parr, at Greenpeace UK, said: “The CCC may have set out its paths to net zero but we’ll need much more legwork from the government over this parliament to reach it. While some progress has been made recently there remains a yawning gap between our targets over the next decade and action needed to meet them.”• This article was amended on 9 December 2020 to refer to Rob Gross’s principal job, of director of the UK Energy Research Centre, rather than his role as director of the Centre for Energy Policy and Technology."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a44cb6b5d81410a9fe582a7209516b93ed232a5b/120_0_1800_1080/master/1800.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=38a6ac46a2da03f250d67afea12435b8","title":"earth photo 2020 nature photography winners in pictures","story":"Earth Photo, the international competition and exhibition created by Forestry England and the Royal Geographical Society with IBG, aims to encourage discussion about the environment by telling stories about the natural world, its inhabitants and our treatment of both"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/da9c501f51149ab69674c701442ea9f5d4198686/0_0_3200_2133/master/3200.jpg?width=660\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e0c9ad67cb84f039777f385226328986 660w","title":"psg v istanbul basaksehir suspended after fourth official accused of racism","story":"Uefa has announced it has launched an investigation after players from Paris Saint-Germain and Istanbul Basaksehir left the pitch in the 23rd minute of their Champions League fixture in the French capital following alleged racism by the fourth official, Sebastian Coltescu.Play was immediately suspended and while an attempt was made to restart the game with a new fourth official it was ultimately abandoned after the visiting side refused to return to the pitch. The remaining minutes of the match will resume from 5.55pm GMT on Wednesday.“Following an alleged incident involving the fourth official, the match was temporarily suspended,” read a Uefa statement. “After consultation with both teams, it was agreed that the match would restart with a different fourth official. Uefa will thoroughly investigate the matter and further communication will be made in due course.”The walk-off occurred after Basaksehir’s Cameroonian assistant coach Pierre Webo was shown a red card in the 16th minute for protesting against a refereeing decision. That led to the Basaksehir substitute Demba Ba confronting Coltescu over what the official said as he called on the referee, Ovidiu Hategan, to dismiss Webo, which Reuters reported as being: “The black one over there. Go and check who he is. The black one over there, it’s not possible to act like that.”In response, a clearly incensed Ba could be seen in video footage saying to Coltescu: “You never say ‘this white guy’, you say: ‘These guys’. So, listen to me, why when you mention a black guy do you have to say ‘this black guy’?”Ba could also then be seen in footage confronting Hategan and saying to him: “Why he say negro?” There followed heated discussions before the players departed down the tunnel.On Twitter, Basaksehir said: “Our players have taken a decision NOT TO go back on the pitch after our Assistant Coach Pierre Webo has been exposed to racist behaviour by the 4th Official.” The same account also posted the message: “NO TO RACISM Respect.”PSG also issued a statement on Twitter: “After a red card is given by the referee to a member of opposition staff, discussions continue between players and staff of both teams with the referee. The Basaksehir players decide to go back to the locker room, the Parisians follow them.”The show of support from PSG players was swift and decisive. The central defender Presnel Kimpembe could be seen saying: “Is he serious? We are heading in. We’re heading in. That’s it, we’re heading in,” as tensions rose. The striker Kylian Mbappé posted on Twitter: “SAY NO TO RACISM. M WEBO WE ARE WITH YOU”.Players walking off the pitch in protest against racism is rare and that those both teams did so was especially striking. It could also prove a turning point in football’s fight against discrimination and there will be much focus on Uefa’s investigation and the sanctions the governing body issues should Coltescu be found guilty of racism.Tayyip Erdogan, Turkey’s president, said on Twitter on Tuesday night: “We are unconditionally against racism and discrimination in sports and in all areas of life.”Regardless of the result in the rearranged game on Wednesday evening, Thomas Tuchel’s side have qualified for the knockout stages of the Champions League following Manchester United’s 3-2 defeat against RB Leipzig.PSG have nine points, the same amount as United, and even if they remain on that after what will be their final Group H fixture the French champions will progress on the back of having a better head-to-head record.A victory against Basaksehir would enable PSG to leapfrog Leipzig and progress to the last 16 as group winners."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/608513e3469bf2426a61f5177e95719f11589b4b/0_133_4863_2918/master/4863.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4eed63b408019118f33c7987520ad1d7","title":"solskjaer lack of champion manager edge was brutally exposed in leipzig manchester united tactics","story":"Manchester United were tactically inadequate in Germany, where a carefully honed plan met their hopeful oneThere was an eerie quality to the BT Sport analysis of Manchester United’s exit from the Champions League. At times the post-match segment was like watching a highly skilled Victorian parlour game as Paul Scholes and Rio Ferdinand accepted the challenge of describing the ineptitude of United’s start against RB Leipzig, the turgid team selection, the unchecked early gains of Julian Nagelsmann’s swift diagonal attacks – all the while managing not to mention the name of United’s manager.Scholes in particular is a true friend in this regard. Ole Gunnar Solskjær could presumably stand on his studio desk shooting him in the neck repeatedly with a pellet gun, and Scholes would shrug and say, well, it’s undoubtedly some kind of pellet gun situation. Or, what I need here is a long-term not-being-shot identity, that’s the real issue.And why not? Piling in on a manager is often a pointless exercise. This is a club with long-standing systemic problems. United are five points off the top of the Premier League. But the failure to analyse Solskjær’s role in United’s 3-2 defeat was a genuine omission.This was a night where the most interesting single point of difference was Nagelsmann’s tactical supremacy in the opening 20 minutes. This period decided the match. It also flagged up the lack of clarity, of real champion-manager drive that separates Solskjær in this company, the moment United’s nice guy met a genuine cutting edge.For 20 minutes at the start Leipzig ran straight through United. Nagelsmann’s team pressed and found no resistance, no stitching, no plan in response. Hindsight makes everything easier. But it was always coming from the moment the team sheets dropped. This was a United XI made to sit deep and play on the break – in the most literal fashion, with a back and a front and not much in between.Faced with seven defensive outfield players, Leipzig lined up without an orthodox striker, leaving United overmanned in defence and outgunned in midfield. The double-pivot of Nemanja Matic and Scott McTominay was primed for trench warfare, a Maginot line in front of the back three. Unfortunately Nagelsmann found a route through the Ardennes almost immediately, and his team just kept on pouring through.With two minutes gone United’s full-backs had already been drawn into an outnumbered midfield. Angeliño was able to stroll through acres of empty farmland on the left flank and plant a fine left-foot volley low and hard into the corner.Nagelsmann loves a bold start and this was his opening gambit here, a series of swift diagonal passes behind United’s flanks. Leipzig played 34 long passes in the first half, Marcel Sabitzer providing nine of them as the midfield swarmed in small packs, then moved the ball immediately out wide.Before long it was 2-0, the goal created by the same overload of those inexplicably vacant flanks. Somehow United had three full-backs on the pitch, but also no full-backs at all. Somehow they had seven players in deep defensive areas, but were still outnumbered every time.This wasn’t an off day, or a case of “starting slowly” as United’s captain and manager later maintained. It was what happens when a carefully honed plan meets a hopeful one. Solskjær picked a team for this game. Nagelsmann picked a plan, a set of well-drilled movements, an expectation of how the opponent would shape up, and of how his own team would press and rest in that first half.This was a safe pair of hands up against a maniacal eye for detail a fully realised opening assault against a manager who came to a shootout with a banana in his hand.And still United could easily have drawn or even won, such is the trapped talent in this team. They recovered from that opening trauma. Donny van de Beek came on at half-time as United switched to a back four approximately 43 minutes too late.Steadily the gears of the midfield began to move. Marcus Rashford and Mason Greenwood  wide to get the ball. But with 68 minutes gone Leipzig made it 3-0, and in horrible fashion.Harry Maguire dithered. Justin Kluivert nipped in. The loose ball was dinked over David de Gea, who carried out a successful piece of evasive action at Kluivert’s feet. Maguire’s passing can be a real asset in a back three. In a back four he can be exposed, an elite level centre back with all the easy mobility of an abandoned alien monolith.Greenwood was tripped for a penalty that Bruno Fernandez buried. United had 10 minutes to score twice. They almost did it too, Paul Pogba’s header followed by some late scrambles.At the end of which United exited Group H in baffling fashion. What kind of team kick off with a 2-1 win in Paris, beat Leipzig 5-0 a week later, then creep in behind both when the group is done?The key Group H defeat in Istanbul will define the campaign, and also capture its oddity. There is still something devastating in the sight of those duelling milk floats: Demba Ba sprinting away from the entire United team, pursued only by Nemanja Matic, a race to become the non-slowest man on the pitch.Solskjær was appointed on the back of progress in the Champions League. But this is also an unforgiving place, where tactical coherence and fine point expertise is so vital. He has now lost six of his 10 Champions League matches, the worst record of any manager of any English team, despite managing the third-richest club in the world.Is there any real sign of progress here? United have the players now, or at least most of the players. They should be at the tactical cutting edge, should be pushing forward what football can be at this level. In Leipzig they were instead the passive partners."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1ef90abf6fb8124a2befcfd518a1f8a49c5b42d5/0_0_1000_600/master/1000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=366e5f77a68c5cea0a9a36514ce7f458","title":"the 100 best female footballers in the world 2020","story":"Chelsea’s Erin Cuthbert, PSG’s Nadia Nadim and Bordeaux’s Khadija Shaw all feature between Nos 70-41 on our joint list with the Offside Rule Podcast"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/32f0b5075e08d410ee80be8f766c853ebc459945/0_0_5360_3218/master/5360.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=27872c6eef0e6b74804953fc20f38b4a","title":"share your experiences of being a uk delivery worker this christmas","story":"We’d like to hear from the people who will be working around the clock to deliver this year’s festive seasonAs the country prepares for a very different kind of Christmas, many people will be shopping online this year instead of hitting the stores in person to stock up on presents and festive treats.We would like to hear from couriers and delivery workers about the year they have had and their work in the run-up to Christmas.You can get in touch by filling in the form below, anonymously if you wish.

I put this conjunction to Arhoolie’s founder, Chris Strachwitz, who laughs. “Well, that may have been the day of the invoice from the pressing plant when they shipped the first albums,” he says, underplaying quite how seminal the release of Mance Lipscomb’s 1960 LP Texas Sharecropper and Songster would prove to be. He pressed only 500 copies of Lipscomb’s album to begin with, but one of America’s greatest record labels has grown from those humble beginnings.The recording of Lipscomb, who had rarely sung beyond the cotton plantation he lived on, came about after Strachwitz, a San Francisco Bay Area high-school teacher (“I was lousy”), had spent his 1960 summer vacation in Texas failing to record Lightnin’ Hopkins. The blues musician insisted on being paid upfront for every song recorded, rejecting Strachwitz’s offer of a small advance plus future royalties. Strachwitz was directed towards Lipscomb instead, and while initially reluctant – Lipscomb was a “songster”, his music far gentler than Hopkins’ razor-sharp blues – he agreed to make the recording.Fortuitously, the album’s release rode a wave of interest in folk music then under way across North America and Strachwitz found that by booking concerts for Lipscomb and selling the album (alongside trading in rare 78s) he could earn enough to quit teaching. Now aged 89 “and a half”, he has never retired and Arhoolie Records (named after the sound of a field holler) stands as the world’s foremost repository of American vernacular music: alongside blues, Strachwitz would record Cajun, zydeco, all manner of Mexican American music, New Orleans jazz and brass bands, klezmer, polka, hillbilly, gospel, street and outsider musicians, free jazz, bluegrass, sacred steel and more. Arhoolie captured the sound of myriad American communities and, in doing so, has preserved a remarkable kaleidoscope of music.“I don’t see myself as a producer, more a song catcher,” says Strachwitz when I inquire as to his recording technique. “When I heard Lightnin’ in that Houston tavern in 1960, he was playing electric guitar, backed by a drummer, and he kept up these stream-of-consciousness raps, singing anything that passed through his mind. It was so exciting, and that’s what I wanted to record. Folklorists had recorded him playing acoustic guitar as they disdained electric, but I wanted to capture what I experienced in his neighbourhood bar.”He adds: “I’ve always been very attracted to what you might call ‘honky tonk’ type music I just find so much value in what gets called ‘low class’. There’s always been this stigma attached to it and people try and make it ‘respectable’, but I don’t see any value in that.”Arhoolie’s albums, then, are “snapshots”. “It’s nothing permanent. Classical musicians can play the same way every day, but this vernacular music can change so quickly. And this is what we like about it – it’s so quirky!”Quirky is an appropriate description of Strachwitz himself, a friendly, happy man who is also restless and extremely opinionated. Ain’t No Mouse Music, Maureen Gosling’s 2013 feature documentary about Strachwitz, captures his idiosyncrasies – at a festival he berates a lemonade vendor for not using enough lemons – and enthusiasms. “Mouse music” is, in Strachwitz parlance, anything he dislikes, ie almost all popular music across the spectrum. As for the music he does like, he’s devoted his life to ensuring it gets heard.Age has slowed him of late. He’s now in an assisted living home, the pandemic having stopped him from commuting to Arhoolie’s El Cerrito headquarters (and then off to hear live music), but remains mentally sharp. “We had a great ride,” says Strachwitz of Arhoolie. “Kids these days don’t value music like we once did and have so many other things to spend their money on. I hope we can last a few more years because I’m uninterested in golf.”Strachwitz was born into an aristocratic family in Lower Silesia, Germany (now part of Poland), and, as the advancing Soviet troops drew near, they fled to allied-controlled Germany. Here they lived as refugees in a ruined mansion until prominent American relatives enabled the Strachwitzes to enter the US in 1947. Chris, a lanky, lonely teenager who spoke fumbling English with a strong accent, found solace in music.I ask whether being a teenage refugee led to his embracing music from marginalised communities, but Strachwitz dismisses the suggestion. It was, he says, simply the power of the music he heard on the radio: jazz and blues on a Los Angeles station with black DJs while “border blasters” – radio stations situated just across the Mexican border – played the music of the southern working class, be they black, white or brown.Strachwitz tried to play some of his 78s to his classmates “and they called me ‘a damn hillbilly’!” He laughs, then adds: “I remember when I was listening to Bunk Johnson, my father said in German, ‘They are playing off key.’ And I said, ‘Doesn’t matter to me – it’s got soul, it’s got feeling.’ So I was always going against the mainstream.”An avid record collector, he became part of a loose network that included Harry Smith, John Fahey, Robert Crumb and others. These young white men shared a huge passion for blues, jazz and hillbilly records of the 20s and 30s and, in doing so, helped open ears to the remarkable, largely ignored vernacular musical culture. While his contemporaries were happy to collect, reissue (in Smith’s case his celebrated Anthology of American Folk Music) and even attempt to play this “lost” music, Strachwitz knew from visiting the south that the music remained alive there. So off he went, at the height of the civil rights struggle, a blond man with a reel-to-reel tape recorder, heading into African American neighbourhoods.Inevitably, he ran into problems with racist police in Texas and Mississippi who suspected Strachwitz to be either an activist or a junkie. Strachwitz laughs about such encounters now, but they must have been terrifying at the time. He survived unscathed and says the hassle was worth it because he found musical treasure.Arguably, the greatest of all was Clifton Chenier, a Louisiana Creole (French-speaking African American) who played accordion and sang. In 1964, Lightnin’ Hopkins took Strachwitz to hear Chenier in a Houston bar where he was playing “this very pure Creole French blues. It almost sounded like Haitian music.” Strachwitz arranged to record Chenier only to find he wanted to cut R\u0026ampB, believing no one would be interested in Creole music. Eventually Strachwitz recorded Chenier performing what is now known as zydeco for the 1965 album Louisiana Blues and Zydeco. The record stunned listeners – almost no one other than habitués of the bayou bars of Texas and Louisiana had heard this powerhouse sound – and Chenier would go on to tour the world and win a Grammy.Around the same time, Strachwitz began recording the music of Chenier’s white neighbours, the Cajuns. “When I initially went down there, asking for Cajuns was like asking for Gypsies in Europe – the response I’d get was along the lines of, ‘What do you want those people for?’ They were considered just the scum of the earth. I finally found a Cajun band playing. One guy was singing in English and one guy was singing French verses people were dancing around in circles, counter clockwise the men were tiny and the women were huge. The first time you encounter something like that it really hits you.”Strachwitz never stayed still, always seeking out new artists to record and, having long collected Mexican American border records, in 1970 he began championing corrido and norteno musicians (alongside reissuing, as he did for every genre that engaged him, the 78-era recordings, and paying royalties). Through his efforts both Lydia Mendoza – the 12-string guitarist who had first recorded in the 20s – and accordionist Flaco Jiménez would win audiences beyond their core, Spanish-speaking communities. Ry Cooder, who accompanied Strachwitz and film-maker Les Blank to Texas when they were filming Chulas Fronteras (a documentary on the Mexican musicians of the US south west), would go on to work closely with Jiménez. Blank and Strachwitz’s documentaries stand as some of the finest music films ever made.“Mexicans in the US live a totally backwater existence,” says Strachwitz. “People see them as cheap labour and little else. Mexican culture tends to get looked down upon, treated as a joke. People like their food and nothing else. It’s sad as their culture is very rich, but there’s almost no recognition of it here.”Inevitably, such albums didn’t sell in large quantities and Arhoolie survived largely through Strachwitz’s good fortune in music publishing. In 1965, he recorded Country Joe McDonald’s song I-Feel-Like-I’m-Fixin’-to-Die Rag, unexpectedly cashing in when it was used in the Woodstock documentary. Then the Rolling Stones’ 1971 album Sticky Fingers featured You Got to Move, a gospel blues tunes they (eventually) credited to Mississippi Fred McDowell, an Arhoolie artist. “We got in contact and said, ‘Pay us the royalties’, and their lawyer said, ‘The Rolling Stones only perform their own songs.’ So this went on for a while until they finally agreed to pay. This meant I got to give Fred the biggest cheque he had ever seen in his life. When I did so he said, ‘I’m glad them boys liked my music!’ He was a wonderful human being.”Smithsonian Folkways, the non-profit record label run by the Smithsonian Institution, acquired Arhoolie in 2016 from Strachwitz and his business partner Tom Diamant – they continue to oversee the label, but no longer have to concern themselves with its finances. The Smithsonian has made more than 300 standout titles from the roughly 650-album catalogue available digitally (with some on CD and vinyl) and is focused on ensuring the remaining titles become available. Strachwitz notes, “Arhoolie never sold a lot of albums and, once people stopped buying CDs, things got rough.”Now Arhoolie Records is safely ensconced in the Smithsonian, Strachwitz’s great passion is the Arhoolie Foundation, whose board of advisers includes Bob Dylan, Linda Ronstadt, Bonnie Raitt and Tom Waits. He established it a quarter of a century ago, initially to document his collection – the world’s largest – of Mexican and Mexican American recordings, photos and more. This and other material relating to vernacular music are now part of UCLA’s online archive. Los Tigres del Norte, one of Mexico’s most popular bands, were so impressed by the material that they donated $500,000 to protect it. Strachwitz proudly notes that the National Endowment of the Arts and the National Endowment for the Humanities have also helped, “as they agree this is really significant stuff that has never been documented”.The Arhoolie Foundation is active on several fronts: it gives grants to educators and artists, digitises hundreds of hours of recordings and interviews, puts on concerts and does its best to continue Strachwitz’s mission of ensuring people get to hear beautiful music. On 10 December, a prerecorded livestream concert will celebrate both Arhoolie’s 60th and the foundation’s 25th anniversaries. Alongside noted Cajun, sacred steel, bluegrass and norteno artists, such marquee names as Bonnie Raitt, Billy Gibbons, Taj Mahal, Ry Cooder and Charlie Musselwhite are also appearing.“I’ve always admired the complete honesty of Chris and honesty in the music of Arhoolie,” says Musselwhite, a Memphis blues musician who recorded for Arhoolie in the early 70s. “Chris is a great fellow, and I love it when he don’t mix his words telling you what he thinks. He’s always correct, so I always listen.”“Without Chris Strachwitz and Arhoolie Records I probably never would have found Cajun music,” says Ann Savoy, matriarch of the Savoy Family Cajun Band, also performing at the concert. “One of his Old Timey series of Cajun 78s won my heart, and led me to a life of mystery and awe on the Cajun prairie. Chris has always done what he wants with no concern for fame or commercial success. It is his passion and hard work that saved much of the American rural songbook.”Strachwitz chuckles when I relay the compliments to him but shrugs them off. “Lady Luck has always been with me,” he says. “I’ve dealt with a lot of people who have had very little luck in their lives and my philosophy has always been, ‘The world will never be fair but you can try and help by being nice.’ I hope I have helped some people.”He laughs, and his joy is infectious. “It’s been an amazing journey and a never-ending lesson – I learned so much!”• 60 Years of Arhoolie: An Anniversary Celebration streams online on Thursday 10 December, 8pm EST  5pm PST (1am GMT on Friday 11 December)."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6905b9c90367e147a53de563f9ceb0446d15b9bb/0_201_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2312bb18c7db2978486ac0d66556c61e","title":"the rise of the chumocracy","story":"Investigations into how lucrative Covid-related government contracts were awarded have raised serious questions about cronyism. ’s Felicity Lawrence and David Pegg investigateA recent investigation by the ’s special correspondent Felicity Lawrence found that a man with connections to the UK health secretary, Matt Hancock, and no previous experience in medical supplies has for about six months been manufacturing tens of millions of plastic vials for Covid test kits.

A report from the National Audit Office recently concluded there was a “high-priority lane” to assess and process potential deals for buying up PPE based on connections to politicians and other officials.

They found that 67 low and lower middle-income countries risk being left behind as rich countries move towards their escape route from the pandemic. Five of the 67 – Kenya, Myanmar, Nigeria, Pakistan and Ukraine – have reported nearly 1.5 million cases between them.The campaigners want Covid vaccine manufacturers to share their technology and intellectual property through the World Health Organization Covid-19 Technology Access Pool. That would allow billions more doses to be made at low prices for the developing world. AstraZenecaOxford, Moderna and PfizerBioNTech have received more than $5bn of public funding to develop their vaccines, they said, which means they have a responsibility to act in the global public interest.“Rich countries have enough doses to vaccinate everyone nearly three times over, whilst poor countries don’t even have enough to reach health workers and people at risk,” said Dr Mohga Kamal Yanni, from the People’s Vaccine Alliance.“The current system, where pharmaceutical corporations use government funding for research, retain exclusive rights and keep their technology secret to boost profits, could cost many lives.”Steve Cockburn, Amnesty International’s head of economic and social justice, said: “The hoarding of vaccines actively undermines global efforts to ensure that everyone, everywhere can be protected from Covid-19. Rich countries have clear human rights obligations not only to refrain from actions that could harm access to vaccines elsewhere, but also to cooperate and provide assistance to countries that need it.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/374424d39affa534a260555656e7778c1e5fb49f/0_153_3325_1995/master/3325.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=664e3472cb18642712ae7ce8ed59f785","title":"theatre everywhere but on stage in pictures","story":"Tristram Kenton photographs theatre performances in unusual locations, in the latest selection from his archive"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/815df44909dd3d4a2097f22864cc53b8b61ef1b5/0_0_2500_1500/master/2500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cec085edfb9a7779416faa50516a56a2","title":"christmas at home plan ahead to make this years festivities extra special","story":"Celebrations may be different from what we’re used to this year, but that doesn’t mean they have to lose any of their magic, says the interior design influencer Jess HurrellChristmas is undoubtedly going to look a little different this year, but I’m staying optimistic and remaining hopeful that we will be allowed to spend some time with our loved ones over the festive period.With that in mind, I’m getting organised early on and I’m determined to make it a Christmas to remember. I usually wait until December to do my Christmas shopping and have been known to be panic buying until the big day, but this year I have started early because a) I need a distraction and something fun to focus on, and b) I want to enjoy the Christmas buildup and not be panicking about last-minute items. So Christmas is very much on in my mind, and I’m relying on John Lewis \u0026amp Partners to have me covered.Before I start on presents for the actual day, there are a few things I like to buy in the run-up to Christmas to build excitement. With all the uncertainty and change this year, I’ve been doing my best to make home feel as safe and as special as possible for the children, and Christmas is the perfect time to create some extra magic.This year, I’m planning to go big with a large tree and plenty of decorations, but I also want to create a sense of cosiness with lots of soft textures. I’m thinking blankets, lamps and scented candles for that warm, fuzzy feeling within our own four walls. I love the Neom Wellbeing Pod, which releases scents of aromatherapy essential oils and can reflect the mood you want to create at home – whether uplifting, or time to wind down.One tradition we have is to buy the children matching Christmas pyjamas, which I give to them on the first day of the holidays. This year has definitely been the one when the virtues of loungewear have truly come into their own, and I’m going to treat my husband and myself to new pyjamas as well, so we’re all kitted out for our family Christmas movie nights. The question is, can I persuade him to go for matching tartan? If not, John Lewis \u0026amp Partners’ beautiful silk pyjamas will be perfect for me. If he’s reading this, the Faux Fur Mule Slippers have also caught my eye – and they’d go well with my new pyjamas.Our usual pre-Christmas drinks and social events are likely to be on hold this year, so I’m on the lookout for more family activities we can do at home together. Move over banana-bread baking from the first lockdown, step forward the gingerbread man. The kids have got into The Great British Bake Off this year, so the Decorate Your Own Gingerbread Men set is sure to keep them busy during the holidays.I’m not much of a baker myself, so I can’t wait to get my hands on the Lego Gingerbread House (never mind the kids!), which can be built and played with over the festive period, then dismantled and brought back out the following year. I can definitely see it becoming a new Christmas tradition for us. If they start to bicker over it, I’ll call it a day and pop the TV on for some time out. We’ve decided to look into buying a new TV for Christmas as ours is on its last legs. I’d like a Samsung Frame, because I love the idea of the TV blending in with your walls.Now for the gifts – starting with the trickiest person in the house to buy for: my husband. It’s not that he’s a a, it’s more that he doesn’t have a wishlist. However, one thing he always appreciates is fresh coffee, especially now that he’s working from home, so a smart coffee machine should go down very well. I recently gave up coffee but I still love the smell of it filling the house. His other great love is running and he is constantly pinching my earphones, so a pair of Bose Sport Earbuds might be on the cards as well.For the children’s gifts, my eight-year-old son has asked Father Christmas for a Nintendo Switch and my daughter, four, would like a bigger scooter. I’ll also definitely be purchasing the eeBoo Birds in Fern Jigsaw Puzzle for them to do together, as they both love a jigsaw.We are midway through a major kitchen renovation at home, which has meant a lot of dust and cooking on a camping stove in the living room for the past few months, so we’re keeping our fingers crossed that it will be completed in time for Christmas. And that can only mean one thing: kitchen disco! Come New Year’s Eve, even if it is just the four of us, we’ll be donning our glad rags, firing up our Sonos Move Smart Speaker, and throwing some shapes to see out this very strange year."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/00ddc088d562eef31c3dd50729182c4289d06a49/705_684_1797_1079/master/1797.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=15e52ea952f046443fd9b64579d9c92b","title":"my year of roaming free in cornwall photo essay cat vinton","story":"Photographer Cat Vinton’s work follows nomadic people in the natural world, but the pandemic meant being closer to home – living out of her vehicle and exploring the Cornish way of life The last embers of my fire flicker orange and red in the dark. It has warmed me after my evening swim shared with a grey seal, a curious female at the water’s edge, under the soft pink hues of the setting sun.The nights are beginning to draw in and the temperature is dropping. Tonight’s home is a magical one: a hidden spot somewhere on the Roseland Heritage coast.I am curled up in my tiny space with only a canvas shell between me and the elements. Tonight is calm: a beautiful moon path marks the ocean and is my view through the open back of my family’s Land Rover. I drift off to sleep to the sound of waves lapping the shore and the call of tawny owls across the night sky.For the last few years I’ve not called one place home. Instead, I’ve roamed across the globe – from the High Himalaya to the Arctic Circle, the Gobi Desert to the Andaman Sea – weaving my life and work as a photographer, more in tune with a wilder spirit and those who still live connected to nature.As the world locked down in March, not only my work but my entire way of life ground to a quiet halt, forcing me to look inward and to grapple with the meaning of “home”.My pull was to the ocean of the south-west of England. Thanks to my friend Louise Middleton, for those three months of lockdown I watched over a wild pocket of the north Cornish coast – an old slate quarry that overlooks the sea at Trebarwith Strand. It is a beautifully curated space, totally off-grid, that Louise has named Kudhva (meaning hideout in Cornish). Kudhva is a visionary architectural hideout that draws creative people who thrive on a life connected to the outdoors.I became part of a community at Kudhva and my days were spent in fascinating conversation, working on the land with the locals. This is what I do on my projects – immerse myself in a way of life, documenting people who are connected to their land and community around the world. I fell into a way of doing the same on home shores.Sidetracked, an adventure journal which has shared my stories from the remotest corners of the world, joined us as lockdown lifted for some backyard adventures – climbing, biking, cold-water swimming and surfing – with the people who know this land best.Then, as the country began to open up again, and Kudhva began to welcome back guests, it was time to move on. I decided this was a gift of time I may never get again. Usually, I’m moving with my work. I had my cameras and a Land Rover that could take me off the beaten track – the perfect companion to explore the Cornish coast and its way of life, and to see if I could still find pockets of solitude, as the tourist floodgates opened.A small pile of books is stacked between the seats of the Land Rover a head torch, tide tables, bikini and my knife are at hand. Everything else I need is packed neatly in the open back, covered with a piece of wood that doubles as a table and my bed. It’s simple – I’m free, independent and happy. With no real plan, I set off west along the north coast.Cornwall has always felt like a haven to me, but even more so now with its gift of space, fresh air, ocean and local produce far from the hustle of city life. Slate and granite cliffs, small rocky coves and headlands, sand dunes, reefs, sandy beaches, green pathways and water shape Cornwall’s 400 miles of coastline.As my days slowed, I noticed every detail in the shifting light, the sounds, smells and colours, and tuned into the tidal rhythm, mesmerised by the waves that roll in perfect lines.I weaved my way along the north coast from Trebarwith Strand to the lighthouse on Pendeen Point, almost 100 miles of coast flanked by the Atlantic Ocean. This part of the coast is punctuated with derelict buildings and still-noble chimneys of tin and copper mines that once thrived in a harsh industrial past. Climbers are drawn to the granite cliffs and crags of the Penwith peninsula, and I spent some epic days here, with friends, climbing and exploring the Penwith heritage coast.The weather had been mostly kind until late August, but the rumblings of thunder carried a wild energy that stirred up the ocean and I lay awake as lightning lit up the night sky, and wind and driving rain whipped the canvas covering of the Land Rover. For 10 days storms Ellen and Francis raged across the ocean, swirled around the end of land and made me appreciate everything – especially how privileged I am to be able to make the choice to live like this. It’s not the easiest way to live and not what most people would choose – but it’s stripped back, simple and connected. Being immersed in the elements is where I find my energy and my balance, giving me a sense of purpose.Every day is different as I move slowly along this stunning coast. I’ve seen pilot whales, dolphins, seals, barn owls, kestrels, peregrines and choughs, met old Cornish fishermen and made new local friends. I have, of course, also seen the hordes of people who’ve flocked here – but I’ve also found so many empty pockets of Kernow magic. The sea mist comes and goes, as do the sun and the clouds. The sea changes every day, every hour, every minute, as do we – our emotions, our energy and our perspectives. It feels like a lesson – a constant reminder that we are part of nature, not separated from it.Friends have joined me, I’ve swum every day, I’ve climbed, explored and watched the days turn to night by a fire on the beach most evenings. I’ve witnessed the change in the coastal palette of the native wildflowers and fallen into the pace of life here. I navigated the coast around the Lizard, up to Falmouth and on to the Roseland Heritage coast the south coast is gentler, with sheltered beaches, woodland valleys, tree-lined estuaries, tiny winding roads, and picturesque fishing villages scattered along its shores.I’ve been drawn to like-minded people, who share the same values, who’ve made a home on this coast and who are passionately driven to protect the ocean and the land. Conversations, ideas and projects are the beginnings of collaborations, now and in the future.I made it to Mevagissey on the south coast by the beginning of October, with warnings of another storm. I had a commitment to be on Cornwall’s highest point, Brown Willy on Bodmin Moor, by 3 October to photograph an amazing man, explorer Robin Hanbury-Tenison and his family. His story is one of a remarkable recovery from Covid-19, having spent five weeks in an induced coma with little chance of survival. The key moment in his recovery was when he was wheeled into the healing garden of Derriford hospital. Now raising funds for healing gardens across Cornwall, Robin braved the 60mph winds of Storm Alex to reach the summit and fly the Cornish flag of Saint Piran. Another story of the power of nature.I’ve been in Cornwall for eight months now. That’s the longest I’ve been in one place for a long time. Cornwall has had my heart for many years, but to have lived through the seasons, entirely off-grid, has connected me more deeply.There is something incredibly powerful about living so close to nature, in the elements. I think it’s something we miss living inside closed walls – we are disconnected.As the world of free movent has new rules and the future is unknown and precarious, I think it has forced many of us to rethink our pace of life, our relationship to nature, what we really need to be happy and fulfilled, and how we will live our lives on the other side of this.I have learned so much about the importance and the purpose of life – a moral and ethical code – from the nomadic people of the world’s most remote corners. About the fragile connection between people and nature, and that wealth and success are not measured in belongings and status, but in the strength of our human spirit. I feel, more than ever, that we have so much to learn from these people who have never lost those visceral connections."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/58d02233f2c740fbe22829e1b75a4bacc2fb659d/71_66_4890_2934/master/4890.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=943aad744401a967e7d20cd6c38d128b","title":"every character was eccentric it was beautiful the inside story of coronation street","story":"In the 60 years since the first episode was aired, the soap has gone from kitchen-sink serial to cultural institution. Its stars, writers and producers tell us the secrets of Britain’s best loved streetIn the winter of 1960, John F Kennedy had just been elected, a young rock band had changed its name to the Beatles, and – at 7pm on Friday 9 December – a mournful cornet was heard in homes across the north of England.The Coronation Street theme tune signalled the then unpromising start of a new TV series. Granada Television had commissioned 13 black-and-white episodes, assembling a cast of little-known stage actors in Weatherfield, a fictional town inspired by the working-class terraces of Salford.Few expected it to succeed, but Coronation Street would transform television, becoming a cultural institution and tabloid juggernaut. It has survived wayward stars, a revolving door of producers, the rise of streaming TV and – in its diamond anniversary year – a global pandemic. The more than 10,000 episodes have included 57 births, 131 marriages (including five acts of bigamy) and 146 deaths (25 of them murders, variously involving a shovel, a crowbar and a small statue).But before all the love rats, family spats, big stunts, ratings clashes and even before the sense of humour that was always the show’s lodestar, there was a nation on the cusp of change – and a frustrated young writer called Tony.Tony Warren grew up sitting under his grandmother’s kitchen table, listening to the gossip and caustic asides of Salford’s no-nonsense matriarchs. He devoured plays in Manchester Central Library and, aged 15, hitchhiked to London to write cabaret and routines for strippers.Back in Manchester, Warren also absorbed the speech and personalities of gay men at pubs such as Paddy’s Goose. But as a junior writer at Granada, which had only begun broadcasting in the still starchy world of TV in 1956, he grew tired of writing Biggles scripts. Postwar Britain was in flux. There was a yearning for recognition and self-assertion among the working class. Desperate for an outlet for the characters buzzing in his head, Warren begged the producer Harry Elton for a shot. Elton agreed, despite scepticism from the Granada supremo, Sidney Bernstein.Warren, who was 23, was allowed to write 12 episodes – plus a finale in case they bombed. His work stunned the script editor Harry Kershaw, who wrote later: “You closed your eyes and you could see the antimacassars and the chenille tablecloths … You sniffed and you could smell the burning sausages and the cheap hairspray and the tang of bitter beer.”Warren got the nod. Next: the search for actors to bring his characters to life.William Roache (Ken Barlow 1960-present): I absolutely didn’t want to do it. I’d grown up in Derbyshire, but I was a young actor on stage in London. I had a flat in Primrose Hill and my career was about to take off. And in those days ITV was broken up into regions so it was like doing local radio. My agent said: “Look at this way, it’s only going to run for a few weeks.”Roache, whom Warren had spotted on stage, is the only member of the original cast still in the show. He has starred in more than 4,600 episodes, and had multiple relationships – most famously with his on-screen wife Deirdre (played by the late Anne Kirkbride).Philip Lowrie (Dennis Tanner 1960-1968, 2011-2014): I remember we were having a coffee break from rehearsing on the Monday when Harry Kershaw came and said: “You’re going out live on Friday at 7pm.” We all fell on the floor because hardly any of us had done television. I’d had one line in Dixon of Dock Green, but my agent had seen that this was a series set in Manchester, where I was from. So I was delighted to audition.William Roache: Bernstein didn’t want to do the show either. He thought people wanted escapism but we were part of a new realism with John Osborne’s Look Back in Anger, and James Dean and Marlon Brando in the cinema. Tony was bringing it to TV with a cutting edge kitchen-sink drama serial.Anne Cunningham (Linda Cheveski nee Tanner 1960-1968, 1984): Everyone spoke standard English in television plays in those days, but Granada was ahead of its time and there was this sort of northern vogue.Anne Cunningham: I don’t remember that! Acting is a bit like jumping off a cliff. If someone else jumps at the same time you form a bond. I made friends for life, as they say on Strictly, and named my daughter Philippa, after Philip.In the first episode, Elsie Tanner (Pat Phoenix) tells her son Dennis to get a job and is rude about her daughter Linda’s legs: “I’m afraid you’ve got the Tanner side of the family to thank for that. Yer know, without a word of a lie, yer grandma Tanner were that bandy she couldn’t have stopped a pig in an entry.”Critics were ided. The Daily Mirror columnist Ken Irwin said the show was “doomed from the outset”. Mary Crozier of the  was more positive, writing: “Mr Warren has pinpointed phrase and accent, humour and oddity, and if he can keep the mixture sharp and not put in too much treacle, it should cook up very well.”Audiences loved it, swiftly winning the show further episodes. Within months Coronation Street was broadcast across the regions and became the most-watched show in Britain. Soon a publicity manager, Norman Frisby, was working hard to manage interviews and charity events.Philip Lowrie: I had no idea it was going to be that big. I remember a few months later we were going to Blackpool to film part of an episode. The bus stopped at a pub on the way. We had a bit of a drink and Coronation Street came on the TV. Everyone was glued to us!William Roache: Those first few years were a golden age. The roots were fully established and every character was powerful and clearly drawn, and all eccentric in some way. It was beautiful.John Finch (writer then producer 1961-1970): The key to everything was Tony Warren’s characters. Nobody, including myself, ever matched his characterisation. But I think he soon got tired and faded away when other writers took over his characters. I think it hurt him.Warren, who at first had a strained relationship with Granada, also struggled with drink and drugs. He would often run away, spending some time in a commune in San Francisco. He returned to the Street in the 1980s as a consultant and beloved oracle. He sat in on storyline meetings until not long before his death in 2016, aged 79.In 1964, a producer called Tim Aspinall shattered the golden age by killing off several big characters, but also introducing the Street legends Stan and Hilda Ogden. It was the first of many off-screen upheavals.Coronation Street narrowly survived the threat of closure in 1968. The writing deteriorated in the early 1970s and the show risked becoming an anachronism or, worse, a joke. Rescue came with Bill “the Godfather” Podmore, an RAF pilot turned director who took over as producer in 1976. Feared yet respected, Podmore restored Warren’s brand of humour, reviving the Ogdens as a comedic act. A new golden era lasted into the 1980s, when audiences would often top 20 million.William Roache: Bill had his heart in the street. He loved it, and that’s why it flourished.Podmore also ushered in the era of blockbuster storylines, which grew even bigger with the launch of the BBC’s arch-rival, EastEnders, in 1985. It is a sign of modern demands for drama that 21 of Coronation Street’s 25 murders have happened in the second half of its 60-year run.In 1981, Ken Barlow’s marriage to Deirdre Langton drew more viewers for ITV than Charles and Diana’s wedding two days later. Millions more watched the climax of a Barlow love triangle involving factory boss Mike Baldwin, in 1983. Storylines still make front-page news, sometimes heaping pressure on the show’s stars.William Roache: The love triangle had a colossal impact. Suddenly newspapers had reporters dedicated to soaps and all the soap magazines and awards were starting. They even flashed it up at Manchester United!The crowd roared when the message “Ken and Deirdre reunited – Ken 1 Mike 0” appeared on the scoreboard at Old Trafford in a match against Arsenal.Jane Danson (Leanne Battersby 1997-2000, 2004-present): Nothing prepared me for the enormity of the press attention and the instant recognition. We were all over the front pages before we’d even done anything.Jane Danson: I remember an old lady whacking me with her handbag! I was 18 and on a handsome wage and I think you either go a bit mad or become a recluse, which is what I did. It terrified me.Alison Sinclair (press officer 1993-present): There was a huge interest in the cast’s private lives, but one of the biggest challenges was the leaks. We recorded Raquel and Curly’s wedding off-site with a tiny crew, but on the day of the episode the script appeared in its entirety in the Mirror.Paul Abbott (script editorwriter 1985-1996): I remember at one point I was getting the blame for all these leaks so I wrote different versions of letters with fake information and left them in the booking table where all the actors got their dates. In one letter it said we were going to film in Barbados and it was in the Manchester Evening News by 5pm. I’d got the greedy little shit!Abbott, who declines to name the leak, was a wide-eyed 24-year-old when he got a script-editing job on the Street, years before he created Touching Evil, State of Play and Shameless.Few storylines have matched the impact of Deirdre Rachid’s wrongful imprisonment for fraud in 1998 while her conman lover Jon Lindsay walked free. The verdict triggered a public campaign. Viewers jammed Granada’s switchboard and made T-shirts bearing the slogan: “Free the Weatherfield One”. One fan donated £5,000 to the campaign.Alison Sinclair: I was pregnant with twins when the phone went, and it was this guy saying he was calling from Downing Street. He wanted a preview of the Deirdre plot. I just laughed. I thought it was a radio station prank, but the prime minister wanted to be briefed.Alastair Campbell (Downing Street press secretary 1997-2000): The papers were just going crazy with “Free Deirdre” and I thought: “Sod it, let’s get on this.”The prime minister, Tony Blair, announced he would ask Jack Straw, the home secretary, to look into the matter, adding in a statement: “It is clear to anyone with eyes in their head she is innocent and she should be freed.” William Hague, the leader of the opposition, could hardly stay silent. “The whole nation is deeply concerned about Deirdre, Conservatives as much as everyone else,” he said. Coronation Street’s ratings surged.Alastair Campbell: I wouldn’t claim it as my finest hour, but I knew from my days on the Mirror just how big Corrie was. When Jack Bell, the TV editor, got the splash when EastEnders launched, I remember thinking: ‘Why the fuck is this the splash?’, but this was a period when soaps were becoming a really big part of the newspaper diet. You just got stories galore out of it.As well as humour and big drama, Coronation Street has always upheld the soap tradition of issue-led storylines, which have also multiplied in the modern era. Writers have variously tackled suicide, rape, teenage pregnancy, coercive control and revenge porn.Hayley Cropper (nee Patterson) arrived on the street in 1998 as a rare trans character in a popular drama. Soon, Tony Warren, together with the writer Daran Little, guided the Street’s belated embrace of gay characters, 40 years after gay men had tacitly inspired his scripts.Antony Cotton (Sean Tully 2003-present): My part didn’t exist until I wrote to the then producer Tony Wood. I found a blank card with a picture of a dog with sunglasses on it, and wrote: “Dear Tony, if you ever fancy having a homosexual skipping down the cobbles of Coronation Street, I’m your man. I’ve got my house, my own car, I don’t do drugs and best of all I’m cheap. Come on Tony, you know you want it.”He passed the card to Tony Warren at a long-term story conference. He said: ‘What do you think of having this gay character?’ And Warren – and I’m not making this up – said: ‘Well, if we do there’s only one queen I want to play him and it’s Antony Cotton.” Then he opened the card. He’d seen me in Queer as Folk.Daran Little (Coronation Street archivist, writer 1989-2006, 2009): I had written my university dissertation about Tony Warren and we soon became friends. He came to my wedding when I married a woman. I remember coming out to him 12 years later and he said: “Darling, I always knew.” When I started writing for the show he’d call me after every episode with a critique. I owe him everything. But in the 1980s, when the show was challenged for having no gay characters, Tony would say it was camp enough.Antony Cotton: I used to have lunch once a month with Tony at the Midland hotel and he’d tell me about these amazing women he’d written for and who they were based on. And there were the old battle axes he’d grown up with, but a lot of it was the men who’d been on the scene in the 50s and 60s.Daran Little: It took me two years to convince a largely straight, male writing team to bring in openly gay characters. I think it was just the fear of the unknown.Antony Cotton: When Sean burst on to the street there wasn’t a character like him. People said it was a stereotype, like John Inman in Are You Being Served?. But for me he wasn’t a stereotype – he was an archetype that a lot of people hadn’t seen.Noreen Kershaw (Tracy Spencer 1975 director 1996-2001): Tony and I used to speak on the phone every day. He’d tell me stories of how hard it was as a young gay man in Manchester in the early days, so I know that for him to be able to place characters like this into normal life on the show made him so proud.Meanwhile, in 2001, a homicidal businessman delivered Weatherfield’s next dose of stop-everything drama. Richard Hillman’s two-year reign of terror ended with the abduction of his wife Gail Platt (one of Platt’s six marriages on the Street) and her children in the family car. Almost 20 million people watched as Hillman drove into a canal in a murder-suicide attempt (the family escaped Hillman died).Brian Capron (Richard Hillman 2001-2003): Richard was always going to be a slightly pantomime character, but I had no idea how it was going to develop. It was absolutely wonderful but I felt an awful lot of pressure to keep delivering.Helen Worth: Brian was such a wonderful villain because part of you couldn’t help but love him. I remember the canal stunt because I couldn’t swim. I had to go into the water in this huge tank near Blackpool and swim out through the car window. The fear was all real, but I owed it to viewers. They’d have known if I’d been a stunt double in a wig.Coronation Street has been a breeding ground for stars (Sarah Lancashire, Patrick Stewart, Pete Postlethwaite and Anna Friel all appeared as young actors). It has also attracted high-profile fans. The poet laureate John Betjeman described the show as “the Pickwick Papers of television”. Established stars who have appeared include Honor Blackman and Joanna Lumley – and Prince Charles.In 2005, a nervous actor and superfan from Lancashire turned up to play a deceitful novelist.Sir Ian McKellen (Mel Hutchwright 2005): I remember one day walking down a corridor and Bill Roache was approaching me. Or was it Ken Barlow? They looked exactly the same. It was very odd but it was absolute bliss. It’s the early characters I remember the most. I have a picture of Violet Carson on my wall.Coronation Street had become a TV colossus. Black and white until 1969, it acquired a third weekly episode in 1989. Today a cast of more than 70 film six episodes a week on a vast set at MediaCity in Salford.Sally Ann Matthews: In the 80s we were all friends and had all the time in the world. Now there are characters you just never see if your days don’t coincide.William Roache: The fact there isn’t a tight community on the Street today reflects the fact you don’t get streets like that any more.Archie Street, which Warren had used as the visual inspiration for Coronation Street, was demolished in 1971 as part of the postwar urban clearances in Salford.From the very beginning, the class snobbery that Warren fought against in 1960 has hung over the mythical squares, closes and streets of Britain’s soaps.William Roache: That’s why I’ve always resented the word “soap”. It’s cutting-edge drama.Nigel Havers (Lewis Archer 2009-2019): Snobbery has always been there, but I think the key to Corrie’s magic is that it has irony and that great sense of humour. It’s never afraid to send itself up, but treats its audience as grownups. In my career, it’s right up there with Chariots of Fire and the National Theatre.As well as the constant struggle for ratings (the show still attracts more than 6 million viewers an episode), the need to remain cutting edge has confronted Coronation Street with new questions. While there have been black and Asian characters, Weatherfield only welcomed its first Muslim family – the Nazirs – in 2014. The Baileys, its first black family, arrived only last year.Sair Khan (Alya Nazir 2014-present): If we were on a real Coronation Street in Salford, maybe there’d be more Muslim families than white British families. I don’t know what the right answer is – it’s a constantly evolving show – but there’s a long way to go.Ryan Russell (Michael Bailey 2019-present): When I look back I could recognise a lot of black faces on EastEnders. It was a long time coming for Coronation Street, and as a family we’ve tried to do our best not just to be a black family for the sake of it.Khan: But I do feel like we have a voice and with that comes responsibility to ask difficult questions, especially in response to the Black Lives Matter movement. We had a conversation with producers about how we felt Coronation Street needs to keep up with inclusivity and representation in a meaningful way.Iain MacLeod  (researcher, writer 2006-2013 series producer 2018-present): It was a very frank debate, and has been a catalyst for meaningful and fairly sizeable shifts that will be coming soon. I sometimes get letters from people saying: “Everyone on my street is white – why can’t Coronation Street be white?” But I think we have a duty to almost over-represent so we reflect every corner of the British experience.Part of that experience has been dealing with the Covid pandemic. Last week, the MP Tracy Brabin, who played Tricia Armstrong on the Street in the 1990s, led an hour-long adjournment debate in tribute to Coronation Street and its impact – and the work to keep it on screen under social-distancing rules. “It is a real shame that at the end of this debate, we cannot have that haunting melody of Coronation Street playing,” the deputy speaker, Nigel Evans, said in his closing remarks.Sally Ann Matthews: This whole year has proved how important Coronation Street still is. I’m a huge telly addict and love to binge, but this year we’ve all been at home so much, with so much choice, and in such a stressful world it’s reassuring to turn on the TV and know that Corrie is still there.Iain MacLeod: We don’t have Netflix budgets and nor should we. We should carry on focusing on character and story and being relevant to what’s going on outside people’s front windows.Coronation Street celebrated its 50th anniversary in 2010 with a live episode featuring a devastating tram crash. The pandemic has forced a return to the show’s more modest origins, without parties or big stunts. Existing storylines will instead come to a head, including Yasmeen Metcalfe’s trial for attempted murder. Bill Roache will also star in tonight’s pre-recorded anniversary episode, which he plans to watch at home with his children.William Roache: When I look back at that first episode, it’s like watching home movies of your childhood. I was 28 when I started. Now I’m 88 and am in charge of this wonderful, dysfunctional family that I adore. Retirement isn’t something I think about. Older people may say the show is not what it was, but I’m a here-and-now person. Coronation Street has always had to grow and evolve and it always will. Those early days were wonderful, but in a way I’m happier now than I think I’ve ever been."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2d5dbd78e8848b6a4b1612df68883d5ae4f92430/318_467_1221_733/master/1221.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=8d5bde7fe397677c63bc7b66522b2dc2","title":"are you getting the pfizer coronavirus vaccine this week in the uk","story":"We’d like to speak to people who are due to be given the Pfizer coronavirus vaccine in the coming daysThe Pfizer coronavirus vaccine is due to be rolled out in the UK this week, with the first people to receive doses on Tuesday.

That is a rise from 156 cases per 100,000 the week before, with PHE noting the seven-day case rate for London increased over five consecutive days.In some parts of London, which is currently in tier 2, the latest figures show the rate was even higher, reaching 299 per 100,000 population in Barking and Dagenham and 319 in Havering, with a total of 20 of the 32 boroughs exceeding the average figure for England of 149 cases per 100,000.By contrast many areas already in tier 3 have lower rates, including the city of Bristol, where the rate is almost 141 per 100,000 population, and Coventry, where the rate is just over 134.“The latest data shows case rates are on the increase again in most London boroughs, including in the at-risk over 60s,” said Prof Kevin Fenton, the London regional director for Public Health England.“We’ll need to work together to prevent a big surge in cases in London ahead of the festive period so we must all do our bit and limit the spread over the coming days and weeks.”But Prof John Ashton, a former regional director of public health for north-west England and author of Blinded by Corona, stressed that urgent action was needed.Experts say the trend in cases chimes with rises in the positivity rate and recent increases hospital admissions in London.Mike Gill, former regional director of public health for the south-east region, said the situation looks “very grim”. “I think it would be quite wrong to imagine that we can relax at Christmas without doing anything extra between now and then,” he told the . A review of coronavirus restrictions across the country is due to be carried out on 16 December.Prof Gabriel Scally, visiting professor of public health at the University of Bristol and a member of Independent Sage, agreed restrictions could be tightened.But Scally added that with Christmas rapidly approaching, and the government committed to relaxing restrictions for the festivities, the situation could get worse with expectations of a high movement of people, as well as international arrivals, multigenerational mixing and indoor gatherings – all of which can increase transmission.“I wouldn’t be at all surprised if the next week or two leaves the government with a really difficult conundrum just days before Christmas,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9cbdef575791b22900a4c97a751d8af720d86f5c/0_0_3500_2102/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0cc9040581f5436344c229a2058e1d34","title":"students in the uk share your experiences of rapid testing coronavirus","story":"We’d like to hear from students or parents on the mass rapid testing schemes taking place in universities before ChristmasSome experts have called for an end to the use of rapid tests in universities, where they have been rolled out to test students before they return home for Christmas.

In an interview with the  she also accuses the company of institutional racism after managers failed to act even after various incidents were brought to their attention.Lopes Gomes, 29, said the dance teacher forced her to wear white makeup to “blend in” with other dancers in Swan Lake, and she had refused to give her a white veil for a performance of La Bayadére, telling her: “It’s because you’re black.” She said the teacher repeatedly told her her skin colour was not aesthetically acceptable and used her to recreate a painting of a black dancer surrounded by white dancers, telling her she would show her friends that the company “also has one of those”.She said that an atmosphere of fear at the company, which was typically found throughout the dance world, “meant that whilst my fellow dancers often felt uncomfortable at my treatment they were mostly too scared to speak up.”The scandal has triggered a large response across social media, attracting the support of Misty Copeland, American Ballet Theatre’s principal dancer, as well as dancers from Ballet Opera de Paris, English Ballet and the organisation Blacks in Ballet. Berlin’s ballet world was already reeling from the results of an investigation which confirmed physical and psychological abuse of pupils had carried on unchecked for years at the state ballet school.In a statement this week the Staatsballett’s interim artistic director, Christiane Theobald, said: “The racist and discriminatory behaviour that was brought to light in our company deeply moves us … The necessary skills and tools to deal with issues of discrimination need to be worked on thoroughly.”Lopes Gomes said she had felt pride when she joined the company in early 2018. “It was the fulfilment of a childhood dream,” she said. “I had not known I was the Staatsballett’s first black female dancer, until I was interviewed by some local journalists who told me.” The Berlin tabloid, BZ, ran its story under the headline Why This Swan is Something Special and marvelled that as a black dancer, she would now be “playing a snow flake” in The Nutcracker.“Of course, Berlin is not as ethnically erse as London or Paris,” Lopes Gomes said. “But I was happy that I had the chance to show other young black girls that they could do the same.”But she said joy quickly turned to anxiety when she was made to feel she did not fit in. “The day after my audition and the ballet mistress told a fellow dancer of mine she thought it had been a mistake to hire me because a black woman spoils the aesthetics. This same woman spent the next two years discriminating against me,” she said.“I was under her supervision most of the time so I could not avoid her. We began with Swan Lake. She was always correcting me, telling me I was out of line. But I know I was not. It’s not that I can’t take criticism, but we’re talking about the basics that you learn when you are three years old.”As the premiere neared, the dance teacher told Lopes Gomes she would have to whiten her skin.“She said to me everyone needs to powder their skin white to blend in. I told her I would never look white, I am black. She just told me I’d simply need to use more powder.”Lopes Gomes approached the company’s then co-artistic director, Johannes Öhman, who told her she should never have to whiten her skin. “The ballet mistress was annoyed that I had effectively undermined her authority,” she said. “She was angry and she became increasingly unpleasant towards me.”The teacher has refused to comment since allegations first appeared in Germany.Lopes Gomes, who trained at the Bolshoi Ballet Academy in Russia, said because she spoke no German and the teacher, a German, spoke no French or English, they initially communicated in Russian. “It meant that my colleagues often didn’t understand her throw-away remarks to me, like: ‘You’re not in line and we see that you stick out because you’re black’.“When she was handing out the Shades’ veils for La Bayadére, and reached me, she laughed, and in front of everyone said: ‘Of course I can’t give you one: the veil is white and you’re black’. I felt so humiliated,” Lopes Gomes said. has spoken to another dancer who witnessed the veil incident and has corroborated Lopes Gomes’ account.Lopes Gomes claimed that when she again approached Öhman, he told her she should not accept such behaviour towards her. “But he said there was little he could do as, as a civil servant, the teacher has a lifetime contract which effectively means she can never be fired.” Lopes Gomes said she turned down his offer to talk to the teacher “because I feared it would only exacerbate the situation”.When Öhman unexpectedly announced in January that he would be leaving the company Gomes said the treatment worsened.“On the very day he announced his departure, the ballet mistress told me that from now on I was going to have to use white powder whether I liked it or not. I knew I was on my own.“It was horrible. My skin was like this grey-green tone. I felt like the ugly duckling. It just amazed me they couldn’t accept the idea of there being a black swan,” she said.She had bumped into Theobald in a corridor while wearing the makeup. “She asked me why I had whitened my skin, that I was not supposed to. But nothing happened.”Lopes Gomes said the company has no safe way for dancers to report discrimination or maltreatment and that dancers lived in fear of being dismissed if they complained. “They show little sense of responsibility towards their dancers,” she said.She also said she had been appalled to discover on joining, that the practice of blackfacing dancers was considered normal, after she saw young white children applied with black makeup for a production of The Nutcracker.Lopes Gomes said she was told in October by Theobald that the company would not be renewing her contract. “They said because of the Covid pandemic they were letting some dancers go and that they thought I would be better off in a smaller company,” she said. “She insisted to me that race was not the reason they were firing me, as well as admitting that it was awful what had happened to me.”She was however subsequently cast in Covid-adapted productions of Giselle and Swan Lake, for which the number of dancers was cut by half. “Instead of 24 dancers, they chose 12. If I was so substandard, why would they have chosen me?” she asked.Theobald has said she only became aware of Lopes Gomes’ treatment after she wrote a letter to the Staatsballett management in September, signed by several of her fellow dancers, detailing the racist incidents. She said she was “deeply shocked” at the revelations.Her statement said the Staatsballett planned a series of workshops for its employees, as well as a restructuring of the company and a review of its longstanding repertory customs.A Staatsballett spokeswoman said that she was not able to comment on personnel issues, but confirmed that the company was now undergoing an “extensive process of reappraisal”. It would not comment on whether it would consider rehiring Lopes Gomes, or dismissing the ballet teacher if the allegations were legally proven.Berlin’s minister for culture, Klaus Lederer, has said he is “appalled” by the accusations but a spokesman said while he was fully aware of the affair, he was “not able to interfere in a matter concerning labour law”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5f319752b87ddcaebd7c59d5289363a0c5ee1aea/0_164_3128_1878/master/3128.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2ec5ceccf80bd539cda1bba85b30b319","title":"im often faster milans bicycling bookseller takes on the online giants","story":"Luca Santini took his fight against Amazon and others to the streets after having to close his bookshopLuca Ambrogio Santini is considered to be something of a knight-errant as he cycles around parts of Milan on his red cargo bike delivering books to people’s homes, so much so he is affectionately called the “Don Quixote of booksellers”.“Quixote went to fight against the windmills,” Santini said of the protagonist in the classic novel by Miguel de Cervantes. “My windmills are the online retailers from those monster multinationals … which for us independent booksellers are unnameable.”The former bookstore owner sighs before uttering a name: “Obviously, Amazon … I practically do what they do, and often I’m faster than them.”Santini has been waging his battle against the online giants since 2015, when he became the first bookseller in Italy to start home deliveries.Called LibriSottoCasa (books on the doorstep), Santini fits his wares into a 2-sq-metre box on the front of his bike before delivering them to customers in the southern districts of Milan. Until the coronavirus pandemic struck, he participated in book fairs and other events. Now with those events cancelled, he is surviving solely on home deliveries. But the pandemic has proved to be a bit of a boon, as people spending more time at home rediscover the joy of books.“Some customers have counted how many books they’ve read since March, and the numbers are significant,” Santini said.For 20 years, Santini owned a bookshop in Milan’s Largo Mahler, opposite the auditorium that houses the Giuseppe Verdi Symphony Orchestra, which made the store particularly popular among those seeking specialist music books. But he was forced to close in 2013 after the business became financially unviable.“It was a great experience and had done well,” said Santini. “But things became more difficult with the arrival of online competition, the general decline in reading books and the financial crisis in 2008. I tried and tried, and people in the neighbourhood also organised initiatives to support the shop, but we had to close.”As he pondered what to do next, Santini discovered he could apply for a licence to operate as a travelling salesperson. And so he became the first to apply for one for the sale of books.“I have always cycled around the city and so decided to try it out,” he said.People can order through Santini’s Facebook page or by sending him a message on WhatsApp. They can pay online or in in cash.His is also among around 2,000 other booksellers across Italy who recently united in their goal to challenge Amazon by setting up their own online platform, called Bookdealer.The venture is the first of its kind in Italy and allows people to search for books and to locate the nearest bookshop to them, as well as take virtual tours of shops, before purchasing online for home delivery. The initiative is particularly useful for people in towns where bookshops have closed, as they can discover stores that are further away. Customers can also seek the kind of advice they would ordinarily get from an independent bookseller.They have a long way to go before the battle can be declared won, but Santini believes it is this personal element that sets them apart from the giants.“Bookdealer started at the end of August and many people are turning to this option,” said Santini. “They might not get a discount like they would on Amazon but they do get a well-curated service, professionalism and the chance to speak to a book expert.”That people are using the service is a positive sign, especially after data released at the beginning of the year showed that 2,300 bookshops had closed in the previous five years. At the time, Paolo Ambrosini, the president of the Italian Booksellers Association, criticised the government for not doing enough to support the sector in the face of online competition.Santini said the pandemic has helped in the sense that people have realised more the importance of independent local businesses.“There is a specific solidarity that is being shown,” he added. ”The situation is still not easy for many but the personal connection has helped people feel united with us.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4409770.1605434900!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"400 yes 400 irish retailers for all your online christmas shopping","story":"A number of Irish independent retailers describe how lockdowns and Covid restrictions have impacted their businesses - and what they’ve had to do to adapt. \t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tIrish retailers are facing a tough Christmas with new Covid-19 restrictions closing non-essential outletsWe have been overwhelmed, in the best possible way, by the response to our original list, a few weeks ago, of 100 Irish websites where you can buy lovely, unique and good-value presents in the run-up to Christmas.Almost as soon as it appeared, business owners and many of their customers emailed us, tweeted us, sent us Instagram messages and contacted us on Facebook to champion more Irish companies doing the business online.That response matters, because we all know that the run-up to Christmas,\u0026nbspwith so many physical shops in lockdown,\u0026nbspis going to be incredibly hard for many businesses.

Tánaiste Leo Varadkar has described the provision of the first vaccinations outside of trials in the UK as ‘a day of hope’ in the battle against the disease. Photograph:  Hugh HastingsGetty Images.Increased Covid-19 infections will be an “inevitable” consequence of people mixing more over Christmas but case numbers alone will not dictate if the State needs a further period of severe restrictions in January, the Tánaiste has said. Leo Varadkar said a rise in cases after Thanksgiving gatherings in the US and Canada gave some indication of the impact the festive period might have on the spread of the disease in Ireland. “I think it is likely that we will see an increase in cases,” he said. “That is inevitable when people are mixing again. This isn’t just about foreign travel , it is about people mixing again over Christmas.”Referring to the “Thanksgiving effect” in the US and Canada, the Fine Gael leader said “it is likely that cases will rise again” in Ireland in January. “We’ve never ruled out the possibility that we would need to reintroduce restrictions for a short period in January,” he told RTÉ’s Morning Ireland. But Mr Varadkar said the need for or severity of any such restrictions would be decided at the time based on the rate of transmission and pressures on the health services and that people should not concentrate too much on the daily case numbers. Projections from the National Public Health Emergency Team (Nphet) suggest that if the R number, which estimates how fast the disease is spreading, grows to 2.0 from December 22nd to January 6th, between 300 and 450 cases per day could be seen by New Year’s Day, and 800 to 1,200 per day by the second week of January.An increase of this sort would see the State above the point at which Nphet estimates that a three-week intervention would be required to bring cases back under control.‘End of the pandemic’The Tánaiste described the provision of the first vaccinations outside of trials in the North and Britain on Tuesday as “a day of hope”. “I think with the vaccine, with mass testing, with increased knowledge of how we treat and prevent this disease, we will see the end of the pandemic in 2021.”Ireland has made advance purchase agreements for six different vaccines, amounting to 8 million doses. On Friday, a Government taskforce charged with overseeing a mass vaccination plan for the State will present its action plan, which will go before the Cabinet next Tuesday for approval. Mr Varadkar told RTÉ’s Morning Ireland that “no one knows exactly” what percentage of the population would need to receive a jab to reach herd immunity - enough people immunised to prevent further spread. “The intention is to vaccinate everyone, to offer it to everyone, free of charge, not compulsory,” he said. “The best estimate is probably around 70 per cent (of the population vaccinated) is what you would need to achieve herd immunity.”Mr Varadkar said there will be a “very strong campaign” to encourage people to get vaccinated, but he warned against any attempts to “browbeat or patronise” people into it, saying it was better to reassure them that vaccines are safe and effective. This year has given people a taste of what the world was like before vaccines, he said, describing it as “medieval”.

Photograph: Getty imagesIt is hard to see how public health officials will not seek a third lockdown in January given their extremely gloomy forecasts of recent days.Chief medical officer Dr Tony Holohan, both in his letter to Government last week and his comments at the National Public Health Emergency Team (Nphet) briefing on Monday, clearly foresees daily case numbers after Christmas reaching the kind of level that twice previously triggered recommendations for swingeing restrictions.The euphoria surrounding the rollout of a Covid-19 vaccine in Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK is understandable. But for now, and many months to come, restrictions are the only way Government knows to rein in surging case numbers, when other public health measures have failed.In his letter Dr Holohan set out an ominous picture case numbers did not fall far enough after the last lockdown, they are already rising again, and Christmas is approaching with all the potentially risky socialising that entails.As a result Nphet is already revising its modelling forecast upwards. Previously it had forecast up to 1,200 cases a day by mid-January now Dr Holohan is predicting this will be a reality by the second week of the month.That might not seem like a big difference but it is when you are dealing with exponential growth, as seems likely next month.That our figures have already “bottomed out”, as the chief medical officer said, is evident in the ergent trends over 14 days and seven days.Ireland has the lowest 14-day incidence of the virus in Europe, and this rate has dropped 25 per cent over the previous 14 days.In contrast, the measure of trends over the past seven days is up 11 per cent compared to the previous seven days, and Ireland suddenly has the fifth fastest rising seven-day incidence in the EU.The heavy messaging of public health officials against socialising over the coming weeks may dampen festivities somewhat and curb the spread of the virus, but only to a limited extent given the high starting point after Level 5 restrictions. High figuresOur big problem is an amalgam of smaller problems which are not difficult to discern. First, the Border the incidence of the virus in Donegal is 2.5 times the rest of the country, and is rising again more quickly than elsewhere. Louth also has high figures.This is hardly surprising given that Northern Ireland has four times the number of cases as the Republic. The virus continues to spill over from the North, seriously damaging the Republic’s chance of reining it in. We also have a hospital problem. The two counties with the highest incidence at present are Donegal and Kilkenny, where large outbreaks in local hospitals are filling wards and causing deaths.Across the country hospital outbreaks accounted for 46 deaths out of the 140 that occurred last month, more even than the 41 recorded in nursing homes.According to Dr Holohan’s letter, there were 60 hospital clusters last month in 24 locations, involving 1,000 cases. This is why serial testing of healthcare workers is being introduced in January, making Ireland the first country in the world to undertake such a measure. Though why wait until January?The high incidence of cases among over-65s is also a problem, though continuing outbreaks in nursing homes may largely account for this.Both the hospital and nursing home outbreaks are being brought under control, and another positive sign is the continuing low number of cases in schools (a trends seen in the UK and other countries).Even so, as Dr Holohan says, a surge in January is now “more likely than not”.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4431794.1607520749!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"brexit could see 40 price hikes for online purchases","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tResearch shows that while numbers shopping online from the UK are falling, only 1 in 10 consumers plan to pay more attention to where a website is based after Brexit. Photograph: iStockThe price of some goods bought by people in Ireland from UK-based websites could increase by over 40 per cent from January 1st after post-Brexit taxes and charges are added to the list price, Revenue has warned. Consumers will not only face substantial price increases when shopping with UK-based companies but they could also see a substantial reduction in the rights they have when it comes to returns or seeking redress in the event that products are faulty on not as described, the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission (CCPC) has said. However in spite of the significant changes coming down the tracks, research published on Wednesday from the CCPC points to an alarmingly high percentage of Irish consumers who do not realise shopping on websites in countries outside the EU – which will soon include the UK – can lead to additional taxes and charges and a substantial reduction in rights if things go wrong. The study shows that only 15 per cent of consumers are aware that buying from non-EU websites may attract higher taxes and charges and it comes as both the CCPC and the Revenue Commissioners have urged online shoppers to be mindful of the impact of Brexit on purchases they make from UK websites from January 1st. Additional taxesAs it stands, the UK is effectively part of the EU and as a result Irish consumers do not have to pay any additional taxes or VAT when shopping on websites based there. People also have significant protections when it comes to returns and redress if products are faulty or not as described which are enshrined in EU law. However, all that is likely to change dramatically and quickly from the start of next year. At a briefing aimed at raising awareness of the impact of Brexit on consumers, Ray Ryan from Revenue’s Customs Division outlined three charging scenarios that online shoppers should consider when buying from a UK website from January 1st.He said that online shoppers will not face additional import charges when buying something for €22 or less including shipping, delivery, insurance and handling charges but if the value of the goods goes above that, then VAT will be payable.He also said that consumers would have to pay customs duty and VAT if the value of the goods was more than €150 (excluding shipping, delivery, insurance and handling charges). Mr Ryan also explained that there are two models in place that cover payment of customs duty and VAT. “If the total price paid for the good or goods at time of purchase includes any customs duty and VAT due, no further import charges will arise on delivery,” he said. “If this is not the case however, the carrier or postal service delivering goods bought online from outside the EU will complete the relevant custom formalities and the amount of VAT and duties will be calculated by Customs based on the information provided. The purchaser must pay these charges to the carrier or postal service before the goods are delivered.”Other taxesHe said clothes bought on a UK-based website for €167 would end up costing €236.32 once the VAT and other taxes were added to the price. Consumers here would be liable to pay that with the additional charges collected by the delivery companies who will be allowed to withhold delivery until payments are made.CCPC spokeswoman Doireann Sweeney added that consumers’ existing EU rights would no longer automatically apply when buying from a UK website post Brexit and she highlighted the need to to check where traders were located.“EU Consumer Protection law gives Irish consumers the right to change their mind after they receive their purchases and other strong protections when buying online. At this point in time, these rights are also reflected in UK law, however from January consumers may find it difficult to enforce these rights in disputes with UK retailers,” she warned. She said the CCPC research pointed to a need for consumers to check out the terms and conditions on the website they are buying from.“Our research shows that while numbers shopping online from the UK are falling, only 1 in 10 consumers plan to pay more attention to where a website is based after Brexit.”She stressed that she was not encouraging people not to shop from UK based websites but to be aware of the consequences of their decisions and the impact they might have on their rights. Mr Ryan said Revenue had no estimates as to how much additional tax would be raised next year as a result of people shopping from UK websites but 100,000 parcels delivered from countries outside of the EU last year generated about €7million for the exchequer.

Photograph: Leon NealGetty ImagesA trusted trader scheme has been agreed for Northern Ireland with the aim of easing food imports after January 1st and offering a grace period for the implementation of some Brexit-related checks on goods, The  understands.If no deal can be reached on a free trade agreement between the EU and the UK, supermarkets in the North had feared they would have to pay tariffs up front on imports from Britain, only to claim the cost back later in rebates. There were concerns the sheer paperwork would drive up costs of basic goods in the North and make some imports from Britain unfeasible.Under the new scheme, importers deemed trusted traders will be able to skip the procedure, with goods expected to carry a label stating they are for sale only in Northern Ireland.The scheme is expected to cover the vast majority of imports on goods intended for the Northern Irish market from Britain, with the rest able to claim back tariffs under the original system.There will be a sunset clause of 3½ years on the arrangement, meaning the EU could pull the plug if they believe it is leading to smuggling into the single market. This review by the joint UK-EU committee on the protocol would happen just before the Northern Ireland Assembly would be due to have a vote on whether to continue the protocol arrangements.In addition, there will be a grace period of implementation of export health certificates on agrifood products brought into the North from Britain, a costly procedure also feared to have implications on the viability of food imports across the Irish Sea as it would require inidual inspections for goods such as ham sandwiches.Under EU rules, there is no provision for the import of high-risk goods such as fresh, unfrozen meat or ready meals into the single market from outside the EU, potentially barring imports into the North from Britain.On this issue, there will also be a grace period of implementation to allow supermarkets to adjust supply chains to source such goods elsewhere.The text outlining the details has yet to be publicly released, but some aspects have emerged from internal briefings by the co-chairs of the joint committee charged with implementing the agreement, the European Commission’s Maros Sefcovic and British cabinet minister Michael Gove.Mr Gove said on Wednesday the deal struck with the European Commission on the implementation of the withdrawal agreement “puts the people of Northern Ireland first”.Mr Gove said there would be no additional requirements placed on Northern Ireland businesses.He told the House of Commons: “This deal protects unfettered access for Northern Ireland businesses to their most important market as the prime minister underlined.“This had to be protected in full and that meant removing any prospect of export declarations for Northern Ireland goods moving from Northern Ireland to Great Britain.“As for what our agreement will do, there will be no additional requirements placed on Northern Ireland businesses with a very limited and specific exception of trade in endangered species and conflict diamonds.”He said that businesses in Northern Ireland would be free of all tariffs on imports from Britain.He told MPs: “The deal safeguards Northern Ireland’s place in the UK customs territory. As recently as July, the commission had envisaged a default tariff scenario in which, and I quote, ‘all goods brought into Northern Ireland would be considered to be at risk are as such subject to the common customs tariff’.“If that had been implemented, that would have raised the prospect of a 58 per cent tariff on a pint of milk going from Scotland to a supermarket in Strabane or 96 per cent on a bag of sugar going from Liverpool to the shops of Belfast.“As we’ve repeatedly made clear, this could never have been an acceptable outcome. So, I’m pleased to say that under the agreement that we’ve reached, Northern Ireland businesses selling to consumers or using goods in Northern Ireland will be free of all tariffs.“Whether that’s Nissan cars from Sunderland or lamb from Montgomeryshire, internal UK trade will be protected as we promised whether we have a free trade agreement with the EU or not.”The British government and European Commission reached the agreement this week on how to practically implement arrangements for Northern Ireland agreed last year, allowing Downing Street to scrap plans for contentious laws overriding the withdrawal agreement.There will be an estimated 15 EU officials based in Northern Ireland to ensure the protocol is enforced, and controls can take place without prior notification, at any time, according to an internal EU briefing.The British side has not agreed to a permanent EU headquarters for them to work from – a politically contentious issue – but there are expected to be workarounds such as the use of offices in another building.EU institutions will have remote access to UK databases, allowing them to monitor customs procedures from afar, and share this data with member states to ensure trust that the defacto Irish Sea border of the single market is being effectively controlled.Border checks on goods from Britain entering Northern Ireland will take place at four border control posts, understood to be Port of Larne, Foyle port, Belfast harbour and Warrenpoint port.Two of them are yet to be completed but will operate as temporary structures, and will inspected by the European Commission. The British government has set out a construction schedule for their completion. – Additional reporting: PADeal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

File photograph: Dara Mac DónaillThe . The Iveagh Market in Dublin’s south inner city was repossessed by Lord Iveagh on Tuesday, Dublin City Council has said. The council was notified by representatives for Lord Iveagh, a member of the Guinness family, that he had invoked the “reverter” clause contained in the original Deed of Conveyance dated July 1906. “The council was informed that as the Iveagh Market building has ceased to be used as a market for a considerable number of years, Lord Iveagh has, in accordance with the terms contained in the Deed of Conveyance, repossessed the property this morning and notified the Council accordingly,” a spokesman for the council said. “The council is considering the matter with its legal advisors.”The market, which was built in the early 20th century by the Guinness family, has been derelict for more than 20 years and the subject of a legal battle between the council and businessman and hotelier Martin Keane. Food hallAn application from Mr Keane to redevelop the site in the Liberties was declared invalid by the council last January. He lodged an application to turn the Edwardian building on Francis Street into a European-style food hall, restaurants, a distillery, a brewery and crafts workshops in December 2019. In a report to councillors in January, the council’s head of planning Richard Shakespeare said the council was not satisfied Mr Keane had “secured the appropriate funding” for the project, and his application had been lodged “without the council’s consent as landowner”.Mr Keane “claims to hold the freehold interest in the property which is untrue in relation to the Iveagh Markets element of the application”, Mr Shakespeare said.The council had advised Mr Keane it is “terminating all communication with him, and that it is taking the necessary steps to repossess the property from him”. The council “will defend this action in the courts if necessary”, said Mr Shakespeare.Displaced tradersThe market was built to house street traders who had been displaced by the construction of the nearby Iveagh Trust housing development on Patrick Street, and was handed over in trust to Dublin Corporation.By the 1980s the building had become very run down, and it eventually closed in the 1990s. In 1996, the council announced it was seeking a private developer to regenerate the market. The following year Mr Keane secured the tender, with an agreement that the title of the market would transfer to him once the redevelopment was completed.However, the development became mired in an ownership row between the corporation and the Guinness family-controlled Iveagh Trust. In 2012, he secured a five-year extension of planning permission, which expired in 2017. That year the council voted to take back control of the market from Mr Keane.The council subsequently commissioned a report on the condition of the building from conservation architects Howley Hayes, which found that “essential structural repairs” alone would cost €13 million.Mr Shakespeare last year told councillors the council did not have the money and the “most efficient way” forward for the market would be for Mr Keane to redevelop it.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"shared","story":"A new  series on the future of the island of Ireland begins todayFormer Fine Gael leader Enda Kenny eased the path for North\u0026rsquos re-entry into bloc in 2017Conversation about a shared island must have boundaries, many unionists argueStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4431817.1607523994!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"relax advice on christmas travel says oireachtas transport committee","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tCrowe said a bilateral deal on a traffic light system with the United States should also be struck. Photograph: iStockMembers of the Oireachtas transport committee have called for the relaxation of advice on non-essential travel around Christmas in order to support the aviation sector.On Wednesday, the committee launched a report calling for an increased role for testing to allow for greater resumption of travel, including closer examination of cheaper antigen – or saliva – tests in airports.“This essential travel totally cripples our tourism sector, our travel agents who have been here also giving testimony, and it ensures that aviation stays on lockdown, shut down for many months to come.”Mr Crowe said a bilateral deal on a traffic light system with the United States should also be struck, perhaps as soon as by Christmas.Sinn Féin transport spokesman Darren O’Rourke said getting testing and tracing right at airports would be a key part of relaxing restrictions. “And if we achieve that, I think there is real opportunity to expand the scale of foreign travel and reconsider the public health advice,” he said.Committee chair Kieran O’Donnell said that the committee believes that more travel can be facilitated by improving pre-flight testing. The report published by the committee today recommends that pre-departure antigen testing for passengers from orange and red countries be made mandatory, and that such a test would allow them to avoid the need to restrict their movements on arrival.“We believe that what we’re putting forward is safe. It provides a situation whereby people on an aeroplane will know all the other passengers are testing negative.”‘Liberalising restrictions’Fianna Fáil Senator Timmy Dooley said that the committee feels “justified” in advancing the case that Government “move towards a position of liberalising the restrictions as soon as possible with appropriate controls and appropriate level of testing”.We think it’s appropriate to begin the process of opening up the aviation sector and opening up the movement of people in and out of the country,” he said, which would be better than the current “closed door approach”.The report published today by the committee recommended the State subsidise the cost of more-expensive PCR tests so passengers do not have to pay more than €50 each, and argued for the acceleration of studies on the use of antigen – or saliva – testing at airports. It also recommended that the travel industry be represented on the HSE’s working group on antigen testing.Research into effectiveness of antigen testing by the Health Information and Quality Authority (HIQA) has found that the rapid tests currently available are not suitable for screening asymptomatic groups of people with unknown levels of disease. Further research is under way by the HSE.The committee’s report also called for more supports for the aviation sector, including the extension of wage subsidies throughout next year, and asked that the Government seek a derogation on strict State aid rules so it can provide emergency funding to Irish airports.It said arrivals from orange and red countries should both be allowed avoid restricting their movement if they could present evidence of a negative Covid test within three days of arrival, and said a traffic light system for travel should be developed with countries outside the EU. It called for the re-establishment of a state airport authority, encompassing Dublin, Shannon and Cork airports along the same model as the CIE.When he appeared before the committee in November, Chief Medical Officer Dr Tony Holohan said there is a “substantial risk” associated with international travel, and that even if testing of passengers were introduced with a five-to-seven day period of restricted movement and a symptom check on day five, up to 15 per cent of imported cases would still be missed.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4431795.1607521328!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"taoiseach tells tds to report claims of student nurse exploitation to hse","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tTaoiseach Micheál Martin has told Opposition TDs to  make formal complaints to the HSE about  cases where student nurses are allegedly being exploited.  Photograph: Laura HuttonThe .The Minister for Health is investigating claims that student nurses and midwives are being asked to work when they should not be in cases that Taoiseach Micheál Martin described as a “scandal”.Mr Martin said Sinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald, People Before Profit TD Richard Boyd Barrett and others should make formal complaints to the HSE about any such cases as they represent an “abuse” and “exploitation” of student nurses.He also defended the restoration of pay and pension cuts to ministers and judges and former taoisigh and said the Government had delayed them for as long as legally possible.Mr Martin rejected Ms McDonald’s claims that the Government was looking after the “great and the good” in the restoration announced on Tuesday of the final 2 per cent that was cut during the financial crisis. She said these would benefit “already well paid Super Junior Ministers” judges and former taoisigh.“There’s no complexity, no review on that front. It is always straightforward to cough up for those at the top,” she said, adding that the Government was refusing to pay student nurses.However, Mr Martin said it suited Ms McDonald to “distort the truth” about the reversal of the cuts to pay and pensions during the recession. He said they could not discriminate between one group and another and she knew that.“What you can do is delay as far as legally possible which is what the government has done.” He said legislation was passed in 2017 to reverse the financial emergency cuts and this had to be done by the end of this year.The row erupted in the Dáil in the ongoing controversy about pay for student nurses and midwives after TDs outlined testimonies of students working for no pay. The Government has rejected an Opposition motion to pay students nurses and midwives. Mr Martin said that first, second and third year students received an allowance while fourth years were paid for 36 weeks of their final year.A review is underway of allowances for all student nurses and for the payment of final year students and the Taoiseach said he was certain the allowances would increase when the review is completed by the end of the year.Menial tasksMr Martin said the whole idea of the introduction of the degree programme for nurses almost 20 years ago was to end the era of nurses doing “menial tasks” and to professionalise nursing.He added that first and second year students were never meant to be working during six week clinical placements.Mr Martin said Minister for Health Stephen Donnelly was investigating this because nursing directors rejected claims that this was happening.However, Mr Boyd Barrett highlighted the case of one first year student who said they were washing, feeding, lifting and dressing Covid-19 patients unsupervised. He said he had dozens of testimonies of students and he called on the Taoiseach to meet student nurses as he too hit out at the restoration of payments to Ministers, judges and former taoisigh. He also insisted that the Government should restore the health care assistant rate they gave to nursing students during the first wave of the Covid-19 pandemic.Mr Martin said that first, second and third year students should not be doing the work Mr Boyd Barrett mentioned. “They should be protected,” he said. The Taoiseach said that the case of the first year student Mr Boyd Barrett mentioned was a “scandal”. “That is wrong and that should be investigated,” he said. “I’m amazed that you think it’s okay, that they should be paid. My view is that they should never have been asked to do that in the first instance and I want that investigated. I want you to give me that case because we need to get to the bottom of that.”"},{"url":null,"title":"matt cartoons december 2020","story":"Sign up for our exclusive, subscriber-only Matt newsletter - and get an unseen Matt  each week. www.telegraphmatt-nlTo order The 2020 limited-edition Matt Christmas jigsaw, go to telegraphcartoonjigsawsOrder The Best of Matt 2019 by visiting books.telegraph or call 0844 871 1514. To order a fine art print, signed or unsigned of this, or any Matt cartoon, go to https:telegraph.newsprints or call 0191 603 0178Brexit latest news: Boris Johnson says there is \u0026#39a good deal to be done\u0026#39 ahead of Brussels dinnerCoronavirus latest news: Two NHS workers suffer allergic reaction to Pfizer vaccineScotland lockdown: what are the new Covid rules and Tier 4 restrictions?Leaders of Catalan Gypsy organisation resign en masse after publishing article discriminating against other Roma groupsThe priority list for the Pfizer vaccine - and how it will be rolled outUK signs trade deal with Canada which rolls over terms of agreement with EUComment: Labour should fight for the Union – not pave the way for a second Scottish referendumIslamic State used UK-based companies to buy weapons parts, says new reportPornhub forced into regulations climbdown after outcryBeyond Brexit: Why you need to think about your money differently from January 1Brexit Day 2020: When is the UK due to leave the EU and how will it happen?Venetians furious over failure to activate Moses barrier and protect city from flooding Zara Tindall pregnant with third child, husband Mike revealsComment: Public support for Boris Johnson will be shattered if he capitulates on sovereignty in EU talks How the UK will get Pfizer\u0026#39s Covid vaccine from factory to patientThe hospitals that will have the Covid-19 vaccine, and how it will be rolled outWhat exactly is the Pfizer vaccine, who will get it, and is it safe?Covid-19 vaccine: Latest updates on Oxford, Moderna and Pfizer breakthroughs - and who will get it first?Brexit deal: what has been agreed, and what happens next?Hanukkah 2020: how the \u0026#39miracle of the oil\u0026#39 sparked the Jewish Festival of LightsBack to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"beyond brexit need think money differently january 1","story":"The Brexit transition period comes to an end on December 31 2020 – and from the start of next year you will need to think about your money differently. In the third of our four-part series exploring what the post-Brexit era will mean for us, The ’s Personal Finance Reporter, Marianna Hunt, warns what to look out for.Brexit, coupled with the Covid pandemic, could lead to a period of uncertainty at the start of next year so it pays off to hope for the best and plan for the worst.Low interest rates could be cut further and continued uncertainty over the strength of the pound will affect any investments abroad.Household bills could go up too - but pensions should be safe, whether you retire in the UK or in a country in the European Union.For a full explainer of everything you need to know regarding personal finance in 2021, watch the video above. To watch more videos from The , subscribe to our YouTube channel.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"number children experiencing destitution 50pc two years","story":"The number of children experiencing destitution has increased by more than 50 per cent in two years, a charity has revealed. The Joseph Rowntree Foundation (JRF) published a study showing that in total, about 2.4 million people experienced extreme hardship in 2019. This marked an appalling rise of 54 per cent since 2017.The number includes 550,000 children, a 52 per cent increase in the two years to 2019, the analysis found.The JRF, a social change organisation working to solve UK poverty, defines destitution as being when a household cannot afford two or more essentials such as shelter, food, heating and clothing.Helen Barnard, JRF director, said: It is appalling that so many people are going through this distressing and degrading experience, and we should not tolerate it.No-one in our society should be unable to afford to eat or keep clean and sheltered. We can and must do more.The pandemic has shown just how much we want to look out for each other in difficult times, but the sobering truth is that even before Covid-19 hit, the number of people in destitution was rising sharply.”The way in which Universal Credit (UC) is delivered was identified as one of the key drivers of the situation along with inadequate benefits.The JRF expressed concern about the impact of the coronavirus outbreak on people with little money, and called on the Government to retain the £20-a-week boost to UC introduced during the Covid-19 pandemic and not carry out plans to stop the extra payments next April.Under current plans, there will be cuts to UC, which will take £20 a week from six million families.The JRF said: With evidence of rising debt and hardship since Covid-19 hit, there are fears that the pandemic may have pushed people experiencing destitution closer to the brink.The JRF is calling for urgent action to make the £20-per-week uplift to Universal Credit permanent, to stem the rising tide of destitution.Half of people experiencing destitution were claiming or had applied for UC when the survey was carried out.”One in seven (14 per cent) people experiencing destitution are in paid work. The charity added that destitution is becoming more concentrated in northern regions.Imran Hussain, director of policy and campaigns at Action for Children, described the report as “shocking”, adding: “This isn’t about a few families falling through cracks in the system, this is about a system that is failing the most vulnerable on a grand scale.“These are the very poorest families, lacking the essentials we all need to live – shelter, food, heating and clothing... We must prevent a generation of children from being scarred by poverty and the pandemic. “We’ll be there to support them this winter, but the Government must put a protective shield around our most vulnerable families and pull back from their planned cuts to Universal Credit which would see families lose out on £1,000 a year.”A total of 3,914 people from 113 crisis services in 18 locations across the UK in 2019 responded, prior to the pandemic. Secondary analysis of over 40 quantitative datasets enabled the scaling up of statistical findings from these locations to national level. In-depth interviews with a further 70 people who were identified as destitute also took place in spring 2020 after Covid-19 hit.  A Government spokesperson said: “Making sure every child gets the best start in life is central to our efforts to level up opportunity across the country, which is why we have raised the living wage for all and boosted welfare support by billions, including £170 million to help families stay warm and well-fed over Christmas.”More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"people should have chance buy vaccine","story":"The development of effective vaccines against Covid-19 in less than a year has been a triumph for the pharmaceutical industry, whose research scientists have worked round the clock to achieve such remarkable results. And the UK Government’s decision to place great faith in these efforts by pre-ordering large quantities of the PfizerBioNTech vaccine in particular while it was still under development has proved to be its best decision in this epidemic, with the early approval of the Pfizer jab making Britain the first country in the world to start vaccinating.As the Government has admitted, however, a huge challenge lies ahead: to ensure the vaccine is administered successfully to many millions of people, so that normal life can resume as soon as possible. Expectations of a rapid roll-out are already being downplayed, and not merely because only one vaccine has thus far been approved. There is plenty for the state still to get wrong.Remember the “world beating” track and trace app? Instead of adopting an app developed by tech experts in the private sector, the Department of Health was determined to invent its own, spending billions in the process. After stumbling around in those crucial weeks after the national spring lockdown, it was forced to discard the first version, finally launching another at the point when cases were too widespread for the app to make a significant difference.Kate Bingham, head of the UK’s Vaccine Taskforce, suggested this week that one of the reasons why Britain has got ahead with its vaccine programme is the fact that, this time, it has not been left to the civil service. “It’s been uncomfortable, but bringing private sector experts into government to get the job done quickly has worked well,” she said. Rather pointedly, Bingham alluded to the lack of people working in the civil service with any scientific knowledge or industrial experience.If we want to make sure that everyone who wants the vaccine has access to it, does it really make sense now to give the NHS a monopoly over its use? Only last week the Doctors’ Association GPs’ committee threatened that surgeries may refuse to administer Covid jabs, demanding higher upfront fees from the Government and claiming that it cannot be managed at the same time as meeting patients’ existing needs. How much time will ministers waste bargaining with reluctant GPs while doses of the vaccine sit unused? Demand for jabs will be huge and yet we know from bitter experience that the only way the NHS can respond to patient demand is by rationing its services. Lack of capacity has been the bane of our healthcare system since its inception, leading to long waiting lists, cancelled operations, and high rates of hospital acquired infections. The pandemic has brought home to everyone the tragic drawbacks of rationed healthcare: closing down the economy, unprecedented restrictions on personal freedom, lives lost due to lack of cancer treatment – all to “protect our NHS”.Do we really want to ration the delivery of Covid vaccinations by moving at the pace dictated by our nationalised health service? Can the Government justify the continued destruction of jobs, businesses and lives which such delays would entail?The best way to ensure that the vaccination programme does not descend into chaos would be to give the private sector a role in its delivery. As soon as plentiful supplies of the vaccine are assured and the needs of the most vulnerable have been met, private healthcare providers should be given the option of administering the jabs to everyone wanting to purchase one. Businesses capable of running vaccine programmes, such as those which already offer their employees annual flu jabs, should be given the chance to vaccinate their employees at work.The response of business to Covid testing has shown there will be no shortage of companies rising to the challenge. In August, long before the Government introduced mass testing, defence giant BAE Systems offered regular Covid testing for 2,500 employees at its Barrow shipyard. During the autumn, independent schools have been implementing private testing in order to minimise disruption to their pupils’ education. Across the country, private health providers have been meeting huge demand for their testing services there is no reason to suppose that they will be unable to respond just as well to demand for private vaccinations.By seizing the initiative on vaccine development, big pharmaceutical companies stand to make dazzling profits while also helping to save the world. The profit motive should equally be harnessed to ensure that their vaccines have the widest possible reach in the shortest possible time. Let’s not waste the next six months in finding out whether or not the NHS can cope our lives have been on hold for long enough.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"singapores cruise to nowhere turns back covid 19 case aboard","story":"A tentative return to cruising in Asia had to be aborted early on Wednesday after a passenger on board was found to be positive for the coronavirus. Quantum of the Seas, a Royal Caribbean cruise ship returned on day three of a four-day “cruise to nowhere” after the captain confirmed that a guest had a Covid-19 infection despite strict checks before boarding. Cruise holidays have been suspended globally since early this year after several mass Covid-19 outbreaks left hundreds of passengers sick or stranded as borders closed to keep the pandemic at bay. In one of the first and most high-profile incidents in February, passengers on the Diamond Princess, owned by Carnival Corporation, were forced to isolate in their cabins for weeks, as the virus swept through the vessel, infecting 712 and killing 14.  The desperate situation damaged the industry’s global image even as borders closed to future ships, forcing the cancelling of cruises worldwide. This year the cruise industry is expected to lose close to $20 billion.Royal Caribbean had only resumed three and four-night Ocean Getaway cruises as part of a safe cruising pilot programme announced in October by the Singapore Tourism Board to help revive the cruise industry.  The short trips are only open to Singapore residents and do not include port calls.All passengers are required to take a mandatory Covid-19 test prior to boarding and the Quantum of the Seas had halved its usual 4,000 capacity as part of strict health and safety measures. Despite the measures, the tourism board confirmed on Wednesday that an 83-year-old passenger had tested positive for the virus after reporting to the medical centre with diarrhoea, reported the Straits Times. He had tested negative before the ship left port. The ship’s captain turned the ship back early as soon as the case was confirmed. “It’s important that you know you are safe on board and we have a good plan in place to maintain your health, safety and comfort,” he told the 1,680 guests and 1, 148 crew members on board. All leisure activities were suspended and the ship isolated all guests and crew who had close contact with the infected man. All of them tested negative for the coronavirus.However, the ministry of health said the contacts will be placed on quarantine or health surveillance. Other people on the ship will be required to monitor their health for 14 days from the date of disembarkation and undergo a swab test at the end of the monitoring period.  The infection is a blow to an industry desperate to get back on its feet and dispel the notion of ships as “floating Petri dishes.”The Quantum of the Seas had prepared for worst-case scenarios with a hospital on board, complete with a PCR testing laboratory and intensive care units equipped with ventilators.Mask wearing on board is mandatory and passengers must have the Trace Together mobile application or token on their person at all times.Royal Caribbean is not the only cruise company to attempt to take to the seas again despite the ongoing pandemic. Chinese ships the Nanhai Dream and the Changle Gongzhu, are to set sail this week on a trial run from Sanya, Hainan Province, to the Xisha Islands, reported the Global Times. The ships are forbidden from carrying more than 50 per cent of their passenger capacity initially and full services are not expected to resume until next year. More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"10000 worth christmas presents being","story":"AdvertorialWhy £, worth of Christmas presents are being given to people who buy milkGraham’s The Family Dairy is surprising customers with hampers of fresh dairy products and vouchers to dine at top restaurantsmirrorShareCommentsByDave MastersHelena Pozniack:,  DEC Updated:,  DEC AdvertorialDr Robert Graham, chairman of Graham’s The Family DairyCows still need milking, even in the middle of a pandemic. And owners of Graham’s The Family Dairy in Scotland have continued to rise at am throughout this year to tend their  strong herd of Jersey cows and ensure customers as far away as the Highlands can get milk delivered to their doors.   But while dairy purchases have soared, Graham’s has seen the fortunes of local hospitality businesses plummet - and the family wanted to help out with a Christmas Advent of giving. Thataposs why every day in December in the run up to Christmas, Graham’s is giving away gts to customers - in the form of hampers of fresh dairy products and vouchers to dine out at some of Scotland’s best local restaurants - to the value of £, in all.  As part of our campaign with KFC, we are sharing stories of everyday people doing extraordinary things to help their community - those heroes who want to give people more of what they love. And today we salute Graham’s The Family Dairy for doing just that. “As a family of farmers, it’s not an option to stop milking our cows - le goes on. We soon realised people needed more help than ever,” says Dr Robert Graham, chairman of the dairy in Stirlingshire, who’s worked on the farm in the village of Bridge of Allan all his le, and still oversees the early morning milking. “Our teams have worked incredibly hard over the past few months, and with Christmas coming up, our business wanted to give something back to communities. “Eating good Scottish food with friends and family is such a pleasure,” says Dr Graham, who hopes the scheme will spread a little Christmas joy now and into the new year. “The past few months have been incredibly tough for restaurants and cafes as most of them are small family-run operations.”  When lockdown began earlier this year, Graham’s, which works with more than  farmers across Scotland, mobilised teams to deliver milk, butter and other fresh products direct to more people’s houses as customers stocked up on home baking staples such as butter, eggs and cream. Founded by Dr Graham’s father in , the business has grown from pony-and-cart doorstep deliveries to supplying shops, hotels and restaurants around the UK. Dr Graham works with his son , who’s now managing director and daughter Carol who leads marketing. It was Dr Graham who back in the s decided to buy some  Jersey cows from the Queen’s herd in Windsor - these produce the rich creamy milk for which the dairy is renowned. Keen to help out local cafes, the dairy has also decided to appoint a new milk ambassador in recognition of a café owner or barista whose community spirit shines through. Staff were won over by a local coffee lover and entrepreneur Michelle Kibaris, owner of Fallen Tree Coffee, who runs a mobile coffee truck around rural Blair Drummond near Stirling. She thinks the rich gold-top milk produced by Graham’s Jersey herd makes the best coffee and is delighted to receive free milk from the dairy for a year - worth some £. “I have so many ideas for the business,” she says. For many, food is more than just fuel to keep us going, it’s a way of showing our love and bringing comfort in a dficult time. This year may have been tough but it’s good to remember it has also served up some incredible stories of kindness, determination and joy in communities across the UK. And we think that calls for more…gravy! To add some festive cheer, and give us all more of what we love, KFC have created the new Gravy Burger Box Meal, featuring a fillet burger with added gravy!

The survey suggests more than . million children have gone short of food amid this year’s economic turmoil. Five of the  authorities with the highest share of children at risk of hunger are in London, with the others in Devon and Lancashire. Use of food banks rose from % before the crisis to % - but take-up of free school meals went down slightly from % to %, the report found. However it said there were no official statistics on the numbers of children suffering food deprivation. It comes after a high-profile child hunger campaign by footballer Marcus Rashford, who shamed the Government into u-turning on its plans to scrap free school meals over the holidays. SMF chief economist Aveek Bhattacharya said: The stark evidence in this report shows that the challenge of food insecurity and child hunger is even greater and more urgent than many observers had thought and feared. The idea of a single child going short of food is heartbreaking, but our evidence shows that almost two million children have been in that awful situation this year. The think tank urged ministers to consider expanding eligibility for free school meals, extending holiday food programmes and keeping the £ uplt in universal credit. It also recommended that policymakers should redistribute food nationally, finding sources of waste in the food chain and directing surpluses to the neediest areas, as well as devolving responsibility and funding for food distribution to local authorities.

Starting from January , they will oversee checks on some goods being traded from east to west, within the UK, from Great Britain to Northern Ireland. EU chiefs say the checks - which the UK agreed to last year - are essential because there’ll be no border between the UK’s Northern Ireland and the EU-member Republic. In order to avoid a massive border loophole, goods that arrive from Britain to Northern Ireland - but are deemed “at risk” of moving into the EU later on - will need EU customs checks and tarfs. Those tarfs will then be refundedthe goods stay in Northern Ireland. In , Northern Ireland itself will effectively be able to trade freely with the EU like it does now.Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove agreed the deal yesterday in exchange for dropping the UK’s threat to break international law over Brexit.Britain had threatened to take control of how the Northern Ireland trading system would work - which would have breached last year’s Brexit deal. Mr Gove said last night’s new agreement would give Northern Ireland the “best of both worlds” and allow “British bangers” to be traded to Belfast.But it comes despite Boris Johnson repeatedly saying there’d be no border down the Irish Sea. DUP Westminster leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson warned the : We donapost see the need for any permanent presence of EU officials in Northern Ireland. We obviously are concerned but we will have to see the detail of this agreement when it is published. Mr Gove insisted the new plan would not create a border down the Irish Sea. He said it would just mean “minimal additional number of checks on products of animal origin”. But he admitted there would be EU officials in place to monitor the arrangement. Mr Gove told BBC Breakfast: “It is the case that there will be some EU officials who we’ll welcome into Northern Ireland to make sure they’re satisfied the processes - which we’re in control of - will be running appropriately. “But that’s standard when you’ve got trade agreements. “It’s often the case that you’ll have people from one country going to their trade partner in order to make sure the systems that have been put in place match the agreement that’s been concluded. “That’s fairly standard practice.” He told LBC: I think that they’ll probably come in, travel in, and I suspect that they’ll be, they’ll want to visit the four major ports Larne, Warrenpoint, Belfast port of course as well and then the port of Foyle in London Londonderry.  Mr Gove was due to announce more details in the House of Commons at .pm. UK sources claimed the EU had demanded much more in the form of a “mini embassy”. The source said: “They withdrew that request. The EU do have the right under the Protocol to supervise processes conducted by UK authorities, which we will of course support, but there will be no mini-embassy, no mission, no building with a flag or brass. Mr Gove added: “At one stage there were some people in the EU who wanted to sort of mount a political land grab, and say ‘we’re planting a flag and there’s a bit of Northern Ireland that is forever the EU. “W’ere not in that position now. We were quite clear that we were very keen on pragmatic and friendly business-like co-operation and that’s what we’ve got.” According to the , % of goods crossing the Irish Sea won’t have EU tarfs applied.  The EU also reportedly agreed to drop plans that might have blocked the UK giving state aid to any firm with a presence in Northern Ireland. It comes as Boris Johnson travels to Brussels tonight in a last-ditch bid to reach a Brexit trade deal in time for January. The Prime Minister will have dinner with EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen in a bid to break a triple deadlock on fishing rights, EU rules and standards and how a deal will be policed. The row is separate to the Northern Ireland issue, but the UK’s climbdown is being seen as a diplomatic push that may help push trade talks over the line. Brexit trade deal talks have been held up over three issues which the EU and UK canapost agree. They are: Fishing: The two sides are split over two issues - quotas and access. In -, % of the fish in UK waters was caught by EU boats and % by UK boats. Britain wants both more quota to catch its own fish, and ultimate control over who accesses the waters. Reports suggested the EU was prepared to% of its current quotas to UK fishermen, but Britain demanded %. The UK offered a three-year transition to having control, but the EU reportedly wanted  years. Level playing field: This means how closely we follow EU rules in the future. The UK wants to be free to set its own laws in areas like labour, environment, climate, sustainable development and subsidies for businesses . Britain wants to be allowed to “give an undertaking” that it won’t “renege” on environment or other standards, but the EU demanded equivalence, with the UK effectively mirroring EU rules in future, in what officials branded a last-minute ambush by the French. Governance: The final key dispute is about how any future disagreements between the UK and the EU on trade are resolved. The UK is confident there will be no role for the European Court of Justice but the exact arrangements are still being drawn up.

Prof Chris Whitty said he had high hopes other pharma giants will join Pfizer in having a jab approved. It comes after the head of the MHRA regulator said she is actively reviewing two jabs from Oxford AstraZeneca and Moderna. Dr June Raine gave no date for when the review might finish, but said her “very active review” into the Oxford jab will receive more data “in the coming days”. And more data on the Moderna jab is expected in the coming weeks, she told MPs. Getting more jabs approved will be crucial to speeding up the rollout of a vaccine to the wider population. The UK has ordered enough of the Pfizer jab for million people but enough of the Oxford jab for million. Prof Whitty told the Commons Health and Science Committee he expects to have a portfolio of several vaccines by the middle of , but advised that the rollout process should still proceed carefully. He said: The aim would be to roll out this vaccine and any others that get a licence and are effective and safe. We expect, probably by the middle of the year, to have a portfolio of three or four vaccines which we can actually use. It came as the HMRA gave precautionary advice to NHS trusts that anyone who has a history of signicant allergic reactions to medicines, food or vaccines should not receive the jab from Pfizer BioNTech.  Two NHS workers suffered an allergic reaction after receiving the vaccine on Tuesday. Both staff members had a signicant history of allergic reactions - to the extent that they carried adrenaline auto-injectors with them. Professor Stephen Powis, national medical director for the NHS in England, said: As is common with new vaccines, the MHRA have advised on a precautionary basis that people with a signicant history of allergic reactions do not receive this vaccination after two people with a history of signicant allergic reactions responded adversely yesterday.

The lowest rates in London are in Camden , Westminsterand Richmond upon Thames . With the latest data available taken in the seven days up to Friday, December , it begs the question of how effective the lockdown actually was in London. Public Health Regional Director for London Kevin Fenton fired a warning shot on Tuesday about the urgent need for Londoners to work together to prevent a big surge in cases. He said: Covid- behaves like clockwork - the more contact we have with others, the higher chance of catching or spreading the virus.

But City Hall officials are aware it is a rapidly moving picture.Professor John Ashton, a former regional director of public health for north-west England and author of Blinded by Corona, told thea decision on London was needed urgently.He said: “[The Government] needs to decide in the next  hours whether to move London into Tier  otherwise they really risk a terrible situation for London, with deaths going up during the Christmas period.

The Donoghue family took up most of the floor of a Belfast hotel while they waited for a property to be found.They claim they had been made homeless from their previous property after their landlord sold the house and they had to move out, Belfast Live reported. While the cityaposs Housing Executive tried to find them a new place to stay, the Donoghues spent eight weeks living out of suitcases. Today they were told that they have a new place to call their own. Mum of  Tessa Donoghue has said her family have been left with nothing following their eviction, as they were unable to find anywhere to store their belongings and had to leave them behind when they went to the hotel. She said they had to live off takeaways and were unable to cook or store their own food in the hotel for health and safety reasons. To make matters worse, Tessa is expecting her th child in February. The mum has been told he may require heart surgery once he is born. Tessa said: The past eight weeks have been hell for us living in this hotel. Because we were unable to find a storage unit for our possessions, we have had to leave everything behind and now we have nothing. No furniture, fridge, freezer, beds or anything. While the hotel have been amazing to us, giving us our own rooms and nearly an entire floor to ourselves, the children are scared to be alone in the rooms by themselves and come into our room to sleep with their sleeping bags. We canapost do any of our own cooking, as we donapost have a fridge to store fresh food or even anything to cook it with, so we have had to survive off takeaways, which has made this entire ordeal very expensive. Not to mention the fact we have to pay to park our cars outside the hotel everyday.

Eliot Prest, , his father Malcolm Prest, , and sister Sapphire were offered alternative accommodation after racking up a huge bill with Hull City Council and being forced to leave their home.But the family refused as Eliot, who struggles with disabilities and disorders including autism, ADHD, dismissive-avoidant attachment disorder and OCD, relies on Malcolm as his full-time carer, Hull Live reports. The family say they have been freezing as temperatures hit -C on Tuesday night, and are having to use the home of friends and family to shower. Elliot said: The council sent my dad a big bill for rent and bedroom tax without warning and it has forced him into having to give the house away. Since then, they have tried to split us up. We were in a temporary house and they put that on the bidding list and said evenwe bid for it, we won’t get it.” Elliot, Malcolm and Sapphire are now living in the family car, along with their two dogs. Elliot says he has informed the council of their living situation but claims to have been told the best the council can do is offer them a flat to move in at the end of January.  The council aren’t bothered about us over Christmas and New Year, we have to live in this car until January, he said. They had said they were going to try and get us three dferent hostels. Iaposm not allowed to be separated from my dad as he is my carer and upon hearing that they said there’s nothing much more they can do.” Elliot thinks the reason they have been told to wait for so long is due to the three family members wanting to be housed together - but he thinks itaposs very little to ask to be housed with his full-time carer.

Speaking to CNN reporter Cyril Vanier, Mr Kenyon explained that he had travelled into London to receive the vaccine - but was late for his appointment as he couldnapost park the car. When asked why he had decided to take it, he said: I don’t intend to have it there’s no point in dying when I’ve lived this long, is there  I don’t intend to anyway. Mr Kenyon added that his family were unaware of his decision and that he was going to head home and tell them. He said: I rang up Guyaposs Hospital, which I know very well as Iaposve lived in London most of my grown le. and I said...youaposre doing the vaccination and they said yes. Then they spent time asking me some questions about this and that..not very interesting and I said yes, no, yes, no and they said come at half past . Well of course, I couldnapost damn well find anywhere to park my car so I was late. Anyway Iaposm here now and I got inside and they duly put me down on the list and I went off and had a rather nasty lunch and then came back, and they were ready for me. And no, it didn’t hurt at all – I didn’t know the needle had gone in until it had come out. It was very interesting, it was painless. Mr Kenyon received his vaccine a few hours after the first Brit, Margaret Keenan, . Health Secretary Matt Hancock said he felt emotional as he saw the image of Mrs Keenan being vaccinated. Like many around the country, the gran has been self-isolating for most of this year and is planning on having a very small family bubble Christmas to keep safe.

Ollie Wood, who was travelling in the car behind, said the motorist was an absolute idiot who went out of his way to soak the lad. The schoolboy was walking along the pavement when he was splashed by muddy water and soaked from head to toe in Wigan, Greater Manchester. The super splash was captured by Ollieaposs dash cam as he drove to Asda to do a food shop, reports the Manchester Evening News. Ollie said:The driver was an absolute idiot.You could see he went out of his way to soak the lad. I donapost know what enjoyment you could get out of doing this to someone. Footage shows a blue VolkswagenGolf travelling down a residential street before coming to the end of a row of parked cars.  The boy, thought to be in his early teens, is then seen standing on the side of the road wearing a blue hoodie. In the seemingly unprovoked incident, the driver is seen travelling in the middle of the road before turning his car towards the pavement and into the puddle.

To incorporate their German heritage, the family normally sit down together and open their presents the night before the big day. Prince Philip used to oversee the evening fun, ensuring that each member of the family had a pile of presents laid out on a trestle table in the White Drawing Room with a name card in front of each stack. The family famously exchange joke presents rather than expensive gts, and there have been some hilarious offerings over the years. For one of her first royal Christmasses, Kate reportedly bought her brother-in-law Prince Harry a aposGrow your Own Girlfriendapos Kit, while the Duke got his granny a Leaposs a B****apos shower cap. We imagine it must be quite intimidating for newcomers to the family, including Meghan Markle and Jack Brooksbank, to come up with a funny and creative idea for their in-laws. But Meghan hit the nail on the head when she attended her first Royal Christmas back in , five months before she married Prince Harry. She reportedly bought her future grandmother-in-law a singing toy hamster – and it went down a treat.The Daily Star reports that the Monarch was so happy with the present that she burst out laughing, before remarking: “It can keep my dogs company.”A source said: “Meghan bought a little hamster that sings with a little rope for Her Majesty. “It was so funny, especially when the corgis tried to take hold of the toy.”  However it turns out the corgis werenapost quite so impressed - and ended up mauling it to pieces before the festive celebrations were over. Last year, Kate explained that the Royals now open one present each on Christmas Eve, a change from their tradition of opening all their gts at that time. Speaking to Mary Berry on her festive TV show, Kate said: Williamaposs familyaposs tradition is to open one Christmas present on Christmas eve, which is really lovely.

Adam Morrison, , who runs The Queenaposs Head, in Norfolk, came up with the idea after the government announced the beefed-up tier system preventing drinkers in Tier  visiting pubs without having a substantial meal. Returning locals found they can now order the p pasta in a number of dferent flavours between pm-pm and pm-pm on weekdays. Flavours include tomato and basil, olive oil and garlic, mac and cheese and creamy Italian sausage. His idea has been well-received by locals looking for a pint, but he insists it isnapost a loophole. We are offering a substantial meal so I don’t really see it as getting around the rules or a loophole or anything like that, he said. He added: We are still abiding exactly by the Government rules, all of our tables are spaced out, we haven’t increased prices of the drinks. The rules are the rules, but it’s table service and we have stood by them  per cent. With many landlords worrying they wonapost be able to make it through the ongoing pandemic given the restrictions, others have also come up with ingenious ways to keep business up.  The  Rabbits tequila bar has tried to register as the Church of  Rabbits as religious places are allowed to remain open. The Caxton Arms in Brighton is serving a drink, aptly named, Substantial Meal - to get away with needing a substantial meal with your drink, because your drink is the substantial meal. Mr Morrison insists this isnapost an attempt like the the Atlantic Sports and Fitness Club in Kraków, Poland which also tried to rebrand as a church. He just wants punters to be able to enjoy a drink without breaking the bank. We wanted to do it so there was a way for someone to come and enjoy a drink but without the need to spend eight nine pounds on a meal to go alongside that. Mr Morrison said,  So with that in mind we came up with the idea of the penny pasta, so we change it every day and make it slightly dferent so our regular customers don’t get bored of having the same ones.The landlord is feeling positive despite the tough new rules because of the newly released vaccine and does make sure everyone in his pub follows the law. He said: Depending on how long they take to eat their meal they can order another drink but once they are finished they will have to leave.  Even with the ingenious pasta for a penny scheme, he says most people are still ordering food from the menu and only those coming in just for a drink, rather than food, are buying the pasta. Most people are also ordering from the main menu so we haven’t had a dip in sales on the food since Friday, it is more for people who primarily come for a drink rather than food but then they can also have a meal included with that, he said.

But many of us are still uncertain about what the coming weeks will bring – and how optimistic we can let ourselves to be. Boris Johnson branded the vaccine a “shot in the arm for the entire nation” and told people who are scared, “don’t be”.The Prime Minister hailed the achievements of scientists as he watched the first jabs going into arms at London’s Guy’s Hospital yesterday  - one of  NHS hubs. Mr Johnson also slammed anti-vaxxers as “totally wrong” and insisted the Pfizer jab - which the UK is the first country in the world to approve for mass rollout - is safe. He said: “I would say to all those who are scared, don’t be”, adding: There is nothing to be nervous about. Here, Dr Mike Tildesley, of the Scientic Pandemic Influenza Group on Modelling, and Dr Kaveh Asanti, a consultant occupational physician and clinical senior lecturer at Imperial College London, have the answers to all the burning questions. How will I know when and where to get the vaccine  The first jabs are being given to people aged  or over who already have hospital appointments, and frontline NHS and social care workers. Dr Asanati says: “You don’t need to do anything except wait. The NHS will let you know when it’s your turn to have the vaccine.” Is there any way I could be vaccinated earlierI’m not in the priority group  If you’re not in the priority group there’s no way to get it earlier, says Dr Tildesley. “At the moment the vaccine is only available on the NHS, although that may changenumbers increase later in the year and can be made available privately,” he adds. Will I experience any symptoms after the jab  In the phase  trials some people experienced mild symptoms such as fever or a sore arm. “That’s very common wth vaccines, but they should disappear after a few days,” says Dr Tildesley. Can I still catch Covid- after having the first jab  “Yes,” says Dr Asanati, “but the risks reduces in time following vaccination. It takes time for the body to develop immunity after the first injection. “The % immunity reported for the Pfizer vaccine was shown at around seven days following the second dose.”  Once I’ve had the second jab can I go and hug my elderly mum  You should still take precautions, says Dr Tildesley. “The vaccine isn’t % effective, meaning that you can still catch it, although most people won’t. And it doesn’t mean that you can breach any restrictions that are still in place.” Dr Asanati agrees: “It is advisable to continue to adhere to government advice about social distancing even after completing the course of the vaccine.” Will the vaccine mean I can’t catch the virus, or just that I don’t get ill  This is the “big unknown”, says Dr Tildesley. “We don’t knowthe vaccine reduces symptoms of the virus, or its transmission. Some vaccines just reduce symptoms, and with Covid there’s a big uncertainly about how it may stop transmission. It may be that the vaccine stops you experiencing symptoms but you can still catch and transmit it. We will need to be careful.”  Am I likely to experience more of a reaction than to a normal flu jab Dr Asanati says: “This is a new vaccine – but it is unlikely that the current approved Covid- vaccine causes symptoms signicantly more than other vaccines such as thenormal flu jab.”How long will I stay immune from the coronavirus for  That’s still uncertain, says Dr Tildesley. “I think it’s reasonable to assume that people will remain immune for months. But it’s unlikely to be lelong and it may be that repeated vaccines are needed. “We’ll get much more information once people have been vaccinated and can be monitored.” Will the vaccine eradicate Covid- from the UK  “Broad vaccination coverage results in mass immunity which signicantly slows down community transmission and hopefully eradication at some stage,” says Dr Asanati.  Might the virus mutate so the vaccine no longer works  Possibly, says Dr Tildesley. “While it’s not showing signs of mutating, when the virus starts coming under pressure with a vaccine it may mutate to survive. That may mean the vaccine doesn’t work in the longer term.” But Dr Asanati says: “Many vaccines currently being developed could be usedthe virus mutates. The most important thing at the moment it to focus on the current outbreak.” When might everyone in the country be vaccinated  That depends a lot on the Oxford vaccine, says Dr Tildesley. “We’ve only got  million doses of the Pfizer vaccine, so we need the Oxford one to be approved and rolled out to vaccinate everyone.” He believes that could be late Spring or early Summer, while Dr Asanati says: “Le should be happier in the second half of next year”.

In a video, which has had . million views on TikTok, the woman, named Maneet, shares what she calls aChristmas hack you need to know as she brings out a tub of Cadburyaposs Heroes.She can be seen showing the camera the sealed tub of chocolates before she demonstrates the sneaky trick. As she flips the box sideways and presses on it, she says: Push it in the middle until it cracks and keep pushing around. Maneet continues to do so until the lid pops open on its own. So now you can open it... without, oh this is amazing, breaking the seal, the chocolate lover exclaims.  You can take whichever you like. For me, itaposs going to be a Creme Egg. And a Fudge. And maybe a Crunchie. And a Wispa. Then you just snap it shut and [the seal] is still on there! She also said you could easily prank your family by swapping out the chocolates for other branded sweets.

In fact, this year has been far from pine and no amount of perfectly decorated trees will help us forget.Now one womanaposs Christmas tree has been dubbed the worldaposs worst - and itaposs easy to see why. On TikTok, a woman called Melody shared a video capturing the moment her cousin cut open the tree in order to decorate it. As he cuts the strings, the tree starts to unfold and look a lot fuller. But disaster strikes as he snips at the bottom half as it suddenly falls apart, leaving it looking a lot barer than expected. The confused man can be heard accusing the woman filming the video of aposbreakingapos the festive icon. Itaposs fair to say it wasnapost what we expected. In fact, it was more than that - it was extremely disappointing and itaposs definitely what weaposve come to expect from .  The hilarious video has been viewed more than  million times since it was uploaded to TikTok. Miss Melody joked in the video caption: If this doesnapost perfectly sum up , I donapost know exactly what does. People were left in stitches by the clip, which has racked up more than , likes. One viewer commented: My god the way he said you broke it that got me. A second referenced the famous Rockefeller Tree, which was dubbed terrible by fed-up New Yorkers this year. They joked:  Rockefeller Treeaposs little brother for sure. Keep it in the family.

Speaking in the clip, she explains: “If you’re coiling your Christmas tree lights, you’re doing it wrong. “Decorating Christmas trees used to be part of my job and we use the zig-zag method. “It means you don’t waste lights round the back of your tree anda set breaks you can take them off really easily.”  Captioning the post, she wrote: This method saved me so many times.

The twins were delivered by caesarean at the Childrenaposs Hospital Dr Hector Quintana located in the city of San Salvador in the Argentine province of Jujuy. The young mum, who has not been named, was allegedly forced to wait until the twin foetuses reached a certain level of maturity before the op could be carried out on November . She has now been placed under the care of the Childrenaposs Ombudsman due to her parent’s “legal situation”, according to a statement by the Network of Health Professionals for the Right to Decide on November . The statement condemns the caesarean surgery on the -year-old, saying she had the right to a legal termination of pregnancy given her young age. It goes on to criticise provincial authorities for allowing the operation, which will leave a permanent scar on the victim’s body and could potentially lead to psychological issues down the line. The network accused officials of “buying time” to ensure the only option was to have the birth despite the fact they have a specic protocol which is carried out with UNICEF.  The protocol allows teens under the age of  to have access to legal abortions given the health risks involved with underage pregnancy. It also claims the National Direction of Sexual Health contacted provincial authorities and offered to immediately help the girl but were met with delays. It is unclear what reasons officials gave for stalling the case.

While mobile banks have their place, they are no substitute for a permanent presence.“Huntly Community Council and the Huntly and District Development Trust have been proactive in seeking a solution to the removal of face-to-face banking services. Retaining face to face access to financial services is vital and their aspiration to establish a town centre financial hub is something that I am happy to support in any way that I can.”Ms Petrie, who represents the Huntly, Strathbogie and Howe of Alford ward, added: #It is disappointing to have a new confirmed date for closure of the Huntly branch, however, I do thank the Bank of Scotland for working with the community council to site their mobile branch in a central location.“Community organisations in the town are continuing to look at future alternative delivery models for the town, and I would hope that the bank remains open to engaging with the community on this, and the future use of the building.”Meanwhile, the Turrf branch is also due to close on March  next year.Scottish Conservative MP for Banff and Buchan David Duguid added: #This is very disappointing news and another blow for the High Street in Turrf.#The timing of this announcement could not be worse for staff, with Christmas just a few weeks away. My immediate thoughts are for those affected.#I will be engaging with Bank of Scotland to ensure that as many as possible will be offered jobs where.#This will also mean another empty unit in the heart of Turrf from next Spring. I hope that the building will not remain out of use for long, as this has a knock-on effect on the rest of the town centre.#A Bank of Scotland spokeswoman said:  “We have made the dficult decision to close the branches due to the changing ways customers choose to bank with us, which means the branch is being used less often.#We are sorry for any inconvenience this may cause customers can continue to bank locally by visiting the new mobile branch, or the nearby Post Office, which is less than half a mile from the branch.“Bank of Scotland is introducing a new mobile branch service which will visit the Huntly area. This new branch will provide a personal, face to face service to the local communities it visits, giving customers access to everyday banking services such as making deposits, withdrawing cash and paying bills.#The new service will be in place prior to the branch closing and our experienced colleagues will be on hand to help customers with online banking and general account and product enquiries. We continue to make a signicant investment in our branches are committed to maintaining the largest network in the UK.”The bank confirmed it would close the Tullos branch on March  next year.Scottish Conservative north-east MSP Liam Kerr said: “I’m extremely disappointed by the Bank of Scotland’s decision to close the Tullos branch, just a few months after TSB decided to shut its bank in the area.“This is a massive blow to residents and businesses in Tullos who are being stripped of yet more banking facilities, leaving an empty unit in the heart of the area.“The timing of this announcement could not be worse for staff, with Christmas just a few weeks away.“My thoughts go to everyone affected by this announcement and I will be contacting Bank of Scotland to ensure staff are offered jobs where.“Retaining face-to-face access is vital, especially for groups such as the elderly during such dficult times.”For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles. vw, px\"   blaize_sub_data  ,\"evening-express-epaper--month\":This offer will auto renew monthly at the price of  ua., you can cancel at any time n\",\"free_trial\":,\"evening-express-web-pack--month\": today and get unlimited access to the Evening Express website. nThis offer will auto-renew monthly at the price of  ua., you can cancel at any time. n\",\"free_trial\":,\"plan_ids\":[\"cancelation-offer-evening-express-web-epaper\",\"evening-express-epaper--month\",\"evening-express-web-pack--month\"],\"subscribe\": ua. per month  u recurring subscription n\",\"label\":\"\",\"highlight\":,\"recurring\":\"\",\"has_multi\":,\"editions\":true,\"durations\":true,\"free_trial\":,\"benefits\":[\"Unlimited access to all articles on the Evening Express website.

Saints, however, failed to harness the wind advantage and it was the home side who looked the more threatening in the early stages.Skipper Lewis Buchanan registered Saints first effort on goal in the th minute, cutting in from the right to send a well-struck shot just wide of the postage stamp corner.Saints manager Donald Black made early use of the agreed rolling substitutes policy, sending on Fraser MacFarlane in the th minute to replace Alan Buchanan in the centre forward#s role.It didn#t take MacFarlane long to make an impact and his neat turn on the edge of the D created the space for a right foot volley which arced away from the Red Star keeper#s right hand to nestle in the bottom corner and give Saints a st minute lead.Red Star cancelled out the Saints advantage on the stroke of half-time after good work on the right from Chris Hart took him all the way to the bye-line from where his cutback picked out Stuart MacLean on the six-yard line for an easy finish.With the wind gathering pace, a long second half was in prospect for Saints and it took the hosts just four minutes to capitalise on their controlled first half performance when central defender Ben Forbes poked home an Andy Weir right wing corner through a sea of legs.After Lewis Buchanan had headed a th minute Andy Weir left wing corner off the line, Weir#s follow up delivery from the opposite flank picked out right full back Coll McCallum eight yards out for the home side#s third goal.Red Star stretched their advantage still further on the hour mark when Ben Forbes whipped a wind assisted free-kick from the halfway line into the postage stamp corner giving Murdo MacKenzie no chance.After keeping the hosts at bay for  minutes, Saints conceded a fth goal with almost the last kick of the ball. Murdo MacKenzie did well to parry a dipping -yard Aaron Moore shot, but luck deserted the Saints keeper when the ball broke to Ewan Litster, who chipped over the stranded keeper into the unguarded net.With the rain coming horizontally, both sets of players were delighted to hear referee Jimmy Litster#s final whistle immediately after the restart signalling a stampede for the sanctuary of the ious cars and vans in the school car park."},{"url":null,"title":"science matters unravelling our deep origins","story":"Dorothy H CrawfordUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

We know that our early ancestors split from chimpanzees, our closest ape relative, around - million years ago , and that the first near-humans of our genusevolved in Africa at least . Myr.These forerunners eventually gave rise to us , but our knowledge of what happened between these dates is very limited, largely because fossilised remains are extremely rare.Common illustrations depicting how our upright posture, facial features and lack of body hair gradually evolved are based on few skeletons of ancient ancestors. Most notable is that of Lucy, a young female skeleton dating back to . Myr.Lucy was discovered in the Afar depression, Ethiopia, in , and was assigned to a species more primitive than ours , and named A. afarensis after her location. In the s a few teeth and bone fragments were found that proved to be similar to, but even older than, Lucy, dating from ^ Myr and called A. anamensis. it was assumed that Lucy was directly descended from this ancient primate.Not surprisingly, there was much excitement in the field when anthropologist Yohannes Haile-Selassie discovered a near-complete skull of A. anamensis dating from approximately . Myr. He found the skull, simply known as MRD for now, during his fieldworks at Woranso-Mille, Ethiopia, in . As the oldest and most-complete skull of A. anamensis, this find allowed detailed comparison with Lucy’s species.There was general agreement that, like the illustration, our ancient ancestors descended one from another in a linear fashion. So most experts assumed that A. anamensis evolved directly into Lucy’s species.Haile-Selassie’s detailed study of MRD suggests, however, that the two species co-existed in Africa for at least , years, presumably with the potential for interbreeding. This undoubtedly shakes up previous thoughts and reshapes our understanding of Homo evolution.But only time will tell Haile-Salassie says he hopes to find the rest of MRD’s skeleton # and even earlier members of our Homo genus # which should certainly help unravel our deep past."},{"url":null,"title":"bobcast episode 17 congratulations and jubilations","story":"The Oban TimesUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

Some applicants do not have English as their first language and Citizens Advice Bureauoffices have experience in obtaining advice via interpreters.Outreach clinics, centred in local area job centres, are also a feature of the CAB service and enable job centre staff to refer clients directly to a CAB Advisor based there for a day.Any cuts will increase the workload on CAB offices exponentially as thousands more may be made redundant, find they have no income of any kind, and turn to CAB for advice. Cuts will undoubtedly affect the vulnerable in our society immediately, with theIn cities such as Glasgow, the closure of offices would mean that many claimants could find it impossible to travel to other parts of the city and, in any case, with an already growing list of applicants those offices would soon be overwhelmed,they are not already.Several members of CAB staff have already been made redundant. I believe that more may follow without additional funding.In Glasgow alone, five offices face closure, though it is estimated that in excess of , people in Glasgow sought advice from these offices in the last year. This is likely to be the case in major cities around Scotland.Our petition calls on the Scottish Parliament to urge the Scottish Government to provide urgent funding to Citizens Advice Scotland. It can be found on the Scottish Parliament website # petition number PE: Urgent funding for Citizens Advice Bureaux.Alistair S Stephen, by emailSir,The Covert Human Intelligence Sources Bill currently going through Westminster, dubbed the Spy Cop Bill, gives agencies including police, armed forces, HMRC, and even the Food Standards Agency permission to break the law with impunity.These agencies will be permitted to break international and domestic law in direct contravention of the Geneva Convention on human rights.Why is this legislation being brought in, and why are HMRC and the Food Standards Agency being given such powers  It is beyond belief that the majority of MPs actually voted for this bill.A clue may come from recent comments made by the home Secretary and endorsed by the prime minister about #leftie lawyers# and #do-gooders#, referring to human rights lawyers and refugee organisations.As for the Food Standards Agency, clues might come from the other very concerning bill in process at present which is the Internal Market Bill which contravenes the Good Friday Agreement and the devolution settlements for Scotland and Wales by undermining the authority of the devolved governments, as well as breaking an international treaty signed less than a year ago.This bill contains some deeply concerning clauses which would come under the remit of The Food Standards Agency which normally only has jurisdiction south of the border, but this bill would enable a UK trade minister to unilaterally overrule Scottish legislation on food safety standards to allow for a trade deal with the US, and the importation of sub-standard foods and food products.It is also the case that any UK minister or appointee would be able to overrule any Scottish legislation. This could affect all aspects of our lives.The Spy Cop Bill is a means of enforcing the Internal Market Bill by using the threat of underhand means. Thus piling illegality on illegality with regard to international law.We need to be very concerned on both counts.Amnesty International has already voiced its grave concerns, as have other international bodies and governments.Surely independence is now the best option for Scotland, where we can build a better, fairer nation for ourselves one that obeys international laws and respects the basic human rights of all its citizens, with a written constitution to ensure that no future Scottish government could ever impose such draconian legislation on the people of Scotland.Cecilia Rees , Lochgilphead.Sir,The Covid- pandemic continues to be exceptionally dficult for all of us, but has also led to crisis levels of #pet poverty# in the UK.PDSA is a charity that provides free and low cost vet care for those who struggle to pay treatment costs for their sick and injured pets.Since the first UK lockdown began, we’ve seen an overwhelming number of additional enquiries from pet owners who have hit hard times.

Martin Bonar replaced Scott Johnston for Saints while Chris Hart made way for Innes Meikle for the hosts.The deadlock was broken in the th minute from a quickly-taken free kick by Cammy Hill after Martin Bonar had been brought down in the centre circle by James McGuiness.Hill spotted Aaron McKay in space on the right and sent him scurrying forward. McKay cut into the box and picked out the run of Craig MacEwan who was foiled from six yards by Ally Lewis.The young keeper#s good work was undone when he couldn#t hold MacEwan#s shot allowing the ball to spin away from him.Ben Forbes was on hand with a sliding challenge to knock the loose ball away from MacEwan but only as far as Gavin Forgrieve, who gleefully tapped home from four yards.Lewis saved again from MacEwan three minutes later this time managing to hold onto the ball at the second attempt before a neat Matty Kelly turn on the corner of the Star -yard box wrong footed Ben Forbes creating the space for Kelly to curl a ball to the far post a matter of inches in front of the outstretched boot of Scott Maitland.Maitland got forward again in the st minute finding Gavin Forgrieve in front of goal. He took the ball down well only for Innes Meikle to get back with a vital challenge at the expense of a corner kick.Martin Bonar climbed well at the back post to meet Forgrieve#s delivery from the right but couldn#t direct his header on target.Despite being unable to hit the target himself Bonar was able to claim an st minute assist for the second and final goal.The big midfielder, a key member of Red Star#s  Scottish Amateur Football League Premier Division Two title winning side, won possession well in the centre circle and opened up his former team mates with a perfectly weighted pass for the forward run of skipper Craig MacEwan.Top marksman MacEwan comfortably beat stranded Red Star keeper Ally Lewis with a deft chip from  yards into the unguarded net.Referee Jimmy Litster, who ensured the two local rivals remained on friendly terms throughout, called time on proceedings after three added minutes with both sides satisfied to complete another  minutes while the majority of their respective league rivals remain side-lined."},{"url":null,"title":"in praise of john campbell factor mor","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

The town on its present site would be taking shape by the time young Zachary began his schooling.His education, however, was said to be #rudimentary#, so young Zachary began teaching himself Latin and Greek as he absorbed English classic literature.Employed from the age of  in a merchant#s office in Glasgow, historical references describe him falling into #bad company# and indulging in excessive drinking.At the age of  in  he emigrated to Jamaica to take up a role as a book-keeper, effectively a slave overseer, on a sugar plantation. Such was his horror and disgust at the way in which slaves were treated on the plantation that he became an implacable opponent of the slave trade.He gave up his job in Jamaica # by this time a #model book-keeper# # and ed in  to Britain and secured a position in London. His sister Jean had married Thomas Babington of Rothley Temple, Leicestershire, a country gentleman and ardent evangelical. Babington took MacAulay under his wing and introduced him to the Clapham Sect # a group of Tories against slavery.Among them was William Wilberforce, founder and leader of the anti-slavery movement.Through working with the Clapham Sect, MacAulay was invited in  to visit Sierra Leone # the West African colony established to provide a home to emancipated slaves from the United States who came to Sierra Leone via Nova Scotia.In , aged , he was promoted to the post of governor and remained in the post until .Returning to England on a slave ship, he brought with him  African children, with the hope of finding them a better le in the Clapham Sect community.He settled in Surrey following his marriage to Selina Mills on August , .Having witnessed the misery of slavery, MacAulay became a member of the Society for the Abolition of the Slave Trade, working closely with Wilberforce, and soon became a leading figure in the parliamentary campaign. He later became secretary of the committee, which became known as the African Institution.The campaign succeeded in , with an Act of Parliament making the slave trade illegal throughout the British Empire. The practice, however, was to continue despite this victory.Many abolitionists had thought slavery would fade away once the slave trade was stopped, but that failed to happen.MacAulay continued in his activism, helping seize a slave ship in . On this act, William Wilberforce commented in a letter to MacAulay, #you really deserve a statue#.In the s MacAulay turned his attention towards securing the total abolition of slavery itself. He helped found the Society for the Mitigation and Gradual Abolition of Slaveryin , and was editor of its monthly publication, the Anti-Slavery Reporter from its launch in .His major contribution was the collection and collating of a huge volume of evidence showing the true scale of slavery # a role to which he was ideally suited as a skilled statistician with a meticulous approach and an exceptional head for figures.It was also during this period that MacAulay co-founded University College London.Publication of the Reporter continued until , but by the end the work had worn MacAulay out and he had got into debt.In  Selina died and, with his finances in disarray, MacAulay was exiled to Paris in  # the year the Slavery Abolition Act came into force which ended slavery throughout the British Empire.He ed to England once his debts were liquidated and died on May , . He was buried in a London cemetery, but after the site became a public park # St George#s Gardens # the exact location of his grave was lost.MacAulay is commemorated with a le-sized memorial bust in Westminster Abbey.To mark the th anniversary of his birth in , a memorial plaque was unveiled in the gardens, donated by the Royal Statistical Society, the Friends of St George#s Gardens, University College London and the Clan MacAulay Association.William Wilberforce said of Zachary MacAulay: #My sober and deliberate opinion is that you [Zachary MacAulay] have done more towards this consummation [abolishing slavery] than any other man.#For myself, I take pleasure in acknowledging that you have been my tutor all the way and that I could have done nothing without you.#"},{"url":null,"title":"a family passion for scotlands beauty","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

Frances and Ross depict the ever-changing and often harsh weather conditions which frame their Argyll home.A Family Affair explores their shared artistic tropes as they both represent the landscape of Scotland’s islands and west coast, working in nature, directly inBoth use oil paint and other media, drawing with the brush or palette kne to make urgent, swt marks that capture the fleeting effects and drama of changing weather.They also share Crinan, where the Ryan family has run the Crinan Hotel since the mid-seventies, from where Ryan left for school, then art school and set out on extensive travels. But the beauty of Argyll # and his boat Sgarbh # drew him back.Earlier this year Ross held his second solo exhibition with The Scottish Gallery, but due to lockdown not a single person was able to attend.Frances has been a regular exhibitor with the gallery for years with her distinctive Hebridean seascapes and landscapes showing the repeated mots of Iona, The Mull of Kintyre, the bays around Crinan and the view across to Jura and the Corryvreckan.Like a good modernist Frances is reluctant to give any commentary on her works but Ross, on the other hand, makes extensive notes on his journeys allowing others to understand how hard-won the paintings are, particularly in winter when the harsh conditions create privations and huge physical problems. Each painting becomes a manestation and record of time and place.His affinity with the natural world is reflected in his long-term project of setting messages in bottles on the ocean, which brings him encounters as he journeys to meet the people who find them, and make new works at the location of the find.A Family Affair will be presented concurrently with Mark Hearld’s Menagerie, which will transport visitors to an animal-filled world with a series of prints, woodcut and linocuts inspired by the artist’s love of British flora and fauna.A Family Affair and Mark Hearld’s Menagerie will be at The Scottish Gallery in Edinburgh between Saturday November  and Wednesday December ."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column november 20 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

All representatives who are isolating or unable to attend must be able to speak up for their voters.We noted as early as June that the abrupt shut-down of remote participation was bound to leave communities unrepresented as the pandemic continued to rage. The Commons took a step backwards in ending this too early.MPs and voters need consistency and transparent standards for how these crucial democratic decisions are made.We can#t have ato the conga line chaos we saw in June, or the decisions simply being made on a whim by a minister.MPs need clarity about how they can continue to represent their voters during this stark second wave and beyond.There must be far greater transparency over how these decisions on participation are made, rather than ministers being forced to act at the last moment.Since some MPs may be isolating or not safe to travel in person, there’s a real threat for democratic representation and political equalityremote participation continues to be strictly limited or indeed denied. Virtual proceedings in the summer were a real success in bringing parliament into the st century. Let’s learn from that and ensure all voters are heard.Darren Hughes, chief executive, the Electoral Reform Society.Sir,SNP ministers must outline how they are planning for a Covid- vaccine rollout across Scotland.People are understandably feeling positive about a potential vaccine for coronavirus, which is why it is critical for the SNP government to lay out the detail of its roll-out plans as a matter of urgency.We can ill-afford to repeat the same mistakes we saw with the flu vaccination earlier this year.Ministers need to set out what infrastructure is being put in place right now so they are ahead of the game when it comes to rolling out any vaccine across Scotland when it becomes available, and doing so fairly and effectively.Getting this right will be particularly important for the Highlands and Islands with our dispersed population and challenging geography.We must be assured that our region does not end up playing catch-up with the central belt which is an understandable concern locally, given the track record of this government in other matters affecting us.Donald Cameron, Highlands and Islands MSP and Shadow Health Secretary.Sir,In the recent storms  houses at Bruach Gorm, Port Charlotte, using the communal West Highland Housing Association satellite dish lost half their sky channels including BBC  and STV.As I write, it#s been  working days since at least three of us that I know reported the issue to West Highland, but not a word of a fix date.The dish has done well for  years, but things degrade over time. I had an inkling this year there would be a dish problem and in the summer I bought a TV aerial kit for £ # a lot cheaper than fitting a dish.I put the aerial in the loft and there is a good reception, with BBC  and STV back. It is storm proof in the loft, though was disappointed with the lack of channels from the Bowmore transmitter.I Googled it and the mast is a Freeview Light and lacks channels other UK areas enjoy. I use Sky HD freeview channels but with Sky you have to navigate the TV guide through all the blocked subscription channels to find the one you want to watch. Via the Bowmore mast the TV guide just lists the the Freeview channels, which is great.Freeview said that there were more channels available on main transmitters than there was on relay transmitters, which play a vital role in providing more remote areas with TV coverage.There are a lot of aerials on houses and I think Islay#s TV transmitters should get an upgrade to the same channels as other areas expect.I will also raise this issue with those elected to improve our lives, including our MSP, MP, council leader Councillor Currie and Councillor Horn.Colin M Campbell, Port Charlotte, Isle of Islay.Sir,I think we all need a boost of positive news, so I would like to appeal to your readers to give a brave and special young person in your area the credit they deserve by nominating them for the  WellChild Awards.We are looking for inspirational children and young people who have defied the odds in the face of serious illness and the selfless nurses, doctors, brothers, sisters and friends who help care for them.This is your opportunity to give them the recognition they deserve at a prestigious event regularly attended by WellChild Patron, The Duke of Sussex.Nominations are open now so please get yours in before the closing date on Monday December  at noon.

Usually we look forward to the Christmas lights and decorations brightening up the dark winter nights and bringing hope and cheer.This year, we wait and wonder. We wonder what level our area will be in, we wonder what level our family and friends will be in, we wonderwe will be able to see them or have them in our homes or go to their homes.We wonder. We watch the news and hope restrictions will be eased, but we are afraid of that too, as this could lead to the virus spreading. So we wait and watch and wonder – a bit like the shepherds of old, gathered on the hillside, waiting and watching and wondering.It has been a tough few months and for many it has been a gruelling and harrowing few months.How do we celebrate in such times Yet, I have heard so many people say: #Well I’m going to put up my tree and I’m going to do it early to bring some cheer into our lives.#We are a people of hope, even in the darkest days.We wait in the darkness for we know that even the darkest night has the first streaks of dawn to lighten the sky.So as we approach the time of preparing to welcome the Christ child once again, we will wait hopefully."},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor november 27 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

The current bus stop and car park at the head of Glen Croe would also be bypassed. This is an important public transport link for local residents.The consultation launched by the Scottish Government’s Transport Secretary, Michael Matheson is a muddled exercise. It confuses the urgent need to decide on an alternative route for a new road through Glen Croe with the much longer-term strategic transport options for improving connectivity between Argyll and west-central Scotland.Most of the strategic options involve a number of new civil engineering challenges including the construction of bridges over Loch Long and Loch Fyne and extensive road building, both new and upgraded. For reasons of cost and complexity, none of these options are likely to be implemented within this decade.Whatever long-term strategy options may be investigated for their feasibility, there remains the urgent need to build a new road in Glen Croe. It will always be necessary to link the communities of Arrochar Tarbetwith Loch Goil, Cairndow, north Loch Fyne, Inveraray and beyond with the A.I note that both my local community council in Loch Goil and Argyll and Bute Council support the route that follows the existing forest track on the opposite side of the glen from the Rest and Be Thankful without a similar risk of landslides. Compared with the strategic options, this is a modestof road to construct.The sooner that steps are taken to realise this solution the better it will be for all who currently suffer the increasingly frequent road closures due to climate change and the unstable hill.Alastair R Moodie, LochgoilheadSir,Every year thousands of children contact Childline about being bullied online and tell us that they feel it is hard to escape from.Lockdown has intensied these feelings for many and since April we’ve counselled more than , children and young people across the UK about online bullying.Children have told us about people sending threatening or abusive messages and being pressured into engaging in sexual conversations. Others have shared that they’ve been excluded from online games by other children, while some spoke of online identities being stolen to embarrass or cause trouble while using their name.Before lockdown measures were first introduced this year, the average monthly number of counselling session with children about online bullying was . Between April and October that value increased by  per cent to a monthly average of .This is worrying, particularly as we continue to adhere to strict social-distancing restrictions across Scotland and children continue to spend more time online. Bullying can have a long-term impact on the mental wellbeing of a child and, as we mark Anti Bullying Week this month and beyond, it’s important to ensure that every child knows who they can turn to for support.If a parent thinks their child is being bullied online, it can be hard to remain calm, but it’s crucial not to overwhelm a child with questions. Taking their device away is likely to make them feel like whatever has happened is their fault instead, it’s helpful to listen to their worries, suggest they take some time away from certain apps, and provide them with reassurance.Adeniyi Alade, service head of Childline at NSPCC ScotlandSir,Boris Johnson’s comment that devolution has been #a disaster north of the border# and #Tony Blair’s worst mistake# should hardly come as a surprise to anyone.The Tories have never been great supporters of devolution, vehemently opposing both the referendums in  on establishing a Scottish Assembly and in  on the Scottish Parliament.Most recently the devolution power grab that is highlighted in the Internal Market Bill simply reinforces this stance.The Scottish Social Attitudes surveyon constitutional preference found that only seven per cent favour abolition of the Scottish Parliament and it found that trust in the Scottish Government sits at four times that of the UK Government. This points to it hardly being a disaster.For those accused of scaremongering that there is a threat to Holyrood, Mr Johnson’s comments are clear vindication. The irony of all this being that devolution has given new le to the Scottish Conservatives after its wipe out in  and it is now the opposition in the Scottish Parliament.Be under no doubt that the Scottish Parliament, which was hard fought for, is under threat and we must do all in our power to defend it.Alex Orr, Edinburgh"},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures november 27 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

Why  Because this modication very effectively protects moths from becoming bat-fodder.Butterflies are active during the day but moths are mostly nocturnal. And under the night sky moths make a tasty meal for insectivorous bats. These tiny mammals detect their prey by echo-location, a method of hunting that involves emitting repeated ultrasonic squeaks, generally with a dominant frequency range of - kilohertz . Their prey is then located from the direction of the ing echoes.Moths have evolved ious mechanisms to evade these predators: some have developed ears that detect bat echolocation calls, allowing them to take evasive action, but others, the earless moths, have to rely on passive defences – so-called acoustic camouflage # that is, their hairy thoraces.Comparing tomographic echo images from two species of earless moths with two species of diurnal butterflies, the Bristol scientists found very little effect on the ultrasound echoes from the thin layer of thoracic scales of butterflies. In contrast, the hair-like scales covering moth thoraces absorbed around  per cent of the ultrasonic sound energy in the broadband - kHz. This provides clear protection from hunting bats and consequently is a very signicant survival advantage.Addressing the mechanisms behind the ultrasound reduction achieved by moth thoraces, the scientists found that the hair-like scales form a connected network of air pockets, which act as porous ultrasound absorbers. Sound waves entering the network cause air molecules in the pockets to vibrate, thereby dissipating energy and reducing echo reflection.The overall arrangement and microstructure of hair-like moth scales closely resembles man-made fibrous materials designed to absorb sound but, interestingly, the Bristol team showed that the moth scales have a considerably higher absorption capacity. So perhaps we could learn lessons from these small hairy creatures.* J. R. Soc.

This really is it. Nothing .An alternative is to mix up a saltwater solution, soak a towel in it and leave the towel on the windscreen overnight.You might also want to leave the engine running while you de-ice your car, but this poses safety issues and may also be in breach of the Highway Code which states you must not leave a vehicle engine running unnecessarily while that vehicle is stationary on a public road.Theres also the risk the vehicle could get stolenthe keys are left in the ignition.The AA says:Get up at least  minutes early to give you time to prepare the car.Donrsquot drive off like a tank-commander, with a tiny hole cleared in the windscreen.Clear all windows using a scraper and de-icer.

We hear the BBCs Europe Editor, Katya Adler, telling us night after night that she doesnt know whats going on.

Why, the Scottish Government tells us that EU competition rules will still prevent it saving the construction firm BiFab after we leave in January.Could there have been a better way  Could this all have been over, done and dusted, four years agoonly the opposition politicians had accepted the result of the  EU referendum  The left-wingcolumnist, Owen Jones, has provoked apoplexy amongst his pro-EU readers by claiming precisely this. ldquoHard Remainers, he says, tried to reverse the  vote instead of pushing for a softer Brexit, ldquonow were all paying the price.\"Of course, the ones principally to blame for the Brexit imbroglio are successive Tory prime ministers since David Cameron. But I think Mr Jones has a point. And it wasnt just Labour and the Liberal Democrats who lost the plot. As I argued at the time, it was bizarre for Nicola Sturgeon to be demanding a repeat referendum, a Peoples Vote, on Brexit when she wouldnt dream of accepting a ldquothink again referendum on Scottish independence.She made this clear when the former PM Sir John Major suggested precisely this last month. He said that Scottish voters should have the right to vote, not just on the principle of Scottish independence, but on the actual separation deal that is negotiated after it. Oh no, said the SNP ndash that would be an abuse of democracy. A votes a vote... yet Ms Sturgeon was eager to march arm-in-arm with Alistair Campbell for a repeat Peoples Vote in London in March . This raised nationalist eyebrows, since she was refusing to appear on Scottish independence marches back home.A votes a vote, said the Brexiters. But it was the wrong kind of vote, said Remainers. There were ious unconvincing arguments offered to deny the validity of the Brexit referendum. People didnt know what they were voting for, did they  They cant be allowed to destroy the economy just because they hate foreigners. They were duped by the Russians and Cambridge Analytica. ldquoThe Great Brexit Robbery: how our democracy was hijacked, shrieked the hyperventilating reporter, Carole Cadwalladr, in her infamous Observer article in May .This became the Great Brexit Conspiracy theory. American billionaires, we were told, had used Cambridge Analyticas sinister algorithms to pervert the Brexit referendum in the interests of, er, Vladimir Putin. #FBPE supporters on Twitter still believe this nonsense, even after it being dismissed by two Commons reports and an exhaustive investigation by the Information Commissioner, Elizabeth Denham.The Brexit vote was not a Russian plot, and the chancers of Cambridge Analytica had nothing to do with it, said Ms Denham. The  referendum was what it was: a peoples vote to leave Brexit. Mr Jones is right that a more constructive approach by the left, one that accepted the validity of the referendum, might have avoided hard Brexit.This isnt just the wisdom of hindsight. Many argued, myself included, that Britain could have remained broadly in the single market through the the European Economic Area and EFTA, of which we were already a member. This was called the Norway-plus option and was offered, off the peg, by Brussels in June .There were problems with it, not least the Irish border, but they were manageable. Brexiters would, and did, claim that it wasnt Brexit because Britain would still be subject to single market rules. But we still are. The EEA at least honoured Brexit by taking Britain out of the political institutions of Europe. The EEA was originally designed in  to accommodate Norway, which had voted against the European Union. It provided trading continuity and a safe space for the UK to sort itself out.If the opposition parties had united with Tory Remainers, Theresa May could have kept the UK in the single market. That, after all, is what she tried to do in her Withdrawal Deal which attempted, disingenuously, to use the Irish backstop as a means of keeping the entire UK, not just Northern Ireland, within the rules of the single market.The opposition parties failed to agree on any of the soft Brexit options in . They were more interested in trying to undermine a weak Tory Government. Intoxicated by hectic, late-night parliamentary victories that actually meant nothing. Seduced by the delusion that the Brexit vote could be reversed. All that did was infuriate Brexit voters, who then turned the  General Election into their own Peoples Vote.Is it worth going over all this again  Probably not. But as a second Scottish independence referendum looms on the horizon, there are lessons clearly to be learned from Brexit. The first being that referendums are rarely just about the issue on the ballot paper. Brexit was also about inequality, immigration, industrial decline.Second, that it is hard for countries to leave voluntary unions, unless the parties involved are very clear about what leaving actually means. Third, that half a loaf is better than none. And finally:you hold a referendum youd bloody well better accept the result.Our columns are a  for writers to express their opinions.

The network is made up of  bureaux across Scotland, as well as our Extra Help Unit helping consumers with specialist energy and post advice.Figures released by Citizens Advice Scotland this week show that our network unlocked a staggering poundmillion for people in the financial year  . Thatrsquos a pound million increase on the year before.These gains mean that for every pound invested in core advice funding the network delivered pound for people.Thatrsquos an extraordinaryof investment and real value for money, as well as a means towards inclusive growth, with these gains being unlocked for people more likely to be struggling financially in the first place and ensures wider dignity and well-being. Additionally, these s are spread throughout communities across the country, rather than focused in one place. Building community wealth across every corner of Scotland. We know councils in particular face incredibly dficult challenges when it comes to spending, and their statutory duties often means much of that spending is often accounted for before officers or councillors can consider other priorities. We have seen this year real collaboration across all sectors to deliver outcomes, and for me it is simply not an option to go back in these challenging times to previous habits of viewing statutory services as more important than other public services such as CABs.The pandemic and demand for essential services, particularly CABs, means the idea of having to prioritise fixing potholes over funding anti-poverty measures is outdated and needs to be addressed.Some may read this and think lsquohold on, you would say that.rsquo But I say it because it is simply true. Funding CABs is a sound investment from an economic and social justice perspective. Itrsquos putting money into peoplersquos pockets that can be spent locally, and reduces strain on other social services as a result and through increased awareness of their rights, hard-wires future resilience into local communities.Many of our clients turn to us at a point of crisis, suffering from serious anxiety and worry, and CABs actions reduce costs which would otherwise fall on other organisations.When CAS researched client satisfaction earlier this year, people told us about the dference friendly, calm, knowledgeable and understanding advisers made. One client said that ldquoWhen the adviser said she could definitely help, I started to cry. But she was so comforting and patient and I was able to go on. She has phoned me since to seeI am alright.People were less anxious having had help from a CAB, even when an issue couldnrsquot be resolved to their liking ndash it gave them certainty and peace of mind.The survey found  per cent of clients were satisfied with the service provided by CAB, and would recommend the service to others. It would be fair to say we are all proud of these findings. The restrictions that have been so necessary this year fundamentally changed the way of le for many of us. There was a risk people could be left behind, but CABs across Scotland didnrsquot miss a beat, with thousands of people transitioning to remote working and advising by telephone, email, web chat. Since August, face to face advice for the most vulnerable clients with the most complex needs has resumed.As a result of that, the network has issued over , pieces of advice since April till the end of November.The challenges of this crisis means nearly two thirds of people accessing our services today have never used a CAB before. We welcome this, but it brings the need to be properly resourced to continue to provide the modern, holistic services we have become known for. We unlocked pound. billion for people in the decade following , despite welfare reform and the growth in insecure work. We could do so much morethe mistakes following the last financial crash are not repeated and governments truly do invest to deliver inclusive growth.National and local policymakers grappling with how we come out of this pandemic with a stronger and fairer society should understand that an investment in CABs offers fabulous value for money and is in the best interests of communities across Scotland.

From the northern isles’ perspective, we see it rather dferently. The pandemic has shown us what is possible for other people because so many people in my constituency are left bumping along on speeds that are less than  megabits per second.“I joined the st century just a couple of weeks ago, when I bought myself an iPhone , which has G capability. I speed tested it as I was coming up for the debate today. I got a speed test of  megabits per second download and  megabits per second upload. We have spoken for years about a digital ide, but that ide is now a chasm.“For Orkney and Shetland, the idea that internet speeds and access to the internet should be more than  times greater in SW than in KW,  and , and ZE,  and  illustrates the nature of the problem we face. It speaks eloquently about the failure. Simply leaving it to the private sector is what has produced the situation today.“My hon. Friend the Member for Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross [Jamie Stone] asked “Who is responsible for this ” We have this constantly in Scotland: on the one hand, there is the provision made by the Scottish Government and, on the other, we have schemes funded by the UK Government. The dficulty is that neither of them gives us what we need.“This House legislated for a universal service in broadband. Constituents of mine get quotes from BT for that and they hear of £,, £, or £, for a broadband connection to get them to  megabits per second. If that is only available to people who have a spare £,, £, or £, lying around the house, it is hardly a universal service.“However, my constituents are also frustrated at the lack of certainty and community consultation we see from the R scheme of the Scottish Government. We still do not know what they are going to deliver and when we are going to get it. All the signs are that the problems that we have had—a service to be deployed in the isles that is designed in Edinburgh what people in Edinburgh think we can get and we need—are going to be there again. The most remote and the most economically fragile communities in my constituency still risk being left behind.“It should not be rocket science. Surely, with a bit of will, the Governments could speak to each other and do better than this.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Another would involve a change to soft drink sales.She added: “We have a drinks chiller at the front but were looking at introducing a bar restaurant-style system where fizzy drinks come from mixer taps.“If we could get something like that, we would be saving not just on bottles but also the water used for these which is transported around the country and is another waste.“That is quite a big investment, though, so I wouldn’t be able to consider that without a grant.”Zero Waste Scotland has said it will administer a total of £, in grant funding provided by the Scottish Government and European Regional Development Fund to empower island shops to take the next steps in the war on waste by ditching single-use packaging and moving to reusable options.It says that the new scheme would see cash made available to existing small and medium-sized enterprises in the isles to make the transition to package free dispensers.“My shop is so small, it is not just about fitting in the new stuff but also about moving everything  around so I don’t lose the things that I sell which enables me to pay staff and support the local community,” she said.“We have tried to do what we can within our budget. We do glass milk bottles for people, we have dispensing units for refills for washing up liquid and laundry liquid.“There are things that I have looked at that we can do, and sothey had just given us that money I applied for then I would have been really happy!”The scheme opened on th October, but Nancy stressed that wasn’t a great deal of time for small business owners like her.“It sounds like a lot of time but when you are running a shop it isn’t very long. We had to get three dferent quotes for some of these things,” she said.“I’m in the shop five and a half days a week — and my afternoons off have been spent on the phone and the internet scoping out possible projects. I don’t really have the extra time it takes to do it.”She added: “If I can’t come out with a scheme then we don#t get anything is my understanding at the moment.“I know it is worth putting a bit of effort in, though, becauseit does work I can really make a dference to the shop and the environment.”"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/kate-forbes.jpg","title":"summit on future of gaelic as a community","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineThe summit on Tuesday st December, pm, will be co-chaired by Kate Forbes, constituency MSP for Skye, Lochaber and Badenoch.

There are still plenty of people in Skye and Raasay with Gaelic, and it can still be heard throughout the island.“Urgent work is required to save Gaelic, but as a living language it won’t be politicians, bureaucracy or tokenistic gestures that make the dference. Ultimately, it will be those people for whom it is the language of daily le that can reverse the decline.“I hope this summit will be a fruitful exercise in doing that.”Councillor Munro said: “It’s extremely important that Gaelic communities in Skye and Raasay have an opportunity to have their voices heard. The recent research by Soillse clearly sets out the challenges facing Gaelic in terms of usage and transmission.“Now is the time to consult with communities and to set the agenda for language policy and planning efforts.

This includes users of all ages and levels of mobility – cyclists, walkers, runners and wheelchair and mobility vehicle users.The route has been chosen to promote active travel, link communities, improve local access, and act as a springboard for an island-wide network of safe paths.The project group has lodged a planning application for the Skye Bridge to Ashaig Airstrip section of the route, following the old A road where possible. And they are now starting on a detailed consultation for a link between Ashaig and Broadford.In March the project group held a community consultation on the three possible routes for this section. It was concluded that the single track ‘committee road’ option running through Breakish would give the best compromise between a quiet, scenic, low-traffic area, and the straightest, most direct route. This was the link most favoured by public consultees. met with supporters of the project outside Breakish Hall to find out what the Skye Cycle Way would mean to them.Broadford Primary pupil Krista said a cycle path would allow her and other children to do what they loved without any worries.She said: “For little kids that want to do more cycling it would be safer because just a little slip off the pavement could lead to a road accidentthere’s a car coming, so I think the cycle path would be really handy.“It wouldn’t put me at risk of traffic and it would mean I just go out and cycle.”Breakish resident Lis Phillips felt the cycle way could help recapture the feeling of safety for cyclists experienced during the lockdown.She said: “I cycle back and forth to my work at Broadford surgery, and during the lockdown, I noticed people on bikes who I’ve never seen cycling before because there were hardly any cars on the roads.“There is obviously an appetite for people to be able to cycle but they don’t feel it is safe, so they don’t do it.”The project group has been working with engineering consultants and main funder Sustrans, to come up with a design proposal for the route that will meet their requirements.The plans involve separating cyclists from pedestrians and other users. Cyclists would share the single-track carriageway with motor traffic, and pedestrians would enjoy a new . metre wide footpath. that the safer environment would help pupils thrive.“There is no way to avoid traffic when you are living here in Broadford, it is so busy – all the traffic that comes through Skye comes through us. So for the children, it was quite daunting to let them out on their bikes through the village.“However, during the lockdown, they were out on bikes, and more of them were cycling than ever before. You are seeing fitter and healthy children with just that bit more independence and freedom.“The cycle way is a wonderful thing.”Kyleakin resident Ian Sikorski, who has a family house in the area, earmarked the best route between Ashaig and Broadford through the community consultation and said: “Hopefully people will see the necessity for it. We have the house at the end of the ‘committee road’ beside the cattle grid.“My auntie lived there, and at that time there weren’t many houses at all. Now look at the number, and in another  years there will probably be twice the number – and you have seen the state of the road, so it badly needs a footpath.“Highland Council should have put in a footpath really. It is definitely needed. If people with families are going to build houses then it would be greatthey are able to walk and cycle along to Broadford or Kyleakin.“I used to cycle up that main road, regularly.

As well as the council, the plan involves Highlands and Islands Enterprise and the Scottish Futures Trust.All three agencies will help identy funding, once the list of projects has been agreed under five broad headings: Strengthening communities, health and education, sustainable tourism, digital and transport infrastructure and a erse and green economy.This week, following an online area committee meeting, Skye and Raasay councillors welcomed the progress to date .Tourism body SkyeConnect also welcomed the potential for the plan to deliver material benefits for the island.A spokesman added: “The priorities for SkyeConnect are, unsurprisingly, additional toilet facilities, road improvements, car parking and a greater provision of ’stop-over’ locations for campervans with appropriate basic infrastructure. In addition, SkyeConnect is working with a number of bodies to develop a so-called ‘internet of things’ which will greatly assist in managing the flow of visitors around the island.”The ‘internet of things’ concept sees digital infrastructure providing real time information on traffic flow and footfall at key locations. This can then be used to send mobile alerts to visitors with suggestions for alternative sites that are not too busy.John Gordonwas pleased the plan was “progressing well” as it had been a priority for Skye and Raasay councillors for some time. He also thought that upgrading Portree harbour would be an ideal project.“This update is encouraging and is an exciting development for Skye and Raasay,” he added. “Over the last few years we have seen some great partnership working at ious tourist hot-spots that has attracted some investment which has made a signicant dference, but we acknowledge there is much to do, and major investment is still needed.“The local area committee and partners are ambitious for Skye and Raasay and this investment plan which spells out actions for coordinating and securing funding and for the implementation of the plan.”Calum Munro highlighted the redevelopment of Uig harbour as a possible candidate for inclusion.He added: “The development of the Skye and Raasay investment plan is at an important and exciting phase as over the next two months stakeholders gather to engage with all the potential projects which will be part of that plan. It will be great to look at projects and see which ones best achieve the outcomes we want to see for Skye and Raasay in terms of infrastructure, strengthening communities, health and education, developing a green and erse economy and sustainable tourism.“Looking at these projects and identying interconnectedness and partnership opportunities is crucial and it’s clear that to bring in the required investment there needs to be an approach which is strategic and cohesive.“We are now at the stage where virtually the whole of Skye and Raasay have formed community trusts so I’m really looking forward to seeing some of these communities building on the work they’ve already done and achieving some of their other ambitions over the next two-three years.”Calum MacLeod said: “I’d like to see a collaborative economic recovery plan continuing with all relevant stakeholders’ involvement that is essential to address the Covid impact, and also a continuing plan to address at pace more attainable affordable housing. “The plan would also be a great opportunity to improve sustainable green tourism including better public transport infrastructure and the Skye cycle path.“It is a necessity to see trunk road agencies working closer together in achieving better and safer measures for all road users and residents working with councillors. The good work and investment that has been established to date on improving ious key projects should continue going forward towards full development.”For John Finlayson, a place-based and joined up Skye plan is “long overdue” and it was essential that the public sector, businesses, community interests and the wider community “work together to support economic recovery and development taking account of the unique challenges and the unique opportunities” in the Eilean a’ Cheo ward.He added: “The key areas of focus in what has to be an outcome driven plan and which were included in the report to the area committee are strong starting points for further community discussion and engagement. But I doubt many willargue that strengthening communities, health and education, sustainable tourism, digital and transport infrastructure and a erse and green economy are not areas we need to focus on.“I personally have a strong commitment to ensuring the best for our young people. This of course means that we need to make sure that our children are educated in st century buildings which provide safe, healthy and modern learning environments and I will continue to champion the need to build new schools at Broadford and Dunvegan.”"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/CROFTING-SHEEP-1.jpg","title":"the rams are out to mark the start of the crofting","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineWith most now looking ahead to the year-end celebrations and festive reflections, the shortened daylight hours of late autumn and winter actually mark the start of the crofting year, certainly for those whose main interest is livestock, which is the vast majority.This is the time when the rams go out with the ewes, everything bar breeding stock has more or less been sold and it’s time to hunker down for the long winter ahead.Sheep have a natural production cycle which fits the seasonal patterns. As the days shorten, they naturally come on “season” ready for the ram, so that their lambs hit the ground with the new flush of spring grass. Mother Nature never ceases to amaze.Cows, on the other hand, can breed all-year, with the same gestation period as humans, though most calve in or around the spring, for much the same reason as sheep.But late autumn is when you start with a blank canvas. The next few weeks and months are all about ensuring everything has enough feed and reserves to carry it through the cold and wet – but especially the wet.I’ve heard many an old-timer say that the cold and wind rarely bother the animals. It’s the wet that really has an impact, as the lack of a dry lying area just saps their reserves.The financial s from a few animals are just too low to justy expenditure on large sheds and then there’s the cost of bedding. In conversation with a mainland farmer, I happened to remark that it cost us in Lewis north of £ for a big bale of bedding straw, sometimes £. He was getting it at £. He was in no doubt that at these prices it was completely unsustainable to have cattle inside for anyof time.If it’s a crisp, frosty winter, the cattle aren’t much of a problem. But the incessant rain can become a depressing drudge as you constantly battle the mud and dampness. With most crofters having a full-time job, you can see why so many just concentrate on keeping a few sheep – they don’t poach the ground nearly as much and, for quite obvious reasons, require much less feeding.For my own part, I’ve noticed a huge improvement in the grazing and ground since introducing cattle and they’re also vital for accessing environmental funding streams aimed at increasing bioersity.When the better weather finally does come, they’re much less selective in their grazing, meaning they will consume a lot of the harsher grasses, leading to greater rejuvenation of sward. Their dung is an extremely proficient fertiliser that attracts a myriad of insects which, in turn, brings more birdle – a very important consideration in today’s environmentally-conscious times.It’s all pros and cons and weighing up what’s right for your own personal circumstances, time and available infrastructure.But, whatever, it’s crucial to get the winter maintenance regime right so the animals can get off to the best of possible starts and, with a bit of luck, we can settle down to the festivities in a relatively rested frame of mind, however muted the celebrations might all be this year.WHILE we look back on what has been the most tumultuous of years, I hope we don’t forget the massive extra volunteer effort that was needed to carry us through. It was rather gratying to see the best of selfless human endeavour coming through in the worst of crises.At one stage it looked like there would be no livestock sales in the islands. In the greater scheme of things it would hardly have been the worst of outcomes, but it would nevertheless have created huge logistical problems. Fortunately, it did not materialise.The commercial aspect on sale day is overseen by Dingwall and Highland Marts, in the case of Stornoway, Portree and Lochmaddy, and United Auctions in Lochboisdale and the Argyll islands. But it still requires a huge amount of volunteer effort at local level. Even in normal times it is a thankless task to ensure all the animals are in their correct pens and the sale keeps moving along efficiently.Considering social distancing rules and that livestock owners were not allowed to be present on sale day, it must have been all the more challenging this year. So a huge debt of gratitude is owed to all those who ensured the sales went ahead – and relatively smoothly into the bargain. The fact that the prices were so good was a bit of an extra boost, just when we all needed it most."},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_3514204.jpg--.jpg?1607091783000\n","title":"covid 19 vaccinations arrive in northern ireland","story":"Robin Swann has confirmed that the first batch of the Pfizer BioNTech Covid- vaccine has arrived into Northern Ireland.The initial consignment of almost , doses paves the way for vaccinations to commence from early next week, starting with vaccinator teams.Welcoming the arrival, the Health Minister said: “We have been anticipating this news for many months and it is hugely welcome to receive the first batch of the vaccine today.

Three households will be able to come together for this period in domestic settings, outdoor public spaces and places of worship. One of the households will be able to include their existing household bubble. First Minister Arlene Foster said: “Through our collective efforts over recent weeks we gained enough space in the transmission of the virus to relax a signicant number of restrictions, including the opening-up of non-essential retail, close contact services, sport and leisure activities and our places of worship at the end of next week. “These decisions will give families, businesses and employees some much-needed certainty and comfort in the run-up to Christmas and beyond. “This is a special time of the year and we want to support people to have a good Christmas, but also a safe one. “Signicant work has been completed with business sectors, faith groups, local government and police on new mitigation measures to reduce the risk of transmission. “I urge everyone to be Covid-aware and to make careful and sensible decisions when out and about or mixing with others.

Everyone needs to think very carefully about the risks posed to them, and their loved ones, by coming together over the Christmas period, particularly to those who are vulnerable.

This year pupils received grades calculated by their schools as exams were cancelled due to the coronavirus lockdown.Mr Weir has repeatedly insisted that said it remains his priority for the exams to go ahead as planned in .Scotland#s Education Secretary John Swinney announced yesterday that exams there would be cancelled in  because of the disproportionate impact of coronavirus on pupils. Last month the Welsh Government confirmed its  results will be based on classroom assessments due to the impact of the pandemic.Exams in England will go ahead next summer, starting three weeks later than usual.Scotland#s latest decision has put further pressure on the Department for Education here to consider a similar policy.Concerned parent Ruth Oliverfrom Ballymena, who is also a secondary school teacher, launched her petition to Mr Weir last week, which has been signed by over  people to date. She said: All other parts of the UK are giving clear direction, putting the interests and well-being of their young people at the heart of their decisions. When will the young people of NI experience the same consideration  Mum-of-two Ruth is calling for a fair system that takes account of the fact that many students have missed face-to-face teaching due to periods of self-isolation. She added: I want the grades young people achieve to be comparable with their counterparts throughout the UK, as these are the people they will compete against for jobs and employment. I want clarication of what evidence would be requiredexams could not go ahead. Schools are so conscious of building up an evidence bank because of what happened last year that pupils are being tested on a continual basis and whilst the intent behind this is good and one that adults can rationalise, it is causing anxiety amongst many young people, who are conscientious and worried thatthey don#t excel in every test they will miss a grade.We see on a daily basis the reality of school le for our young people, the challenges they face and the struggles that exist. I think they are coping really well but they are dealing with a lot and need us to be on their side, for us to fight for them to have a fair chance, Ruth said. Addressing the Assembly yesterday, Mr Weir said cancelling exams in Northern Ireland next year would put students at a disadvantage over pupils in Great Britain and the Irish Republic who would be taking exams.If we were the only jurisdiction that in all forms was abandoning examinations, where would that leave some of our students when making comparisons when it comes to university places and obtaining those places So, rather than snatching at a populist headline we#ve actually got to think this through as to where it actually leaves our students in that regard, he added. The minister said he would also not intervene to force secondary schools to ditch academic selection.Mr Weir stressed it was for schools to determine their entrance qualication and said some that had decided to abandon the transfer test this year were instead using genetics, referencing criteria such as whether a parent or sibling attended previously.Whatever criticisms are there from the point of view of academic selection, at least it is on the basis of the inidual merits of the applicant, he said.Mr Weir said he would not be the minister who destroyed the grammar school system, adding: I#m not intending to force academic selection on anyone but neither am I intending to take that right away from schools.Belfast Most ReadNI company boss cleared of shoplting from Tesco as judge dismisses #nonsense# caseCoronavirus Northern Ireland: Department of Health reveals vaccine roll-out plans as a further  deaths reported Armagh’s All-Ireland celebrations set to be probed by sports body as county denies IRA singingUK and EU reach agreement on NI trade and border checksWe didn#t know she#d be first in the world: NI family#s pride as Margaret Keenan gets first Covid vaccineLatest NewsSmart home tech isn#t fully trusted, QUB study revealsSum achievement...

Reflecting on their delayed wedding plans, Lauren, who is a professional wedding photographer, explained that the original idea was to reschedule their wedding for April  - but her diary quickly filled up with other couples reorganising their own weddings.We also said to ourselves, #What are we waiting for, we just want to get married#, so we decided to stick with a date in November that we had arranged when the original day was cancelled, she said.A stressful few months later and amid restrictions changing regularly, the couple eventually got their big day last week.Much to Jason#s surprise and delight, four fully kitted out leboat crew members representing the station, were waiting outside the Arcadia in Portrush following the ceremony to provide a socially distanced guard of honour to wish the couple well.We could only have  guests along with Jason, myself and our two children but we were able to set up a live stream that allowed everybody  who should have been there to watch, Lauren said. Everyone went to such efforts in getting dressed up for the occasion and to join us in the wedding virtually.She continued: When it was over, we went for takeaway coffee and sat on the harbour overlooking the leboat station. Then we went home, had a takeaway and had our first dance in the kitchen.With her husband on the leboat crew in Portrush, Lauren knows all too well how important it is for volunteers to have the right lesaving kit and personal protection equipment.I am very proud that Jason is a volunteer but I do also worry when the pager beeps and he is called out to save others who are in trouble, she said. There is always such a sense of relief when he helps to bring those in dficulty back to safety but also when he s home safely himself.From the moment I met Jason, the RNLI pager became a part of my le too. The leboat has always been in Jason#s blood and he comes from a long family line who have been involved in helping to save lives at sea for generations.Lauren urged people to donate to the RNLI#s Christmas appeal, while Jason added that any donation would make a huge dference to the charity as it provides lesaving services.The best Christmas gt RNLI volunteers like me can wish for is a kind donation to our Christmas appeal, he said.

I can#t thank May and the NHS staff enough for looking after me.My advice to anyone offered this vaccine is to take it. If I can have it at , then you can have it too.Mrs Keenan, who will receive a booster jab in three weeks, was the first patient at dozens of hospital hubs across the UK administering the Pfizer vaccine on what the emotional Health Secretary, Matt Hancock, dubbed V-Day.Not long after Mrs Keenan made history, Dundrum nursing sister Joanna Sloan became the first person to receive the jab in Northern Ireland.The -year-old said she hoped her five-year-old daughter, Cailie, would be impressed by what she had done, adding that she felt emotional at being part of such a momentous occasion.Ms Sloan, who manages the Belfast Trust#s vaccination centre, had to put her wedding on hold this year because of the pandemic.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseJoanna Sloan receives the vaccinePA FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":trueJoanna Sloan receives the vaccine She is now due to get married in April next year.This feels like the last hurdle towards keeping people safe - myself and everyone around me, she said.I#ve been looking forward to this for so long and it feels great.

Additionally, the number of people who are trialled or being trialled are comparable to a regular vaccine efficacy trial. Therefore, no corner has been cut on testing, evaluation and determining safety of the Covid- vaccine. The vaccine causes infertility autism etc.Most of vaccine-related side effects or complications are short-lived and appear within days of vaccination. The side-effects of Pfizer#s mRNA vaccine are mild and include fatigueand headachesafter the second dose. During the Pfizer vaccine trials in thousands of volunteers, no long-term disabilities such as infertility or autism were reported.The vaccine will give you Covid-.Most of the promising vaccine candidates including Moderna, Pfizer or AstraZeneca vaccines only use a portion of the SARS-CoV- virus which by itself can#t cause disease. Therefore, none of the approved vaccines can give disease in vaccinated people. Instead, these vaccines protect people from getting severely sick who could otherwise end up in hospital or ICUs.I get my flu jab - I don#t need a Covid  vaccination as well.The flu jab can#t protect people from Covid- infection. Therefore, to safeguard from both diseases, two vaccines - each specically designed for flu and Covid- - are required. The flu jab is even more important this season due to possible increase in Covid- infection after the festive season in January and February. The vaccine is unsuitable for those with weakened immune systems or existing conditions.There are dferent kind of vaccines to do the same job - protection from infections. Some of these vaccines, particularly live attenuated vaccinesmay not be suitable for people how are on immune-suppressive drugs, chemotherapy or have immune compromising conditions. However, the currently rolled out Pfizer BioNtech vaccine is based on mRNA technology and can safely be applied in these vulnerable communities. The vaccine contains a microchip to track those who get it.This is a myth and there is no scientic backing to this misinformation. All vaccines carry genetic instruction of the virus so that these components of the virus can be presented to our immune system to establish immunity. After this immunity is established, the person is no longer susceptible to the virus and therefore will be safeguarded from severe form of the infection. These genetic instructions are only short-livedand thereafter these are removed through our body#s clearing mechanisms within days. Importantly, the virus genetic instructions in the vaccines are delivered to our cell cytoplasm whereas our DNA is in the nucleus. Therefore, integration of the vaccine encoded instructions can#t reach to nucleus and thus can#t permanently integrate to be tracked. The Pfizer vaccine is based on mRNA technology and RNA can#t be microchipped to DNA as these are not compatible. The vaccine will be used to control people through G cell phone towers.The vaccine contains components of the viruses to train our immune system and these molecules are only controlled by our body cellular and metabolic machinery. Therefore, G mobile phone signals can#t transmit the virus or reduce our defences to attract viruses.The mooted travel and hospitality passports are designed for the government to police people#s behaviour.We are dealing with a deadly virus that has killed more people in a single year than HIV, flu, Ebola did. Therefore, it is a personal, moral and administrative responsibility to ensure at least % coverage of the vaccine so that herd immunity through vaccination is achieved to break the transmission chain of the SARS-CoV-.If everyone  gets the vaccine, I don#t need to.With a % effective vaccine, we need to immunize  out of every  people in a population. This means there will be people within the community who can#t be vaccinated due to their medical complications. This poses a societal responsibility for everyone to take part in vaccination campaign. Herd immunity is a better solution. It would be better to get Covid-.Herd immunity is an established and probably ultimate solution getting out of Covid- pandemic. The question lies how we would achieve herd immunity - either through natural course of infection or through vaccination. In the former case, we will lose signicant lives, people will develop long Covid, and this expensive way of immunity might last only for a year which means the whole process needs to be started again multiple times. The vaccine-induced herd immunity is the safe, plausible and legitimate way out of this crisis. This vaccine has been rolled out too fast.It is true that the timeline for the Covid- vaccine from concept to reality has been in a short one-year time. However, this squeeze in time has been due to re-purposed technologies, cutting short administration, availability of funds and willingness of people to participate in clinical trials. Additionally, the number of people who have been trialled in safety and efficacy studies are comparable to participants in regular vaccine assessment process. Therefore, approval from regulatory bodies is an assurance for its safety and effectiveness. Why is there a vaccine for a disease with such a high survival rate The vast majority of people infected will survive and many will not even notice the clinical signs . However, people who are infected asymptomatically may pass the infection to people with underlying conditions. Finally, while we have learned a signicant number of facts about the virus, there are still fundamental questions that need illustration. For example, people developing #long covid# may become a norm in the long-term, necessitating the importance of vaccines to break the community spread of the virus.

The protocol means Northern Ireland will continue as part of the single market, subject to customs union rules and therefore avoiding tarfs.Read MoreMargaret Canning:OpinionNI Protocol accord may be more important for le here than any Brexit free trade pactIrish Sea Brexit trade deal done after UK drops plan to ignore lawDr Branston co-authored the paper What Does Brexit Mean For UK Tobacco Control  The report, which appeared in the International Journal of Drug Policy, said: With % of UK tobacco products originating from the EU in recent years, a no-deal Brexit is likely to raise cigarette and tobacco prices. The Treasury has committed to apply new UK import tarfs on tobacco from January .If passed onto consumers,would increase the average price of a typical -pack of cigarettes by around p and a g pouch of roll-your-own tobacco by £..The benefits of Brexit-related flexibility will not extend to Northern Ireland, which will be considered part of the EU customs union, following EU rules and where imports to and from the EU will be tarf-free.Askedthe dferential could mean weekend visitors to Northern Ireland load up on tobacco products, Dr Branston said: You could buy unlimited quantities for personal use and have your suitcase full. Whether you#d do that for p for a packet of , I don#t know. Butit#s a £. saving on a brand of rolling tobacco, and that#s the brand that you smoke, then that#s quite a strong incentive.Dr Branston said Brexit could also bring more flexibility in how tobacco is taxed in Britain, which could again widen the price gap with Northern Irelandlevies are increased. A box of  Marlboro Gold cigarettes costs just over £ in the UK, while a g bag of rolling tobacco costs around £. Ballymena newsagent Eugene Diamond said he hoped lower cigarette prices would help retailers. It could be an asset to retailerswe can offer a competitive price compared to people who smuggle cigarettes, he added. Smuggling is a big, big problem, and we have not only to contend with smuggled cigarettes from places like Russia, but with counterfeit cigarettes as well.Dr Branston said Northern Ireland would also retain the EU#s photograph health warnings on tobacco packaging, whereas the remainder of the UK will switch to using Australian imagery. That is not because trading on World Trade Organisation terms after a no-deal Brexit is commonly referred to as an Australia-type deal. It#s simply because there are a small number of countries in the world which lead on tobacco control, explained Dr Branston. The UK happens to be one of those. So are Australia and New Zealand, for example.Given that you can#t use European , you can try and create loads yourself, but it happens the Australian ones do what we want, so the UK has signed a deal to use those.Belfast Related ContentNews Analysis PremiumMargaret CanningOpinionNI Protocol accord may be more important for le here than any Brexit free trade pactEven the most ardent supporter of Brexit in Northern Ireland could not have discerned anything but storm clouds in the complex outworkings of the NI Protocol - never mind the sunlit uplands of Brexiteers# dreams.GalleryNorthern IrelandIrish Sea Brexit trade deal done after UK drops plan to ignore lawBusinesses say they need more detail of a new UK-EU deal on trade flow to Northern Ireland from across the Irish Sea - which includes measures to safeguard the supply of goods onto supermarket shelves here.

She would have given you the last penny in her purse. She would have loved putting on a big hat and playing Lady Bountul all over the place, and she’d have had the money given away faster than me.”Frances added: “For the anniversary of my mum’s death I was running a knitting company and I made packs of blankets and hats and jumpers for the premature baby unit. I’ve never turned my back where there was a need I came across my entire le.”To date, the Co Down lottery winner, who was speaking publicly for the first time, said they have given away half of their fortune to others in the biggest ever Lottery giveaway, helping “thousands” of people, with Frances having lost count of “the number of times I’ve cried my eyes out” following a recipient’s response to her generosity.Frances dismissed suggestions that new found wealth could be as much a burden as a blessing.“This is just love and joy on a permanent basis,” she said.“How could this be a burden  It’s just like winning the lottery every day.”Yet, Frances, who suffers from a medical condition that has her destined for a wheelchair, is also all too aware that fabulous wealth can’t buy you everything.“My auntie told me I had Perthes’ disease as a kid,” she revealed.“When I was a baby I had a big metal frame around my hips my dad used to be able to pick me up with the back of the frame.“I just managed. I’ve always done plenty of sport but about  years ago my cruciate ligament went and all of a sudden the joints went so my mobility is really poor.”She told how she spent years “sitting on a chair, unable to go anywhere or do anything”.“I actually spent about three years in Northern Ireland sitting on a chair because I couldn’t really go anywhere or do anything,” she confided.“I had an operation the year before we won the lottery and it has got me back on my feet again for a bit but I will eventually not be able to walk so I’m preparing for that.”But Frances told the Belfastthat it’s not something that scares her at all.The mother of three daughters — Katrinaand twins Natalie and Fiona— added: “What can you do about it  You just have to get on with it.”She also revealed to this newspaper that her health condition was a factor in her choice of home. Although she had her heart set on a bungalow, estate agents insisted on showing her a castle and a -bed stately home which came with an entire village “somewhere in the north east” of England.But she’s perfectly happy in her current abode — “a five bedroom, brick-built house with good sized rooms and a couple of acres of garden” which she “found on the internet”.The Connollys’ generosity was especially appreciated during the ongoing pandemic.In Northern Ireland, the couple bought new sewing machines for charity workers who were making PPE during Covid, as well as sending food parcels to many sheltering alone.The pair also paid for hundreds of elderly patients in nursing homes to have iPads to Facetime their families — including Frances’ great aunt Sheila Graham — and for young carers to be able to learn from home.“Sheila’s home in Omagh was one of the ones that got tables to keep people from being isolated she was able to talk to my -year-old father Frank in Essex over Skype,” Frances said.Being filthy rich does, however, take some managing.“I get up at am so I can answer all the messages and emails people have sent me before I start a day’s work,” she said.“Then Paddy gets up and makes me my breakfast.”When asked what a multi-millionaire has for breakfast she replied: “Pancakes and pineapple juice this morning...”Frances, now based in Hartlepool, spent a lot of time in Northern Ireland in the pre-Covid days, and admitted that she always has got a buzz out of helping others.The businesswoman added that she has “been doing voluntary work since I was nine”.“Obviously I’m able to do it now on a much bigger scale and the buzz is bigger because you’re actually making a massive dference,” she said.Apart from splashing out on “some nice bits of jewellery” and “more clothes than I need” Frances admitted that she still looks for bargains.One of her most recent purchases was  bottles of Bollinger champagne for people working on the front line.“Patrick and I watched a programme on Monaco recently, and somebody spent £, on a single bottle of champagne,” Frances, who doesn’t drink alcohol, said.“I found a special offer on champagne for £ a bottle, and I’m saving them to hand out to people who deserve some gratitude.”In the meantime, her plans for  include doing a PhD in clinical psychology — and writing a book about her good fortune.Frances said that while money hasn’t changed her as a person, “it does change how you live”.“We’re living in a nicer house, driving nicer cars, I can make a shopping list and, miraculously, my PA just has everything in the fridge for me and it’d be absolutely amazing,” she said.“If I want to go and stay in a hotel I can just do that but it doesn’t change who you are.“We have come into money late. If you’d come to it when you’re young, you’d maybe let it change how you live a bit more.”Belfast Most ReadNI company boss cleared of shoplting from Tesco as judge dismisses #nonsense# caseCoronavirus Northern Ireland: Department of Health reveals vaccine roll-out plans as a further  deaths reported Armagh’s All-Ireland celebrations set to be probed by sports body as county denies IRA singingUK and EU reach agreement on NI trade and border checksWe didn#t know she#d be first in the world: NI family#s pride as Margaret Keenan gets first Covid vaccineLatest NewsPSNI launches Christmas domestic abuse campaign revealing report made every  minutes in Northern IrelandEU officials allowed at NI border checks but UK vetoes ‘mini’ Brussels embassyPressure builds on PSNI chief Byrne to explain #deal# with Sinn Fein on Bobby Storey funeralJamie Bryson in bid to have NAMA hearing misconduct charge thrown out on human rights groundsUK named third most generous country after donating millions during pandemic,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The UK Government confirmed it will withdraw controversial measures currently going through the Commons which could see the Brexit orce deal torn up.Delighted to announce agreement in principle on all issues in the UK-EU Withdrawal Agreement Joint Committee. Thank you to @MarosSefcovic and his team for their constructive and pragmatic approach. I will be updating Parliament tomorrow.https:t.co xtJhymu pic OKYPLxVjZ— Michael GoveDecember , The move follows progress in talks led by Michael Gove and EU interinstitutional relations chief Maros Sefcovic on issues including the Northern Ireland protocol.In a joint statement, the UK and EU said that “an agreement in principle” had been reached on all issues.In view of these “mutually-agreed solutions”, the UK Government will withdraw clauses ,  and  of the UK Internal Market Bill – which could have overridden the Withdrawal Agreement – and it will not introduce any similar provisions in the Taxation Bill.SDLP Belfast MP Claire Hanna welcomed the announcement as big news. She said more detail was needed and understanding that Biz only getting three weeks to get heads around it.Underlines point I made in Commons yesterday that Internal Market Bill bombshell only ever a crass negotiating ploy. Still, hopeful of further progress, she tweeted. There have been warnings, however, that a border down the Irish Sea - as the withdrawal agreement proposes - would see a reduction in goods to NI and increased prices. The Consumer Council has warned online shoppers could face a tax on receiving goods from Great Britain because of the added paperwork needed.Read MoreFears NI online shoppers facing #tax# on parcels crossing Irish Sea from JanuaryNI business chiefs urge UK and EU to reach Brexit agreement or #we will take massive hit#Irish foreign affairs minister Simon Coveney said it was positive news that agreement in principle has been reached on the outstanding issues on the implementation of the protocol on Ireland and Northern Ireland.He said: Of particular signicance is the commitment by the UK to withdraw clauses ,  and  of the Internal Market Bill, bringing it back into line with its obligations under the Withdrawal Agreement.This positive development comes after signicant and productive engagement between the EU and the UK on implementation of the protocol, as provided for under the Withdrawal Agreement.I look forward to an early meeting of the EU-UK Joint Committee, chaired by commission vice president Maros Sefcovic and Michael Gove, to formalise the agreements reached.I hope this may also provide some of the positive momentum necessary to instil confidence and trust and allow progress in the wider context of the future relationship negotiations.It comes as Boris Johnson warned that talks with the European Union on a separate trade deal were proving “very tricky” ahead of a crunch meeting with Brussels’ top official.The Prime Minister said he was still hopeful about reaching a deal but it was proving “very, very dficult” to make progress.Later this week Mr Johnson will head to Brussels for face-to-face talks with European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen in an attempt to salvage a deal, with time running out before the current trading arrangements expire at the end of the month.Mr Johnson said he hoped the “power of sweet reason” would triumph but Brussels had to accept there were limits to what terms the UK would be prepared to accept.Talks have faltered on the issues of fishing rights, the “level playing field” measures aimed at preventing the UK undercutting the EU on standards and state subsidies, and the way that any deal would be governed.In a message to Brussels, the Prime Minister said: “Our friends have just got to understand the UK has left the EU in order to be able to exercise democratic control over the way we do things.“There is also the issue of fisheries where we are a long way apart still.“But hope springs eternal, I will do my best to sort it outwe can.”Mr Johnson’s trip to Brussels is seen as a make-or-break moment for the process after months of talks led by Lord Frost and the EU’s Michel Barnier.Downing Street said Lord Frost wouldto London later on Tuesday to discuss the remaining dferences in reaching a free trade deal with Mr Johnson.Then “over the course of the coming days” the Prime Minister will go to Brussels, Number  said, though no meetings are planned with the leaders of either France or Germany.The Prime Minister acknowledged that there may be a point where it is “time to draw stumps” and accept that a deal is impossible.“There are just limits beyond which no sensible, independent government or country could go and people have got to understand that.”He again insisted the UK will “prosper mightily” with or without a trade deal with the European Union, despite grim warnings from the budget watchdog and the governor of the Bank of England about the impact.We want to reach a deal, but not at any priceGermany#s European affairs minister, Michael RothThe Office for Budget Responsibility has suggested that a no-deal situation could wipe % off gross domestic product, a measure of the size of the economy, in .Bank governor Andrew Bailey has warned that the long-term damage caused by a no-deal situation would be worse than the economic hit from coronavirus.But Mr Johnson urged people to “be in good cheer” as there were “great options ahead” for the country.Germany’s European affairs minister, Michael Roth, said “political will in London” was needed to get a deal.“Let me be very clear, our future relationship is based on trust and confidence,” he said.“It’s precisely this confidence that is at stake in our negotiations right now. We want to reach a deal, but not at any price.”No day has yet been fixed for Mr Johnson’s meeting with Mrs von der Leyen, but it is expected later this week and follows a y telephone call on Monday.\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming aeb .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_ddaaa-bc---ffefd_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming aeb .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_ddaaa-bc---ffefd_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming aeb .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_ddaaa-bc---ffefd_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming aeb .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_ddaaa-bc---ffefd_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming aeb .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_ddaaa-bc---ffefd_embedded w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeClose\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming aeb .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_ddaaa-bc---ffefd_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming aeb .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_ddaaa-bc---ffefd_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming aeb .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_ddaaa-bc---ffefd_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming aeb .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_ddaaa-bc---ffefd_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming aeb .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_ddaaa-bc---ffefd_embedded w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"Fishing rights continue to be problematic in the trade negotiations PA FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":trueFishing rights continue to be problematic in the trade negotiations  The Times reported that fisheries negotiations have continued to stall over how long any transition period would be for European trawlermen to adjust to agreed changes to fishing rights.The newspaper said the EU wants a -year grace period, while the UK wants that pegged back to three.Leaders of the EU’s  member states are due to gather in Brussels on Thursday for a two-day summit, potentially giving political impetus for a deal.Mr Barnier reportedly told MEPs the deadline for the talks succeeding is Wednesday, but Downing Street said it was prepared to continue talks for “as long as we have time available” – keeping the door open for an agreement to be reached at or after Thursday’s EU Council gathering.Whatever kind of deal we get, whether it’s going to be like Australia or like Canada, there is going to be change, and businesses and people need to get ready for that changeBoris JohnsonThe UK leaves the single market and customs union at the end of December and businesses already face major changes to their trading relationship with the EU from January .In a sign of the nervousness in Whitehall about the level of business preparation, Mr Johnson stressed the need for firms to get ready.During a visit to a hospital in London he said: “Whatever happens, it’s going to be dferent on January .“Whatever kind of deal we get, whether it’s going to be like Australia or like Canada, there is going to be change, and businesses and people need to get ready for that change.”The Prime Minister wants a Canadian-style free trade agreement with the EU, buthe fails to achieve that the UK will deal with the bloc in the same way as Australia does – without a comprehensive deal, meaning the imposition of tarfs.PAMost ReadNI company boss cleared of shoplting from Tesco as judge dismisses #nonsense# caseCoronavirus Northern Ireland: Department of Health reveals vaccine roll-out plans as a further  deaths reported Armagh’s All-Ireland celebrations set to be probed by sports body as county denies IRA singingUK and EU reach agreement on NI trade and border checksWe didn#t know she#d be first in the world: NI family#s pride as Margaret Keenan gets first Covid vaccineLatest NewsPressure builds on PSNI chief Byrne to explain #deal# with Sinn Fein on Bobby Storey funeralJamie Bryson in bid to have NAMA hearing misconduct charge thrown out on human rights groundsUK named third most generous country after £m charity donationsCoronavirus Northern Ireland:  further deaths and  new cases reportedNine shots fired at Derry home in #completely reckless# gun attack,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Annemarie Bell’s father, Hugh, died suddenly while showing a worker from The Resource Centre his famous Christmas garden on December , . He was  years of age at the time and had experienced a tough year with infections but remained fit. Hugh loved to decorate the family home at Moyola Walk in Shantallow at Christmas time where there was a ‘real sense of community’. He became known for his impressive festive displays and was hailed as the ‘King of Christmas’. googletag.cmd.push  Just prior to his death, Hugh taught daughter Annemarie how to wire the plugs but, she says, ‘little did I know, I would have to do it again so quickly’. He was well-known in the local community for his walks to Knock and charitable work with the Foyle Hospice, and also helped to organise the first Derry marathons. Annemarie said: “My daddy has been the king of Christmas from I can remember. “When we were young my mother and father smoked and they wrapped fag packets up with wrapping paper and hung them up on the tree. “That’s the tradition that I grew up with and shoe boxes at the bottom of the tree for fake presents. googletag.cmd.push “Our crib was always the centre piece of our home and the main focus of our celebrations.” When the family moved to Mount Vernon in Culmore, Hugh became even more invested in the Christmas season, lighting up hedges and setting up inflatable reindeers in the garden. “I’ve just followed suit now and added new features the past two years,” Annemarie explained. As a youth worker in Pennyburn she erected the Christmas tree as soon as Halloween ended. The spiritual side of Christmas is of most import to the family and as such they would have attended a Christmas nativity event at Thornhill.     The year Hugh died they had around  nativities but Annemarie continued gathering and now has  around the house. A nativity picture is the oldest item in the family’s collection. Sadly, some decorations have been consigned to the past, Annemarie explained: “We had this big inflatable snowman and it was really, really strange. “A big fat giant snowman, we must’ve had it for at least  years and my daddy died on the th and that just went kaput on the st. So, it was strange, it was probably one of his first.” This year, Annemarie says, many people have experienced hardship in the city with a further announcement this week of job cuts. She believes it is important for everyone to get back to basics and think about family and the true meaning of Christmas.  With the pandemic it felt strange for children to be locked indoors all day long. Annemarie reflected: “I think this Christmas is going to be more special for people, we’re more used to living with one another during the pandemic, and young people won’t be looking to run here, there and everywhere. “I’d imagine this year will be more traditional, that family board games will come back. “And people won’t want their children going to other houses. “When you look at the row of houses lit up in Shantallow right now, that is community. “I was driving around after work last night and you see houses lit up that weren’t before and you think to yourself, isn’t that so beautul, so much hope and joy in the community. “For me, that’s why my daddy wanted to do it, to spread some joy.” She added: “The wains are at school at the minute but the binmen were shouting to me, ‘your garden is class, I’m so glad you followed on in your daddy’s footsteps!’ “Those kind of comments from someone out doing his job, that’s what it’s all about.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

So Ill be in the kitchen prepping on Christmas Eve and then the dinner will be cooked and delivered on Christmas Day for anyone who’s alone or in need of one.Last year we actually had some spare meals left over so I went and delivered them up to the Fire Station, which was the highlight of my Christmas, she said.Paula has been provided with the names of people in the local community who would benefit from the scheme by the Operation Snowball at the OLT and staff at the Long Tower Youth Club.This service is free of charge of course, soyou or someone you know needs help this Christmas please send me a message to the Peggys Kitchen Facebook page,continued Ms Monk. googletag.cmd.push Last year we covered the cost of it ourselves, apart from the desserts, but this year Foyle Fruit have kindly offered to donate the potatoes and vegetables and we have also had donations of containers and cups. All donations are welcome andanyone wishes to help our efforts that help would be much appreciated.Ms Monk has enlisted the help of two delivery drivers to take the food to the Bogside, Brandywell and Creggan areas of the city.Like all cafes, Peggys Kitchen is closed at the moment due to current restrictions.Its sad that we cant open because we really miss our customers like the Over s Club that used to meet here every Wednesday and for a lot of them it was their only source of interaction but the safety of everyone needs to come first, said Ms Monk. googletag.cmd.push We cant wait to reopen again but until then please keep safe.      --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

He is one of the first people to get the jab in the UK. At a Trust Board meeting on Thursday members were told that vaccinations are planned to start at the Foyle Arena on December  but that could be brought forward. Dr Bob Brown, Director of Primary Care and Older peoples services in the Western Trust,is one of the first vaccinators to be vaccinated from the Western Trust area. He said: “As the Executive Director of Nursing and given my responsibility for older people’s services, I felt it was important that I received my vaccine early so that I can become a peer vaccinator to support our team who are getting ready to deliver this vital vaccine to our fantastic health and social care staff who have worked tirelessly throughout the last ten months, and also for our care home residents and staff who have also been highly impacted by this virus. googletag.cmd.push While our thoughts continue to remain with those families who have experienced the loss of a loved one from COVID-, I would encourage all staff to avail of the vaccine as it becomes available to them, to protect themselves, their patients and their families.” The initial phase of the roll-out of the vaccination programme began today. The programme represents an unprecedented logistical exercise that will take many months to complete. Progress will depend on available supply across the UK and is dependent on production and delivery schedules. The timescale for the approval of further vaccines will be an important factor in the wider roll-out of the programme. googletag.cmd.push The exact timing of all plans will be subject to vaccine availability. The focus in the coming weeks will therefore include care home residents and staffhealth and social care staff working with patient groups at higher riskstaff working in higher risk settings staff who are themselves at increased personal risk due to being in extremely vulnerable high risk categories or having other defined clinical risk factors. In advance of the GP element of the programme starting, active consideration is being given to options for extending the programme to begin vaccinating over ’s in the community.      --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Education Minister Peter Weir tweeted a picture of the paintings after he visited the school last week, and the portraits quickly went viral, appearing on BBCs The View programme. Titillated Executive ministers praised the childrens artwork on social media, with Justice Minister Naomi Long adopting the painting as her Twitter profile picture. The Alliance MLA felt the work captured her essence perfectly. “I love my wonky eyebrow! It looks like Im a bit cross about something which I usually am! Fantastic work and say thanks to all the young artists!” she said. googletag.cmd.push Finance Minister, Sinn Feacuteins Conor Murphy, took time to write to the pupils and express his gratitute, saying the painting was an improvement on the real thing. Mr Murphy also told the children that one of their local heroes had held pride of place in Stormont for years. “The late Martin McGuinness, who was Deputy First Minister, had in his office a large photograph behind his desk in Stormont Castle of someone who attended your school,” he wrote. “It was of the  All-Ireland winning captain, Henry Downey. In an office which had photographs of world leaders including Nelson Mandela, the photo of Henry Downey of Lavey had pride of place.” googletag.cmd.push After the paintings were beamed around the airwaves, requests began to make their way to South Derry and the children have been busy. The Blame Games Tim McGarry, Jake OKane and Colin Murphy got the full treatment from the Mayogall Monets, along with local councillor Sean McPeake, who helped arrange the visit. Principal Mary OKane said the paintings, and associated publicity, had created a great feeling of positivity around the school. “Its created a great buzz, which is very important at this time,” she said. “Following lockdown and the long period of absence from school, its important that children get a wee boost now.     “Its important for the whole school, but particularly those children who are getting a real buzz out of it at the moment. They see themselves as being pretty famous artists.”  Another famous local artist, Kilreas Conor Larkin, agreed to give the childrens paintings a professional artists scrutiny for us this week – and he was very impressed!  Aoe and Charley Arlene Foster: The artist has captured Arlenes ‘lockdown cofure’ – a large, thick plumage of black hair. Arlene is looking away from the viewer, maybe deep in thought or dreaming of an easier time. They have captured a fantastically sombre and meditative state that many artists strive for!  Lisa and Maria Michelle O’Neill: The subject has been caught in a moment of contemplation or reflection. She appears to be gazing just below the viewer’s eye-line. Thinking hard and remaining very tight-lipped, giving no clue to her inner-thoughts. Her hands are clasped, asplaying her cards close to her chest.  Isabelle, Christopher and Charlie Naomi Long: The artist has gone for a bold palette of contrasting colours. The subject is looking a little bewildered or deflated. She appears to have one hand behind her back, asnot wanting to show the viewer her crossed fingers. Or have we purposely been left wonderingNaomi’s hands are tied   Ella, Shannon and Dara Nichola Mallon: The subject appears very happy or comfortable in her own skin. She stands up straight with her hands by her side, portraying a certain pride. This could be the Mona Lisa of political portraits, with her confident gaze following the viewer around the room.  Serena and Chloe Caraacutel Niacute Chuiliacuten: Simple and effective brush strokes have been used to capture the subject’s vibrant hair and expressionless face. The subject stares directly from the canvas, almost straight through the viewer. The artist has done well to capture this moment of determination.  Anna, Riacutean and Molly Conor Murphy: The artist has captured this subject well, leaving the viewer wondering ‘what has he just been asked ’. His bottom lip juts out in a moment of deep concentration, staring past the viewer in search of an answer, as the viewer begs to know what exactly the question is.   Emily Rose and Isla Diane Dodds: A subtle palette of greys has been used to portray the subject’s face, perhaps an indication as to how she is feeling. The subject appears to be smiling, but also looks panicked as she scans her surroundings.  Charley, Don and Seamus Oacuteg Peter Weir: This subject is portrayed as being happy and almost laughing, leaving the viewer asking ‘what is so funny ’. But, looking behind the glasses and gazing further into his eyes, the viewer soon realises there is no joke here.  Amber and Riacuteonach Robin Swann: The artist has really taken the time to depict someone under extreme pressure. His fists are clenched tight, his mouth opened wide asshouting for someone to listen. But, his eyes look sad and his cheeks tear-stained. His gaze is directed straight at you, asto say ‘I have more bad news.  Johnny, Callum, Cathal and Conan Edwin Poots: This painting shows someone who appears to be very happy with themselves, but look deeper into the subjects eyes and you can see that one eye is looking hard at the viewer for approval and the other is looking back at himself in some doubt.  Sean, Conor and Donnacha Sean McPeake :The Artist has captured the subject wide eyed, maybe in disbelief. The pale hue used for his lips, blend into his skin tone – perhaps the artist is sending the subliminal message that the subject is lost for words. The silvery grey hair gives the subject a ‘worldly wise’ appeal.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Pat OHagan, from Magherafelt, was a founding member of the South Derry Historical Society, formed in the town in . A talented musician, Mr OHagan could have turned his hand to a number of instruments, and some of his students have recalled being taught piano, bassoon, flute and clarinet. He often quipped the only instrument he couldnt play was the bagpipes. Eugene Kielt, owner of Laurel Villa Guest House in Magherafelt, recalled how Pat would have helped entertain his guests with encyclopedic local knowledge. googletag.cmd.push “Magherafelt has just lost one of its most respected citizens,” he said. “Apart from his many other fine qualities, Pat was a man of principle and a font of knowledge. A knowledge which he unselfishly shared with so many others.

Pat was in his element while giving information on the local graveyards. “When he was in good health he used to pass a lot of his time going around all the graves there. But it was not to be.”     Pat had assisted local historian Paddy Larkin in surveying old graveyards in South Derry, and was extremely knowledgeable on Magherafelts early history. His help was acknowledged by American archaeologist Orloff Miller, who conducted an archaeological excavation into the early seventeenth century Plantation settlement at Salterstown near Ballyronan. “I remember vividly two things that he taught me,” said Orloff. “We were strolling through the town one evening and he was pointing out the details of the stone masonry walls, and noted where one man’s hand had stopped and another took up the work. “It had never occurred to me that you could see a dferences in the decision-making of the stonemasons by looking at the wall. “As an archaeologist, I thought I knew a thing or two about man-made things, so it was good for me to be gently reminded that I had a lot to learn. “Mr. O’Hagan also referred to historical events and people ashe was there, and ashe knew them, and asit happened last week. “But he was talking about Cromwell  King Billy, and how the troops came over the hill, just there. “ years later, I was enthralled but also smacked by the realization that for this town, these people, those days never went away.” At Mr OHagans removal, parish priest Fr John Gates, told a story of how he had first encountered Pat when he was newly appointed to the parish. He answered a knock at the door. It was Pat. “You must be the new man,” he said. “I’m Pat O’Hagan and I’m here to welcome you to the town.” Pat then drew from his pocket a tin whistle and played him a couple of tunes. The tributes paid to Pat reveal a huge respect for a welcoming man, a talented teacher and musician, and a man who loved his local area dearly. His death is deeply regretted by his brothers and wider family circle.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The deferral by Causeway Coast and Glens Councils planning committee is to allow an alternative application to progress to the same stage so a decision can be made. The controversial proposal would see a single storey McDonalds restaurant with car parking and drive through facilities erected at a section of the existing Asda site alongside the towns Ring Road. Representatives of the Lodge Hotel, which backs onto the proposed site, have stated their objection to the application. After the initial application was deferred at Octobers Planning Committee meeting, a second application was lodged showing the location of the restaurant on the East side of the car park. googletag.cmd.push At a meeting of the Planning Committee, Causeway Coast and Glens councillors heard objections from a representative of the Lodge Hotel which is situated close to the proposed site. The spokesperson said noise and disturbance from the development would have an adverse impact on residents at the hotel and the knock-on effect could cause the hotel to go out of business. Representatives of the Lodge Hotel have raised objections to the proposal. The points were echoed by some councillors, with Alderman William Duddy citing anti-social behaviour arising from the existing McDonalds site in Coleraine. “Some residents have told me they can hear the revving and the music, and some of those are three quarters of a mile away,” said Alderman Duddy. googletag.cmd.push “We cannot leave the hotel out of this. Its  years in operation and is the only tourist asset we have in this town in regards to accommodation. “We have an obligation to secure and maintain that as a planning committee. The noise, the smell, the fumes, the litter and the strong likelihood of anti-social behaviour taking place in that car park. “The police have yet to be able to resolve the issues at Riverside, which has been ongoing for years. It is imperative to take into account the impact on those using the hotel.” The committee have voted to defer the current application until the alternative planning application reaches a stage where both can be reviewed at the same time.      --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

One local councillor described the news as a Christmas present for Derry City and Strabane District Council. Details of the financial support secured were outlined during a meeting of the councils Governance and Strategic Planning committee on Tuesday. At the meeting, Alfie Dallas, the councils Lead Finance Officer, presented a report on the situation faced by the council in the first half of this financial year from April  to September . Mr Dallas said the councils planned budget for   was poundm, with % of that money coming from rates collected. googletag.cmd.push However, Mr Dallas said the councils finances had been very signicantly impacted by the Covid crisis. He said that the council had lost approximately pound.m during the first half of the financial year. These losses included: - pound.m as a result of the closure of council facilities, including leisure centres- pound, due to the closure of council-run car parks- pound, as a result of the loss of building control income- pound, loss of income from cemeteries due to non-charging during the pandemic Mr Dallas said the council had also faced huge unplanned costs as a result of having to respond to the pandemic. googletag.cmd.push These included health and safety costs, costs associated with new working arrangements, communications and IT costs to enable home-working. However, Mr Dallas said that thankfully the councils losses had been completely mitigated by the financial support received from a number of government departments. He said the council had recouped pound.m of its losses from the Job Retention Scheme Furlough. He said the Department of Finance had provided support of pound.m as part of a package for all  councils in Northern Ireland, while the Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs had allocated pound, to the council for waste management losses. Mr Dallas said the government had also provided pound.m to cover the losses at City of Derry Airport which means that this financial burden will not fall on the council.     Government support has therefore been critical in ensuring Council finances have remained stable and has enabled signicant decisions around services to be avoided, said Mr Dallas. However, he added that there remained signicant risk and uncertainty over the councils finances because of its reliance on rates income for its annual budget. Speaking at Tuesdays meeting, Sinn Fein councillor Mickey Cooper said that back in March April of this year, the situation had been scary in relation to the financial situation facing the council. Given the government support, he welcomed that the council could continue to look at major infrastructure projects that had been planned pre-Covid. DUP Alderman Hilary McClintock said given the doom and gloom earlier in the year, the news that the councils losses had been completely mitigated was like a Christmas present. This is an absolutely fantastic outcome, she said. SDLP councillor Martin Reilly paid tribute to the council officers for their efforts in recent months. It is such a good position to be in in comparison to where we thought we would be six months ago, said Cllr Reilly.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The competition is part of the Revival Festival being co-ordinated by Creggan Enterprises. As part of the festival, a scavenger hunt with a twist is also being staged. There are great prizes to be won in both competitions, which are running on the Revival Festival website – www.revivalfestival.net - from now until December . The lockdown restrictions kept many of us inside during , but the two contests will now allow people to revisit, and celebrate, our cityscape and local heritage safely. The ‘Treasure Trail’, which can also be completed at home, features  city landmarks - some old, some new, and some pictured from unusual angles - and asks you to identy them. googletag.cmd.push Raacuteth Moacuter manager Kevin Hippsley encouraged young people to get involved. “A few of these landmarks are fiendishly dficult so we have included a number of clues on the website, which should help,” said Mr Hippsley. The ‘Teenage Clicks’ Photo Competition asks participants to go out into their communities and capture three great images and send them in to: competition@teenageclicks.net. Winning entries will then been displayed in an exhibition and online. “We’re looking for imagination and creativity here,’ said Mr Hippsley. “Both these events are free to enter and a great fun for all the family.” The Revival Festival is supported by Derry City and Strabane District Council’s Community Festival Fund. googletag.cmd.push Other activities and materials are available from www.revivalfestival.net and www.teenageclicks.net for access or downloading.      --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

You enjoy playing and you take any opportunity you can get.ldquoI was nervous going into it but I probably had one of the best games I ever played. I was going out an expressing myself and I was named player of the match.However, her world came crashing down when she suffered an injury while playing for the NI U- team when what looked like a normal stress fracture in her foot was to keep her out of action for four years.ldquoIt should have healed naturally within eight to  weeks and I kept getting told it would heal with rest, she recalled.ldquoIt came to a year but it hadnrsquot healed fully, so I got a second opinion and the consultant said I should have had surgery straight away on it.ldquoI had the operation and went through the full rehab period, but I was still having quite a lot of issues, so I had a second surgery and it was back to square one.Caragh recalls ldquocrying day after day at the prospect of never playing football again and said every time she took a step forward ldquoit felt like five steps back again.She went on: I had thought about going to England or America when I left school, but being injured at that age there was no point trying to chase that.ldquoHaving a lot of success at a young age, I just didnrsquot know le without football.Caragh made herto action almost four years on from her injury and after a year with Glentoran she spent a season in Iceland with Fylkir.She says Reykjavik was an ldquoamazing place to play and live and after being introduced to CrossFit in her rehab, it was in Iceland her interest in the sport grew.ldquoI was totally hooked on it and progressed quite quickly in it. I started to do a few local competitions and for a while I was balancing the two.ldquoBecause I enjoyed CrossFit so much, my love for football waned slightly. I got to the point where I didnrsquot have the same desire as before.She ed to Glentoran after her year in Iceland, lting the Irish Cup with the east Belfast side and representing Northern Ireland before halting her time in the sport to focus on CrossFit.In her break from football, Caragh said her priorities changed away from the pitch when she married her husband, Michael, in .At the turn of  she was set to compete at high-level CrossFit competitions in Asia, Egypt and the Netherlands before the Covid- pandemic intervened.ldquoI hadnrsquot planned to come back to football. Gail Redmond at Glentoran heard the competitions were scrapped and saw it as an opportunity to get me back playing, she explained.ldquoInitially I was a bit hesitant but she said about the Glens challenging for the title. I think that pulled on my heart stings a bit.Caragh netted four goals in six Womenrsquos Premiership matches to set Glentoran on course for the title before an ldquounexpected call from NI manager Kenny Shiels saw her reintroduced to the international fold.ldquoKenny was watching out first game against Cltonville. After being away from football I donrsquot think he knew who I was but I got  minutes at the end and must have impressed him.Shiels invited Caragah to train with the senior squad and was named as a stand-by for Northern Irelandrsquos trip to the Faroe Islands in Septemberrsquos Euro  qualier.She was drafted into the squad when midfielder Marissa Callaghan pulled out and made her internationalas a second-half substitute in a - win.Despite her sensationalto the NI set-up, Hamiltonrsquos season was ended prematurely by a knee injury sustained days before the victory away to Belarus.She adds that while she is disappointed to be on the sidelines, she is thankful to both Glentoran and Shiels for their support to keep her involved in club and country as much as possible.She admits she is undecided whether she will focus on CrossFit orto the football pitch after her recovery.ldquoThatrsquos the million dollar question, she said. At the minute I am focusing on getting as fit as possible to make sure Irsquom able to do the best that I can in whatever I do.ldquoI want to be healthy and injury-free so I will make that decision closer to the time depending on how things are going.Going into last nightrsquos crunch tie, Northern Ireland were hoping to secure a play-off place in the European Championships for the first time.Despite her absence for the remainder of the campaign, Caragh says she has no doubts Northern Ireland can secure second position in Group C and make history.She credits manager Shiels with instilling a strong belief in his side. ldquoHe has brought out something that was always there but a lot of it is belief and confidence, she said.ldquoPreviously we would have played within ourselves to avoid defeat, but now there is an attitude that we can go and win this game.ldquoThere is a hunger and desire to push on.

The concerts are due to be broadcast on Sunday, December , and Tuesday, December .News of the concerts comes after festive lights were switched on in Downpatrick last weekend, with others due to be illuminated over the coming weeks at local towns and villages including Ballynahinch, Newcastle, Killyleagh, Saintfield, Crossgar, and Castlewellan.Both Downpatrick and Newcastle will have articial trees, with a cut tree erected in Ballynahinch with the local authority illuminating festive lights at up to  sustainable Christmas trees across the district as well as  so-called street trees.Council chairwoman Laura Devlin said that Christmas  will be like no other.She said the local authority wants to acknowledge the impact that Covid- has had on so many peoplersquos lives and sharing a message of light and hope for better times ahead.ldquoWhile we couldnrsquot hold our traditional Christmas events and light switch-ons, we still wanted to come together as a district and I hope many will join us from their own homes to watch the upcoming light and hope concerts, she continued.ldquoI am delighted we have secured artists of such calibre and proud of the homegrown talent from Newry, Mourne and Down on display.Cllr Devlin said that as the Christmas lights are switched on across the district, she wants to acknowledge the particular dficulties faced by the retail sector this festive season.She added: ldquoFollowing the latest restrictions announced by the Northern Ireland Executive, our lsquomake it local Christmas campaign will now be launched at the safe and appropriate time.ldquoThe message from council is always to shop local and shop safely and this will be emphasised during the campaign..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/2nd December 2020 Down(1).jpg","title":"Down have title in sight  ","story":"ldquoWErsquoVE been knocking on the door for years now, and it is really exciting that we may finally do it.Those are the words of Down captain Karen McMullan ahead of Saturdayrsquos clash with Antrim in the All-Ireland Intermediate Camogie Championship final at Breffni Park, Cavan.Down were beaten finalists two years ago, before making the semi-finals last year. Once more they have gone right to the business end of the competition, but this time they are determined to carry off the silverware.ldquoFrom a neutralrsquos point of view, it should be a really exciting match, the Castlewellan woman said. ldquoIt is also great for Ulster camogie that two northern teams are in the final.ldquoWersquove been so close over the last few years and it would be great to be able to get over that final hurdle now.With Down teams performing strongly at schools level in camogie for a while, it was always felt that would ultimately translate to success higher up the age groups. And so it has proven to be. McMullan says a number of factors have come together to allow Down to prosper, including manager Derek Dunnersquos influence.ldquoDerek has been brilliant for us, she said. He is passionate and committed to the team. In his preparation, he leaves no stone unturned. He has definitely gone above and beyond the call of duty for us.ldquoHe has brought the best people into the off-field team around us, and he has invested in us. When someone does that, it makes you want to repay their faith by bringing success. It is a time-consuming role for him too, he does a lot as well away from the matches and the training ground, so the fact we have made it to the final is brilliant for him too.In what has been a year when sportsmen and sportswomen have been left unsure about what would happened because of the coronavirus, Karen and her team-mates are revelling in being able to anticipate the excitement around an All-Ireland final.ldquoWersquore delighted to be there, first and foremost. We are buzzing with excitement. And the other thing is too, especially with the dficulties that so many people are going through, we are able to feed off the excitement of others.ldquoSo many people have been affected badly by Covid-, but you can see the dference sport can make.It can help communities come together and that is certainly something we can feel heading into this game.Down booked their spot in the final with a - to - semi-final success against Meath in Clones. It was a match where the Mourne girls looked fairly comfortable and had a gear or two to spare.McMullan concurs, saying they could have racked up an even more convincing winning margin.ldquoWe should have scored more, and could have done. But Meath held out well, and then it became more of a case of seeing the game out and protecting the advantage. We knew Meath are a very dficult team to overcome.ldquoBefore the match, we spoke about how close we had come before going all the way. We absolutely did not want to experience those feelings again. A lot of players, to be honest, were not over last yearrsquos loss to Westmeath. It hurt a lot.ldquoSometimes it can take you to lose a game of that importance to toughen you up, make you ready to go that bit more the next time. There is no doubt the girls have the hunger and are driven to win this now. As for the challenge posed by Antrim, the Down camp are certainly not under-estimating the task at hand, as Karen admits.ldquoItrsquoll be a tough one against Antrim. They are a very young, very fit, quick team. They have some of their top players from the likes of Loughgiel and Ballycastle. Itrsquos a local derby which obviously adds a bit more spice to things. Honestly, on the day, it is anyonersquos game.Anyonersquos game indeed, but Down will know they have weapons in their team that they will look to on the day to make the dference between the pain of coming runners-up again, and the glory of being crowned All-Ireland champions.Paula OrsquoHagan is someone the team will certainly be looking towards to presenting a threat in front of the Antrim goal. She was a constant thorn in the side of Meath in the last four, accounting for seven points.Sarah-Louise Graffin is also a threat going forward. She ably dovetailed with OrsquoHagan in the last four, weighing in with three points. When those two click going forward, they can be a handful for even the most miserly of back-lines.Fionnuala Carr is the glue that held that line together so well in the success over Meath, and no doubt she will be the bedrock that Down will try to build their success on again.As well as that, Dougan has the team well-drilled in defence. And ahead of them, they have a midfield prowess that can take a grip on a game against the best. Niamh Mallon is a constant danger to the opposition, full of busy running and creativity. Alongside her, Saoirse McCartan is another wily operator.Undoubtedly, Down possess the tools in their armoury to carry off the title this time around. In terms of talent, and the experience of being there before and knowing what to expect on the big occasion, they know the drill.Now Dougan, and the players will be hoping they can shake off the lsquonearlyrsquo tag and be crowned camogie queens of Ireland.The throw-in for Saturdayrsquos final is .pm. It will be broadcast live on the RTE News Channel and also on the RTE Player International.

In these strange and dficult times, even the strongest and most resilient among us are not exempt from occasionally feeling weary and despondent.During the early months of lockdown back in the spring, how many of us enjoyed the slowing down of the hamster wheel of le and took time to enjoy nature at its finest and to reflect on what our priorities really are It all seems much harder this time around as people face the harsh reality of a huge economic downturn and the virus pandemic takes on a dferent guise.We need all the help we can get to keep ourselves as positive and hopeful as possible. This is where mindfulness can come in. It is a term that has become popular in recent times and often is wrongly used.It can get a bad press and seem shrouded in mystery mdash something that requires a knowledge of Zen beyond the reach of lsquoJoe Publicrsquo while others claim it to be some kind of panacea that can cure all ills. It is neither of these things.As a practitioner for several years and a Mindfulness in Schools Project trained teacher for five, I can honestly say it is a tool that can help some peoplefocus on the present and not let the mind wander into unnecessary places, whether that be worries or distractions.The analogy of thoughts being like buses is one I like. We donrsquot need to jump on every single one, instead just watch them pass by.An example of a mindful experience could be when a musician is playing a piece and sensing the music, rather than reading the notes.It is flowing completely naturally and no thinking is involved. Sport is another great example. Novak Djokovic and Jonny Wilkinson are two advocates of mindful practice and both claim their focus and steady performance can be attributed to the discipline.Interestingly, two of the most mindful sports are golf and cricket. Being at one with the little white ball as it gets smacked about the greens is said to be as good for mental health as much as physical.Our own Rory McIlroy summed it up well when he said: ldquoIrsquom not about to go and live with the monks in Nepal or anything like that, but Irsquom making sure that I centre myself and put my head in the right place.Cricket is similar.When you are bowling an over, the focus is on the line of the ball, the position of the field and the feel of the wicket under foot. The batsman is equally focussing on the ball and the fielders woe betide they lose their concentration.The halcyon days of local cricket as a mainstream sport appear to be over at the moment and there are multiple reasons offered for the demise mdash schools having less time for summer sports in the final term, the attention span of young players not being what it was and fewer people willing to commit to what could be a full day.Which leads me nicely back to the beginning.Remember those lovely, slower days of lockdown when we realised being busy wasnrsquot necessarily all it was cracked up to be and that many of the things on our mental lsquoto dorsquo list are not that important after all Maybe we really need to take time to smell the autumn leaves, the way we did for the daffodils of spring. Maybe we need to slow it down and find things to hope for.Local cricket clubs donrsquot have the crowds around the team boards any more on a Thursday evening after the selection committee when the team lists were pinned up.There isnrsquot that excitement of ldquodid I make it from the thirds to the seconds   or for me, ldquowhere am I serving the sandwiches It is a dferent era for the game, but those who love it, really love it. If anyone reading this has their whites from a bygone time hidden in an attic somewhere, why not retrieve them and dust them down for next spring If you played a bit at school and just feel like revisiting the sport for a bit of exercise and a bit of craic with new people, then please do it.Evenyoursquove never played, but have walked down the Strangford Road and loved that beautul setting, then it might be worth a go.We all need things to look forward to and we all need hope. Downpatrick Cricket Club needs that hope too.Maurice Irvine, a dear friend and colleague and master of cricket at Down High School, is also a former player for the school and the club.He strongly recommends anyone to take up the bat again or try it out whatever level you are at.When I asked him how he felt at the possible closure of Downpatrick Cricket Club, he said:ldquoIt is with great sadness that I learn of this possibility. I have many memories of playing there under the guidance of Roy Briggs, Ken McCammon and many others, developing my love of the game. ldquoCricket is a great game educating young people especially in respect, fair play, how to win and lose with dignity and team spirit.ldquoDownpatrick Cricket Club, along with Saintfield and Dundrum, is also a great place for Down High cricketers to gain valuable experience and the opportunity to learn from more experienced cricketers.ldquoDownpatrick have also been very generous to Down High, allowing us access to nets when they were not available at school and I would add my encouragement to anyone in the area to become involved to help the club at this dficult time.For me, the Linehan family are synonymous with cricket in Downpatrick.Alfie and Hugh will remain heroes of mine always, while current club chairman Paul Linehan hopes thatanyone can assist to keep the club going they will contact him on   or email paul.k.linehan@gmail..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/2nd December 2020 Drumaness.jpg","title":"Drumaness green space plans  ","story":"A NEW amenity area is to be created in Drumaness by Newry, Mourne and Down Council.An area known locally as the lsquoBack Fieldrsquo where a play park was located a number of years ago is to be redeveloped.The news has been welcomed by Slieve Croob councillor, Cathy Mason, who is pleased that a raised area made of bricks and concrete is to be flattened and reseeded with GAA and football posts and nets to be provided.The local politician, who has been lobbying for the work to be carried out, said it is now possible as the village has two play parks, explaining that the remnants of bricks and concrete at the back field can now be removed, with this particular work long over due. ldquoThe area will be flattened and seeded so it can be safely used, with a set of GAA and soccer nets provided, said Cllr Mason.ldquoWe all know how vital it is to get outside into the fresh air, especially our children during these unprecedented times.

I also hope that in the final few weeks before Christmas people will support our local business community but remember to shop safety and adhere to social distancing measures.Meanwhile, anyone wishing to speak with a council official about a membership package or who has other queries is asked to telephone   .The council has confirmed that will also continue to provide latest information and updates via the NMD Be Active App, NMD Be Active Facebook page and its website https:www.newrymournedown.org leisure-facilities..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/2nd December 2020 Minister.jpg","title":"Minister urged to commit funding to begin bypass  ","story":"STORMONT roads minister Nichola Mallon has been asked to commit the money required to build Ballynahinchrsquos new multi-million pound bypass.The appeal was made at special meeting of Newry, Mourne and Down Council on Monday evening when roads officials tabled their annual report detailing planned investment across the district during the current financial year.The meeting took place just weeks after it emerged that a start date for the near two-mile bypass could be revealed early in the New Year.Mrs Mallon has confirmed that she will make a so-called direction order within weeks which is expected to outline when contractors could be on site.Major progress has been made over recent years to advance the scheme to link the Newcastle and Saintfield roads with the bypass designed to alleviate chronic town centre congestion in Ballynahinch and along the main approach roads to the town.Major new roundabouts are proposed at the Belfast Road junction with the Saintfield Road and at the Newcastle Road junction with the Downpatrick Road, with a new bridge constructed over the Moss Road.Overtaking lanes stretching almost  metres are proposed at either end of the bypass where the major new roundabouts are to be constructed, with the scheme also including a shared footpath and cycle lane.The bypass is the single biggest road scheme ever proposed for the district with suggestions that it will take at least  months to construct, with roads officials insisting that the scheme will reduce journey times and improve road safety.Last June, the roads minister included the bypass in a list of strategic projects expected to progress during the current financial year, with the local scheme mdash which could cost up to poundm mdash effectively ready to proceed.At the time, roads officials said the bypass was now at an ldquoadvanced stage of development and that preparatory work on contract documentation had been completed.Officials said the roads minister had asked them to complete the work necessary to allow her to make the so-called direction order which included reviewing environmental reports which is nearing completion.The government department said that subject to the outcome of the review, the minister hopes to be in position to make the direction order for the Ballynahinch bypass in the New Year and was committed to moving ahead with the scheme.On Monday evening, Rowallane councillor Billy Walker said while progress on the eagerly-awaited scheme is welcome, what people want to see is money committed to allow contractors to begin work.ldquoConfirmation that the roads minister is preparing to make a direction order is good news. Progress is at last being made, but the money required to finance the scheme is the final piece in the development jigsaw, he said.ldquoThis scheme is good news for the people of Ballynahinch and the wider district and what everyone is keen to see is a timetable for delivery.Cllr Walker said the bypass had been talked about for  years and was now literally within touching distance.He added: ldquoWhat we require is a definitive timetable and confirmation from the roads minister that the money to build the new road is there. The scheme is finally moving in the right direction and now is the time to commit the money to ensure its delivery.Cllr Terry Andrews also welcomed progress in the bypass which he said can make a signicant dference for not only Ballynahinch, but the wider East and South Down areas.Rowallane councillor, Robert Burgess, said people in Ballynahinch look forward to the delivery of the scheme, urging consideration be given to farmers whose land has ben set aside for  years to accommodate the planned bypass.ldquoThese farmers have been unable to do anything with these areas of land which will probably be vested. The situation they fund themselves in is not fair, he added.The Department for Infrastructurersquos network manager, James Kelly, said while a previous roads manager was minded to proceed with the Ballynahinch scheme, it did not reach the point of going ahead.He said there was now an opportunity for roads officials to refresh the schemersquos environmental assessments before presenting them to the minister again.Mr Kelly said with the scheme expected to cost between poundm and poundm,Mrs Mallon wishes for it to proceed, the bypass will have to enter a process where it will be competing for finance with other schemes.He added: ldquoWe cannot guarantee that the money will be available next year..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/2nd December 2020 New.jpg","title":"New bus at Knockevin Special School following £28k donation  ","story":"KNOCKEVIN Special School in Downpatrick has taken charge of a new bus thanks to the generosity of the Lordrsquos Taverners and the schoolrsquos parent staff association.The PSA donated pound, towards the cost of the new wheelchair accessible bus which was provided by the Lordrsquos Taverners, which provides support for people with disabilities.The bus was recently handed over to the school by PSA members, who will also fund its running costs.The PSA was formed in  when parents and staff came together to fund music therapy for the pupils which was no longer being funded by the relevant authorities.The associationrsquos goal is to support all of the pupils at Knockevin Special School in Downpatrick and Knockevin Early Years Centre in Dundrum.PSA chairperson Kelley OrsquoReilly said: ldquoSince we formed we have raised considerable amounts of money through ious events and projects, such as the Sparkle Project in , with our previous chairperson Paula Dillon at the helm, which saw the local community come together to raise money for the refurbishment of two sensory rooms and the hydrotherapy pool.ldquoWe smashed our target of pound, to raise a staggering amount of over pound, and we were able to provide the school with a bicycle track and new bikes.ldquoWe funded a Memory Tree, which the school had wanted for some considerable time, designed and constructed by local artist Kevin Killen, to remember pupils who passed away while attending Knockevin.Kelley added: ldquoWe also have recently agreed to fund the refurbishment of the soft play area in the Profound and Multiple Learning Disabilities unit within the Downpatrick school site. Our next aim is to provide funding for outdoor gym play equipment which is essential at this time.Due to the Covid pandemic the PSA was forced to cancel or postpone many fundraising events such as the annual  and k runs and family fun walk.The bag pack at the Asda supermarket Downpatrick also had to be cancelled, although the PSA received a generous donation from Asda for its Christmas raffle.The tenth anniversary ball, which was to have been held in the Burrendale Hotel, has been put back until October .A drive-in movie screening of the Christmas film Elf at Letrsquos Go Hydro in Carryduff this Sunday has also been cancelled, but there are hopes that it can be rescheduled for a later date.Said Kelley: ldquoWe are always so grateful of all the support we receive not only from our parents, carers and school staff, who all volunteer their time to organise and carry out events, but also the local community.ldquoWithout everyonersquos help we would not be able to continue to support our amazing children and young adults, which is our purpose.She added: ldquoBoth school sites are held in such high regard by the local community and by parents and carers.ldquoWe look forward to a time when we can resume fundraising as a community again.

There is a programme within that which will go out to the public and I would imagine multiple groups will want to apply from all over the district.“I would hope and expect the group Cllr Cuthbertson refers to will also be an applicant, that is how we do our business.“My role in all of this is to ensure we are consistent in our approach, trouble arises when criteria is applied inconsistently.”Sinn Fein councillor Sean McPeake said “it was a bit rich” of Cllr Cuthbertson to make this accusation.“Essentially what has been put here isCouncil does not jump to the beck and call of a certain community group it is in the wrong,” said Cllr McPeake.“I think that would be a very dangerous precedent to start going down.“We are at a very early stage in this and are going down the route of best practice, taking an educational view and taking all perspectives into account.“That is the way it should be and the way it was previously.“I just think it is a bit rich but I am not surprised coming from the same councillor.“It is absolutely hypocriticalfor a member to be castigating this council because somehow, the Council is not acting to the whim of a certain community group.”In response, Cllr Cuthbertson said he would “not take any lectures about being hypocriticalfrom a Sinn Fein member” and reiterated his stance that it is not for an officer to decide what community feedback is included in a report.“Are we saying now that ratepayers in Mid Ulster have no say in any policy coming forward. Does community feedbackmean nothing,” asked Cllr Cuthbertson.“Is it now the case any consultation this Council does is simply a paper ticking exercise as community feedback means nothing ”The Council’s Chair described this suggestion as “rubbish” and “not the experience of any other member in this council.”Maghera author signs up top scriptwriter - read hereEditor’s messageThank you for reading this article.

When a bubble is formed it is fixed, and must not be changed or extended further at any point.bull Each Christmas bubble can meet at home, at a place of worship or an outdoor public place, but existing, more restrictive rules on hospitality and meeting in other venues will be maintained throughout this period.It is important that everyone respects and abides by the rules of each nation wherever they choose to spend the festive period.Where there are any iations in our approach, these will be communicated by each administration accordingly.Further guidance will be provided in due course.The winter holiday period is a time often spent with family and friends, with schools and offices closing and people travelling over the bank holidays.Many have already begun making their plans, and we are today providing clarity to help people make the right choices for them, and enjoy time with those closest to them while staying within the rules to protect us all. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

These centres have already been decided by health boards and are in the process of being prepared.The development process for coronavirus vaccines has been as stringent as any other but the process in the face of the pandemic has been sped up by prompt, world-wide funding and a reduction in paperwork.Theof the trials have not been shortened, and the usual safety measures remain in place.The vaccine will not be mandatory and people will be able to choose whether they take up the vaccine or not.Information will be provided to people before vaccination to reassure them about patient safety and robust consent processes will be in place.Vice-chairman of the Covid- Vaccine Programme Board, Richard Roberts from Public Health Wales, said: ldquoIt is a signicant achievement that only  months after WHOannounced the global pandemic that we now have the first safe and effective vaccine available for use in Wales, and other vaccines to follow.\"Everyone has been preparing for months to deliver the Covid- vaccine programme, and it is very exciting that we will be able to begin, once the final steps have been put in place so that the programme can be delivered safely. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Shops, hairdressers, restaurants, places of worship and hotels are among the places that will be able to re-open from December . Pubs selling drink onlywill remain closed and an additional financial package will be put in place. The Executive has also agreed Christmas household bubbling arrangements from December -. Three households will be able to come together for this period in domestic settings, outdoor public spaces and places of worship. One of the households will be able to include their existing household bubble. First Minister Arlene Foster said: “Through our collective efforts over recent weeks we gained enough space in the transmission of the virus to relax a signicant number of restrictions, including the opening-up of non-essential retail, close contact services, sport and leisure activities and our places of worship at the end of next week. “These decisions will give families, businesses and employees some much-needed certainty and comfort in the run-up to Christmas and beyond. “This is a special time of the year and we want to support people to have a good Christmas, but also a safe one. “Signicant work has been completed with business sectors, faith groups, local government and police on new mitigation measures to reduce the risk of transmission. “I urge everyone to be Covid-aware and to make careful and sensible decisions when out and about or mixing with others. We need to make sure we continue doing all we can to protect ourselves and our loved ones.” Deputy First Minister Michelle O’Neill said: “The Executive wants to give people as much notice as possible on what the situation will look like from next Friday when the current circuit breaker comes to an end. “We have given detailed consideration to which restrictions need tobe maintained, and what we can open up, in light of the scientic and medical advice. “A package of measures that will see signicant relaxations to the current restrictions has been agreed, with maximum mitigations in place to minimise risks to the greatest extent possible. An additional support package will be put in place for traditional drink-only pubs that unfortunately will not be able to reopen at this time. “We appreciate how important Christmas time is for many families and the Executive has agreed arrangements that will allow families and friends to come together in a limited way between  and  December. “It’s important for people to understand that with any increased contact comes increased risk. Everyone needs to think very carefully about the risks posed to them, and their loved ones, by coming together over the Christmas period, particularly to those who are vulnerable. Some may choose not to form a Christmas bubble but for those who do, we encourage them to keep their bubbles small and limit the numbers of people gathering, as much as possible.”  addthis,     Leave your commentTyrone Constitution- High Street, OmaghBT BDTel:     , ,, , ,  .jsp, , ,   , ,success:  ,  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" Order your photos n n n \" Advertise with us n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_edbdeebbcabc   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_bbeedac   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html .  ,.vc_most_readMost Popular Stories.   , ]]      []js  d js.id  idjs.src  \"connect.facebook.net en_US #xfbmlversionv.\"fjs[],p ^http: .test http:httpsjs+: fjspo  text javascript   truepo.src  https:apis.google js plusone.js s  document[] s"}]
