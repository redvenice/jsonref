Some of our busiest city centres resemble ghost towns, missing the usual bustle of passing trade. This comes at a high price for local businesses, jobs and communities.\u0027She added that getting staff back into offices and workplaces is as important as the return of pupils to school. Today, Dame Carolyn explained a return to work is \u0027about balance between flexible working and office working\u0027 as she echoed her concerns about deserted city hubs.\u0027We\u0027ve seen the most extraordinary effects from flexible working, productivity improvement, better quality of life, there\u0027s no doubt about that and we\u0027re not going back to where we were,\u0027 she said. \u0027We must remember the huge importance of offices. The mental health benefits of being in an office, the training benefits for young people, and the third reason I think is absolutely fundamental, we do have a number of our bigger cities, they feel like ghost towns. \u0027We risk destroying the ecosystem of the small businesses, the large businesses, the offices that make the city centres so vibrant.\u0027She added that firms are \u0027really thinking hard\u0027 about how to implement a return to work, with some employees who are keen to return to the workplace still concerned about public transport and childcare.\u0027We know that there is real demand for coming back to the office from some people,\u0027 Dame Carolyn said. \u0027Firms want to do right by their employees and create that flexibility.\u0027I think there are a number of things the government can do, the first is Test and Trace, this is all about confidence in people feeling it\u0027s OK to leave the home.\u0027Public transport, we hear again and again people are concerned over the safety of public transport - actually it\u0027s relatively empty at the moment, people are by and large wearing masks.\u0027We\u0027re not talking here about a stampede back to the office, that simply is not going to happen, but unless we start putting the measures in place to build confidence, the childcare, the test and trace, the confidence in public transport, the risk is that we will look back discover we have lost something incredibly valuable.\u0027An audit of major employers conducted by the Mail this week revealed most have only a small percentage of staff back in the office – and many are telling people they will not be back at their desks until January at the earliest.Firms opting to keep most staff working from home for the rest of the year include NatWest, which employs almost 50,000 BT, which has 40,000 staff at home KPMG, which has only 10 per cent of its 16,000 staff in the office and Vodafone, whose 7,850 staff are almost all at home.Tech giant Microsoft has said it will not start returning its 3,000 UK staff to their desks until at least November.A separate survey by the BBC found that 50 of the country’s biggest employers have no plans to return all staff to the office full time.The Government last month dropped the formal pandemic advice that people should work from home if possible.Mr Johnson said ‘start to go back to work now if you can’ and ordered Whitehall to draw up detailed plans for getting more civil servants back. However the return to work across Government appears to have been only a trickle, rather than a flood.Ministers are in talks about workplace testing for coronavirus in order to give staff more confidence to return. But talks are still at an early stage and there has been no effort to encourage commuters back onto public transport.A Whitehall source said this week: ‘Getting people back to work is something the PM feels strongly about. It is slowly happening in Whitehall but not at the pace we would want.’"},{"url":null,"title":"An economic hurricane brewing Business chief says aid workers firms on","story":" Mr Marshall also suggested extra help for sectors like the night time economy, aviation, travel, and the aerospace supply chain which are likely to be badly hit by coronavirus for a long time.The also backed an extension of Coronavirus Business Interruption Loans and help to buy cheap coronavirus tests to allow workers to be checked more frequently.  Germany yesterday extended its furlough scheme until the end of next year at a likely cost of £27billion.It is hoped that the move will help the economy to recover after the coronavirus pandemic saw the country\u0027s GDP fall by 11.7 per cent over the first six months of the year.More than 10.1 million workers, including one in three in the industrial sector, were on furlough at the peak of the Covid-19 lockdown.But there are no plans to extend the scheme in the UK into the winter.

Releases of restrictions, increased numbers of imports due to people travelling overseas, and evidence of poor adherence in some cases to such restrictions that remain, all have the potential to contribute to increased transmission. \u0027This trend also reflects patterns seen in other European countries which released restrictions earlier and therefore saw a case resurgence earlier. \u0027Whether or not this represents the beginning of a second wave of a national epidemic will depend on the ability of the test and trace system to respond effectively by stamping out as many local outbreaks as possible, quickly.\u0027  One saving grace even if the numbers of cases are rising is that the death toll does not seem to be picking up pace, which experts say is because cases may now be more common among younger people who are less affected.Dr Simon Clarke, professor of cellular microbiology at the University of Reading, added: \u0027It should be remembered that we have not yet seen corresponding increases in hospital admissions, let alone deaths and it seems likely that we’d need to see sustained increases in the daily numbers of fresh diagnoses and hospital admissions before the authorities move towards any significant tightening of restrictions on our lives.\u0027People need to remain conscious of the risks of infection and get tested if they have any symptoms.\u0027 "},{"url":null,"title":"Passenger hauled flight no symptoms received text seconds off","story":"Share this articleRyanair coronavirus scare: What really happened when passenger was dragged off jet - Mirror OnlineCovid passenger on Ryanair flight \u0027had no symptoms\u0027 \u0026amp plane was about to TAKE-OFF when \u0027he received positive test text\u0027"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0377d179f1a9e8be9200ea566ecaf83a2b5d4758/0_224_3000_1799/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3bdaa1645b2be25ebd6b55c4702714b5","title":"richard osman i want to be writing novels for the rest of my life now","story":"The television presenter and debut author on John le Carré, his favourite crime writers and the funniest book in the English languageThe book I am currently readingThe Nickel Boys by Colson Whitehead.

An ultra-Orthodox man and his son, who were sitting in the row when she arrived, asked Wolfson to switch seats with a man a few rows ahead.Wolfson says she was “insulted and humiliated” by the request. “It was the first time in my adult life that I was discriminated against for being a woman,” she told Haaretz.“I would not have had any problem whatsoever switching seats if it were to allow members of a family or friends to sit together, but the fact that I was being asked to do this because I was a woman was why I refused.”A flight attendant intervened and offered Wolfson a free hot drink as an incentive to move. Concerned that the flight might be delayed on her account and feeling that she had little choice in the matter, she agreed to switch seats. “There were passengers watching this happen who said nothing,” she said.According to the suit, several flight attendants told Wolfson during the flight that women were often asked to switch seats in order to accommodate ultra-Orthodox men.Two months later, on another easyJet flight to London, Wolfson was again asked to move seats by two ultra-Orthodox men. She refused their request but two female passengers agreed to change seats with the two men sitting next to her.Members of the cabin crew did not intervene or try to defend her right to stay seated where she was although again she was offered a free hot drink, according to the suit.Wolfson complained to the airline on both occasions but when it failed to respond, she decided to sue for violation of Israeli law, which prohibits discrimination against customers on the basis of race, religion, nationality, land of origin, gender, sexual orientation, political views or personal status.Although easyJet is not based in Israel, lawyers will argue that the airline was subject to Israeli law while its plane was on the ground at Ben-Gurion airport, where the incident took place.In a statement, easyJet said: “We take claims of this nature very seriously. Whilst it would be inappropriate to comment, as this matter is currently the subject of legal proceedings, we do not discriminate on any grounds.”Three years ago, Renee Rabinowitz, an 82-year-old Holocaust survivor, won a landmark ruling against El Al. The Israeli judge hearing the case said that “under absolutely no circumstances can a crew member ask a passenger to move from their designated seat because the adjacent passenger doesn’t want to sit next to them due to their gender”.At the time, IRAC said almost 7,500 emails had been sent to El Al by members of the public objecting to requests made to female passengers to change seats.• This article was amended on 28 August 2020 to restore the wording “ultra-Orthodox”, which had been mistakenly changed during the editing process."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a89ecfd049e2eb97befaad517580fdee863bb1c9/99_151_5901_3540/master/5901.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0f073a82a50827bc116dc40f6f383364","title":"eat out to help out fuels uk economic recovery in august covid 19","story":" analysis shows pace of job cuts on back of Covid-19 crisis remains the concernBritain’s economic recovery from Covid-19 gathered pace in the past month, fuelled by consumer spending and people taking advantage of the government’s “eat out to help out” scheme, despite fears mounting over rapid growth in unemployment.On the ’s latest monthly tracker of economic news since the pandemic spread to Britain this spring, the release of pent-up demand with the easing of lockdown is driving the sharpest rebound in economic growth among the G7 advanced economies, while retail spending has returned to pre-crisis levels.However, after the country plunged into the deepest recession on record in the three months to June, companies have started making job cuts at a faster pace than during the 2008 global financial crisis, with hundreds of thousands of redundancies announced in the past few weeks alone.Sounding the alarm as the UK government prepares to remove its furlough job retention scheme this autumn, Frances O’Grady, the director general of the TUC, warned that continued support would be required to avert a jobs catastrophe and long-term damage to the economy.Writing in the , she said: “Without urgent action we face the prospect of mass unemployment on a scale not seen since the 1980s.”Issuing an appeal to the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, she said: “There is still time to stop mass unemployment. We worked together once before as this crisis began: I will work with you again if you are serious at stemming the haemorrhage of jobs.” has chosen eight economic indicators, as well as the level of the FTSE 100, to track the impact on jobs and growth from Covid-19 and the measures used to contain it. Faced with the deepest global recession since the 1930s Great Depression, the Covid Crisis watch will also monitor how the UK is faring compared with other countries.In the past month, private sector business activity has risen at the fastest pace in seven years as companies race to catch up on work put on hold during lockdown. The increase in demand for services and manufactured goods, which followed the easing of restrictions during the summer, sent the IHS Markit CIPS flash UK composite output index to 60.3 in August, up from 57 in July. On a scale where a figure above 50 indicates expansion, the latest figures suggest the UK is recovering faster than the US, China and the eurozone.In the deepest decline of any nation in the G7 and the EU, the slump was worsened by the later launch of lockdown and prolonged use of controls to limit the spread of the virus. In a reflection of the deeper downturn for Britain, non-essential shops were closed for just 50 days in Germany, compared with 84 days in the UK.Retail sales jumped above pre-pandemic levels in July during the first full month since the relaxation of restrictions, as shoppers gradually returned to the high street. The hospitality sector also received a shot in the arm from the “eat out to help out” scheme, with a Monday-to-Wednesday boom at restaurants, pubs and cafes in August. More than 64m discounted meals – the equivalent of one for almost every person in Britain – have been claimed by venues taking part in the scheme so far.However, significant pressure remains for firms, threatening a sharp increase in unemployment this autumn. Online spending remains higher than before the crisis struck, footfall remains down in several big cities amid the continued absence of office workers, and demand remains weak in certain sectors more reliant on social interaction or travel, such as entertainment, aviation and tourism.Millions of workers have been brought back from furlough as firms gradually reopen with physical distancing measures in place, with the total number of people on the government’s wage subsidy scheme down from a peak of about 9 million in May to about 4.5 million at the start of August.Despite the government scheme protecting millions of jobs, official figures show almost three-quarters of a million jobs have been shed from company payrolls since March. Economists say unemployment is set to more than double as the government rolls back the furlough scheme this autumn and as firms cut their costs amid weaker levels of demand while Covid-19 remains a risk to health.Warning that the crisis is far from over, O’Grady said employers would need continued government support to protect jobs and create new ones as the risks from the pandemic gradually recede.“Mass unemployment is not inevitable. If the government acts fast to keep people in work, our economy will recover faster and our country can build back better,” she said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ed2fe976d253334925cd932a53bc7309c888941f/0_219_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6867c4c2ace657c2daac0941f22696b1","title":"revealed auditors raised minimum wage red flags at boohoo factories","story":"Exclusive: Third-party reports set out allegations at 18 Leicester suppliers The fast-fashion retailer Boohoo has been selling clothes made by at least 18 factories in Leicester that audits say have failed to prove they pay the minimum wage to workers, a  investigation has found.Third-party audit reports produced over the past four years make claims of “critical” issues over record-keeping and working hours at the time they were written, suggesting that in parts of the supply chain workers may be paid as little as £3-£4 an hour.Disclosed alongside new whistleblower claims about Boohoo’s supply chain, the confidential reports provide a snapshot of alleged issues in a factory at a specific time. They pose a new challenge to the brand’s insistence that issues reported in July were simply evidence of “the actions of a few” and stood in contrast to “the excellent work of many of our suppliers in the area”.Claudia Webbe, the MP for Leicester East, where many of the factories are based, said the allegations suggested “an unforgivable breakdown of our basic social contract” and called on Boohoo to urgently release a full list of its suppliers in the city.Boohoo said the documentation seen by the  “appears to be a selection of commentary from a limited number of the third-party audits that have been completed”. But it added that its own investigations “have highlighted similar issues” in some of the manufacturers identified by the  and that it had suspended trading with them until its concerns were resolved.Claims in the documents, which were described by one expert as “a smoking gun” on Boohoo and other brands’ oversight of minimum wage issues, detail allegations of:The reports, which date from 2017 to just a few months ago, came alongside whistleblower claims of other violations in Leicester’s factories. Industry sources speaking on condition of anonymity said they had seen dozens more that raised similar concerns at other Boohoo suppliers.There is no suggestion that Boohoo had access to the reports, which were circulated to some factory managers and other brands. The company, which has been accused in the past of turning a blind eye to issues in its supply chain, has its own oversight process for factories in Leicester.On its own investigations, Boohoo said: “Due to the nature of the non-compliance that we have found in a small number of manufacturers … we have immediately suspended orders with a number of suppliers whilst they take the appropriate action to resolve the issues identified. This includes some of the manufacturers identified by the .”It added that it was “deeply concerned by these findings” but said that until its own investigations and an independent QC-led review were complete “it would be inappropriate for us to comment further”. The brand did not clarify which of the factories it had suspended.Eight of the 18 companies denied some or all of the claims set out in the audits, with some calling them historical or saying they did not represent typical standards. The other 10 did not respond to multiple requests for comment.Audit reports are a central part of how fashion brands assess working practices in factories before deciding whether to place orders. But while they may be circulated within the industry, until now the reports have not been released publicly, even when they raise concerns over possible minimum-wage violations.“We have long known these reports exist, but brands never release them,” said Nik Hammer, an associate professor in employment studies at the University of Leicester and author of a 2015 report on the city’s textiles industry.The reports came alongside separate claims from one worker at Pro Fashion Limited, a subcontractor making clothes for Boohoo and its sister brands PrettyLittleThing and Nasty Gal. The worker showed the  a recent “official” payslip. It showed them earning the £8.72 legal minimum wage. Separately, the worker had what they described as a “shadow” payslip which was handwritten and they said showed many hours more had been worked. That suggested the real rate was just £6 an hour.Concerns over the company’s supply chain have been raised repeatedly over the years by campaign groups, the media and MPs, including the Conservative Andrew Bridgen in a speech to parliament earlier this year. But the brand and the government have until recently largely ignored calls for reform.The scrutiny intensified again this summer after the  revealed claims that Leicester textile firms had breached lockdown measures, and the Sunday Times reported that one Boohoo supplier had offered an undercover reporter £3.50 an hour.The Manchester-based brand had £1.5bn wiped off its share price in two days in July amid growing investor concern over practices within its supply chain. When the lockdown claims first emerged, Boohoo said they were inaccurate and that it “categorically does not tolerate any incidence of non-compliance … with our strict code of conduct”.With investors deserting the firm, and the home secretary, Priti Patel, demanding the company do more to protect workers in its supply chain, it announced plans to set up a “model factory” in Leicester where workers would be treated fairly, and set up an independent review. It also said it would increase an inspection programme led by the third-party auditor Verisio.But critics say the whistleblower accounts and reports seen by the  provide a worrying snapshot of the problems within the industry, particularly over alleged minimum-wage violations. At Onyx Fashion, a Boohoo supplier, one audit claimed managers admitted full-time workers were being falsely recorded as working part-time hours – an allegation the company “vehemently denied”.A 2018 report on Ezili Dariyai, which mainly produced leisurewear, said timesheets were not signed by workers and minimum-wage payments could not be verified. The company then went into liquidation, owing more than £600,000 to HM Revenue and Customs, causing Mahomed Hanif Musa Patel to be struck off as a director. He did not respond to requests for comment.Another firm, Bux Clothing, was accused in a 2017 audit of failing to keep proper records of working hours, making it impossible to verify the payment of minimum wage. The company did not respond to repeated requests for comment.On 8 July, we announced an independent review of our UK supply chain in Leicester. This two-part approach\u0026nbspsaw us invest heavily in significant extra compliance and auditing resource to forensically investigate the allegations that had been made about mistreatment of people employed by garment manufacturers in the area. We also appointed senior barrister Alison Levitt QC to lead a comprehensive and fully independent review of our Leicester supply chain, which has included a public call for evidence.\u0026nbspThe documentation that has been seen by the  appears to be a selection of commentary from a limited number of the third-party audits that have been completed. Whilst we are deeply concerned by these findings, until these processes are concluded, we have had sight of all the facts and received Ms Levitt’s findings, it would be inappropriate for us to comment further.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspThe group is committed to delivering the highest standards of ethics, compliance and transparency, and we have committed to sharing an update on the findings of Ms Levitt’s review, our response, and the actions that we will take to address any failings at the end of September.\u0026nbspWe will continue to offer our full support to raise standards where appropriate for the benefit of those employed in our supply chain, but will not hesitate to take more severe action when necessary. We can confirm that due to the nature of the non-compliance that we have found in a small number of manufacturers during this process we have immediately suspended trading with them whilst they take the appropriate action to resolve the issues identified within the timeline we have set. This includes some of the manufacturers identified by the , as our own investigations have highlighted similar issues.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspWe feel that it is important to give owners the opportunity to show demonstrable, measurable and significant improvement to protect the jobs of those employed, but if we are left in any doubt about an owner’s true commitment to drive change in the timeframe that we have set out we will have no choice but to terminate trading with them.\u0026nbspWe recognise that walking away from every factory where an issue is found would have a catastrophic impact on the livelihoods of those employed in the sector. Instead, we are working closely with a number of organisations, including the GLAA and Slave Free Alliance, sharing our findings with them to support the important work that they do in ensuring that the rights of workers are protected and that everyone is treated fairly and paid appropriately.Bux Clothing is one of five textile firms in Leicester to separately be issued with improvement notices by the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) over hygiene and social distancing measures since the city’s second lockdown, alongside I Design Leicester, Clothing Pallet, VR Mode Limited and Smart Garments. All five complied with the notices.As well as Bux, the  has established through worker interviews that Smart Garments is also a Boohoo supplier.Smart Garments did not dispute the HSE’s findings that it “failed to put reasonably practicable control measures in place to prevent the spread of Covid-19” but said the body was “satisfied with our risk assessment and how we managed the factory in the current Covid environment”. Boohoo did not comment on the improvement notices.Dominique Muller, whose report on Leicester factories in lockdown for the campaign group Labour Behind the Label prompted the recent Boohoo storm, claimed the range of the audits showed that “the idea that this could go on without Boohoo’s knowledge or tacit acceptance, it’s a complete fallacy. They hold the power in Leicester, and it’s disingenuous to pretend anything else.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/629f090333054a6f9de9b05bcd862368619eb017/0_400_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=07f7776b6f9a17a4fff035c69165e7cd","title":"uk economy august sales jump tough choices national debt","story":"As the national debt breaches the £2tn mark, here is our snapshot of what is happeningDaily new coronavirus infections peaked in early April and fell between May and early July.

US stock markets laden with big tech companies – which are benefiting from more activity online during the pandemic – have hit record highs. The FTSE 100 has held steady in the past month, roughly unchanged at just over 6,000.Britain’s private sector expanded at its fastest pace for seven years in August after the lifting of lockdown for most of the country, boosted by the release of pent-up demand. The IHS Markit CIPS flash UK composite output index rose to 60.3 in August, from 57 in July. A figure above 50 indicates expansion. Activity also increased in the US. However, growth slowed in the eurozone and China, raising fears for other countries following in the path of the first country to be struck by the pandemic.The government’s emergency response to the coronavirus pandemic and shrinking tax receipts as Britain falls into recession has triggered a sharp increase in public borrowing. Against this backdrop, national debt has risen to more than £2tn and now exceeds the size of the UK economy for the first time since the early 1960s. Borrowing in the financial year to July is estimated to have been £150.5bn – as much as £128.4bn more than in the same period last year. The chancellor, Rishi Sunak, has said “tough choices” must be made to tackle the size of the deficit. However, economists say the cost of borrowing is at a record low and warn against cutting back state support too soon."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/64db94351c41669ced77ba1960099443015b078d/0_119_3736_2242/master/3736.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4baa4ef2c1ca60c2bdfb71a0d9bb42dd","title":"waitrose and deliveroo to take on m and s and ocado online groceries","story":"Tuesday marks new front in fight for online groceries market as Ocado and Waitrose part waysWaitrose is to test fast-track grocery deliveries with the takeaway courier firm Deliveroo as it prepares to do battle with its rival Marks \u0026amp Spencer, which will finally begin selling groceries online next week.After almost two decades together, the online grocery specialist Ocado has ditched Waitrose and will switch to selling M\u0026ampS food from Tuesday, kicking off a fight between the two grocers for the online upper-midmarket.In a last minute move, Waitrose has unveiled a 12-week trial with Deliveroo, through which more than 500 of the supermarket’s products could be delivered within 30 minutes of five stores. The service will be available from stores including Bristol, Cambridge and Notting Hill, west London, and adds to Waitrose’s two-hour Rapid service, which is now operating from 29 stores and has 23,000 customers.James Bailey, the executive director of Waitrose, said: “This gives us another opportunity to give our customers a taste of what the future of convenience shopping could look like for us.”Slick delivery service from robot-run distribution centresDelivery fee:\u0026nbspup to £6.99 depending on timingNumber of products: 50,000, including 6,000 M\u0026ampS items from TuesdayFastest delivery:\u0026nbspless than 30 minutes if you live near the Zoom facility in Chiswick, west LondonStaff-owned service run from mix of stores and warehousesNumber of products:\u0026nbspup to 27,000, about half of which are own-labelSubstitutions: average two per order, with option of refund or biggerbetter productFastest delivery:\u0026nbspless than two hours via Rapid service, which operates from 29 stores. Also less than 30 minutes via Deliveroo from five stores from SeptemberWhile Waitrose is revving mopeds and delivery bikes, Ocado will close two of its three giant robot-run warehouses on bank holiday Monday so it can ship out remaining Waitrose products to food banks and the food redistributor Company Shop. At the same time, thousands of fresh M\u0026ampS products will be trucked in to join the tins, packets and other less fragile and perishable goods that have been gradually filling Ocado’s warehouses over the last three weeks.Only those Ocado shoppers close to the group’s warehouse in Erith, south-east London, will be able to receive one of the last Ocado deliveries containing Waitrose products on Monday.Melanie Smith, the head of Ocado’s retail arm, will be present at one of group’s first deliveries containing M\u0026ampS food products on Tuesday at about 6am – potentially in a van decked out in the livery of M\u0026ampS Percy Pig sweets that was spotted on a motorway covered in black plastic before the launch.Smith said she felt relaxed about the switch from Waitrose to M\u0026ampS after 18 months of preparations, adding that there had been a “strong level of forward demand” for the move. Despite the gradual unwinding of coronavirus lockdown measures and return to work for many, Ocado’s delivery slots are still selling out every day with all of Tuesday’s snapped up earlier this week.Bailey, who only joined Waitrose in May, said he was “feeling optimistic” especially as the switch to online shopping during the pandemic had already helped Waitrose replace those Ocado sales.Waitrose, which is part of the John Lewis Partnership, has gained more than 100,000 extra online orders a week – or about 250,000 customers – since lockdown began. Online sales are already at an annualised rate of £1bn, the group’s target for the end of the year. But the retailer is clearly ambitious for more with two last-minute changes this week.First Waitrose cut its minimum order from £60 to £40, putting it on a par with Ocado. Then it announced the Deliveroo trial.Bailey said the biggest change would be a more direct relationship with its shoppers. While Waitrose supplied 4,000 products to Ocado, making up about a quarter of the latter’s grocery sales, it had no contact with them.“Now we’ll be the No 1 connection with customers online and can communicate with them about the brands we sell, our food provenance and all the things that make Waitrose special and different,” Bailey said.Waitrose’s battle is not only with Ocado and M\u0026ampS but also Tesco, Sainsbury’s, Morrisons, Asda and Amazon, all of whom are investing heavily in expanding online. Food box firms, such as Riverford, and meal kit services have also experienced massive growth while restaurants and cafes have been closed.Despite the gradual return to offices and schools, Smith said she did not expect Ocado shoppers to head back to stores. “The hurdle for us is the move to shopping online. Once customers start then they tend to stick online. Competitors have done us a great service switching a lot of people to shop online,” she said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5e6d482bca3fc535cbf4ce96c4ef6d6b9684ec31/0_68_953_572/master/953.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0be043bb6e75a07094a11b994598a2f9","title":"pebble pods and bubble domes six amazing places to wake up in northern ireland","story":"From quirky glampsites to boutique hotels with amazing views, discover the most enticing places to stay in Northern IrelandPebble Pods, Strangford, County DownA relatively new entry to the Northern Ireland glamping scene, but one of the most remarkable, this private location on the shores of Strangford Lough takes pod camping to a new level – and with only three two-person pods, you’ll never find it overcrowded.The glass-and-timber Pebble Pods resemble Hobbit holes, and have a host of amenities, but let’s focus on the most important: a private hot tub, thermal sauna, firepit and barbecue area, providing for year-round luxuriating by the cool waters of one of NI’s most gorgeous loughs.If you’re an active person, there are free bikes and even kayaks to help you explore the area. If you’re feeling more laid back, you can just hit the tub and let the world scurry on by.Lough Erne Resort, County FermanaghIf you’re after absolute luxury, why not go the whole hog? The sprawling, castellated Lough Erne Resort, housed on its own 243-hectare (600-acre) peninsula between the reedy shores of Lower Lough Erne and Castle Hume Lough, just outside Enniskillen, really is the last word in refinement.Starting your day with a choice between the resort’s two world-class golf courses sounds like our kind of dilemma: the Faldo course has been represented globally by local son Rory McIlroy, who holds the course record.For those who don’t have the golf bug, take heart: with an incredible Thai spa, world-class restaurants and access to the 40-mile-long splendour of Lough Erne, you’ll be fine.If it’s good enough to host the not-unpicky G8 summit (as it did in 2013), Lough Erne Resort is sure to satisfy your own exacting standards …And those who are after quality local food won’t need to look further than the resort’s Catalina restaurant, where guests can dine in luxury after a long day of exploring.Larchfield Estate, Lisburn, County AntrimIt’s fair to say Myrtle has been around for a while, seen a few tight squeezes, and is always ready with a warm welcome for her guests. Don’t worry, she’s not an over-friendly local – Myrtle is a lovingly-restored 1952 Saurer Swiss Army truck that now serves as one of Northern Ireland’s most inspiring glamping options at the gorgeous Larchfield Estate.The accommodation is suitably cosy and stylish, equipped with a log-burning stove, sun deck and a sauna housed in its own wooden pod with bucolic views of the surrounding greenery. Rise and shine after a night with Myrtle and set off to explore the 243-hectare (600-acre) estate. Mission accomplished.Killeavy Castle Estate, County ArmaghA gothic flight of fantasy built in 1836, Killeavy Castle is both grand and cosy: it features imposing medieval-style doors and turrets, yet the restored pile makes room for just four luxurious bedrooms within its castellated walls. Wake to the view from any of its 52 windows and you’ll feel like landed gentry.Elsewhere on the estate, the original mill, gatehouse and coach house have all been converted into stylish accommodation. There’s also a high-end spa, all on 142 hectares (350 acres) in the shadow of Slieve Gullion, the tallest mountain in County Armagh.Famed for its locally sourced food, Killeavy Castle Estate provides everything from sublime seven-course tasting menus to a famously good fry-up for breakfast.That’s your morning plans sorted.Palace Street Apartments, Derry-LondonderryPass through the famed city walls at the ornate Bishop’s Gate, then hang a sneaky left, and you’ll find yourself in a barely car-width street lined on one side by the kind of Victorian red brick you’d expect to see in an adaptation of Dickens.It’s also the very fitting home of the Palace Street Apartments, a lovingly restored, three-unit, self-catering gem. Step outside in the morning and you’ll find all of Derry-Londonderry at your feet. Within the confines of the old walled city, you’re only a stroll away from the historic Guildhall (as well-known for its political history as for its appearance in Derry Girls), St Columba’s Cathedral, where the original keys of the city are held, and the Diamond war memorial.That said, dark wood, oiled leather, antique furniture and deep beds come as standard in each apartment, making going outside an optional extra.Finn Lough, County FermanaghA lot has been written about the bubble domes at the eco-conscious Finn Lough resort in Fermanagh, but nothing can prepare you for the experience of waking snug and cosy in a luxury bed, and opening your eyes to see the dawn sky straight above you.These transparent domes offer uninterrupted views of the surrounding nature alongside high-end creature comforts: four-poster beds, ensuite bathrooms, and coffee machines to ease you into the morning the right way.Once you’ve recovered from the majesty of the morning there are woodland trails to explore, on foot or cycle, and a lake to linger by. There’s also a top-tier spa for those who aim simply to “sleep well, be pampered” – and who can blame them, when your bed is this spectacular?Come on over to Northern IrelandPlan your visit to Northern Ireland with everything you need to know about things to do, where to stay and more at irelandnorthern-irelandGet advice about travelling to Northern Ireland, including the latest information on Covid-19 restrictions at nidirect.gov.ukcoronavirus"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/345c28211f4ca1ea57842a60109e9d76c3d87992/0_116_6242_3745/master/6242.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b59877834e5319eb717de6309ac0365b","title":"surf cycle or hike go wild on northern irelands adventure coast","story":"Where can you hike along a world-heritage coastline, ride an Atlantic wave, then cycle around a puffin colony, all within a few miles of each other? The answer is along Northern Ireland’s Causeway CoastWhether you like to explore on foot, by bike or by water, Northern Ireland’s Causeway Coast could be the most scenic part of the UK you’ve never visited. Yet its natural attractions and ersity of landscapes make it perfect for anyone with an adventurous heart.Here we pick a few of Northern Ireland’s outdoor highlights, though the full range of opportunities extend far beyond what’s mentioned here. The best advice? Book a week and discover the possibilities for yourself.Explore by footAt the tip of Northern Ireland lies its most famous attraction – the Unesco world heritage site of the Giant’s Causeway. And there’s no better way to reach it than on foot, by following an eight-mile section of the Causeway Coast Way. Begin at picturesque Ballintoy Harbour, which Game of Thrones fans will recognise as a setting for the Iron Islands. Then head west along the signed coast path, passing sandy beaches, rock arches and a ruined clifftop castle before finishing at the Giant’s Causeway. The 40,000 interlocking basalt columns provide a fitting finale to one of the best walks in Northern Ireland.For something completely different, head to nearby Glenariff Forest Park. Set within the celebrated Glens of Antrim, the scenery here transports you to another world. Expect numerous waterfalls, wooden walkways deep within river gorges, and long-distance views along chiselled glacial escarpments. Signed hiking circuits of different lengths mean there’s a route for walkers of all abilities.Explore by bikeIf two wheels are your thing, Rathlin Island offers an outing that will remain etched in your memory for years to come. Lying six miles off the coast, the trip begins with a ferry ride from Ballycastle marina. You’ll need to bring your own bike due to Covid-19 restrictions, but the island can be explored in a few hours. The highlight is the eight-mile return trip to its western tip. Here the land ends in sheer cliffs that are home to both a lighthouse and Northern Ireland’s largest breeding seabird colony. There’s no better way to break your ride than descending to the RSPB viewing platform and, if you’re here at the right time of year – between April and August – watching the antics of hundreds of thousands of nesting birds. Regardless of when you visit, the views remain breathtaking all year round, and the sensual assault of sound and smell makes the trip back to the harbour feel positively peaceful.For a longer journey, back on the mainland try the signed cycle route between the Giant’s Causeway and Benone. This 22-mile trip can be completed in either direction, and follows a mixture of public roads and traffic-free paths. The ride takes you through the coastal towns of Portrush, Portstewart and Castlerock, with numerous opportunities to explore sandy beaches or stop for refreshments along the way.Explore by waterAnother great option is to leave the land altogether, and explore the unique coastline from the sea. This is a shore littered with caves, arches, tunnels and cliffs, and the only way to appreciate them fully is from the water.Sea kayaking is a great option, with several local companies providing all the equipment and guidance you need to begin weaving silently between the headlands. Choose from a half-day or full-day excursion, with incredible coastal scenery interspersed by a snack or lunch in some tucked-away cove along the way.If you’d prefer to embrace the waves then there’s the chance to try surfing instead – the neighbouring towns of Portrush and Portstewart are the twin meccas for local surfers. Hire a wetsuit and surfboard from the back of the beach, book into a lesson, then hit the waves. Whether you’re a beginner or a pro, you’re guaranteed a great time, with watery thrills and spills all part of the fun.Novices and experts are also welcomed by the local sailing centres. Take a lesson or join a skippered yacht for a longer adventure, spending anything from an hour to a whole weekend on the water. With the emphasis on guests doing as much of the sailing as possible, it won’t be long before you know your jib from your gybe.Something differentOf course the activities mentioned here just scrape the surface of what’s available, and with a little imagination almost anything is possible. How about a catch-and-sea boat trip, where you start by going sea fishing, then return to watch a professional chef prepare your bounty, garnished by other local delicacies?Or a horse ride, featuring a gentle hack through the glens or an adrenaline-filled canter across the beach? Organised scuba ing, coasteering it’s all here, with countless options to suit all ages and abilities.So what’s keeping you away? The Causeway Coast is a goldmine of activities and opportunities, its charms are just waiting to be discovered.Due to Covid-19 restrictions, the mini-bus tour, bird sanctuary and bike hire are not currently available, for more information visit: rathlincommunity.orghomeCome on over to Northern IrelandPlan your visit to Northern Ireland with everything you need to know about things to do, where to stay and more at irelandnorthern-irelandGet advice about travelling to Northern Ireland, including the latest information on Covid-19 restrictions at nidirect.gov.ukcoronavirus"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f7b5b21ac8701af2978992441cadda1c892a230d/0_632_2700_1620/master/2700.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=05dc56861a84e84a9aa9254dbc4ee3c9","title":"teachers and parents across the uk share your thoughts on the reopening of schools","story":"We’d like to hear from people in England, Wales and Northern Ireland about returning to schools, and those in Scotland about how it has beenWith just weeks to go until children return to school in England and Wales, and less than a week until the first cohort of students in Northern Ireland return for the start of the new academic year, protective measures in schools remain fiercely contested.Many teachers have criticised the government’s ‘bubble’ group scheme and social distancing measures, while some unions have called for teachers to be able to choose to use face coverings, against government advice.We’d like to hear from teachers and parents about how they are preparing for the reopening of schools, and how they are feeling about it.If you are in Scotland, where schools are already open full-time, we’d also like to hear how it has been so far.We are particularly interested in hearing from parents about whether they will be sending their children back to school, and how they feel about possible fines for not doing so.You can get in touch by filling in the form below, anonymously if you wish.

A “modern ranch, 21st-century ranch is really land management”, he said, and one aspect of that is to “lease the mineral rights to oil companies and you sell water to oil companies”.The Wilderness Society called the prospect “disappointing” Greenpeace warns, generally, of “hundreds of tons of toxic fracking chemicals, many of which are kept secret by the industry”, polluting aquifers and drinking water.Yet in Wyoming itself, months later, people say they are hardly surprised. In fact, they say, it would be strange for major landowners like RuPaul and his husband not to have fracking rigs on their ranches.Ranching and fracking go hand in hand here in one of the country’s top oil-producing states. Oil wells are as much a part of the landscape as sweeping mountains, sagebrush and cattle, often whether landowners like it or not.RuPaul doesn’t live full-time at the ranch, which is owned by his husband, Georges LeBar, but rather uses it as a vacation spot. “There isn’t a lot to do” there, RuPaul told Jimmy Kimmel in 2018. “I go up there and read books and watch movies. We just chill.” RuPaul hasn’t been seen in town by locals very often, and he called the people of Wyoming “frosty” and “chilly”.Members of the local LGBTQ community are excited RuPaul is in the area. “I wish I knew the right person who knew RuPaul so that he would come to one of my events,” said Gage Williams, chair of Out in Wyoming, an LGBTQ non-profit.He added: “That ranch is right in Douglas, which is known for oil. It’s not a surprise that one of the biggest ranches is fracking.”Fracking is a controversial method of extracting oil and gas trapped in rock formations. Wyoming is arid, and the process uses an immense of amount of water. The resulting fossil fuels contribute to the climate crisis.The non-profit FracTracker estimates that there are 60 producing oil wells and 144 wells waiting for approval on the LeBar Ranch property. A majority of the companies that own producing oil wells on the property are privately owned.As Wyomingites are aware, RuPaul and his husband probably have no say over whether fracking occurs on their property. The rights to minerals under a given piece of land, including fossil fuels, are owned separately from the surface rights.While it might be difficult for many landowners to refuse oil and gas development on their properties outright, “negotiating with companies as opposed to just saying no often means being able to get wells and infrastructure located away from sensitive wildlife areas or other areas the landowner cares about”, said Shannon Anderson, staff attorney for the Powder River Basin Resource Council, which advocates for responsible energy development through community organizing.LeBar, RuPaul’s husband, was born and raised in Australia and inherited the LeBar Ranch from his grandfather, who ran a successful sheep and cattle operation along with his wife for decades on the ranch. Georges LeBar doesn’t own or run cattle himself, instead leasing the grazing rights on his land to other ranchers.LeBar and RuPaul did not respond to requests for comment.“RuPaul and LeBar could not say no to oil and gas development,” Butler said. “I cannot say no on any of the ranch that I’m owner of. There’s a healthy tension between ranchers and the oil industry, and you just have to negotiate in good faith.”He added that although RuPaul considers the locals cold, he would beg to differ.“I’m not frosty, I’d go for a drink with him,” Butler said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8f64e89545ec56a815edf70b0c89eebb5d299b2a/0_65_2100_1260/master/2100.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f5146e0a9814bd386dd702957eee2abf","title":"hawaii native birds fence kauai","story":"The Kīlauea Point national wildlife refuge is aiming to keep invasive species out and encourage native habitat to thriveSign up for monthly updates on America’s public lands.Before the first Polynesian settlers arrived roughly 1,500 years ago, the Hawaiian Islands were ruled from the sky. Not a single land-dwelling reptile or mammal called the archipelago home – just winged insects, one variety of bat, and a truly vast array of birds.To protect Hawaii’s native birds from these and other four-legged predators, conservationists at the Kīlauea Point national wildlife refuge on the island of Kauai are trying something new: building a sprawling wall around the birds’ nesting ground.In 2014, the wildlife refuge unveiled a state-of-the-art, predator-proof fence standing two meters tall and ning 624 meters (2,050ft) across, it creates a physical barrier that blocks invasive predators from accessing nesting seabirds and their young. The fence is capped with a rolled hood to stop attempts of climbing over, and an underground extension of its base wards off predators who can burrow and dig. The fence – with its very fine mesh – can prevent anything “larger than a one-day-old mouse” from getting through, according to the US Fish and Wildlife Service.In addition to non-native invasive species – like feral cats, dogs, rats and pigs – Hawaii’s rare native birds also face the looming threat of climate change, according to Jen Waipa, a local employee of the Fish and Wildlife Service. To that effect, the fence is also composed of marine-grade stainless steel to withstand natural disasters.The fence – the second of its kind in Hawaii – was installed at the behest of the Nihoku ecosystem restoration project, which is dedicated to preserving the archipelago’s coastal ecosystems and establishing safe breeding grounds for Hawaiian seabirds.While the barrier is designed to protect the seabirds from bodily harm, the wildlife refuge ultimately wants the birds to thrive – which necessitates a large number of ongoing side projects. One is habitat restoration – just as predatory mammals are catastrophic to Hawaii’s birds, invasive plants have crowded the islands, choking out native flora that can be used as a food source for Kauai’s birds. Each year, the Nihoku project transforms one acre of the wilderness refuge, uprooting all introduced vegetation and replacing it with native species. Volunteers also build artificial burrows, which provide the birds with reliable shelter.The Nihoku project is also working to attract animals to Kīlauea Point. Seabird calls are broadcast from a large speaker to attract the attention of adult birds, while volunteers search for hatchlings. The gradual loss of bioersity across Hawaii has painted a bleak picture, but Kīlauea Point serves as a beacon of hope for the archipelago’s future.In the coming years, the Fish and Wildlife Service aims to double the number of breeding species at Kīlauea Point the service highlights the success of Hawaii’s Lehua Island in the north-west as cause for optimism.And while many of the unique species that once called Hawaii home are now extinct, Kīlauea Point serves as another source of hope. Human settlers and colonizers may have started some of the troubles facing the islands’ endemic birds – but careful conservation and creative thinking could now help protect what’s left of them for future generations.

The venerable gallery, founded in 1846, had weathered the civil war, two global conflicts, bankruptcy, the expansion of the American art market, purchase by the actor Armie Hammer’s great-grandfather, and 911. But in the end, it mysteriously ceased operations with little more than an email announcement.The closure sent shock waves through the fine art establishment, a notoriously insular and opaque world, but in the days and months that followed, a trickle of press leaks revealed the extent of the damage: for 15 years, Knoedler had procured and sold at least 40 fraudulent paintings – an astounding $60m of forged work attributed to such modern American masters as Mark Rothko, Jackson Pollock and Robert Motherwell. It was, according to Driven to Abstraction, a new documentary on the scandal, “the greatest forgery hoax ever of modern American art”.At the heart of a scandal was a remarkably homespun, given the status and moneyed anonymity of the fine art world, scheme to pass forgeries off as lost works by masters of abstract expressionism, run primarily by a Long Island woman named Glafira Rosales. An associate of Freedman’s since the gallery president took over Knoedler in 1994, Rosales was virtually unknown to the rest of the fine art dealers it is unclear how she won over Freedman’s trust, but through a series of constantly shifting, flimsy stories, Rosales convinced Freedman of the existence of a mysterious, anonymous client – Mr X and his son, Mr X Jr, neither of whom were real. The Xs were supposedly looking to sell a trove of inherited treasures without documented provenance – they were gifts, clients were told, among other lies – which Rosales “discovered” over the course of 15 years from 1994 onward.In truth, the works were painted in Queens by a Chinese immigrant and preternatural imitator named Pei-Shen Qian, with the alleged help of Rosales’s boyfriend, José Carlos Bergantiños Díaz, and his brother Jesús, using artificial ageing techniques such as staining the canvas with teabags to make it appear older. (Qian, who did not participate in the film, allegedly made just $5,000 per painting, and has maintained he didn’t know his paintings were being sold as genuine works of famous artists, and fled to China the Bergantiños Díaz brothers fled to Spain Rosales pleaded guilty to various charges, including tax evasion and wire fraud, in 2013).The scheme outlined in Driven to Abstraction, which plays out in rhythm with the 2016 federal racketeering trial for $25m in damages levied against Knoedler by a disgruntled former client, is startlingly wide-reaching and brazen. Forged paintings on display in the gallery and private homes for years basic questions about paper trails, origins and simple fallacies (why was a signature misspelled “Pollok”? How were some paintings crafted with materials unavailable at the time they were supposedly made?) went unanswered or ignored. The slow drip of forgeries, it was revealed, totaled an astounding $60m – and that’s just the known works.The fraud was perpetuated, in part, by the fine art world’s fixation with anonymity and penchant for discretion Price referenced an old saying that after drugs and guns, the art trade is the most unregulated in the world. “This is not accidental lack of transparency this is the way they like it,” said Price. “The collectors like to be anonymous, the buyers like to be anonymous, the prices are anonymous … it all creates a world where this could happen.”That secretiveness, and the embarrassment of the whole affair, made finding people directly involved in the case willing to speak on camera difficult. “The art world is so scared of itself,” Price said. “I always knew it was going to be a difficult film to make, because of the very secrecy that allowed the hoax to go on so long was systemic. I knew I would run up against people who just wouldn’t talk.”Still, she said, it was surprising how people even tangentially related to the case expressed hesitation on speaking about it. “Just because they were dealers, or had to do with art fairs, just because it was such a tainted thing, there would be people who said ‘I think it’s great you’re making a film, but I can’t be in it,’” Price said.It’s not that nobody ever saw the paintings, since several of the forged paintings showed at Armory art shows, “and it’s not even that nobody was ever suspicious,” Price added. It’s that the true extent of the fraud passed for years under the cover of a lack of inquiry. “If all the dealers and all the experts had all talked to each other and shared their feelings, maybe it would’ve been different,” said Price. “But you don’t talk about it.”Freedman, who also did not participate in the film, vouched for the works’ authenticity until the last moment she later claimed in an interview with New York Magazine that she was Rosales’s “central victim”, though it remains unclear how much of the fraud she knew about, and when. For the shuttered Knoedler \u0026amp Company, the embarrassment caused by the scandal was protracted and costly it took eight years for the 10th and final forgery lawsuit against the gallery to be settled in August 2019, the final chapter in the hoax saga.Though Driven to Abstraction sticks strictly to the murky world of fine art dealing in the US, Price sees lessons in the film beyond the niche market of abstract expressionist paintings the forgery scheme evinces what can happen, she said, in worlds predicated on anonymity, where passion and prestige can fluidly override doubt or even common sense – “the less one is entitled to tell all, the more vulnerable it is to abuses.”Driven to Abstraction is not “getting at one final truth that wraps up neatly, but a way of telling how this evolved, how something like this could happen,” she said. “It’s not just about art – it’s about telling tall tales, and why it works.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/782d51693093d32bf47942d7b4cfea6b84c478fc/890_1000_3967_2380/master/3967.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=27918a18870930a7a153f341fc017ed2","title":"covid 19 turns tide on indias ganesh festival traditions","story":"Thousands of ritual statues are dunked into the sea off Mumbai each year – but coronavirus and pollution concerns are forcing change by Gautam Doshi in MumbaiIn the quiet housing estate of Angrewadi in the heart of Girgaon in south Mumbai, people are celebrating the 100th consecutive year of the Ganesh Chaturthi, the Hindu festival of the elephant-headed god of new beginnings. Statues of Lord Ganesh are brought into homes and put on display for offerings and prayers.On the 11th and final day of the festival, the ritual of Ganesh Visarjan takes place – falling this year on 1 September. The statues, normally made of soluble plaster of paris, are traditionally carried in a public procession with music and chanting, and are then immersed in either a river or the sea. Here, they slowly dissolve in a ceremony that dramatises the Hindu view of the ephemeral nature of life – but also causes widespread pollution.In Mumbai alone, around 150,000 statues are immersed each year.Angrewadiresidents normally head to  Girgaon Chowpatty beach, just over a mile away. Most statues from south Mumbai are submerged in these waters, including one particularly revered idol, Lalbaugcha Raja, which stands over six metres tall.But not this year.In Mumbai – one of the Indian cities most affected by coronavirus – devotees are not heading for the beach this year. Instead, Mumbai’s ngoverning body, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC), has installed more than 200 artificial ponds across the city so that the tradition may be upheld while preventing large crowds gathering. Environmentalists hope these ponds, which will reduce pollution, will become a permanent fixture “We will be immersing our eco-friendly idol in a small aluminium tub this year,” says DV Kulkarni, head of Angrewadi’s event-organising committee.Devotees will not be allowed to go near the new ponds, but will instead hand over their statues to workers who will immerse them as the owners watch from a distance.The BMC – which has limited the size of the religious statues to a maximum of 1.2 metres this year – has also arranged for pick-up trucks to collect statues from people who do not want to leave their homes. Those who still want to use the sea will need to seek approval online and book a time slot. The same regulations will apply to some of the new ponds. Traditionally, most statues are dropped into the Arabian Sea, leaking chemicals into the marine ecosystem along Mumbai’s coast. Varying in size, from just a few centimetres to up to 20 metres, most of the idols are made of non-biodegradable plaster, which can take years to dissolve.Paints and materials containing lead, mercury, chromium and other harmful substances are used to colour and decorate the statues, and thousands of garlands of plastic flowers are thrown into the sea with them. Indranil Sengupta and Rabia Tewari launched the Mahim Beach Clean Up campaign in Mumbai in 2017. They say the ritual causes great marine damage.After last year’s festival, says Tewari, the impact on marine life was immediate. “The tide was low, and several idols were still on the beach . We could also see plenty of dead fish around. We were so disappointed to see it.“The seepage of harmful substances is also biomagnified in marine life, which indirectly harms humans too,” says Debi Goenka, executive trustee of Conservation Action Trust in Mumbai.The rise in use of eco-friendly idols, made from clay, is starting to have a positive impact on water pollution. According to reports by the Maharashtra Pollution Control Board, the water quality indexat Girgaon Chowpatty beach has improved from 49.77 (out of a maximum of 100) in September 2016, to 64.19 in September 2019. September is the month when the festival ends and when pollution peaks. But the improvement has come at a cost to local businesses.Using clay to make the statues is much more time-consuming and expensive, taking up to six days to complete, whereas a plaster idol, made in a cast, takes less than a day to produce.The festival is extremely popular in Mumbai and throughout the state of Maharashtra.“Apart from immersing our idol, we mainly go to the beach to just soak in the electric atmosphere of the processions, crowds, and the views of other majestic idols. It’s a wonderful feeling and is one of our main festivals,” says Kulkarni.“People have been very receptive and welcoming of the idea of artificial ponds since last year, as there is a lot of awareness of the real damage to the sea after Visarjan,” says Kiran Dighavkar, assistant commissioner of Dadar-Mahim area in Mumbai.“Last year, we collected and recycled around 9,000 idols made of plaster of paris, where they were put in cement silos. But there are still religious concerns with this, and we have to work to find out a sustainable solution. Our main aim this year is to avoid large gatherings. Going forward, we are moving towards utilising environment-friendly solutions such as artificial ponds.”The processions, celebrations, and rituals may resume post-Covid-19, but both authorities and citizens are edging slowly towards lessening the impact on fragile marine ecosystems in the Mumbai area."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/df3e3d17e286a94c3881dfa5a0910dd214c43939/0_0_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=d443c5b5b023235d38f5438b535688a1","title":"i left my baby to cry at night for a week is it my fault shes an anxious child","story":"You judge yourself harshly, says Annalisa Barbieri. Make peace with the past and be a more confident motherI am the mother of a four-year-old (due to go to school next month) and a 20-month-old, both girls. I am quite anxious and highly strung. I have always set very high standards for myself and had a need for control.When my first child was born, the first 12 weeks were tough and we became very sleep-deprived. I read all the books and tried everything I could think of to help her sleep. I didn’t want to leave her to cry, but eventually, at seven months, I didn’t feel I could take it any longer. I had started taking antidepressants because I felt low and more anxious than ever. I joined a support group for sleep training and, for about a week, I left her room at bedtime and returned only at 11pm and 3am to feed her. She cried for hours at a time. And I left her.After a week I realised it wasn’t going to work. I have never left her to cry since. I practise “gentle parenting” now, respond to her needs fully and give her lots of love, reassurance and attention. However, she is quite a serious and anxious child who takes a long time to settle into a new environment or routine. I can’t shake off the feeling that I did that to her by leaving her to cry in the night as a baby.Is there a chance I’ve done this to her through my actions? Or, with my history, was it inevitable that her personality and temperament would be this way, regardless? How can I build her up and make her feel secure?Your older daughter is nearly four and, from your longer letter, it is obvious that you are thoughtful and caring – and that includes stopping something you didn’t think was right after only a week. Yet you are determined to judge yourself on that one week. What about your younger child? How is she? You didn’t mention anything else about her – is that because there is nothing to berate yourself for there?Dr Jan McGregor Hepburn, a psychoanalytic psychotherapist (bpc.org.uk), and I both wondered about your own childhood and where this super-critical voice originates. She said: “You sound very sensitive, and so does your daughter, but the other side of being sensitive is anxiety. You sound less sensitive to your own needs and I wondered why.”When we become parents, anything unresolved from our own childhoods can come back. I wish more parenting books mentioned this. Parenting is dual aspect: it’s about your child, but also the child you once were and all of those experiences. Did something happen to you, aged four, just before starting school, that has made you write now? Becoming an effective, kind parent is often about working out what is our anxiety and what is our children’s.Becoming a mother for the first time, especially when you are a “control freak”, is hard. You have put things in place to give a semblance of control and then along comes this baby with primal needs, added to which are feeding problems, sleep deprivation and depression. You got through it – isn’t that something to praise yourself for? You are chastising yourself for not being kinder to your daughter – for that one week – when you can’t be kind to yourself now. Children learn from thhe way we treat them, but also the way we treat ourselves. As I’ve said before, guilt is the enemy of confident parenting. Somehow you need to make peace with your past (even one session with a good therapist could be really beneficial) and move on to enjoy what is happening now.“If you’re always feeling guilty,” McGregor Hepburn said, “it can make your child more anxious.” I would add that a parent who feels guilty can make the child feel as if they are at fault, because they may misinterpret your unease as something they have done wrong.“You seem to be punishing yourself for something you now regret, but is not decisive in your child’s life,” McGregor Hepburn said. “It’s the totality of the experience children get that really matters. Everyone does things they later regret. You only have to be good enough as a parent for the child to grow up OK.”You have done so much right with your daughter, and as your younger one grows, you will see that children from the same parents can be vastly different. By being a more confident mother – which means forgiving yourself – you will make her more confident. Carry on responding to her emotional needs. We all become more secure by knowing our needs are met, that we are listened to and accepted for who we are. Who does that for you? • Send your problem to annalisa.barbieri@mac.

With areas of the UK still in lockdown and the threat of spikes in the virus remaining very real, there will be many parliamentarians and parliamentary staff with good reason for being unable to be in Westminster in person.”Some MPs are warning that they have underlying health conditions while others are in areas where local restrictions are tighter and do not want to risk travelling across the country.Andrew Gwynne, the Labour MP for Denton and Reddish in Greater Manchester, has documented his struggles with “long Covid” – the long-term effects of the coronavirus suffered by some of those who contract it.He said: “Clearly the government would like MPs to go back to sitting in parliament permanently, but that just isn’t going to be possible for a small number of people. Either for public health reasons, because they’re coming from parts of the country that are facing local lockdowns, and what you don’t want to do is inadvertently become a super-spreader and give it to other MPs who then go back to their own constituencies that are relatively Covid-free and start polluting their own areas. But also, there are people like myself who are still struggling with the long-term impacts of coronavirus.“On a good day I would probably be able to cope OK, but I can’t plan which is going to be my good day and which is going to be my bad day. And my constituents should not be disenfranchised.”The SNP’s spokesman on the Cabinet Office, Tommy Sheppard, said: “The return of parliament is a significant test for the UK government, as we are still in the middle of a global health pandemic and know that social distancing is impossible in parts of Westminster.”He called for the hybrid arrangements to be extended to the end of the year. “In accordance with the guidance for those who live in Scotland, where working from home is possible, SNP members and our staff are encouraged to do so,” he said.During the early stages of the lockdown an electronic voting system was introduced in parliament, but Rees-Mogg later replaced that with voting in person, which caused long, distanced queues to snake through the Palace of Westminster in what sceptical MPs nicknamed the “Rees-Mogg conga”.MPs with health concerns can request a proxy vote, which is exercised on their behalf by party whips. Gwynne said the electronic voting system was preferable. “It’s not for me not to trust the whips, but I would far sooner cast the vote myself and be fully accountable to the electorate than trust my whip to do the job for me,” he said.The hybrid system will expire at the end of Wednesday’s parliamentary sitting unless the government tables a motion to extend it. A spokesperson said: “In July we extended arrangements to allow for remote participation in scrutiny proceedings until 2 September. The position will be assessed when the House of Commons returns from the summer recess.”The shadow disabilities minister, Vicky Foxcroft, who has rheumatoid arthritis and was advised to shield earlier in the outbreak, said: “If you look at the government’s own comms on this stuff, it says if you were shielding, work from home if possible your employer should support you to do this. So they’re saying one thing to everybody else and then saying something else in parliament.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ef9dfd37bb89648deab07e9d0fea953cacea0b77/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=42cc6c540aa2d28533be5599cb7fc812","title":"taught me value slowing down solace of allotments","story":"UK allotment holders took comfort from their plots in the worst days of the pandemic.

The Canadian club are expected to be readmitted to Super League in 2021 after withdrawing from the competition this year due to “overwhelming financial challenges”.“We’re working closely with Super League on it,” he said. “There’s interest in taking the club on and I think they have proved themselves to a degree.

What they’ve had to deal with would be overwhelming for any club.”Rimmer also confirmed that discussions are continuing about Super League hosting a full round of fixtures on 30 September with crowds in attendance.

I’ve been surprised how little of that we had in the Tests given how it really is second nature after a while. It looks like Pakistan self-reported before the ball was cleaned by the umpires. It’s Amir again, who is tough to get away when banging it into the pitch after ripping his fingers down the seam but Malan is savvy enough to get bat on a pull shot for two after getting into an awkward position. Can Banton get one away before the power play ends? He does, a four through midwicket. It wasn’t away from the catcher on the circle and came off the bottom of the bat, but a boundary is a boundary. I heard the song played after the boundary, John, but I can’t account for it. I’ve been busy with my Landfill Indie playlist after the Vice piece yesterday. I feel so very lucky that my 20s married up with this era. 5th over: England 25-1 (Banton 11, Malan 12) Shaheen follows Imad, changing to the Statham End. And there’s England’s second boundary, pulled away by Malan off his tummy, into the gap behing square. Neatly struck. But just two singles from the four remaining opportunities, making six from it. One over left with the field up.John Starbuck is upset about my discussion of the Welsh connection with bat v ball earlier on. Sorry, John. He’s also angry at TMS for playing the ground noise between overs. “And if we’ve got to hear it, your music appreciation thoughts.” It’s been white noise to me but I’ll pay attention over the next couple of overs and assess. 4th over: England 19-1 (Banton 10, Malan 7) Shaheen wants to go again but he’s sent away: it’s Mohammad Amir’s turn. Banton takes a couple of balls to find the gap, getting one down the ground, Malan then turning a further two to midwicket. The only further single he gets isn’t without risk, a clip landing about five metres away from the man at deep backward square. This is Pakistan’s power play so far.3rd over: England 15-1 (Banton 9, Malan 4) Imad to Malan, can anybody hear Bread of Heaven playing in the background? Or is that just me? The No3 takes one then Banton, who miscues his sweep, a top edges clearing short-fine leg - it runs away for three. Malan again, who reverse sweeps a careful single - can you imagine writing that 20 years ago? Banton adds another down the ground before Malan finishes with a tuck out to the sweeper at deep midwicket. Good running, they take two. 2nd over: England 7-1 (Banton 5, Malan 0) Shaheen Shah Afridi, be still my beating heart. I was there at his T20 International debut in Harare two years ago and asked him about how he felt about the whole experience. He replied, earnestly, that he had a dream that he would dismiss Finch and Maxwell to start off. Of course, he did. What a gem. Starting here today, he beats Banton outside the off-stump, squaring him up just a tad. Lovely. As is the bouncer, the opener out of the way. He gives him something to tuck away later in the over on the pads and the opener clips it away with ease given the man at fine leg is inside the circle. Dropped catch to finish! A slip is in for just that but Iftikhar has put it down. An easy chance, too.1st over: England 3-1 (Banton 1, Malan 0) Malan has one delivery to deal with from the Welsh-born tweaker (that’ll be the only time I mention it, promise) and pushes to the man on the cover circle. A wonderful start for Pakistan. How about that! Bairstow used his feet to open up the offside but ended up chipping a low catch back to the left-arm spinner, who made no mistake. The players are on the field. Imad Wasim to Tom Banton. PLAY! Oh yeah, I forgot to talk about Haider Ali’s omission. That’s a shame. The 19-year-old has a strike-rate of 148 in just 15 T20s. I’m sure we’ll see him during the series. Eoin Morgan wants to play both of the next T20 World Cups. That was a good interview with Nick Knight. He’s certainly not ruling himself out from making the next ODI World Cup in three years from now, either. As he said in the chat, his statistical output in T20 cricket has never been better, so why would he be looking to give it away? Fair point. And despite being around forever, he’s only 33, after all.Other important cricket this weekend. Read Raf Nicholson’s preview of the Rachael Heyhoe Flint Trophy. A brand new competition with brand new teams. A big step forward in terms of the competition and the remuneration for domestic players.And Rizwan also gets the nod ahead of Sarfraz behind the stumps. I like that a lot. And for Pakistan, they have named Haris Raul in their team - the young PSL and BBL firebrand - instead of Wahab Riaz. That’s a big call. Full XI shortly. Eoin Morgan says they would have bowled too. He notes that this series is about development as much as winning with their Test players unavailable. David Willey and Joe Denly are the players who have missed out on the XI for the hosts. Pakistan are bowling, citing the conditions. Teams shortly. Gloomy but dry. That’s good news. Here comes the toss. Ollie Pope is out for four months. This is the big non-game related news coming out of the England camp this afternoon. His left shoulder (yes, the one that he had the operation on last summer) was dislocated again when fielding on Monday. Urgh!Welcome back to the strangest international summer, Manchester again the venue for the first of three T20s between England Pakistan. Now, remember, when these matches were fixtured, they were set to be just before October’s World Cup in the shortest form of the game. Of course, that’s no longer. However, there’s no doubting how much this means to players who have had so little to do in 2020. Especially the Pakistan white-ball specialists. While their colleagues in the Test arena have been slugging it out over the last month, they have been stuck in the nets waiting for their opportunity to make this trip worthwhile. It isn’t quite the same for England, but this is the second time they have been locked away for a series this summer and it starts to take a toll after a while. Still, they’re here now.For the hosts, the big news is that they will be without Jason Roy, who injured his side when batting during the week. This has led to him also ruling himself out of the Indian Premier League. The expectation is that the opener will be back for the Australian series beginning this time next week, but there’s nothing certain. It’s likely that this will open the door to a BantonBairstow opening combination. It is safe to assume that at least four and up to six of the Pakistan tourists will be making the jump from red to white ball in the space of four days, including skipper Babar Azam who is the top ranked T20 batsman in the world. It’ll also be interesting to see Sarfraz Ahmed back in operation, returning to his position behind the stumps after being dropped from the Test captaincy last year. Or maybe they’ll stick with Rizwan in that job and the veteran will miss out? We’ll know in 15 minutes. What seems certain is that we will see both Mohammad Amir and Wahab Riaz with the new ball in their hands when the time comes. In the case of the former, he is no longer available for Test selection so this becomes his main, and only, stage. Shaheen Afridi will also be there, so that makes three southpaw quicks. Fun! Drop me a line at any stage, of course, I’m here all night. Back with the toss shortly.

His neighbors on the eighth floor felt the roof go at about the same time. Soon, his room was full of water from the rain running through the building.Shalonda Brouchet, who also lives in the building, didn’t trust her car to make it to Houston, so she spent the night as well. Windows began to blow out, and a set of dumpsters began to crash around in the parking lot. “The wind, it just kept coming.”In the morning, Ballou and Brouchet walked the streets of downtown to assess the damage, and then gathered in a covered area under the building with neighbors.“There’s devastation everywhere,” said Ballou, pointing towards the collapsed roof of a home-goods store across the street. “This is the worst I’ve ever seen, and I came up remembering Audrey,” a storm that killed 416 people in the same part of Louisiana in 1957.Matthew Dubone, another resident, said they didn’t expect to hear from their property manager about the habitability of their apartments till Monday. “This building is out of commission,” said Brouchet. There is no electricity and no water, although the rooms are soaked.Now, Dubone said, they survey the wreckage that was Lake Charles and wait for help to come.The cars in the parking lot of their building are mostly ruined, smashed by pieces of the falling roof, and the Texas-bound interstate – where most residents say they would go - is blocked. They have piled frozen chicken thighs and pork chops on a picnic table, along with a bottle of lighter fluid and bag of charcoal briquettes, and are getting ready to cook the meat before it rots.By Friday morning, the storm had moved on, unleashing heavy rain hundreds of miles inland from where the hurricane made landfall, and prompting tornado warnings from Alabama to Tennessee and heavy weather forecasts all the way up the eastern seaboard into Connecticut.But as of early afternoon on Thursday, nobody had told them when or where aid workers might distribute food in the days ahead. On the street outside, a steady stream of trucks rolled by, which they said were focused on clearing downed trees.“Everyone who lives here is disabled. A lot of them left or were evacuated and we was the ones who couldn’t make it,” said another resident, Kelvin Lamplin.Louisiana is still under restrictions designed to cope with the coronavirus pandemic – such as a mask mandate – but in Lake Charles masks were nowhere to be seen on residents, rescue workers and even the soldiers on the crowded national guard convoys rolling through town. Near the town a chlorine plant erupted with thick, billowing smoke after being damaged by the storm. Authorities ordered people around the plant to stay in their homes with windows and doors shut.Laura has headed north of the state as a tropical storm after hitting the Louisiana coast with blasts of wind up to 150mph strong. Officials warned of “catastrophic conditions” and more than 600,000 people fled its path.But not Chrystal and Ben Johnson. They rode out the storm with their family in the historic office building they own downtown. They live 30 miles north of Lake Charles in Ragley, Louisiana, but thought that the building was safer. “This place has 2ft-thick walls, and a pump in the basement,” said Ben. “Houses roar,” said Chrystal, but this building, which was once a post office and court, stayed quiet.Now, anticipating weeks without power, they are planning to drive back north and gather their belongings, and then leave the state. The family is receiving a steady stream of updates about relief efforts nearby. Another family member, chiming in from behind them, said the national guard had begun guarding the local CVS store, and had heard that the Cajun Navy, famous for its civilian rescue effort during Katrina, was still looking for somewhere to set up a base.In front of one of Lake Charles’ few high-rise buildings downtown, a volunteer rescue worker who identified himself only as James described spending the night inside a jammed elevator. He said that he had been in at least 20 storms, and came to Lake Charles on Wednesday to prepare for the aftermath. A friend let him stay inside the tower, home to a Capitol One office, but in the middle of the night, he got antsy about the storm surge, and decided to take a service elevator to the 16th floor.Halfway up, he heard a voice through the speaker that said “Elevator out of service”, and then he was stuck. He had brought meteorological equipment, and watched the pressure drop as the eye of the hurricane passed over. “The barometer dropped an inch. I’ve been in a lot of storms, and I’ve never seen that before.”As the eyewall whipped the city, “something gave, and the whole building shredded”.James was sure that the others who had taken cover inside the tower were gone. But in the morning, he pried open the door and then used a piece of metal to scratch his way through the sheetrock elevator shaft. From there, he had enough service to call for help, and rescue workers smashed the rest of the way through.A few blocks from downtown, 18-year-olds Draven Smith and Aidan Abshire wound through debris-covered streets in a rattling pickup, gathering fallen traffic signs.The pair had waited out the storm in their house just outside Lake Charles after realizing that all the gas stations were closed, and they didn’t have enough gas to evacuate. Like others, the wind, and the shaking, roaring, is what stuck with them. “Surprisingly,” said Abshire, “ours is the only house that’s OK. Roofs are ripped off, fences are all down, windows broken.”As an army corps truck rolled by, they changed the conversation to the rumors of looting they had heard, although they hadn’t seen any themselves.“A hurricane, when it comes through, feels like a big warning, from God,” says Abshire, “A big push that things should change. The looting, the riots. The way people are treating our Earth.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ecb9b08ab239b85b222fc4efa8acce4848dd255b/0_24_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=7bac2a5e79f208dacbcb643cd85601f6","title":"march washington dc racism get your knee off our necks","story":"Tens of thousands of people gathered in Washington DC on Friday, demanding criminal justice reform following a summer of protests against systemic racism and against police treatment of Black people.The Get Your Knee Off Our Necks march, announced in early June following the killing of George Floyd by police in Minneapolis, Minnesota, also marks the 57th anniversary of the March on Washington, where Martin Luther King Jr gave his “I have a dream” speech in 1963 urging racial equality.Organized by the civil rights campaigner Al Sharpton’s National Action Network and groups including the NAACP and the National Urban League, Friday’s rally will highlight police brutality and the need for reform, and demand voting rights protections ahead of the November elections.“We are tired of the mistreatment and the violence that we, as Black Americans, have been subjected to for hundreds of years,” Sharpton said in a statement.“Like those who marched before us, we are standing up and telling the police, telling lawmakers, telling the people and systems that have kept us down for years, ‘Get your knee off our necks.’”The Washington march comes days after Jacob Blake became the latest in a series of black people to suffer brutal treatment at the hands of police.Blake was shot in the back by police in Kenosha, Wisconsin, on Sunday, and remains in hospital. His father said on Tuesday that Blake had been paralyzed from the waist down.Members of his family will talk at the rally on Friday – as will the families of George Floyd, Trayvon Martin, Eric Garner, Ahmaud Arbery, and Breonna Taylor, all black people killed by police or by iniduals on the extremist fringes who regarded themselves as vigilantes.Martin Luther King III, a son of the late civil rights icon, and the civil rights attorney Benjamin Crump, who is representing several families of recent victims of violence or police actions, are also scheduled to speak.The march was organized amid protests over the killing of Floyd.The 46-year-old died after a police officer knelt on Floyd’s neck for eight minutes and 46 seconds, including the final two minutes when Floyd was unconscious.“The reason why George Floyd laying there with that knee on his neck resonated with so many African-Americans is because we have all had a knee on our neck,” Sharpton told USA Today.The march will be matched by demonstrations in states which have a high Covid risk, NAN said, including in Montgomery, Alabama and Las Vegas, Nevada.The NAACP will also host a “virtual march”, the organization said.Speakers will include the New Jersey senator Cory Booker, congresswoman Brenda Lawrence, from Michigan, and Stacey Abrams.A group of protesters are due at the march who have walked all the way from Milwaukee to the nation’s capital for the event."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/31698b2b5e1e7578eb705a476acaae9a25b02549/0_119_4997_2997/master/4997.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=570f2e24a5649ffb65411202b81524df","title":"texas coronavirus covid tests contact tracers","story":"Discrepancies abound in state and county data as local contact tracers are dealing with more confirmed cases than they are equipped to handleOn the day in April that he announced his state would emerge from lockdown the Texas governor, Greg Abbott, said: “A core part of opening up safely is having an effective testing and tracing process – a process that can quickly identify any flare-ups in Covid-19.”As Texas flung open its doors before much of the country, it needed to lean on “doctors and data to provide the safest strategies”, Abbott went on.That has not worked out. Only four months later, Texas is nearing the grim milestone of 12,000 deaths from Covid-19, after being walloped by the virus for much of the summer.“It was never a situation we were gonna contact trace our way out of,” said Chris Van Deusen, director of media relations at the Texas department of state healthservices (DSHS). “We were seeing so many cases throughout July that doing that alone wasn’t going to stop the outbreak from spreading.”Now, discrepancies between state and county data abound in Texas. Local contact tracers are bombarded by exponentially more confirmed cases than they are equipped to handle, and Texans are still struggling with the deceptively simple distinction of which test actually confirms whether they’re infectious. Some students are already heading back to campus, including the state’s gargantuan public universities, despite pushback from co-eds and employees.Testing has dropped off in recent weeks, possibly because people are letting their guard down. And, despite mitigation efforts, a continual, alarmingly high rate of positive test results indicates that Texas won’t be able to control the virus as successfully as in other places, warned Ashish K Jha, a professor of global health at the Harvard TH Chan School of Public Health.“What we’re gonna see is schools have large outbreaks, and probably have to shut down. And that’s likely what is coming in many, many schools across Texas,” Jha said.State officials logged more than 5,300 new Covid-19 cases on Wednesday, a significant dip from over 10,000 a day in mid-July, but still far more than were ever documented daily before late June.Meanwhile, quantitative measures used to understand the virus’s impact continually reveal dramatic inconsistencies on the state and county level, painting an even more nebulous portrait of the coronavirus pandemic in Texas.By Wednesday evening, Hidalgo county, a hard-hit border community, had suffered 1,130 Covid-19 deaths, according to its local dashboard. But only 1,027 fatalities appeared on the state’s county-by-county list.“Our numbers are usually higher than the state’s, and they’re more accurate,” said Ivan Melendez, Hidalgo county’s health authority.Harris county and Houston, on the other hand, reported losing 1,252 residents – 854 fewer than were included in the state’s official tally for the county.The contradicting statistics also lend themselves to credibility issues and skepticism among Texans, some of whom have already fallen prey to a widespread misconception that the coronavirus is a hoax or overblown.“I do believe that data has both been our friend and our enemy,” said Nueces county judge Barbara Canales, who presides over the tourist beach town of Corpus Christi. “Until you are personally affected, sometimes the data’s all you’ve got, and so if the data looks inaccurate or not current, it causes a lack of integrity.”As Canales grapples with a devastating local death toll and the loss of dozens of people she personally knew she’s simultaneously fielding conspiracy theories about why those counts are so high.“I had one woman ask me if we make more money if, you know, we basically logged in more deaths,” Canales said. “I almost just fell over, and just lost it.”Beyond numerical variations, DSHS has been releasing massive data dumps from a backlog of tests, distorting Texas’s positivity rate. Counties have been receiving positive results from weeks if not months ago, even though those results are rendered “essentially useless” if they’re delayed beyond 72 hours, Jha said.The backlog didn’t keep patients from learning if their tests came back positive, but “it did prevent those from getting into the public health system”, Van Deusen said.“You can’t do contact tracing on ’em. It’s too late,” said Philip Huang, the health and human services director in Dallas county. The government there reported more than 5,000 new cases from the state’s backlog earlier this month, including some dating as far back as March.Generally, testing has declined in recent weeks, potentially because Abbott’s policies such as a mask mandate and bar closures are working, Huang suggested. But Melendez offered another hypothesis: “I think people are getting a false sense of security,” he said.Across Texas, just under 4,000 contact tracers are currently employed, about half of them by local health departments, Van Deusen said. The statewide effort makes contact with most new cases within a day of getting their information, he said, and it’s been able to pick up some of the slack from counties.In Nueces county, the phones aren’t ringing off the hook any more, and contact tracing is up and running again with help from the state, Canales said. She still isn’t getting too comfortable.“It is a lull, and only time will tell if the storm will hit us, or will it skirt on by?” she said. “But we don’t take chances around here. We put our hurricane shutters down.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/31ac154badc01c2d1387996b51b02fe02fb9165d/0_47_3600_2160/master/3600.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=3b3a27e5e438b32e02b911da2dcd876e","title":"europe holiday resorts foreign tourists magaluf staycationers","story":"Typical holiday destinations across Europe are seeing an influx of a new type of visitor: local staycationersIt is usually the domain of hangover-nursing sunbathers and rowdy tourists getting an early start on beach parties. But this year – as quarantines, restrictions and advisories take a toll on travel – the white sandy beaches and crystal-clear waters of Magaluf on the Spanish holiday island of Mallorca have some new visitors: Mallorcans.“This is the first time we’ve ever come – Mallorcans do not come to Magaluf,” laughed Laura, 31, as she settled in for a day on the beach with her friends. “We came this year only because we knew there were no tourists.”It’s a scene playing out across Europe as locals reclaim sites ceded long ago to throngs of tourists. Plazas once filled with the sounds of suitcases rattling over cobblestones now ring with children’s voices, while near-vacant landmarks offer locals an intimate experience of the top sights in their backyards.Earlier this year Mallorcans began quietly spreading word of a nearly deserted, picture-perfect beach, resulting in a stream of locals traipsing out to Magaluf.“I would have never brought my daughter here before,” Consuelo Merchante told the news website Ultima Hora. It was her first time visiting Magaluf’s beach in four decades. “We stayed away because of the British tourists,” she said.The novelty of being a hometown tourist, however, comes at a steep cost. In Magaluf and across tourist sites in Europe, the backdrop is one of shuttered shops and hotels, hinting at the devastating economic impact of the plunge in tourists.“It’s bittersweet,” said Vesna Celebic, a tour guide in the Croatian city of Dubrovnik. In recent years locals had resigned themselves to sharing the walled old town with millions of visitors, enduring the relentless arrivals of mammoth cruise ships and the clatter of helicopter tours overhead.Then the pandemic brought these drawbacks into sharp relief. “At the moment it’s wonderful,” she said. “The old town is definitely the place that the locals reclaimed. Now you see a lot of kids riding bikes and playing soccer in some of the public squares, you hear the locals again. You hear the local language.”Still, the dire reality facing the tourism-dependent city was unescapable. Celebic had just wrapped up her fifth tour of the season, when normally she would have racked up 100 or so at this point. “The things is, there is this economic disaster looming upon us,” she said.In Italy, cities and beaches usually thronged with foreign tourists have become a draw for Italians. Locals have flocked to the Riviera Romagnola, a stretch of golden beaches overlooking the Adriatic sea.“With the advent of low-cost flights to foreign destinations, young Italians had preferred to spend their holidays in Spain or Greece,” the deputy mayor of Rimini, Gloria Lisi, told the .But the pandemic appears to have reversed this flow, with the riviera now playing host to a crop of first-time visitors. “This summer, Rimini is crowded with people in their 20s who come from neighbouring regions. This hasn’t happened for decades.”The chance to take in some of the world’s best art without elbowing through crowds has been a draw for some. “Morning at the Louvre to take advantage of the lack of tourists,” author Mira Kamdar wrote on Twitter last week. “Paris as we Parisians rarely get to experience it.”In Barcelona, which before the pandemic was receiving an average of 155,000 visitors a day, arrivals have slowed to a trickle. “Tourism had been pushing out residents, in some ways,” said Arlene Bayliss, a marketing professional based in the city. “Now it’s the reverse: it’s tourists that get lost among the locals.”She is now seeing the city in a new light, marvelling at the ability to snap photos alone on the steps of the city’s cathedral, or use the time she had once spent navigating a sea of tourists to focus on the city’s stunning architecture.The lack of visitors, coupled with the departure of city residents on August vacations, has emptied the usual tourist haunts such as the Gothic quarter. “You can wander through and there’s not a soul,” she said. “Then you come across a plaza filled with locals and kids playing. It’s very different.”The situation has demonstrated what is at stake for cities and other hotspots in striking a balance between attracting tourists and catering for local residents."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5cc0858423c884ca564a624b05aa079d4daab6d4/234_68_1686_1012/master/1686.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bafd424f2e4267b8089167b97c0c2425","title":"far right activists filmed hassling asylum seekers in hotels","story":"One video shows members of Britain First entering hotel and banging on bedroom doorsAnger is mounting over a series of videos posted by far-right organisations in which activists enter hotels where asylum seekers are being held, knock on their doors to interrogate them and accuse them of wasting taxpayers’ money.A video by Britain First, circulated widely on social media, shows a group of far-right activists entering a hotel in Bromsgrove, near Birmingham, and banging on bedroom doors, demanding to know what country the asylum seekers are from.The Britain First members say in the video they have entered legally and that the hotel is housing illegal immigrants.The asylum seekers appear not to understand who the far-right activists are. Most who are interrogated answer, perhaps believing the Britain First activists to be officials. Many of the asylum seekers could be at risk if their faces are shown on camera.Campaigners from the group Status Now have raised concerns about the video and have complained to the Home Office and the accommodation provider Serco about the incident.  has contacted Serco for comment.Claudia Webbe, the MP for Leicester East, condemned the incident. “The attacks on asylum seekers at this hotel are disgraceful and I stand in full solidarity with all those who are exercising their legal right to claim asylum,” she said. “Britain First and other hate groups represent the very worst of our country. They must not be given any platform to legitimise their vile anti-migrant discourse.”Other similar videos are circulating on YouTube from far-right organisations, including one that shows asylum seekers being harassed outside their hotel in Newcastle.Far-right organisations are also circulating on social media lists of hotels where asylum seekers are being accommodated.One hotel on the list is Home Office accommodation in Wakefield where living conditions have been heavily criticised. The far-right list wrongly refers to it as an “Urban House Detection Centre”.A spokesperson for West Mercia police said of the Bromsgrove incident: “Officers were called to a report of a group of people who had gained access to the Bromsgrove Hotel at just after 7.30pm on Thursday 20 August. The iniduals had left the premises prior to police arrival and no criminal offences have been reported.”A Home Office spokesperson said: “We take the wellbeing of asylum seekers extremely seriously.

Pubs that serve food reopened in late June.Ronan Glynn, Ireland’s acting chief medical officer, said on Thursday that wet pubs – about half of Ireland’s 7,000 pubs – should stay shut amid a rising weekly infection rate of 33 per 100,000 people. “In the context of schools opening and the number of cases in hospital beginning to rise, it’s not the time to open pubs,” Glynn told a media briefing.The government is expected to endorse the recommendation on Friday and to approve a crackdown on pubs that are open and violating restrictions. Police are to gain powers to shut a pub immediately if they believe there are breaches of public health guidelines.Asked about Ireland having the EU’s longest pub lockdown, Glynn said authorities were aware of the impact on small family businesses and the social life of communities. “We want pubs to reopen, let’s be clear about that. We want pubs to reopen in a safe way. But since the end of June, we have seen a slow and steady deterioration of the profile of this disease in this country.”Authorities in Northern Ireland announced on Wednesday that wet pubs would not open next week, as previously planned, because of an increase in coronavirus cases.Other EU countries let bars and pubs resume trading several months ago with social distancing restrictions.Italy and Germany did so in May. followed by France, Spain and the Netherlands in June. Pubs in England reopened on 4 July, followed by Wales (initially outdoors only) on 13 July and Scotland on 15 July.Sweden and Latvia have kept pubs open throughout the pandemic. In Romania, pubs and bars can operate only if they have open-air terraces.The Drinks Industry Group of Ireland, an advocacy group, called for urgent state help. “The drinks and hospitality industry needs support now, otherwise we risk permanently losing hundreds of businesses and thousands of jobs, just as we did in the 2008 recession,” it said.A formerly wet pub in County Mayo in the west of Ireland reopened this week as a cafe, turning bar staff into baristas.

Dozens of travellers have contacted the  to raise concerns over a lack of checks.Arrivals in the UK from abroad must submit a passenger locator form online beforehand, to be shown at the border either in printed form or on a mobile device. Failure to provide details risks a fine of up to £100.Border Force officers “will use the QR code at the top of the document to check you have completed the form successfully”, the government says. Information including the passenger’s UK address and travel details is used to check that iniduals are self-isolating if necessary or to warn them if they have come into contact with travellers with Covid-19.Home Office figures published this week show 1.3 million passengers arrived in the UK by air in July.It is understood that the checks need to be made manually by Border Force officials, with no automated system of logging passenger locator form details when passports are scanned. The shadow home secretary, Nick Thomas-Symonds, said: “Passenger locator forms are a crucial part of a functioning test, track and isolate system. These are deeply worrying findings, amounting to yet another example of failing to implement effective protective measures at UK borders. This issue needs to be addressed urgently for the sake of public health and to reassure travellers.”More than half of the 136 people who responded to a  callout about arrivals to the UK said their passenger locator forms had not been checked. Peter de Groot, 72,, who flew into London’s Heathrow airport from Kenya this month, described the monitoring in the airport as “a scandal”.“When I got there they seemed really disinterested. There was far more security getting into a Kenyan supermarket,” he said. “Nobody checked I filled in the form I felt it was quite disgraceful. There was a digital thermometer sat on a desk, but no one there to man it. It seemed like the government were expecting the airlines to do their work for them. It’s pathetic.”Colin Beesely, a secondary school assistant principal who lives in Stratford-upon-Avon, said he was shocked at the difference in measures when he arrived at Stansted from Spain in the first week of August.“When we arrived in Spain, our QR code was scanned by two police officers and we were led into a foyer where our temperature was taken. Only then were we permitted to leave the terminal,” Beesely, 60, said. “When we got to Stansted, there was nothing, we just walked out. We were really angry because you’re either doing this seriously or not. The absolute lack of people to check documentation upon our arrival speaks volumes.”Many reported failings onboard ferries and trains. A 45-year-old man from Essex said he had not been aware that he had to complete a form until he boarded his ferry home from a holiday in France, but he was not stopped or asked for further details.Only three fixed-penalty notices were handed out by police to people who failed to self-isolate after arriving in England and Wales between 15 June and 17 August, according to figures published by the National Police Chiefs’ Council on Thursday. A Home Office spokesperson said: “Passengers do not to need to hand a passenger locator form to a Border Force officer on arrival, the form is completed and submitted online.“Border Force continues to operate a spot-check regime so passengers may be asked to show proof they have completed the form to an officer. We are seeing a high level of compliance and we expect this to continue as everyone plays their part to help stop the spread of this disease.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4663a3b94f7e98243158e2d6188d549854680378/0_82_3673_2204/master/3673.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=52a1bff3953ead26c378feec42ff578c","title":"coronavirus live news tour de france in doubt who to review emergency alert rules","story":"Italy is considering dedicated planes and ships to evacuate tourists in Sardinia Spain’s daily count falls face masks mandatory in Paris India records over 77,000 new casesFour people at the Republican national convention in North Carolina this week tested positive, officials have said, even as Republicans played down the US health crisis in renominating Donald Trump.The party’s convention, which began with one day of events in Charlotte, North Carolina, despite the pandemic that has killed more than 180,000 Americans, ended on Thursday after four days of speeches lauding Trump.Throughout, Republicans largely abandoned talk of the crisis as if it had abated, instead reminding voters of the robust economy that existed beforehand.The official Twitter feed of Mecklenburg County, North Carolina, where Charlotte is located, said two convention attendees and two event support staff had tested positive and all were “immediately isolated”.The convention spokesman, Michael Ahrens, confirmed the four positive tests out of about 1,000 administered.The daily number of deaths in Turkey rose to 36 on Friday, its highest level since 17 May, while the number of daily new cases again rose above 1,500, according to health ministry data.This week the level of new daily cases has risen to levels last seen in mid-June, prompting the government to impose measures to combat the spread of the pandemic.The health ministry figures showed a total of 1,517 new cases on Friday, bringing the total number to 265,515. The daily death toll was the highest since 17 May, when it stood at 44. The total death toll in Turkey stands at 6,245.Responding to this week’s rise, the president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, announced that all state institutions may now implement “flexible working methods” and the interior ministry said it was banning certain events and celebrations.Greece is banning flights to and from Barcelona from Monday as health authorities extend most of the travel restrictions for foreign visitors by three weeks due to a surge in infections.The rise in cases in recent weeks has forced Greek authorities to gradually reimpose restrictions in the capital Athens and other areas, including popular islands at the peak of tourism season.Greece also requires visitors from a list of countries, including Belgium, Bulgaria, Romania, Malta, Sweden, Spain, Albania, North Macedonia and the United Arab Emirates to show a negative test to enter the country.The restrictions will be extended until 19 September, the deputy civil protection minister, Nikos Hardalias, told reporters, adding that the Netherlands would be dropped from the list. Flights to and from Barcelona and Spain’s Catalonia region will be banned, he said.Health authorities also said that restrictions, including a complete ban on festivities, a limit of nine people in all public and private gatherings and compulsory mask wearing in closed and open spaces, will be imposed on the islands of Zakynthos (also known as Zante) and Lesbos as of Saturday.On Friday, Greece reported 270 new cases. In total, the country has registered 9,800 Covid-19 infections and 259 deaths since its first case surfaced in February.Spain diagnosed 3,829 new cases in the past 24 hours, health ministry data shows. That is down from a revised count of more than 6,000 the previous day.A cumulative total of 439,286 infections have been detected since the onset of the pandemic. In the past seven days, 129 people have died from the virus, bringing the total to 29,011, the data showed.The latest statistics could be modified in future as Spain retroactively adjusts its official data.Italy’s Civil Protection is considering using dedicated planes and ships to evacuate dozens of tourists who are under quarantine from Sardinia to Italy’s mainland after the emergence of new clusters in the island’s nightclubs, the Italian newspaper La Repubblica has reported.More than 20 employees of the Phi Beach nightclub in Baja Sardinia, on the Costa Smeralda, have tested positive. An employee of another nightclub in San Teodoro who also tested positive was hospitalised in Sassari.Italian health authorities are also tracing visitors to the former Formula One team boss Flavio Briatore’s Sardinian nightclub after more than 60 confirmed cases were linked to the venue.On Friday, Italy recorded a new spike in cases as a further 1,411 people tested positive. Such numbers had not been seen since 2 May, when the country was still in lockdown.Authorities have also registered the highest number of tests since the beginning of the pandemic: 97,065. Nine more people have died with the virus in the last 24 hours and the Italian death toll stands at 35,472. The total number of cases is up to 265,409. On Friday, Hungary recorded 132 new infections, the highest daily number since the peak of the pandemic. The country has recorded a total of 5,511 cases and 614 deaths.“We would not like to reintroduce lockdown measures,” Gulyás, said.Budapest is due to host the match between Bayern Munich and Sevilla next month.Gulyás said Uefa was planning to grant access to the game for 3,000 fans of both Bayern and Sevilla. One possibility was that fans would have to produce two negative tests at the airport, would be transported directly to the stadium and back to the airport after the game.He said the government has not decided yet about the rules, and was also in talks with Uefa.Hungary will close its borders to foreigners from 1 September to curb a rise in infections and Hungarians returning from abroad will have to go into quarantine, the prime minister Viktor Orbán’s cabinet chief has said.Gergely Gulyás said Hungarian citizens could leave the 14-day quarantine only if they provided two negative Covid tests.Exceptions for the ban on entry for foreigners would apply to military convoys and for humanitarian transit, as well as business or diplomatic travel.The government was considering various rules on how fans could be allowed to attend the Uefa Super Cup match between Bayern Munich and Sevilla in Budapest on 24 September, Gulyás added.“The number of infections has increased … and most of these originate from abroad,” Gulyás told a news conference. He said the restrictions were needed to allow the school year to start next week, and protect people as well as the economy.Peru will start testing coronavirus vaccines from China’s Sinopharm and the US drugmaker Johnson \u0026amp Johnson in September, researchers have said, which should help the country gain faster access to inoculations once the vaccines are approved.Sinopharm began this week to recruit up to 6,000 volunteers in Peru, which Reuters data indicates has the highest number of Covid-19 deaths in relation to its population size. A team of Chinese scientists is expected to arrive in the Andean nation next week to work with local researchers, said Germán Málaga, a doctor and lead vaccine investigator at Lima’s Cayetano Heredia University.“This is going to happen around 3 September, to begin vaccinations on 8 September,” he said. Sinopharm’s clinical trials in Peru are being done with Cayetano Heredia and the state-run Universidad Mayor de San Marcos.The pandemic shuttered production of television and films in Hollywood in mid-March and the industry has struggled to get back to work under new health guidelines. Scripted TV dramas and comedies are usually shot in August and begin airing in September.Comcast Corp’s NBC said hospital drama New Amsterdam and police comedy Brooklyn Nine-Nine were among shows that will not be back until January, while a new season of family series This Is Us will not appear until 10 November.Reality shows, re-runs and revivals make up most of the television menu this fall as America’s top four broadcasters grapple to fill holes in their schedules caused by coronavirus production shutdowns.Most scripted dramas, including popular shows like This Is Us and 9-1-1, will not be available until November or later, while the Star Trek: Discovery series that has been behind a paywall for three years will get a run on free-to-view CBS , the networks announced this week.Elsewhere, it will mostly be a diet of old and new gameshows, including Ellen’s Game of Games, repeats of Celebrity Family Feud, and another revival of 1960s show Supermarket Sweep. Kelly Kahl, the president of entertainment at CBS, said in a statement announcing the lineup.This is hardly a traditional fall season but we are prepared with a strong slate of original content while our regular scripted series begin production."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4341143.1598628345!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"english language schools should suspend recruitment department says","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe Department said language schools should return to classroom lessons “without delay” in compliance with public health advice to meet the needs of students already in Ireland who must attend an education institution to receive immigration permission in order to remain in the country. Photograph: iStockEnglish language schools should suspend the recruitment of international students until 2021, the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science has recommended.In a three-page letter sent to language school representative groups as part of talks regarding the sector’s reopening, the Department said it would welcome “a voluntary moratorium” which would put a stop to the enrolling of new international students to English language schools in Ireland. A particular date in 2021 was not specified. The Department wrote: “There are currently too many unknowns and concerns to support any resumption of recruitment activity which would result in new International ELE (English Language Education) students entering the State.”The Department cited “substantial concerns” regarding the sector’s capacity to manage the safety of new students. In particular, it questioned schools’ ability to ensure appropriate accommodation for quarantine upon arrival and for the duration of students’ stay, to ensure students are capable of supporting themselves without State supports, and that the necessary standards of educational provision will be in place. The Department said its concern was shared by the Department of Health.However, the Department said language schools should return to classroom lessons “without delay” in compliance with public health advice to meet the needs of students already in Ireland who must attend an education institution to receive immigration permission in order to remain in the country.Most language schools have switched to online teaching during the pandemic. However, in the letter, the Department said it had received many complaints regarding the quality of online classes as well as the treatment of students.It cited complaints including, “deep dissatisfaction with the standard of online classes where they have been provided, a lack of support for students struggling to access these services and the non-refund of fees for students receiving a reduced service from their provider”.The Department suggested that online delivery of classes for students already in the country should only be used as “a contingency measure”, in circumstances where the Government restricts such activities in the interest of public health.The ELE sector in Ireland is unregulated and run by private companies.The Qualifications and Quality Assurance (Education and Training) (Amendment) Act 2019 was enacted to provide regulation to the ELE sector through the introduction of the “International Education Mark” (IEM), which only providers that meet robust quality assurance procedures would be allowed to use.However, this regulation has yet to be implemented.A spokesperson for the Department of Higher and Further Education said it was now “working with QQI (Quality and Qualifications Ireland) on the necessary precursors, as set out in the Act, to the full implementation of the IEM…which will set standards for ELE providers.”Ian Brangan, director of ActualiseELT, a management, training and consultancy company, and owner of a new English language school which has yet to open due to Covid restrictions, said he regrets that all ELE schools were being “tarred with the same brush”. He said this was largely caused by lack of regulation for which he criticised the Department.“I think we are all shocked with the position of the Department in that it contrasts hugely with the help they are giving universities to facilitate new students coming into the country,” he said.In response to the Government’s recommendations for the sector, Ciarán Gallagher, spokesman for Unite the Union’s ELT branch, said: “It looks very bleak for the industry.“For teachers it probably means lay-offs and redundancies on quite a large scale.”He added: “A more inclusive industry that recognises teachers as ‘stakeholders’ and that our input is vital is the only way forward,” he added.Founder of English Language Students Union (ELSU) Ireland and Unite Student Liaison Officer, Fiachra Ó Luain, said ELSU students welcomed the Department’s recommendations in the letter and its “change of tone with school owners”.“Justice will not be done until a significant visa extension of at least a year is offered to the students still present in the country and refunds offered to all those thousands of students who had to leave without being able to complete their courses,” Mr Ó Luain said.The letter was sent from the Department to an organisation representing English language schools Progressive College Network (PCN), as well as Marketing English in Ireland (MEI) and Independent Language Schools Group (ILSG) on August 18th."},{"url":null,"title":"climate","story":"Dismantling of protections \u0026lsquois making it harder for future administrations to use science\u0026rsquoLoss equivalent to an ice sheet over landmass of Ireland to a depth of 300 metresDiesel and petrol consumption fell as transport restrictions took hold, report shows"},{"url":null,"title":"heritage","story":"The by-the-wind sailor\u0026rsquos sworn foe, the violet sea snail, floats upside-down alongside itMichael Viney: North Atlantic\u0026rsquos top predator now shares island with 13 other speciesMichael Viney: The wayside ashes of the west stand as defiantly healthy emblems of their kindInidual ants are certainly not smart, but their group wisdom may exceed our ownMichael Viney: Irish numbers have more than doubled since the counts of Operation Seafarer in 1970Michael Viney: A predator denning in parks, gardens and wasteland gets mixed responsesA beefed-up, independent National Parks and Wildlife Service would be just the ticketMichael Viney: Wild grasses have loved the mood swings of our climate this yearAnother Life: As one of many of the world\u0026rsquos declining seabirds, puffins are now receiving much more necessary and serious attentionAnother Life: A new book on the founders of the Tyler Prize shows their political influenceAvian science journal Ibis reports \u0026lsquogreat conservation concern\u0026rsquo about the speciesAnother Life: Dairy farmer Bruce Thompson examines impact of worming drug on beetlesMichael Viney: Crumbling hilltop trig pillars\u0026rsquo played key role in the mapping of IrelandAntipodean flatworms pose risk to indigenous variety which could have severe knock-on effectsAnother Life: Some floaters circle territories and sneak the odd \u0026lsquoextra-pair copulation\u0026rsquoMichael Viney: Plant intelligence rests in the ways by which they solve their problemsA Life on Our Planet is a terrifying catalogue of our self-sabotaging transgressionsGreys carry squirrel-pox virus which is fatal to Ireland\u0026rsquos native redsAnother Life: The disappearance of this bird from cities has prompted much researchRobinson has followed Mair\u0026eacutead, his wife and collaborator, into the list of Covid-19 fatalitiesWill Covid-19 begin a resurgence of the 1970s withdrawal from growth-driven capitalism?"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4341003.1598634621!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"cabinet agrees on new garda powers to close pubs not following covid 19 guidelines","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tWorkers in premises that serve drink and food will be obliged to wear masks under new regulations being considered by the Government.The Cabinet has agreed to new Garda powers for pubs, signed off on a package of financial aid for pubs and the Attorney General is to examine options for further regulating house parties.Gardaí will be given the powers to close a pub immediately where they believe public health guidelines are not being followed. With the sanction of a superintendent, a garda can order the closure of a premises either orally or in written format. If the owner does not comply, they could be subject to a fine or imprisonment on conviction.Gardaí will also be able to apply to the District Court for a longer closure order, which could close a pub for up to 30 days. The Cabinet also discussed possible action to be taken against house parties that are not complying with public health guidelines.Under the proposals discussed this afternoon, if approved, it will be an offence to organise or attend a gathering in a private house with more than six visitors either indoors or outdoors. This measure was introduced as a guideline last week.It is understood that the number of people permitted at weddings will remain at 50. It is expected that the Cabinet will also agree that pubs that serve only alcohol will not be permitted to reopen on Monday.Workers in premises that serve drink and food will be obliged to wear masks under further regulations being considered by the Government.Ministers previously signed regulations making face coverings mandatory in shops and other indoor public settings but this did not extend to restaurants, bars or cafes.Sources have said that officials in the Department of Health are currently drafting the regulations but that the plan will be to make it mandatory for those working in any establishment that serves food or drinks to wear masks.It is understood the matter would be discussed in this afternoon’s Cabinet meeting but will not be agreed until the regulations are ready.Earlier on Friday, the HSE’s Chief Clinical Officer Dr Colm Henry said now was not the time for pubs not serving food to reopen.Dr Henry, who is also a member of the National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET), said that from international experience congregated settings and alcohol were not good conditions for transmission of the virus.‘A critical juncture’“Now we’re opening schools and that’s an important milestone in our experience of Covid so far, because we’re recognising the impact closures have had on children’s health and well being, so now is not the right time to reopen pubs at this critical juncture,” he said.When asked about the lower levels of hospitalisation and the age profile of more recent cases (31 years old), Dr Henry said: “We can’t have society apartheid where we expect older people to obey one set of rules and younger people to not adhere to those rules, because we know that apart from the harm to children, we are now seeing reports of harm to older people, malnutrition, deconditioning, decreased mobility, we can’t protract the isolation of older people.”Dr Henry said that the new advice that came in last week was the need to double up “on all our behaviours” which meant that now was not the right time to reopen pubs with rising community transmissions.“ Sequencing of the virus shows it is the same, every bit as transmissible, every bit as lethal to vulnerable people and older people and younger people are not immune to the effects of the virus.”Dr Henry said that the collective aim must be “to extinguish and suffocate the virus in those household settings and not allow transmission between household settings, hence the regulations that came in last week limiting the number of people indoors and outdoors and hence the generic advice for people apart from washing hands and distancing is avoid indoor settings, avoid congregated settings, minimise and ration the number of close contacts that you have.”OutbreaksThere are nearly 400 active outbreaks of coronavirus in the country at present, according to officials from the Health Protection Surveillance Centre.Dr John Cuddihy, director of the HPSC, which monitors and analyses the number of Covid-19 cases in the State, said on Thursday that officials were seeing a “significant number of outbreaks” at present.There are 392 active outbreaks of the virus in the State at present, 252 of which were related to social gatherings in private households, he said.One recent outbreak in a pubrestaurant had been linked to 26 cases, which then spread further causing 10 cases in another workplace. Another outbreak in a restaurant involved 19 cases.Six cases had been traced to an outbreak in a sports club, with further transmission at an associated social gathering resulting in another 19 cases.Dr Cuddihy said an outbreak in a retail outlet had seen seven staff contract the virus, as some of the workers continued to work while showing symptoms."},{"url":null,"title":"confronting","story":"A news podcast from The  that covers Ireland\u0027s response to the Coronavirus outbreak.

Photograph: Gareth Chaney CollinsNo further deaths from Covid-19 but a further 127 cases in the State were confirmed on Friday.This brings to 28,578 the total number of cases of the coronavirus since the pandemic began, and leaves the death toll in the Republic at 1,777.Of the cases confirmed on Friday, 52 are in Dublin, 13 are in Monaghan, nine are in Tipperary, eight are in Meath, eight are in Wexford, eight are in Roscommon and the remaining 29 are located in Carlow, Cavan, Clare, Cork, Galway, Kerry, Kildare, Kilkenny, Limerick, Longford, Louth, Offaly, Waterford, Westmeath and Wicklow.Around 80 per cent of the cases are people under 45 years of age, while 70 of the confirmed cases are men and 57 are women.Dr Ronan Glynn, acting chief medical officer, said while the number of people in critical care “remains stable”, an additional eight people have been hospitalised in the last 24 hours.“If cases continue to rise we will see an inevitable increase in the number of people hospitalised. We all have a role to play in preventing that from happening,” Dr Glynn said.“This weekend it is vital that people play their part by decreasing social contacts. Do not drop your guard just because you are meeting people close to you.”Earlier, it was confirmed that a second inmate in the Irish prison system has tested positive for Covid-19 shortly after his arrest for minor offences.Prison officials were aware the man had symptoms of the virus before his arrival at Cloverhill Prison and sources say they are confident they have contained any outbreak. The 28-year-old accused was arrested by gardaí in Coolock earlier this week for a series of minor offences including criminal damage, theft and road traffic offences. After being taken to Coolock Garda Station he informed gardaí he had recently returned from a trip abroad. He also started to display symptoms of Covid-19, leading gardaí to order a test for the virus. He was tested for the virus before being transported to Cloverhill Prison by officers in full PPE gear. He was tested again in the back of the prison van before going into a 14-day quarantine period in a designated area of the prison, as is standard for all new committals. The day after his admission the test came back positive. The man remains in Cloverhill and does not require hospitalisation. An Irish Prison Service spokesman said it does not comment on inidual Covid-19 cases and referred queries to the National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET). The man is the second person to test positive for the virus in the prison system. Last week a female prisoner tested positive shortly after her arrival at the Dochas Centre women’s prison. She was also in the mandatory 14 day quarantine period at the time and prison authorities believe no other inmates were infected. Until last week, Ireland was one of the few countries in Europe to keep Covid-19 out of its prison population, despite several prison officers contracting the virus in the community. This was achieved through the imposition of strict infection control measures including a complete ban on visiting which was only recently lifted. Other measures include segregation of symptomatic prisoners or prisoners awaiting tests in a designated area of Cloverhill and the cocooning of elderly or vulnerable prisoners. Prison sources say if the current resurgence of the virus continues in the community, the ban on visiting may be temporarily reintroduced.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Cabinet also signs off on financial aid package for publicansNo further deaths reported but a second case of Covid-19 is identified in prison systemSecond-generation Offaly pub owner opened burger bar to stay open amid Covid-19 restrictionsCoroner calls for \u0026lsquoend to speculation\u0026rsquo at preliminary hearing on death of teenagerIncrease linked to single adults having to use emergency accommodation due to problems finding homesMoney will be used as education fund for staff fighting Covid-19Average number of contacts per case among 15-24 year olds is more than 11\u0026lsquoCurrently too many unknowns and concerns to support any resumption of recruitment activity\u0026rsquoDublin City Council asking hotel to address alleged planning permission breachRonan Hughes (40) on trial over discovery of 39 bodies in a truck container in EssexDozens of students affected by decision to shut Brookfield College in TraleeMore than half of submissions in public consultation were against new \u0026lsquodefault speed limit\u0026rsquo across city and suburbsNorth\u0026rsquos health minister is to ask the North\u0026rsquos Executive to \u0026lsquoprioritise stronger legislation\u0026rsquoElijah Burke, educated by his mother, to receive results on same day as other candidatesTemperatures are forecast to stay in low teens over Saturday and SundayThief wielding a screwdriver threatened governors before stealing small sum of cashParty leaders to discuss potential candidates for role after resignation of Phil HoganTaking of saliva samples deemed less traumatic amid range of parental concernsIt will be an offence to attend a gathering in a house with more than six visitorsKeeping the virus from reappearing in nursing homes key to lower death ratesStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4341196.1598633018!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"you have some hope when the door is open none when it is shut says publican","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tEmmet Lynch’s pub has started serving food to stay afloat. Photograph: Alan BetsonThe “This is a time to be as open minded as possible, to try anything and to be ready to try again,” says second-generation publican Emmet Lynch, who believes the pandemic has advanced the death of the traditional Irish pub.The owner of what was, for decades, Hugh Lynch’s pub on Tullamore’s Kilbride Street – named after his father who ran it from 1971 until he died four years ago – has transformed it over recent weeks into Hugh Lynch’s Burger Bar.There was already a kitchen on the premises, although it was only used in the past to cater functions in the upstairs room – beef stroganoff and rice was a popular dish for funerals, christenings and birthdays.But when Covid-19 struck and the lockdown of so-called “wet pubs” – those that don’t normally serve food – looked increasingly indefinite, Lynch knew he had to try something radically different if he were to keep the family business alive.Looking to gourmet burger offerings in Dublin, he decided to try out the concept in Offaly’s county town.Rather than ambling into a front bar of regulars, or the back lounge popular with younger crowds at the weekend, customers are now greeted at the front door and guided to a socially distanced table, where they must remain unless going to the toilet or leaving.Diners make their order by ticking boxes on a business card-sized menu which floor staff pass to the chef in the kitchen.A 6oz fresh beef burger costs €6.95, a double cheeseburger €9.50 and fries are €3.So far, it has been a success, but it’s not for everybody.Social hub“Some of our older customers just want to have a drink and it was difficult at the beginning trying to explain to them that they can’t do that with the regulations,” says Mr Lynch.“A lot of them would have been daily customers, who come in for a pint and read the newspaper, and maybe join five or six more. It was their social hub – some are quite lonely.”Those who decide to stay for a burger are adjusting to the movement restrictions and having to pay a bill rather than pay for each pint as it is served.Opening hours have also changed. Gone is the 10.30am to last orders day, replaced with a strict 5pm to 10pm operation.Lynch relaunched the pub on the August bank holiday weekend but was shut down again after just nine days trading when restrictions were tightened in Offaly, Laois and Kildare amid a spike in coronavirus cases.As restrictions eased again, he reopened this week.Crucial to the venture’s survival will be, of course, demand – he is worried it may wane in the autumn – but also the continuance for now of the government’s wage subsidy scheme, which is due to be wound down in the spring.Before lockdown, one person could operate the bar and adjacent off licence. For the burger bar, Mr Lynch needs two people on the floor, one behind the counter and one in the kitchen.

Michel Barnier said he was disappointed, concerned and surprised by the lack of progress displayed in discussions that took place in Brussels this week, reiterating that at this stage an agreement between the two sides still looked unlikely and that there was a risk the two sides would fail to ratify a deal by the end of the year. “Too often this week it felt as if we were going backwards more than forwards,” Mr Barnier said at a press conference following the conclusion of the latest negotiations. “I simply do not understand why we are wasting valuable time.” The failure to advance the discussions that began on Tuesday evening leaves only a narrow window in which to agree the text of a trade agreement, translate it into multiple European languages and obtain ratification before the post-Brexit transition period ends on December 31st. While both the UK and EU insist they want a deal, EU officials decried a lack of momentum on the British side in the wake of Thursday’s session, with one describing it as “puzzling”. David Frost, the UK’s chief negotiator, acknowledged in a separate statement that there had been “little progress” during the week’s talks, but he also insisted that a deal remained possible even if it would not be easy to achieve.State aid and fisheriesThe EU wants the two sides to push towards a common understanding on the topics of state aid and fisheries, rather than leaving these highly sensitive topics until later in the talks, but British negotiators are seeking to advance to a legal text in other areas where the two sides are closer together.Lord Frost criticised the EU’s approach on Friday. “The EU is still insisting not only that we must accept continuity with EU state aid and fisheries policy, but also that this must be agreed before any further substantive work can be done in any other area of the negotiation, including on legal texts,” he said. “This makes it unnecessarily difficult to make progress.”Mr Barnier complained that he was not seeing any willingness on the UK side to take on board the EU’s priorities, adding that the need for a “level playing field” that ensures fair competition in areas including state aid would not go away and was a non-negotiable precondition to any trade deal.“No international agreement was ever reached without the parties agreeing to common rules,” he said. The notion of a zero-tariff, zero-quota agreement without level playing field provisions and a balanced deal on fisheries was a “non-starter” for the EU, and the absence of progress in these areas was blocking everything, he warned.British negotiating officials said the talks were stalling due to the problematic issues of fishing and state aid, over which they accused the EU of seeking to maintain the status quo.“What is frustrating is that Barnier wants to see us continuing arrangements very like those we had as members of the EU. The principle of ‘Brexit means Brexit’ is a good one and should be applied across the board,” the official said.“The process block now is that we must accept their position on state aid and fisheries before we can talk about anything else. We’re obviously not going to do that, so we’re frozen.”Key concernsMr Barnier confirmed that the UK had presented a draft legal text for the trade deal during the round of talks, but he added that this had not addressed the EU’s key concerns, serving instead as a reminder of the UK’s existing positions.Lord Frost added that the UK was seeking a relationship that ensures Britain regains “sovereign control of our own laws, borders, and waters” and is similar to other agreements struck by the EU elsewhere. “When the EU accepts this reality in all areas of the negotiation, it will be much easier to make progress.” A dinner between Mr Barnier and Lord Frost was held on Thursday evening after negotiations concluded, which officials suggested was tense following the lack of progress. “It was a very nice dinner, we had courteous and friendly discussions but we didn’t hide the difficulties between us,” one inidual said. – Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2020Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

Photograph: Olivier DoulieryAFP via Getty ImagesIt was late afternoon on February 2nd, the eve of the Iowa caucuses. We were jammed into a high-school gymnasium in Des Moines, the state capital, for Joe Biden’s closing rally.No one thought he would win the primary season’s talismanic opening contest the following day. Nor was he expected to come close to beating Bernie Sanders, the socialist Vermonter, in New Hampshire the next week. Though he was still ahead in the national polls, the 77-year-old former vice-president was treated as yesterday’s news.A crowd of several hundred was waiting unexpectantly. Biden entered roughly half an hour late, accompanied by a phalanx of retired politicians: John Kerry (76), the former secretary of state Chris Dodd (75), the retired senator from Connecticut Tom Vilsack (69), former governor of Iowa and Harold Schaitberger (73), president of the International Association of Firefighters.The oxygen seemed to drain from the room. As Biden’s surrogates spoke one after the other, the air got progressively thinner. By the time the candidate got up to speak, it was positively embalmed. “This is like a wake,” joked one veteran television anchor. Biden’s low-key soliloquy did little to lift the energy.Such are the limits of conventional wisdom. Twenty-seven days later, Biden grabbed the Democratic mantle after sweeping the South Carolina primary. With the notable exception of Sanders, who fought on for another five weeks, most of the rest of the field dropped out and endorsed him. It was a breathtaking twist.With hindsight, Biden officials say they always knew he would be the Democratic nominee. They were playing the long game. “We made a decision from the start not to listen to the loudest voices on Twitter,” says Stef Feldman, Biden’s policy director. That was not how many sounded at the time. When I asked a Biden staffer in Des Moines about the campaign’s mood, he used the TV anchor’s same funereal analogy.Who could blame them? Biden’s long history of running for the White House offered no cause for hope. Over a  of more than 32 years, he had not won a single primary. In 1987, he crashed out months before the voting began, having been accused of plagiarising a speech by Neil Kinnock, leader of the British Labour party.In 2008, he quit after having won just 0.9 per cent of the Iowa caucus vote. “At that point, most people thought his presidential career was over,” says Shailagh Murray, then a journalist with the Washington Post, who went on to become Biden’s deputy chief of staff. He had at least another 12 years to go. Nobody that night imagined that Barack Obama, winner of the Iowa caucus, would go on to pick Biden as his ­running mate.Ceremonial presidentThe vicissitudes of Biden’s 50 years in politics ought to make anyone sceptical of forecasts for this November. In the absence of time machines, we can only go by the numbers. Both the betting markets (about two to one in Biden’s favour) and the polls (an average eight-percentage-point lead over Donald Trump) suggest Biden will be America’s 46th president.What manner of president would he make? Half of Washington claims to know the man well. At a year above the median US male’s life expectancy, many expect him to be a ceremonial president. Even Biden’s close friends admit his energy and power of recall are not what they were.His would be a restorationist presidency – an erasure of what he is fond of describing as the Trumpian “aberration”. Others, notably Trump, depict him as a geriatric prisoner of the Democratic Party’s left. Most agree that whatever his agenda, and whatever the time of day, he would probably still talk too much.The word “logorrhea” (a tendency to extreme loquacity) has recently come into fashion. Biden’s campaign is keen to emphasise he would not, like Trump, be the “Twitterer-in-chief”.Those who know him the best – many of whom spoke to me for this profile – are in little doubt about the character he would bring to the presidency. Their Biden may stray too readily into schmaltz. But his empathy for people is real. In this pandemic-blighted election year, that quality could count for a lot.“Biden is the same guy I first met in 1969 – he was full of piss and vinegar,” says Louis Susman, a Chicago-based investor and former ambassador to the UK. “He doesn’t suffer from inner demons, he doesn’t bear grudges and he loves being around people.”Should he make it to the White House, Biden would have completed the longest marathon in US political history. No other serious figure has tried this long to make it over the finishing line in recent history.A majority of Americans were not born when Biden first entered national politics. At 30, he was the fifth youngest senator in the country’s history after he won office in 1972. Biden’s 48-year political career is older than John F Kennedy, Bill Clinton and Barack Obama when they were elected.Yet he sounds remarkably similar today to the ambitious, blue-collar Irish-American that he was then. Staffers tried and failed to get him to avoid using words such as “record player” during the 2020 primaries. Calling someone a “horse’s ass” is no longer thought to be cutting. In an interview with Kitty Kelley in 1974, Biden worried about being seen as a “gay young bachelor” around Washington – by which he meant “happy”, not “LGBTQ”.So popular are Biden’s anachronisms that there is even a “Biden insult bot” – a Twitter algorithm – to which fans can turn. “You got something stuck in your craw, you milk-swillin’ circus peanut,” reads one tweet. “Shut your piehole, you hood-winked britch soiler,” reads another.‘Amtrak Joe’Most American voters already know of the ­tragedy that struck Biden in his early career. A few weeks after he was elected to the Senate, he lost his wife Neilia and one-year-old daughter, Naomi, in a car crash while they were Christmas shopping in Delaware, his home state.His sons, Beau, aged three, and Hunter, aged two, survived but were hospitalised with severe injuries. Most people would have disintegrated. Biden considered not taking his Senate seat. In the end, he was persuaded to be sworn in at the hospital beside one of his sons. He said he could only continue in politics if he saw his kids every morning and night.Thus was born “Amtrak Joe” – the senator who took the 90-minute journey each evening from Washington to Wilmington to say goodnight to his sons. He commuted until 2008, long after the boys had grown up. Subtracting a tenth of nights for other travel, and nearly half the year for recess and weekends, I calculate that Biden spent at least 21,000 hours – or three years of his life – on that train.“He knew the names of every conductor and they all loved him,” says Paul Laudicina, Biden’s legislative director between 1977 and 1982. “Often, he would still be talking when he boarded, and I would go to Wilmington with him and then cross the platform and come straight back.”In the 1974 Kelley interview, the famously acerbic journalist said Biden “reeks of decency”. He nevertheless managed to sound almost Trumpian about his deceased wife. “Let me show you my favourite picture of her,” he says, holding up a snapshot of Neilia in a bikini. “She had the best body of any woman I ever saw. She looks better than a Playboy bunny, doesn’t she?” Kelley described his office as a shrine to Neilia.Biden recently conceded that he has been too invasive of women’s personal space – “handsiness” has also entered the DC lexicon. Unlike some of his contemporaries, however, he has not been dogged by rumours of infidelity. A former Senate staffer, Tara Reade, accused him earlier this year of sexually assaulting her in a corridor in 1993. Biden denies it and her story has been criticised as inconsistent.In 1977 Biden married Jill Tracy Jacobs, a teacher based in Wilmington. On their first date he dressed in a jacket. When he dropped her back home he shook her hand. According to What it Takes, the ­celebrated 1988 campaign book by the late ­Richard Ben Cramer, Jill said she could not believe such men still existed. “Jill is Biden’s least appreciated strength,” says Susman, who often hosted the Bidens for Thanksgiving in his Nantucket home.Much of Biden’s sense of gravity comes from her. Even when her husband was vice-president, Jill Biden continued to teach every day at a community college in Northern Virginia. When he left office in 2017, the Bidens’ net worth was less than $500,000. They still hadn’t paid off the mortgage on their Wilmington home.Irish-Catholic and handsomeUntil he was rescued from near-certain genteel decline by Obama, Biden was defined by his disastrous 1988 presidential bid. Most of the people who helped him on that jinxed quest, including Ted Kaufman, his long-running chief of staff, Michael Donilon, his chief strategist today, and Donilon’s brother Tom, Biden’s foreign-policy adviser, are still around him.They are mostly Irish-American and very tight-knit. Cathy Russell, Tom Donilon’s wife, was Jill Biden’s chief of staff when she was “second lady”. Her husband is tipped as a possible secretary of state. Kaufman is running Biden’s presidential transition – that long and rickety bridge between victory and inauguration.In the 1988 campaign, Biden tried to present himself as the new John F Kennedy – young, Irish-Catholic and handsome. It never quite took hold. Then he saw a video of Kinnock’s soaring oratory – “Why am I the first Kinnock in a thousand generations to be able to get to university?” That was the middle-class poetry Biden had been lacking – the story of how the sons and daughters of coal miners had been lifted up by the welfare state, Britain’s version of the New Deal.“He grabbed that tape and took it home he inhaled the thing,” wrote Cramer. “It was like when Barbra Streisand came on the radio – Kinnock was singing Joe’s song.” For the most part, Biden credited Kinnock’s words. But the rival Michael Dukakis campaign found one tape where Biden had not. They leaked it.Suddenly, Biden was inundated with calls asking whether his grandfather had been a coal miner (none of his forebears had been). “It looked like Joe didn’t just steal the words, it looked like he ripped off Kinnock’s life,” Cramer wrote. A few months after dropping out, Biden had a near-fatal ­aneurysm. Then another. He was given a 50-50 chance of ­surviving the first nine-hour operation.“Joe wouldn’t be alive today if he had still been running for president,” says Kaufman. “He wouldn’t have had the time to get his headaches checked out.” Or, as Biden said when he emerged from the anaesthetic: “Now I know why the campaign ended like it did.” For what it’s worth, Kinnock’s Labour Party lost the election too.Emotional antennaeBiden’s 2008 loss left less of a mark on him, partly because he became vice-president less than a year later. “How could you begrudge losing to Barack Obama?” says Murray. “Obama was like The Beatles.”The campaign Biden still regrets was the one that he didn’t fight in 2016. His reluctance stemmed from another tragedy, the death in 2015 of his son Beau from brain cancer. But he had little encouragement from Obama, who had already committed to backing Hillary Clinton. Biden’s internal polls show that he would have beaten Trump. But he had little chance of wresting the crown from Clinton, whose machine he could not hope to match.In his memoir Promise Me, Dad, named after Beau’s request that his father stay in politics, Biden recounts his anger following a Politico story that he was exploiting his son’s death for electoral purposes. “It exceeded even my worst expectations of what the opposition was going to be like,” he wrote. In truth, he could not discuss running without breaking down. “He would literally start to cry every time we raised the subject,” says a Biden ­confidante.In another cycle, Biden’s lachrymosity might have been an albatross. During coronavirus, his emotional antennae look like a virtue. More than 165,000 Americans have now died in the pandemic. That toll is likely to be approaching a quarter of a million by early November.Trump’s inability to express condolences for America’s grieving families could not be further apart from Biden’s. In 2016, anger was the dominant political emotion. In 2020, it feels more like sadness. “If Trump were matter, then Biden is anti-matter – their characters are opposites,” says Laurence Tribe, a Harvard law professor who has been advising Biden on constitutional matters since the mid-1980s.When Biden was vice-president, Norm Ornstein, a veteran Congressional watcher, lost his son in a tragic accident. “The moment he heard, Biden telephoned and spent an hour on the phone with me and my wife, talking us through it,” says ­Ornstein. “The next day I received a handwritten letter of condolence from him. There is nothing fake about his sympathy. He feels it deeply.”Andrew Yang, the maverick hit of the Democratic primaries, says: “When most people hadn’t figured out who I was, Joe took me aside and was very gracious and friendly. This was just as true when things were going badly for him – he’s always steady and good-natured, in public and in private.”‘Shoot. Me. Now’Some in Biden’s world admit they have one or two concerns about the election and beyond. Chief of these is his tendency to make gaffes. In that sense, the lockdown has a silver lining: there is no campaign trail to avoid. Zoom is easier to manage.When Obama was elected to the US Senate in 2004, Biden invited him to join the foreign relations committee, of which he was chairman. Having listened to a trademark Biden disquisition, Obama scribbled a note and handed it to a staffer. It read: “Shoot. Me. Now.”When the two men were discussing how they would handle their White House relationship, Obama said: “I want your advice Joe, I just want it in 10-minute, not 60-minute, increments.” For the most part, Biden complied.Sometimes, he could not help himself. The term “Bidenism” – self-inflicted public humiliation – has long been in currency. “Stand up Chuck, let ’em see ya,” Biden once said to a Missouri state senator in a wheelchair. “Folks, I can tell you, I’ve known eight presidents, three of them intimately,” he said in praise of Obama, adding: “I promise you, the president has a big stick, I promise you,” in a mangled rendition of Theodore Roosevelt’s dictum about speaking softly and carrying a big stick.Fear of such miscues saw the Obama camp “quarantine” Biden for most of the 2012 re-election campaign. This year’s actual quarantine could thus be helpful.Many in Biden world are betting that his choice of Kamala Harris as running mate will immunise him against a record of racial gaffes. Earlier this year, Biden apologised after saying that “you ain’t black” if you would consider voting against him. As a mixed-race American of Indian and Jamaican heritage, the Harris pick will buy Biden more protection.Given Biden’s age, she is far likelier than most running mates to become president. As Biden discovered in the primaries, she also knows how to throw a punch.It is hard to find anyone in Biden’s circle who is losing sleep over three debates with Trump later this year. As Biden showed in 2008 with Sarah Palin and in 2012 with Paul Ryan – the Republican running mates of John McCain and Mitt Romney – he is a surprisingly taut debater.Trump, meanwhile, seems to be afflicted with his own severe dose of logorrhea. His recent boast in a Fox News interview that he recalled five words in order in a cognitive test was greeted with mockery. “I have two words for you,” says a senior adviser, when I ask about Biden’s age and prolixity: “Donald Trump. ”Biden’s peopleNor is the campaign worried about Twitter. When I asked two Biden officials whether he composed his own tweets, or would know how to send one, I got an unexpectedly constipated response: “No one has ever asked us that.” It turns out that Biden does not physically send his own tweets but is involved with their substance.Their second concern is ageing. At 74, Trump is only a smidgen younger than Biden. The difference with Trump is the people with whom Biden would surround himself. Chief among these is Ron Klain, a long-standing Biden aide who is likely to be White House chief of staff. Tony Blinken would probably be his national security adviser.Other top-job contenders would include Tom Donilon and Susan Rice (successive national security advisers to Obama), Kurt Campbell (who ran Asia policy for Obama), Jake Sullivan (who leads Biden’s campaign policy), Nick Burns, a former under secretary of state, and Bill Burns (no relation), a former deputy secretary of state. Michèle Flournoy, a former under secretary of defence, is tipped as a likely Pentagon chief.One adviser predicted that Biden would choose Romney, the Republican senator from Utah, as his secretary of state. That would annoy Vladimir Putin’s Russia, whom Romney described as America’s “number one geopolitical foe”. It would also upset most Democrats for very different reasons.Either way, the contrast between Biden’s friends and the parade of often bizarre cameos that have staffed the Trump administration is glaring. The current president is now on his fourth chief of staff and sixth national security adviser. By contrast, most of Biden’s coterie have known him for decades.“What leaps out about Biden’s people is their competence,” says John Podesta, a senior official in both the Clinton and Obama White Houses. “Neither he nor his team need training wheels.”There are also lingering worries about Hunter Biden, who has long been a source of concern for his father. “Joe has a total blind spot about Hunter,” says a close family friend.Hunter was discharged from the US Navy because he tested positive for cocaine. He launched various business ventures while his father was vice-president. He was accused of monetising the Biden name and subsequently got a seat on the board of a Ukrainian gas company.Trump’s attempts to extort Ukraine to supply Biden opposition research resulted in his impeachment last year (though he was acquitted by the Senate). “The campaign just has to keep Hunter out of the picture,” says the friend.Radical platformWhat would Biden actually do in office? Tackling the pandemic would be the first, second and third priority of any incoming president. Little can happen while the US economy is under semi-­permanent lockdown.Beyond that his economic platform is radical by the standards of any recent Democratic president, including Obama. “We would have the largest mobilisation of investments since world war two,” says Feldman. “We would start by putting pandemic logistics and supply on a war footing.”Some people compare the gargantuan challenges of today to 1932, when Franklin D Roosevelt won the election in the middle of the Great Depression. In spite of running a fairly bland campaign, FDR then embarked on a streak of “bold, persistent experimentation” that would remake America.But the differences are more interesting. For all its ravages, coronavirus is not as intractable as the Great Depression. By next January, the world should be closer to having a vaccine. Biden would also be fulfilling the first rule of any job – always follow an under-performer.He could achieve a lot in his first 100 days simply by covering the basics, such as launching a national coronavirus plan, shunning Twitter and not insulting foreign leaders. “If you have an American president at foreign summits eating with his mouth closed and not throwing cutlery around, the world will give him a standing ovation,” says one adviser and friend.Low-hanging foreign-policy fruit that Biden would pluck in his opening days include rejoining the World Health Organisation, the Paris agreement on climate change and the Iran nuclear deal, says Jake Sullivan. He would also convene a global summit to tackle Covid-19.Domestic steps would include stopping work on the US-Mexico border wall (such as it is), setting up a daily coronavirus briefing led by Dr Anthony Fauci or Ron Klain (who led Obama’s Ebola team) and picking an attorney general who would embrace planks of Black Lives Matter’s criminal-justice reform agenda.In his dealings both with Republicans and foreign leaders, Biden would place great stock in personal chemistry. Enjoying the company of people is one area where Biden is as different to Obama as he is to Trump. “The thing that Biden most likes is what Obama liked the least – the ­personal stuff,” says Podesta. Nick Burns says Biden revels in the “constant gardening” of diplomacy – talking frequently to his counterparts.Wishful thinkingSceptics point out that today’s Republican Party is unrecognisable to the one with which Biden grew up. Should he emerge intact from transition with a paranoid Trump, the chances of the defeated party working with him will be slim. Woke nativism will prove a more durable pathogen than Covid-19.Moreover, Biden’s global honeymoon would be unlikely to last long. Most people view his musings about restoring the status quo ante – going back to the world before Trump – as wishful thinking, not that geopolitical trends were particularly stable during the Obama years.China looms far larger today than it did in 2016. Biden’s favourite European, Angela Merkel, Germany’s chancellor, is due to retire by next year. And Biden will neither be inclined – nor likely in a position – to offer Britain’s Boris Johnson the US-UK trade deal he craves.Tony Blinken, Biden’s senior foreign policy adviser, says Biden’s scepticism about Obama’s ineffectual Afghanistan surge looks better and better in hindsight. “I respect Gates tremendously but he just wanted approval for his Afghanistan plan and Biden disagreed,” he says. Biden was in favour of US intervention in Bosnia in 1995, he adds, to convey that Biden is not some ­inveterate peacenik.But Biden’s biggest migraine would probably be at home. In the coming weeks, Trump is likely to make a lot of Biden’s “socialist” agenda – the hundreds of billions he has pledged to spend on everything from college education to rural broadband.Should Biden follow Obama’s example and pick Wall Street-friendly economic advisers, the left’s distrust would soon resurface. Last week, Lawrence Summers, Obama’s chief economic adviser and Bill Clinton’s Treasury secretary, ruled out joining a Biden administration. “My time in government is behind me,” he told the Aspen Security Forum.Happy passengerTo many people’s surprise, the left has largely fallen into line. Bernie Sanders dropped nearly all his most-cherished demands to agree a joint platform with Biden. This is in stark contrast to Sanders’s stand-offish – and simmeringly uneasy – ceasefire with Hillary Clinton in 2016.An estimated one-fifth of Sanders’s supporters in 2016 either sat on their hands or voted for Trump. Biden has not adopted a universal basic income, Medicare for all or a wealth tax – Sanders’s top three priorities.Yet the Vermont senator seems to be a happy passenger on Amtrak Joe’s train. Their policies may differ but their values are not miles apart. “Biden believes that his ultimate calling is to make life better for the middle class,” says Jared Bernstein, an economic adviser. “His watchword is ‘dignity.’” Ted Kaufman adds: “Biden and Bernie may disagree ideologically but they respect each other’s integrity.”Might such charms work on Republicans? I spoke to many people in Biden’s world and none thought the Republican leopard was likely to change its spots. One said: “Joe is still a romantic about the Senate. He will have to learn the hard way.”The omens for old-fashioned Biden-style bipartisanship are not cheerful. Yet there is an improbability to Biden’s odyssey that should give anyone pause. The lyrics may be corny. The music is not. It is an odd mix of Shakespearean tragedy and Shakespearean comedy.I have heard people describe Biden as the embodiment of America’s can-do spirit. Shailagh Murray called him a “spiritual optimist”. A campaign official talked of his “strategic empathy”. I have also heard people call Biden a “clown”, including a former Obama official.Biden loves to talk of when “the man meets the moment”. The joke is that he has said this about himself every time he has run for office. There has never been a moment where Biden does not think he should be residing in the White House.But like a stopped clock, perhaps this time he is right. “Life is about choices, right?” says a former senior CIA official who has interacted with Biden over more than three decades. “Biden or Trump?” He admitted that he occasionally saw Biden as a “mediocre” politician. But he added that Biden always struck him as fundamentally decent, which sounds like a subversive quality in today’s Washington.“Even if you thought that Biden was mediocre,” he continued, “you would take mediocre over catastrophic every time.”– Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2020Full coverage of the US presidential election 2020Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"exclusive brexit 50p coins now collectors item","story":"Where have all the Brexit 50p coins gone? It has been a question asked for months by many Leaver voters who wanted a piece of history in their wallets.Royal Mint has now produced 10 million of the coins, of which seven million have entered circulation. Yet they appear to be hard to come by in shops and restaurants.Now, the Royal Mint thinks it might have that answer, saying it believes that they are dropping out of circulation because they are some of the most coveted by collectors who are looking after them at home as a keepsake.There are 1.2 billion 50p coins in circulation and many different designs are produced annually which means Royal Mint is unable to keep track of the popularity of each one.Yet judging by the sales of the commemorative versions of the Brexit 50p – some selling for more than £1,000 – they are proving to be incredibly popular.Royal Mint said that more than 50,000 of the coins – including 3,000 gold coins worth more £1,000 each, and 47,000 solid silver Brexit 50p coins worth £60 each – have all sold out.A spokesman for Royal Mint said: The coins are in circulation. However, we anticipated that they would become some of the most coveted by collectors.Due to the historical significance of the UK’s decision to leave the EU, we believe many people who encounter a ‘Brexit’ 50p will add it to their existing coin collection, or retain it as a keepsake in their family.Craig Mackinlay, a Conservative MP who first proposed the idea of a 50p coin to mark the UK\u0027s exit from the EU to the Treasury, said: I have never seen one.He added that the Royal Mint should produce more of the coins.Royal Mint said that, for now, it is not planning to produce any more. A spokesman sad: The actual demand for coins issued into circulation is determined by UK banks and Post Offices.We then respond by issuing coins on behalf of HM Treasury who decide how many new coins should be issued into circulation.In the event that more stocks of UK coins are required to meet demand, we would seek approval to produce more. However, at the moment there is enough supply of fifty pence pieces. The Brexit 50p coin – stamped with the legend Peace, Prosperity and Friendship with all nations – was issued at the end of January, the fourth special 50p piece struck to mark the UK\u0027s 45 year membership of the EU and European Economic Community.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"parisian smokers demand exception city introduces compulsory","story":"Parisians grudgingly accepted a new citywide rule that face masks must be worn outdoors from Friday amid confusion over whether they are allowed to remove them while smoking.Police patrolled the streets on bicycles, stopping pedestrians who defied the regulation, prompted by a relentless rise in Covid-19 infections this week. Denmark became the latest country to advise against all but essential travel to the French capital, after the UK, Germany Belgium and the Netherlands.Cigarette-loving Parisians demanded the right to light up outdoors after cyclists and joggers were exempted from wearing masks. Anne Souyris, an assistant mayor in charge of health, rebuffed the request. “It is forbidden to smoke in the street without a mask so smokers will have to find another solution.”But Emmanuel Grégoire, the deputy mayor, contradicted her: “Smoking and eating in public are allowed.”A senior police source said officers would “use their common sense. We aren’t going to have an exhaustive list of every situation in which you don’t have to wear a mask, but people sitting on benches or smoking in public areas shouldn’t be fined.” Few people failed to wear masks in central Paris. Sarah, a 25-year-old student strolling along the Rue de Bretagne with a friend, told the : “We aren’t wearing them because there aren’t many people around at the moment.”Her companion, Clara, 23, said: “We do agree with the rule that you have to wear them. It’s for everyone’s health. It’s just that we’re only out for 10 minutes.”Masks became compulsory earlier this month in Nice, Bordeaux, Marseille and Toulouse. An average of 700 people a day are being fined €135 (£120) for failing to wear them.Michèle, 51, a shop owner, said: “This really isn’t much to ask of people. I agree that we must wear masks.”But Martin Blachier, a doctor and head of the consultancy Public Health Expertise, argued that the measure would not stem the spread of the virus.“It’s not scientifically justified because we know the big risk is indoors, not outdoors. This could be counter-productive as people might wear masks outdoors because they don’t want to be fined, and then take them off indoors where the police are less likely to see them.”Masks are compulsory in indoor public spaces throughout France. They will be required in most shared workplaces such as open-plan offices and factories from Tuesday. Teachers and schoolchildren from the age of 11 will also be required to wear them.Despite the increase in cases, the number of Covid-19 patients in French hospitals fell by 65 this week to 4,535. Doctors suggested this was probably because most people catching the virus are under-40 and have few or no symptoms. Those in intensive care fell by 29 to 381.Éric Caume, head of the infectious diseases department at Paris’s largest public hospital, La Pitié-Salpêtrière, said: “Anxiety is being blown up out of proportion to the health situation.” But he cautioned that another lockdown might be necessary if the spread of Covid-19 is not halted.Michèle Rubirola, the Green mayor of Marseille, and Samia Ghali, the local senator, complained that the government had failed to consult local leaders before introducing the face-mask rule in France’s second city. They said additional police were needed to enforce it.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"watch race has become new fault line us politics","story":"Over the course of the last few months the US has seen unprecedented Black Lives Matter protests, placing the subject of race relations squarely at the front and centre of the US election 2020. Polling shows that whilst there was widespread support for the BLM movement following the death of George Floyd, concerns for the restoration of law and order are growing.

skipping meals and fatigue are really important, as are headaches.Prof Spector said there are currently no clear dferences between children in primary school and high school, adding: We did also pick up skin rashes as quite a common feature in children and they can be as young as babies as well.And these rashes can come before any other symptoms, or they can come after other symptoms and that’s increasingly a sign in kids that can’t tell their parents what’s going on.While parents also need to remain vigilant for the virus and other illnesses, experts have also reminded many not to forget the usual issues school children might face, such as contracting head lice.Many kids would have managed to avoid catching lice while being at home, but this doesnt mean the pests are gone for good.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Usually there is at least a soloist,not a full choir leading the audience, but of course this year the public seats in the hall will be empty because of the virus, and the voices on stage silenced.Now, the lyrics of both songs are pro-colonial. If you ban them from the Last Night of the Proms, ending a tradition going back decades, what consequences will that have Certainly, someone  years from now will say we shouldn’t have done that.It is the same argument for not taking down statues. If you remove statues because that person stands for something evil in their past, you are removing the deed too.Manipulating history only adds to mistrust among the black community.I would like to see the survey that says the public want these two songs taken out of the Proms programme, because it appears to me that the public hasn’t been consulted.Rule, Britannia! was written by Scottish poet James Thomson and he features on the famous Scott Monument in Edinburgh, near where I live.He is also commemorated in Westminster Abbey’s Poets’ Corner, next to William Shakespeare.If we say we must remove his words from the Proms, do we then remove the memorials too Rule, Britannia!, written and set to music in , was mentioned in James Joyce’s novel, Ulysses. It is part of my history and my culture. If we take it away, we take away part of my culture.It’s a song about the power structure at the time, and the arrogance and hypocrisy of Britain vowing to “never be slaves” while at the same time owning and benefiting from about , black chattel slaves in the West Indies who were called ‘property’.Of course, people are sensitive to its meaning, as well as Land Of Hope And Glory, the music of which was written by Edward Elgar.It doesn’t mean we should hide it.I personally don’t find the lyrics offensive because they are a true representation of the terrible truth at the time.If you take that away, then you are replacing history with a fairy story.There is also the possibility that it was written to show the evil of the time, rather than glorying it.The objection is that Rule, Britannia! is used by flag-waving “prommers” as a jubilant finale at the Proms.It is used in the wrong context, and that is part of the ignorance of our society of our history.It’s the same with Amazing Grace, which was written by a slaver of black people and is sung as a religious anthem.Recently, it was proposed that we should ban Swing Low, Sweet Chariot at rugby matches due to its link to slavery. That came to nothing.Instead of banning such songs or stripping away their lyrics, we need to educate people on the history of slavery, starting with putting it on the history curriculum.From speaking to people about slavery, the one constant reaction is always: “Why didn’t anyone tell us this before ”At the Proms, instead of taking the words away, we should put an explanation in the programme. We should tell people it’s about enslaving black people, making money from them, giving them a short le span and then compensating the slave owners when it was abolished because slaves were regarded as ‘property’.If they want to sing it after reading that, then fine, go ahead and sing it. But I bet they won’t sing it as joyfully as they might have done before.When I worked in research, I once had a lovely technician who worked for me. She looked after me so well, and she went to the Proms.If she knew the history of those two songs, being my friend, I doubt she would have sung along.It wasn’t her fault that she didn’t know the history.Those songs didn’t have a place in the Proms in the first place, they are there because of people’s ignorance. I would challenge anyone to know their meanings and still sing them in a frivolous capacity.But we shouldn’t be bothering ourselves about whether those songs should now be removed.What we should be bothering ourselves about is increasing the representation of black people who are the descendants of slaves. We should be concerning ourselves about making sure black people from the Windrush generation get compensation. And we should also be ensuring ourselves that every child is taught the history of slavery so that they can make their own minds up about whether to sing songs like these.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

At last, after an unprecedented lockdown of six months, all schools are due to re-open, representing a giant leap back towards normality. But the damage caused by the Coronavirus disruption has been severe.Many parents have been prevented from ing to work. Young people’s education has been badly undermined, especially because the quality of online learning has been so uneven. One study found that a fth of pupils had less than an hour’s instruction a day. Moreover, social activities and friendships – which are a vital part of growing up – have been heavily restricted.The exam chaos over the last fortnight was a fitting symbol of the vacuum created by the absence of proper schooling. No advanced society canwhen a vital sector like education is temporarily paralysed. That is why it is so important that the Government succeeds in its goal of seeing a fullto the classroom. As Boris Johnson put it at the weekend, “it is vital for pupils’ education. It is vital for their welfare. It’s vital for their physical and, indeed, mental well-being.”Given the Government’s mixed record on its management of the Covid crisis, this will be a big test. From the inadequate supply of protective gear to the botched imposition of quarantine rules, Ministers have got it badly wrong at times. They cannot afford another fiasco next week.But to do that, they will have to curtail the influence of militant teaching unions, which thrive in a climate of scare-mongering and grievance. Full of negativity, these hardened left-wing operators turn every pebble of dficulty into a giant boulder of obstruction. They are the abominable no men and women, the ultimate “can’t do” brigade.To overcome the unions’ capacity for trouble-making, reassurances about safety will be absolutely crucial. Most teachers are keen to go back to work, but they want to know schools will not be dangerous environments. That is why the recent upbeat advice from medical experts has been so welcome. It is clear from the Covid experience around the world that not only are children less likely to transmit the disease than any other group, but also that schools are safer than most other workplaces. Yesterday, the Deputy Chief Medical Officer Jenny Harries pointed out that a child is more likely to be involved in a traffic accident or die from flu than to be harmed by Coronavirus.That message was also spelt out by her boss Chris Whitty, who said on Sunday that the damage to health caused by a continued schools lockdown is potentially greater than the impact of Covid. “The balance of risk is very strongly in favour of children going to school,” he declared, adding the chances of catching the disease “are incredibly small.” In fact, there is now hard evidence to prove this. Although the vast majority of schools were closed since March, over one million pupils – such as the children of essential workers – went back to the classroom in June. Yet a comprehensive study by Public Health England showed that in the subsequent weeks until the end of term, just  children and  staff tested positive for Covid- – and nearly all these infections occurred outside the school. There were hardly any cases of children passing on the disease to each other, or to their teachers. Other research from around the world has come to the same conclusion.But none of this seems to matter to the teaching unions, eager to exploit anxiety in pursuit of their anti-Tory agenda. These are the organisations which for decades have blocked every major reform of the education system and have defended every outdated working practice. With depressing inevitability, they have continually put their own narrow interests before the wider needs of pupils. They want the respect due to trained professionals but they frequently display the rebellious spirit of the permanent agitators. “Strike action is a very powerful tool,” said Amanda Martin, the President of the ,-strong National Education Unionin an interview with the Communist Morning Star newspaper in , adding, “I’ve run demos and rallies and worked with trade councils to bring everyone out and that’s brilliant.”Led by the NEU, the unions have brought the same attitude to the Coronavirus crisis. Instead of looking for solutions, they have endlessly exaggerated problems. One Whitehall insider says of Dr Mary Bousted, the £,-a-year joint general secretary of the NEU, “it’s all about the union, to hell with the teachers who want to get back into the classroom – let alone the children.” A left-wing radical, Bousted jokes that the word “strike” was one of the first she learnt as a child. Hers is not the voice of co-operation and enterprise, so it is hardly surprising that the Government has struggled to get schools reopened.In June, a planned majorwas thwarted by the unions, dealing a severe blow to Gavin Williamson’s credibility. One left-wing website gushed that the continued shutdown was due “to the hard work of NEU branch secretaries and rank and file militants galvanising the members.” In the months since, an alliance of unions – including Bousted’s NEU and Unite led by the notorious Merseyside militant Len McCluskey – have fought a y battle against a swt re-opening. Central to this effort at sabotage was a vast -point checklist of detailed questions which the Department for Education was told it had to answer. Dubbed by critics “a wreckers’ charter”, the list included queries such as “will lidded bins with double bagging be available in every classroom”, “will dedicated space be available for any breastfeeding women to express milk” and “has behaviour policy been reviewed to acknowledge the increased level of trauma and anxiety experienced by pupils ” Some Tories complained that the union was playing politics. Robert Halfon, the chairman of the Education Select Committee was amazed at the warped priorities: “It is incredible that not one of these nit-picking questions asks the most important thing of all – what’s best for the kids ”Even as September approaches, the whining and resistance has not ceased. “The unions need to stand firm and protect their members,” argues socialist teacher Martin Powell-Davies. In the latest ruse, the public sector outfit UNISON not only wants its members to wear masks in the classroom – something for which there is no scientic evidence of any need – but also to have extra funding for deep cleaning. “Schools need more money to pay for specially trained cleaners, rather than relying on other staff who are busy enough already,” says Jon Richards, UNISON’s head of education. The moan about over-stretched budgets is a favourite of the union movement but it is an empty accusation. The Government is pouring an extra £. billion into education, while this summer it was announced that teachers’ pay is to go up by an average of . per cent, a bigger increase than any other public sector workers received.But that did nothing to stop the combination of whingeing and shroud-waving. The mentality of the hardliners was embodied in a recent statement from the NEU’s far left “Education Solidarity Network” which set out a series of demands to “make sure safety comes first.” Among them were: “smaller class sizes to allow adequate physical distancing” arrangements “for rotas and home learning to be produced in consultation with parents” “local risk assessments to include staggered outdoor breaks, sanitising, provision of transparent coverings to enable access to lip reading and facial expression” and “weekly onsite testing of staff”. Above all, the Network called for extra funding “to implement these measures.” If there were any question of a risk to safety, the union should “prepare for a national strike ballot.”That was so typical. This lot seem to feel more comfortable on the picket line than in the classroom. The Solidary Network might be seen as extreme, but its carping outlook runs right through the unionYesterday, the NEU’s joint general secretary was bleating on the airwaves about the risks of new Covid spikes: “Staff, parents and pupils are being sorely let down by the government because of a lack of a Plan B and of ensuring robust track and trace is in place throughout the country.

Pictured is, apparently, a pair of “size ” jeans from online giant Asosin front of my old size sI couldn’t get them up one leg and, quite frankly, Kate Moss would struggle too. So they’re going back.Then a beguiling ad for summer dresses popped up on my Instagram account and I clicked through to a site called “Cinderear” showing a wide range of very pretty frocks on tanned and shapely models.I ordered what was described as a “Printed Folding Holiday Swing Dress” in what looked like an airy cotton, cinched in at the waist with a brown leather belt. The colour was described as apricot.What arrived — several weeks later — was a beyond-hideous sartorial aberration that was “Made in China” , out of a paper-thin polyester that would make me think twice about standing near a naked flame.What’s more, the colour was more camel and blue than “apricot”, it swamped me, and the brown belt in the photo was nowhere to be seen.It cost me  — approx £ — and the s policy is so ­unintelligible that it’s not worth the bother.

It was am on a Monday morning and virtually empty.Little wonder when the ­government guidance says retailers must “discourage customers from handling products while browsing, and keep fitting rooms closed”.One store let me try on a dress then sanitised the cubicle afterwards, another told me thatI tried something on they would have to then take it off display for  hours.In LK Bennett, the fitting rooms were closed and I askedI could try on a blouse over my clothes, just to seeit actually fits. No, they said, you have to buy the item, take it home to try it on, then bring it backit doesn’t fit. Needless to say, I ed home empty-handed.So,our High Street clothes shops are to survive the pandemic, two things need to happen.Unless classed as vulnerable, those of us who actually enjoy clothes ­shopping need to get back out there as soon as possible and actively support them. And the Government needs to relax its strict rules and let retailers and shoppers take inidual responsibility for what happens in store.If I have to wear a mask and gloves to try on a pair of jeans in a cubicle, then I’m happy to do so.

I cannot remember any government being so devoid of direction, leadership, policy, conviction and — frankly — intelligence.And I had to endure Ted Heath AND John Major’s attempts to run the country. Oh, and the shaft of glorious sunshine that was Gordon Brown. Those guys have nothing on Boris. He is the clear leader in the field. If you ever wanted to know what a country would look likeit was led by Frank Spencer, here you go. Yes, I know — I’m showing my age. To be honest, under this administration I’m feeling my age.For those who don’t remember, Frank was a bumbling, dithering, halfwit from the s sitcom Some Mothers Do ’Ave ’Em. The only dference with Bojo is that Frank was thinner. And, mercully, a fictional creation. Boris is all too real. Many kids will be going back to school wearing face masks. For ages, this government insisted that they would not have to do so. Now they’ve changed their minds. Face masks and grouped in “bubbles”. Probably getting only about half of their usual education,that. Any kid who coughs will be pounced upon, exiled to the Outer Hebrides and the entire school shuts down. Never mind that there has been no recorded case of a schoolkid passing on the virus to a teacher.Never mind that our economy needs the schools fully open with a proper, normal, timetable, so people can get back to work.After six months of no lessons , the kids now have to endure insufferable conditions at school.This is because Boris and the rest have proved utterly incapable of standing up to the teaching unions .Other U-turns have involved the wearing of masks in shops, the usefulness of masks in general, whether there’s any point in closing our borders, the schools due to re-open in June, the scrapping of an expensive track and trace system, the re-grading of GCSEs and A levels . . . oh lordy, the list goes on and on.Sometimes the U-turn appears only a day after the original decision.Sometimes we have to wait a week or so. But come they surely do, a long parade of staggering ineptitude. In fact, I think even Frank Spencer would have been more decisive. Maybe the right comparison is with Benny from Crossroads. Yes, it’s my age again. For those who don’t know, Benny was a cast-iron moron.We know that dealing with this horrible pandemic can’t have been easy. We know Boris has had a dficult year.But the utter lack of planning and resolve has been astonishing. Slow to take the virus seriously, bizarrely refusing to close our airports at the peak of the outbreak, hopelessly lost over track and trace and what do with our poor kids.This has been mismanagement on an almost heroic level. My guess is that Boris will not survive as Prime Minister: His party will get shot of him when the opportunity arises. Because here’s the crucial, damaging question.Could Jeremy Corbyn have handled this crisis any worse I DON’T think those smug monkeys at the BBC realised the fury they would unleash when they banned singing our favourite anthems at The Last Night Of The Proms.A petition reached , names in just  hours.And Dame Vera Lynn is suddenly at No in the iTunes chart with Land Of Hope And Glory.The BBC apparently agreed with the Finnish conductor, Dalia Stasevska, that the “jingoistic” words of Land Of Hope And Glory and Rule Britannia would not be heard this year.I wonder what convinced Ms Stasevska to agree to conduct an evening of patriotic songs when she hates patriotic songs Money, you would guess. Meanwhile another BBC bureaucrat, Cat Lewis, likened singing the songs to Nazis singing about gas chambers.Silly woman. The BBC – its entire staff – has no understanding of the British people. It despises them. Support for the corporation is at an all-time low.

As a result, very few people watch it — but it’s the toast of Beeb journos and left-wing social media, giving it undeserved influence over our daily news agenda.Despite her dressing-down over that outrageous Dominic Cummings monologue, Emily Maitlis is considered untouchable by executives. No one dares warn her that constant unbalanced questioning of Tory politicians and right-wing commentators is putting the very future of the Beeb under threat.And then there’s Lewis Goodall, the left-wing operative turned Newsnight policy editor who last week was allowed to author a feature for the New Statesman magazine headlined: “Failed.

Harry and Meghan later sent a personal note of “great thanks” to Jeremy and Laura, writing: “Cruz is a fascinating historical figure, and we look forward to learning more about her le and works. Thanks for the support.”That revelation came one day after Meghan made her first intervention into this year’s US election, with a not-at-all-subtle anti-Trump message to American voters, suggesting: “We all know what’s at stake this year”.I have long been told by those close to her that Meghan harbours political ambitions and would one day like to end up in elected office.Which is absolutely fine.But to continue to use the Duchess title and represent the Queen on the Commonwealth Trust is highly inappropriate.I’d have great respectshe would cut the cords entirely and become a political activistwithout causing a massive diplomatic headache for the Royal Family.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Meanwhile, the germs usually responsible for worsening attacks of bronchitis, pneumonia or chronic lung disease can cause symptoms similar to Covid-, making accurate diagnosis and correct treatment much more dficult.But there is no need for people to panic.Admissions to hospital and mortality related to Covid- are declining.There were only  admissions on Wednesday, while just  new Covid deaths were reported yesterday.That compares to around  or more deaths per day during the peak of the pandemic, at the end of April.Testing is also improving. More than , tests were processed yesterday and it is vital that testing and tracing continues.There is no room at all for complacency.Test-and-trace will tell us exactly what it is that we are dealing with.But it is now more important than ever to know the dferences between the ious winter infections that might come our way. It is easy to panic, thinking we might have coronavirus when it is merely a cold.Equally, we could easily miss the chance of early treatment for Covid-we ignore its earliest symptoms.Millions of people will suffer this winter from sore throats, norovirus, influenza sinusitis, ear infections, allergies, conjunctivitis, ­­migraines, whooping cough and pneumonia.The Government tells us to stay alert. So how can we help ourselves to see the wood from the trees It is always good to bear in mind the possibility of coronavirus but the symptom checklist below can help to provide you with a dferential diagnosis, as doctors call it, to pinpoint your problem.Prevention is always better than cure and the good news is that all the measures we ought to be taking to protect ourselves from coronavirus should also help reduce the risk of these winter bugs.Frequent hand-washing, wearing of masks, social distancing and cleaning hard surfaces with bleach will all help keep us healthier. Another of the most ­important things you can do, as winter approaches, is to book your flu jab.If we protect the most vulnerable people in society by making them immune to seasonal flu, we can protect all the others with whom they come into contact.That is why this winter the Government aims to immunise up to  million people — twice as many as usual. It could make a huge dference.Take-up of flu vaccinations has dropped in the past five years and that needs to change.The jab is being offered to everybody aged  and over, pregnant women, children, anyone with a pre-existing medical condition, those who live with somebody who has been shielding, carers and care-home residents and, of course, frontline health and social-care workers.The most vulnerable should be prioritised.But hopefully, the huge focus on Covid- in the first half of this year will have turned everybody into mini-microbiologists — with better understanding of the ­importance of hygiene and how germs are spread.This knowledge should serve us well as winter approaches.COVID-Fatigue: None to severeFever: Moderate to highChills, shaking: PossibleAching muscles, joints: UnlikelyRunny, stuffy nose: PossibleFacial pain, headache: YesSore throat: PossibleCough: Severe, persistentNausea, vomiting, diarrhoea: More likely in childrenLoss of taste or smell: OftenNeck stfness: NoShortness of breath: SevereWheezing: UnusualBut Covid- can be symptomless.COMMON COLDFatigue: SlightFever: NoChills, shaking: NoAching muscles, joints: NoRunny, stuffy nose: YesFacial pain, headache: YesSore throat: YesCough: YesNausea, vomiting, diarrhoea: NoLoss of taste or smell: PossibleNeck stfness: NoShortness of breath: NoWheezing: NoFLUFatigue: SevereFever: Moderate to highChills, shaking: YesAching muscles, joints: SevereRunny, stuffy nose: YesFacial pain, headache: YesSore throat: YesCough: Dry, hackingNausea, vomiting, diarrhoea: NoLoss of taste or smell: PossibleNeck stfness: NoShortness of breath: PossibleWheezing: PossibleSINUSITISFatigue: NoneFever: UnusualChills, shaking: NoAching muscles, joints: NoRunny, stuffy nose: YesFacial pain, headache: YesSore throat: NoCough: NoNausea, vomiting, diarrhoea: NoLoss of taste or smell: PossibleNeck stfness: NoShortness of breath: NoWheezing: NoBRONCHITIS PNEUMONIAFatigue: YesFever: YesChills, shaking: YesAching muscles and joints: NoRunny, stuffy nose: UnusualFacial pain, headache: YesSore throat: NoCough: YesNausea, vomiting, diarrhoea: UnusualLoss of taste or smell: PossibleNeck stfness: NoShortness of breath: YesWheezing: PossibleMENINGITISFatigue: Yesever: YesChills: YesAching muscles and joints: YesRunny, stuffy nose: NoFacial pain, headache: YesSore throat: NoCough: NoNausea, vomiting, diarrhoea: PossibleLoss of taste or smell: NoNeck stfness: YesShortness of breath: NoWheezing: NoNOROVIRUSFatigue: YesFever: MildChills: NoAching muscles and joints: SometimesRunny, stuffy nose: NoFacial pain, headache: YesSore throat: NoCough: NoNausea, vomiting, diarrhoea: SevereLoss of taste or smell: NoNeck stfness: NoShortness of breath: NoWheezing: NoASTHMAFatigue: NoFever: NoChills: NoAching muscles and joints: NoRunny, stuffy nose: PossibleFacial pain, headache: NoSore throat: PossibleCough: Dry coughNausea, vomiting, diarrhoea: NoLoss of taste or smell: NoNeck stfness: NoShortness of breath: YesWheezing: YesGOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The professional fundraiser said: It was the first time in my adult le that I was discriminated against for being a woman, adding she felt insulted and humiliated.Gender segregation is not uncommon in many ultra-Orthodox Jewish communities, with men and women praying, travelling, living and even attending weddings and religious ceremonies separately. Orthodox Judaism, largely ruled by the Torah - a kind of Jewish scripture - rules men should devote their le to its study, and its believed in some circles women can be a distraction from this. The religion also values modesty and does not encourage the mixing of men and women who are unmarried, with devotees encouraged to only spend time with those of the opposite sex that they are married or directly related to.The first incident happened on a flight from Ben Gurion airport to London last October, with Melanie having paid extra for an aisle seat on that flight, according to the lawsuit.She said when she boarded the plane, an older Orthodox man and his son were sat in the row she had been placed in, who asked her to move. Melanie told Haaretz : I would not have had any problem whatsoever switching seatsit were to allow members of a family or friends to sit together, but the fact that I was being asked to do this because I was a woman was why I refused.She said she was further infuriated by nearby passengers who failed to step in and defend her. A flight attendant then intervened, offering Melanie a free hot drink as incentive to swap seats.The -year-old said she felt like she had no choice but to move, fearing further argument could delay the flight.Around a month later Melanie lodged a complaint with easyJet citing gender discrimination, but never heard back.Eight weeks later on another flight to London she was again asked by two Orthodox Jewish male passengers to switch seats so they didnt have to sit next to a woman.Melanie again refused the request but two female passengers stepped in and offered to swap seats with the men and sit next to Melanie.She said this time cabin crew did not intervene, but again offered her a free hot drink.Now Melanie is claiming claiming , shekels compensation from theairline in a lawsuit filed on her behalf by the Israel Religious Action Center .Lawyers will say although easyJet is a British airline, they were subject to Israeli law while grounded at the Tel Aviv airport - which prohibits discrimination against customers on the basis of race, religion, nationality, land of origin, gender, sexual orientation, political views or personal status.In a statement a spokesperson for easyJet said: We take claims of this nature very seriously. Whilst it would be inappropriate to comment, as this matter is currently the subject of legal proceedings, we do not discriminate on any grounds.Back in , the IRAC won a landmark case against Israeli El Al airlines after Renee Rabinowitz was pressured to move seats when two Orthodox men refused to sit next to her. Ms Rabinowitz, a Holocaust survivor and lawyer in her eighties won , shekelsin compensation.The judge said: Under absolutely no circumstances can a crew member ask a passenger to move from their designated seat because the adjacent passenger doesnt want to sit next to them due to their gender.At the time, the IRAC said almost , emails of complaint had been made to El Al regarding Orthodox men requesting women move seats.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

There is also a signicant amount of iability across a region.Prof Keith Neal previously said that local Covid clusters can also push the R rate up for an entire region when it may just be one small area.The epidemiologist at the University of Nottingham said: “Making estimates of R with small number of cases becomes increasingly dficult and inaccurate.  Hence the wide range of the estimates.As a result, the Government began publishing the countrys growth rate - which reflects how quickly the number of infections are changing day-by-day.If the rate is greater than zero, then the epidemic is growing, butit is less than zero then it will shrink.The growth rate published today is from - per cent + per cent - meaning the epidemic is somewhere between growing and shrinking.A Government spokesperson said: A growth rate between - per cent and + per cent means the number of new infections is somewhere between shrinking by two per cent and growing by one per cent every day.The UK estimates of R and growth rate are averages over very dferent epidemiological situations and should be regarded as a guide to the general trend rather than a description of the epidemic state.They added: We have been seeing indications that these values may be increasing, with estimated ranges increasing slightly from previous publications. Recent changes in transmission are not yet fully reflected in these estimates because the data used to calculate R and growth rate reflect the situation from a few weeks ago. It is also important to recognise that these are estimates, and there is a high degree of uncertainty with them.Pointing to a time delay in gathering data on the R rate, they continued: For this reason, Sage does not have confidence that R is currently below  in England. We would expect to see this change in transmission reflected in the R and growth rate published over the next few weeks as we gain more certainty of what is currently happening.But experts warn that the data suggests the epidemic is growing and warn that the situation is very delicate.Dr Yuliya Kyrychko, a mathematician at the University of Sussex, said: “Latest estimates of the R number combined with growing number of new infections over the last several days suggest that the number of infections was and is continuing to grow across England. This makes the current situation very delicate, especially with opening of schools next week because increased social interactions and contacts associated with schools should be carefully balanced by the reduction of contacts wherepossible to avoid a signicant growth in new infections.“The increase in positive cases in Pillar  testing and low death rates suggest that majority of cases are not causing major health crisis at the moment, but this means that only a very robust and efficient track-and-trace program would stop this from reaching more vulnerable groups and becoming a larger and deadlier outbreak.” Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The local officials should do something. She needs medical attention.Seeing her like that was heartbreaking.Jedah is now coordinating with the government officials in the area to improve the condition of the woman and has asked her own friends to find help for Manol.The WHOs report says it was natural catastrophes like the  tsunami in Sri Lanka and Indonesia, and the  typhoon in the Philippines which provided the catalyst for decentralizing mental health care to the community level, where it was most needed.They add that in the last  years the mental health care in these countries has seen some of the biggest leaps forward as a result of the natural emergenices. However it appears in some remote areas, the practice is ongoing.In , one year after Typhoon Haiyan devastated the Philippines,published a short film exposing the practice. One interviewee, a disability campaigner, said following the  typhoon, the practice was opened up, describing how the mentally ill are left in the make-sht cages to rot to death.The campaigner describes the story of Ben, a mentally ill man who was shackled for  years by his own family, he said.He said Bens family left him to die in the typhoon.Locals describe how a lack of funds prevented them from accessing costly psychiatric treatment - but its also down to stigma around mental health issues, says .But now ious organisations, including the WHO are pushing for the government to channel funding into mental health up, with an improvement in recent years.In  the WHO published a report stating: In many countries in the world, ignorance about mental health and mental illness remains widespread. The uptake of mental health care during conflict and other emergencies, in countries where such support has been limited, can lead to the identication of people who are tied up, locked in cages, hidden from society.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But the Nottinghamshire restaurant hit back, accusing the family of reducing staff members to tears, being sick everywhere, damaging light fittings and smearing birthday cake over a table.In the review, Jo wrote: [They] didnt mind taking the £ though, I have never been spoken to in such a way. Maybe they should be open to reviews and yes our family member was sick and YES WE CLEANED IT UP - so no members of staff were affected by this.Maybe a course for your staff in customer service wouldnt go amiss - rude staff huffing and puffing because they had a large round to bring out!The Cowshed, which has a five star rating on TripAdvisor shared their version of events from the night on Facebook by saying: Hi Jo, thanks for reaching out!We love feedback, whether it be positive or negative, we especially love feedback like this so others can see the type of people we have to deal with sometimes.They began by addressing the amount of money Jo claimed the family had spent. The Cowshed team wrote: Our most expensive pizza on the menu is £., this means thatyou ordered only pizzas, youd have to order  of them to be even close to spending £. You didnt order  pizzas, Jo.But lets talk drinks... the most expensive drink we sell is a double gin  mixer at £., this means youd have to order  of these to be even close to spending £. You didnt order  double gin  mixers. So lets split the dference, seeing as you had spent the £ on both pizzas and drinks... you and your party would have to have ordered  of our most expensive pizzas and  of our most expensive drinks to have spent £ at our bar. You ordered nowhere near this, Jo... not even close.Laden with sarcasm, the owner went on to pull Jo up on her memory and maths, claiming that staff went over receipts and CCTV - revealing that the group had actually spent £.In the blazing response, the author of the Facebook post held Jo accountable for the partys behaviour towards staff and fellow diners. With the ironic exception of the young adults that were in your group and one or two others, you all acted like belligerent, entitled little toddlers from the moment you walked through our gates. We allowed members of your party to bring in food from other venues to circumvent their food allergies. We cleaned up all the smashed pint glasses you broke and birthday cake you dropped and smeared all over our tables  benches, and tolerated the many loud family rows you were having with each other.Rather than treat our staff like human beings that are just trying to earn a wage, you decided to treat them like your own personal servants, clicking your fingers, shouting, swearing and barking your orders at them, to the point one was almost in tears and refused to deal with you any more.You were the loudest, most obnoxious group in the whole bar, just being a nuisance in general and other customers were starting to complain about you at this point. Then, for your partys grand finale, the gentleman in the blue shirt headed into our bar from outside and decided to vomit everywhere but the toilet. Our staff stepped into to help, but you demanded to deal with the situation and rather than clean up the mess, proceeded to smear it over an even wider area with our mop, whilst... once again, being loud, rude, sticking your hand in our staffs faces and shouting over anybody who was trying to communicate with you or help.The restaurant explained that this is why they choose not to have the review comments turned on on their page - because it only gives one side of the story. They also corrected Jo on her accusations that she was barred. The post was closed with the Cowshed making it clear that there will be no more comments or responding on the thread to avoid keyboard warriors getting involved.The pub was inundated with praise from Facebook followers for their brave and brutal response. One person wrote I really want to visit Cowshed now! Never heard of the place before and already have so much respect for the staff there! Another said: Congratulations Cowshed, you have won the internet today!Somebody who works in hospitality wrote: Coming from a hospitality background having worked in many pubs and restaurants reviews like this can be so damaging and most of timeextremely untrue and made up!

Unless Frost unblocks this it is hard to see how a deal can be saved. We really are on the brink this time.If Britain leaves without a deal at the end of the year, it will be on World Trade Organisation terms with lesser access to the EUs single market.There could be disruption on both sides of the Channel and tarfs slapped on goods, a leaked document given to The Sun has shown.Government insiders fear a second wave and No Deal Brexit would cause chaos for the country this winter.Meanwhile Trade Secretary Liz Truss is said to be on the verge of signing a landmark first post-Brexit deal with Japan.Talks are also underway with the US, Australia and New Zealand.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Its certainly what weve seen so far and I very much think that will carry on next week as people do start tomore often to the office.And the mental health of people stuck working in cramped homes was also a major factor to play, he added.But the Government faces an uphill battle to get everyone in.A new report from Cardf University and the University of Southampton, said  per cent of employees who worked at home during lockdown would like to continue doing so in some capacity, with  per cent wanting to do so often or all the time.And Mr Shapps was left red-faced today when pushing the Governments back to work message - he was working at home.LBCs Nick Ferrari called him out saying: Im in my office in central London and youre in your study  I am back to work, Secretary of State, you are not.Meanwhile, Government ministers and insiders have warned privately that not going back in could risk peoples jobs.One Government source told The Daily : “People need to understand that working from home is not the benign option it seems. We need workers to be alert to what decisions their bosses may take in the weeks ahead. If they are only seeing workers once a fortnight then that could prove problematic for some employees in the future.“We want employees to be careful what working arrangements they accept.

She wanted to earn pounds, which actually mean something. She went to Britain seeking greener pastures.” But the mum had fallen into dire straits by the time she died. Barred from working, penniless Mercy is feared to have lain dead for up to three days before neighbours alerted cops to her tot’s screams on Saturday.Her grief-stricken family in Uganda are trying to have her body flown back so they can hold her funeral.Ms Byaruhanga added: “The focus for [her family] is to bring Mercy’s body back here to Uganda for burial.“This is a grieving family going through a heartbreaking situation with their daughter and sister thousands of miles away.”Mercy’s father is believed to be a Ugandan politician. Her brother Eric is reportedly standing for parliament in upcoming elections next year.The news comes as the Scottish Refugee Council warned similar tragedies could happen. Chief executive Sabir Zazai said loneliness, a lack of cash, and being unable to work has created a “recipe for disaster” for asylum seekers.He said: “Mercy’s death is an unspeakable tragedy — it was completely avoidable.  “Le is very tough in the asylum system. Almost everyone in the system is on the breadline and some people are being left homeless and destitute.“Not being able to support yourself, being isolated from friends and family, exclusion from society and your mental health not being taken seriously is a perfect storm.“We have concerns that unless the approach to accommodating asylum seekers is changed, we’ll see further tragedies.”Nicola Sturgeon has also told of her anger and sorrow at Mercy’s death as she branded the UK’s asylum system “broken” and “inhumane”.Mercy’s son was rushed to hospital following the grim discovery by cops on Saturday but was released on Monday.He is now being cared for by his dad, who lives where in Glasgow and is also seeking asylum.Police Scotland said Mercy’s death was “unexplained but not suspicious”.The Home Office added that officials are now conducting a “full investigation”. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The likes of Nigel Farage and Boris Johnson do. Or rather they exploit that myth for their own ends. Farage to whip up a rabid, right-wing following that has made him rich and famous, and Johnson to target a similar audience to win the Tory leadership.

Mass redundancies are being announced with grim regularity, and I fear we will see more unless the government urgently changes course. The furlough scheme, a leline during the coronavirus crisis for many, is now being withdrawn from all businesses, whatever their circumstance. That blanket approach completely ignores that some sectors and regions have been much harder hit than others. Since August, employers have been required to pay for the pension and national insurance contributions of their furloughed staff. And in just three days, from September , employers across the country will also be required to pay % of the salary of their furloughed employees. That rule applies to all businesses across the board. Whether your business is trading well, whether it’s slowly recovering but still struggling, or whether it cannot operate properly or at all due to local lockdown restrictions, the furlough leline is being pulled away, come what may. It’s clearly illogical and unfair to treat every business in this unorm way. * What do you think  Do you agree  Have your say in the comments below Hospitality, retail and key manufacturing industries have been particularly hard hit by job losses, with thousands already announced and more predicted by trade bodies. Some businesses, such as night clubs, are still totally locked down. They are rightly following the public-health measures and are therefore unable to bring in any income, yet are being asked to paythey want to protect their employees’ jobs. The government is also failing to recognise that its approach could mean making this country more unequal with parts of the UK still under local lockdowns, and some areas of the UK having more of the businesses that have been worst affected by the crisis. It would be far better to be targeting those sectors that really need the help than offering £, to every business next February for every worker they take back off furlough. That policy means an awful lot of money is being spent on workers who would have been rehired anyway in sectors that are recovering after lockdown. Germany and France have schemes in place enabling workers to be put on part-time working and have the rest of their wage subsidised. Extended support, targeted at key sectors, could work in a similar way. The government has said they cannot save every job, but in taking this rigid approach, they are washing their hands of every livelihood still under threat. Plan to care  There’s been a % rise in the number of children needing foster care during this pandemic, and Labour has called for a proper plan from government to ensure children moving into the care system can access the support they need. On this week’s episode of my podcast Reasons to be Cheerful, we talk with the poet and writer Lemn Sissay about My Name is Why – his powerful memoir about growing up in the care system. Lemn talks about his -year battle to access his records and why it was so important to tell his story. Zombie horror  Boris Johnson this week blamed the A-level exam fiasco on a “mutant algorithm”. It does make you wonder whether this government will ever take responsibility for anything. He’d previously said the results system was “robust” as did Education Secretary Gavin Williamson. Distress was caused to so many young people, and the government can’t even say the buck stops with them. It feels much more a case of a zombie government than a mutant algorithm to me. Grants clawback will hit jobs    High streets across the country have been hit hard by this pandemic. We’ve seen waves of job losses from household names like MS, WH Smith, Pizza Express, John Lewis and Boots. And while retail sales overall are rebounding, sales at department stores and clothing shops are still down on pre-pandemic levels. More than a billion remains unused of the Government’s business grants funds, with many thousands of firms having been locked out of support. But the Business Secretary wants local councils tothat money by the end of the month. That can’t be right when so many firms are still struggling. Labour has called for that underspend to be turned into a Hospitality and High Streets Fightback Fund, with restrictions eased so more businesses can access the funding they need. Clawing that money back rather than redeploying it flexibly means ministers risk accelerating the jobs crisis. We must do everything we can to protect our country’s vital city centres and prevent shuttered high streets. Time to invest in going green    Climate change is a massive long-term threat to the country. To tackle the threat means we will need to change the way we power our homes, move around our towns and cities, and use our land. This may sound daunting and it is, but there is also a chance to ensure that in tackling that threat we can create a better economy and quality of le for people. That’s what I am determined we do as a country. Think of all the jobs that need doing, from insulating homes to building the zero carbon engines of the future to planting trees and creating green spaces that we can all enjoy. Britain can have a bright manufacturing futurewe take a lead in the environmentally friendly jobs of the future. It makes environmental and economic sense. At a time when we are facing an unemployment emergency, this is the moment to power forward with action to create those jobs we badly need. It’s what we have seen in other countries. Germany has already announced €bn worth of plans, with France likely also to invest a signicant amount. So far, the Government’s warm words on the need for a green recovery have not been matched by their deeds. The £bn of green investment announced pales in comparison. We owe it to ourselves to build back better, and we owe it to future generations to tackle the climate emergency. That’s why Labour has been talking to businesses, unions, workers, campaign groups and the public about ideas to kickstart a recovery that builds an environmentally sustainable economy with a zero carbon army of workers. We need a Green Recovery worthy of the name. Campaign aims to protect us all    Labour’s Jobs, Jobs, Jobs campaign aims to fight for jobs, keep workers safe and back businesses. Fight for jobs: by reforming the furlough scheme so it supports those in the worst-hit sectors and targets aid to struggling industries. Back our businesses: by setting up a fightback fund to prevent firms going under and save our high streets.

The -second clip claimed activist lawyers are taking advantage of EU rules to frustrate their policy of deporting migrants with no right to remain. The Law Society said the clip was misleading and dangerous and that lawyers protecting the rights of asylum seekers were merely doing their jobs. After a formal complaint was lodged with the Home Office, top civil servant Matthew Rycroft agreed the phrase activist lawyers should not have been used in a government video. He said: I have made clear to the team this post should not be used again from Home Office accounts or anywhere  by civil servants. Meanwhile, Ms Patel was reportedly left furious as she was forced to abandon a charter flight removing  migrants from Britain to other EU countries following legal challenges. On Wednesday the Home Office removed  migrants to France and Germany and earlier in the month  others were sent back to EU states. The Mirror contacted the Home Office twice on Friday Morning to ask why the video should not have been used, and the reason it was deleted. But on both occasions a spokesperson said they were “not adding anything further” to the comments made by Mr Rycroft.  A Home Office spokeswoman said: The Governmentaposs efforts to facilitate entirely legitimate and legal s of people who have entered the UK through illegal routes are too often frustrated by last minute challenges submitted hours before a scheduled flight. These claims are very often baseless and entirely without merit, but are given full legal consideration, leading to removal being rescheduled. This can effectively result in the timing out of adue to stringent Dublin Regulations. It is right that we seek to remove migrants who have travelled through a safe country and have no right to remain in the UK. The row came as the Home Office prepared plans to reduce the burden of unaccompanied asylum-seeking children on some areas of the country. The National Transfer Scheme places unaccompanied children in the care of councils around the country to ensure theyaposre spread between local authorities. The Government is consulting on plans to aposrevitaliseapos the scheme following an increase in arrivals in Kent. So far,  local authorities have pledged more than  places to help support children arriving on the south coast.

Staff have given up their summer to make sure children will get the education they deserve in a Covid-secure environment. The achievement is all the more impressive given they had to deal with the exams grading chaos at the same time. They deserve our thanks – unlike the Government, which has sent out confused and conflicting messages to parents, teachers and pupils. There remains a lack of guidance from the Department for Education on what schools should dothere is a second wave in autumn. During lockdown too many pupils missed out by not having access to laptops and lessons via video calls. This cannot be allowed to happen againthere are further outbreaks. Yet the Government has failed to set out how children and teachers will be supported in such a situation. Teachers deserve high grades for their efforts this summer – but ministers should be placed in detention. Trump shame To British eyes it is shocking that a -year-old is allowed to own an assault rle. Even more grotesque is that Kyle Rittenhouse reportedly used that weapon to kill two protesters demonstrating against the police shooting of a black man in Kenosha, Wisconsin. What is less surprising is that Rittenhouse is a fanatical Donald Trump supporter. Rather than seek to calm tensions raging across the US, the President has sought to exploit them. Guest speakers at this week’s Republican convention included the two lawyers from St Louis who brandished guns at Black Lives Matters marchers. Trump may not be directly responsible for the Kenosha deaths but he is responsible for fanning the flames of hatred in his supporters.

A witness had described a woman running towards her pleading for help in a desperate bid to save Maisy and a second child, who suffered serious injuries. Coroner Sonia Hayes opened an inquest into the youngsteraposs death at County Hall in Maidstone on Friday. Ms Hayes said the primary school pupil suffered a traumatic head injury when a tree branch fell on her and gave the cause of death as severe head trauma. Have you been affected by the incident  Email webnews@mirror.  Winds reached speeds of up to mph around the time of the tragedy and the Met Office issued a yellow weather warning as Storm Ellen blasted Britain.Emergency services rushed to the public footpath in a remote crop field shortly after pm on August . But Maisy was pronounced dead at the scene after an air ambulance landed nearby. A second child was also airlted to Kingaposs College Hospital in London with serious injuries. Maisy, who was born and raised in Sittingbourne, Kent, was identied by a hospital doctor. An uncle paid tribute to her in a floral tribute left by the collapsed tree, with a note attached to one bouquet reading: To my beautul niece, I love you. May you rest in peace. Love your uncle and beautul cousins. A white teddy bear was also later tied to a fence post in Maisyaposs memory. An eyewitness described a woman running towards her pleading for help in a desperate bid to save the children. She said: I heard this woman shouting as she came running across the field with no shoes on so I walked over.  She rushed towards me and was screaming for anyone to help. The woman started crying and said her niece had just been hit by a tree. I asked hershe was alright. She seemed very, very panicked. As I walked up and down trying to help her, at least  emergency service vehicles came flying past me. A neighbour who wanted to remain anonymous said: When I saw the air ambulance was there for almost two hours, I knew it was either too late or something serious.

The borough in North East England, which is not under a local lockdown, is at the top of a Covid- symptom tracking appaposs watch list after entering the table for the first time. It is followed by Blackpool, which topped the list last week, Oldham, Halton and Manchester, which have been on the list for weeks. Wirral and Barnsley have also entered the list, while Rochdale, Dundee City, Nottingham, Blackburn with Darwen and Salford have dropped from the table. More than , people in the UK currently have symptomatic coronavirus, according to the government-funded Covid Symptom Study app. Have you been affected by coronavirus  Email your story to webnews@mirror. The latest figures are based on the data from , swab tests carried out between August  and . The app does not indicate the number of recorded cases of coronavirus but predicts where they might be expected to arise based on the number of people reporting symptoms. The appaposs creators said the latest numbers suggests that even though localised outbreaks are happening in the UK, they are not impacting or spreading further. According to the app, there are currently , daily new cases of Covid- in the UK on average over the two weeks up to August . It is a slight increase from app data published a week ago.The figures do not include cases in care homes. A spokesperson for the app said: The numbers are only slightly up from last week, which for another week suggests that even with the localised outbreaks happening in the UK, these outbreaks are not impacting or spreading further. The latest prevalence figures estimate that , people currently have symptomatic coronavirus in the UK, a slight decrease from last week. That figure does not include long-term sufferers. The previous large gap between the regions in north and South continues to reduce, the latest figures show. The Covid Symptom Study app’s prevalence estimate is lower but still within the confidence bounds of the most recent and smaller Office for National Statistics Infection survey, the appaposs spokesperson said. New figures from the ONS on Friday revealed an estimated , people within private households in England had Covid- between August  and . Broadly unchanged from last weeek, this was the equivalent of around .% of the population or one in , iniduals.  The appaposs figures are lower than those published by the ONS because the app doesnapost include asymptomatic cases. The app has now been downloaded by almost four million people in the UK. Launched in March, it was developed by health science company Zoe with scientic analysis provided by King’s College London and £ million in government funding. Said to be the worldaposs largest ongoing study of Covid-, its aim is to identy places where cases appear to be increases so attention can be focused on them.A spokesperson said: When an area of concern is highlighted, increased testing should take place there to help confirmthe situation needs further action such as a localised lockdown. Tim Spector, professor of genetic epidemiology at Kingaposs College London and Zoe co-founder, said: “Whilst we are nowhere near back to normal le yet, it appears that the measures currently in place seem to be keeping this low level of Covid within most of the population, which is good news. However, until we have a vaccine, we will continue to walk along this kne edge with the ever present threat of cases going up again. While there are higher numbers in these local outbreaks in the North of England, we aren’t seeing these small local outbreaks spreading more widely.

Harry first introduced his then girlfriend to William at Kensington Palace a few months into their relationship, in November , and he was reportedly eager to meet the American actress. But a new book about Meghan and Harry, Finding Freedom, claims the future Duchess of Sussex had nothing to worry about as it was a huge success. Even though Kate had to skip the meeting as she was in Norfolk with George, Charlotte and Louis, William was very welcoming. According to the book, Meghan was expecting a grilling and thought William would want to know everything about her - and her intentions. Authors Omid Scobie and Carolyn Durand write: As she walked up the seven freshly jet-washed concrete steps to Apartment A with Harry, she wasnapost thinking about meeting the future king of England but her boyfriendaposs older brother, and one famously protective of his younger one, who had experienced more than his fair share of emotional wounds. However, as soon as she arrived at the Palace she realised she neednapost have worried, with William saying I was looking forward to meeting the girl who has put that silly grin on my brotheraposs face as soon as he opened the door.  The trio enjoyed tea in the Cambridge familyaposs kitchen, which sits right in the middle of their Kenginston Palace home, away from staff and aides. However there was one key element missing from the occasion - Kate. The authors write: Meghan was disappointed she didnapost get to meet Kate, who was with the children at Anmer Hall, the coupleaposs Norfolk estate home near Sandringham. But having gotten along so well with Harryaposs brother, she didnapost think much more about that. William had made his feelings known to his brother when he shared how happy he was to see Harry smiling. Meghan spoke about the first meeting in her engagement interview, when Harry was asked what it was like introducing her to his royal family. He replied: What was it like  It was exciting I mean Iaposve - you know Iaposd been seeing her for a period of time when I - literally didnapost tell anybody at all. And then William was longing to meet her and so was Catherine. So, you know, being our neighbors we managed to get that in a couple of - well quite a few times now and Catherine has been absolutely... Meghan then cut in, adding: Sheaposs been wonderful. Harry then continued: ...amazing, as has William as well, you know, fantastic support.

The shocking incident was filmed in Peterborough on August  and it is unknown why the apparent road rage incident started. In the clip, bystanders shout out as the motorist, driving on the wrong side of the road, ploughs into the man, and the sound of the impact can be clearly heard.  The man is knocked off his feet by the Mercedes and flies onto the pavement. Astonishingly he picks himself back up and limps towards the Mercedes, which is reversing on the wrong side of the road towards a roundabout. The man and a woman dressed in white yell at the retreating driver to leave as they follow the car.  A small crowd of people gather to watch and a line of traffic can be seen stuck behind the incident. The couple turn back but then the Mercedes driver accelerates towards them and mounts the pavement towards the man.  As the Mercedes car drives off, the man smacks on the vehicle window in anger and the woman screams at the driver to leave. As the car flees the scene, a passenger in the front seat imitates a fake finger pistol sign at the pedestrian the vehicle just ran over. Social media users were left shocked by the clip and were astounded by how the hit-and-run victim managed to get up again.

The woman called Jo left the review after visiting The Cowshed at Hucknall for her sister-in-lawaposs th birthday. She claimed that her party spent approximately £ between them on drinks and pizza before they were asked to leave by staff with awful attitude for being too drunk reported Daily Star. In the review Jo wrote, she said: [They] didn’t mind taking the £ though, I have never been spoken to in such a way. Maybe they should open reviews [on their website].She then added: And, yes, our family member was sick, and yes, we cleaned it up so no members of staff were affected by this. Maybe a course for your staff in customer service wouldn’t go amiss – rude staff, huffing and puffing because they had a large round to bring out. But the restaurant, which has a five star rating on TripAdvisor, shared their version of events from the night on Facebook by saying: Hi Jo, thanks for reaching out! We love feedback, whether it be positive or negative, we especially love feedback like this so others can see the type of people we have to deal with sometimes.  Firstly, it said that Jo hadnapost spent the amount of money she claimed she did. To spend that amount of money they would have had to have ordered  of their most expensive pizzas and  of their most expensive drinks... The Cowshed continued: You ordered nowhere near this, Jo... not even close. What you and your party spent, Jo, was a far more realistic and believable £ . Then it got a little brutal.  It added: You all acted like belligerent, entitled little toddlers from the moment you walked through our gates. At :pm you showed up with the tables you wanted already taken, but not to worry, we shuffled other customers about at your request in order to accommodate you.  Then you proceeded to pull our light fittings loose off our boundary fence in order to hang your birthday decor. We cleaned up all the smashed pint glasses you broke and birthday cake you dropped and smeared all over our tables and benches, and tolerated the many loud family rows you were having with each other. The group also supposedly treated The Cowshedaposs staff  like personal servants. It wrote: Clicking your fingers, shouting, swearing and barking your orders at [staff], to the point one was almost in tears and refused to deal with you any more. But it didnapost stop there. The group also refused to abide by social distancing rules following the coronavirus pandemic. Then, for your partyaposs grand finale, the gentleman in the blue shirt headed into our bar from outside and decided to vomit everywhere but the toilet. Our staff stepped into to help, but you demanded to aposdeal with the situationapos and rather than clean up the mess, proceeded to smear it over an even wider area with our mop, whilst... once again, being loud, rude, sticking your hand in our staffaposs faces and shouting over anybody who was trying to communicate with you or help. Donapost worry, the staff member that you nearly had in tears earlier on cleaned it up for you.

Our homes have become more important than ever before this year, and it’s fascinating to see which properties have captured the imagination of Rightmove users this summer. From the music studio where everything started for Oasis, to an Essex mansion with le-size superhero figurines guarding a home cinema, these five properties are really special. Greenacres, EssexSitting in  acres of land, this stunning -bed detached house is on the market for £,, .Over four floors, it has two formal sitting rooms, a family room, a formal dining room, a large kitchen, a wine cellar, library and study. There are two pools - one for leisure and one for exercise - as well as a sauna, hot tub and gym. In the basement youaposll find an -seat cinema, a bar and an arcade.

There are tennis courts and a pavilion in the grounds, as well as a huge drive way and garage space for four cars. All of the five bedrooms have en suites and the master has his and hers dressing rooms.  The online description states: Greenacres is arguably one of the best properties within South East Essex. The unrivalled leisure facilities are simply superb with an enormous party room of approximately , sq ft with fully equipped bar, dance floor, stage, lounge, dining  casino areas. The grounds extend to approximately  acres and are approached via wrought iron security gates with a sweeping in  out driveway leading to garaging for up to  cars. The formal gardens have a large patio area and extensive lawns whilst the remainder of the gardens are well. Tregeare House, CornwallThis Grade II-listed mansion, set in a private country estate, will set you back £,, . The main house has four bedrooms, and there is also a separate two-bed lodge and a self-contained three-bed staff quarters.

The description states: Tregeare is an exceptional, private country estate centred around an elegant Grade II Listed Palladian style mansion surrounded by beautul parkland and grounds with a breath taking approach over a long private drive.  Set amidst the glorious unspoilt North Cornish countryside, Tregeare encapsulates all the elements of a traditional, mixed estate with further residential properties, a working farm, equestrian facilities together with considerable sporting potential. Rich in history, the first recorded owners were the Baron Family and the Grade II Listed Mansion is believed to have been built by Jasper Baron and completed in the s. Today, following a meticulous renovation programme undertaken by the current owners under the supervision of English Heritage, Tregeare has retained a wealth of historical architectural features and is finished and appointed to an exceptional standard. Tranquil Waters, CornwallThis stunning three-bedroom offers unbeatable panoramic views of the estuary and surrounding countryside.Itaposs on the market for just shy of £million , and has it own boathouse and private stone quay.There is also a one-bed guesthouse, a summer house and a separate studio.

The building is surrounded by  acres of private land including itaposs own private creek.The description reads: Only accessible by boat or on foot, the property offers an unrivalled level of privacy and seclusion, surrounded by its own enchanting woodland, with the potential for a high level of self-sufficiency.  It would be dficult to imagine a more romantic and historic setting than that of The Old Sawmills. The creek at The Old Sawmills could tell a long and colourful story. From its early origins as a site used by medieval merchants, to the inspiration for a classic novel, and then a world-famous recording studio, this enchanting site is immersed in history. The most recent chapter in the le of The Old Sawmills, and certainly the most well-known, is its current incarnation as a recording studio. Regularly described as “legendary” by the media, it has played host to many well-established artists and played a big part in the initial development of some.

Many parents, pupils and teachers are excited to get back into the routine and although it’s understandable to have a few worries the benefits of going back into education are clear. Not only will pupils be learning again, but they’ll benefit from the sense of routine, the chance to see their friends and a boost to their wellbeing. With new safety measures in place things will look a bit dferent, but pupils will be guaranteed plenty of support from their teachers.  Dr Paul Phillips CBE, , the Principal and Chief Executive of the Weston College Group in Somerset is one of many leaders who’s worked hard to make the learning environment safe and welcoming for ing students. He said: If you came into my campuses you’d see the one-way system, you’d see all the sanitisers, you’d see the counselling service, you’d see the ability for us to check temperatures, but behind that are the inidual learning plans for each student. That’s where the crucial planning really takes place. We’ve increased the number of mental health advisors and support workers who are here, we’ve put a massive investment into all levels of additional learning support at tutorial level, mentoring and one-to-one teaching. I’ve doubled the amount of cleaners in the college – I just need to be assured that everything we do is protecting everyone.  Home schooling hasn’t been easy and many parents are worried that their children have fallen behind, but parenting expert and author Dr Kalanit Ben-Ari believes they’ll catch up quickly and that getting back into the classroom will boost their mental health. I’m not worried about the academic gap, because I think kids will pick up very quickly. But it’s starting to affect their mental health more and more, so it’s good that they will be back in school from September, says Dr Ben-Ari. Children are not designed to sit down all day. They need to be out in the fresh air and moving their bodies. It’s so important for children of all ages to interact with their friends face to face for communication, and non-verbal communication.  Kids at home have spent a long time on screens while parents are working and they don’t have the resources to entertain and teach their children at home. Spending more time on screens will have affected their mental health: it increases anxiety, especially with children who are a little bit more vulnerable to it. For Chloe Williams, a beauty therapy student at Weston College, thecan’t come soon enough. I feel ready to go for a long-awaited  and seeing the new socially distanced facilities has been great, she says. My tutors are very approachableI have any worries and we are all helping each other. The PHE’s Chief Nurse, Viv Bennett, says: Parents can be reassured that to maximise safety in schools, an extremely stringent system of controls has been advised by PHE and is published in DfE guidance. Evidence so far indicates that schools do not appear to be a primary driver of coronavirus infections in the community. Globally, children and young people have been found to experience coronavirus asymptomatically or as a minor illness.  The Government’s new Wellbeing for Education Return package has training and resources for teachers and young people to protect their wellbeing and mental health. Now the NHS Test and Trace system is up and running and there’s more understanding about what needs to be done to stay safer. Children should stay at homethey have any symptoms such as a fever, continuous cough or loss of taste and smell. If there is an outbreak at a school or college, local health protection teams will work with staff to agree what action is needed. Schools shouldn’t need to close fully, butthey do there’ll be a contingency plan in place to make sure children’s education continues. It’s vital that young peopleto school and college for their educational progress, mental wellbeing and wider development, so attendance is mandatory from the beginning of the new school year. For post-, attendance is important becausea student doesn’t turn up their college may believe they’ve left the course. Schools and colleges have put in a raft of measures to keep pupils and staff safe, including staggered start and finish times and lunch breaks, one-way systems, extra cleaning and encouraging regular handwashing. Where it’s dficult to maintain social distancing, with younger children, contact between groups or “bubbles” will be limited. This means things will look a little dferent, soparents or young people are anxious or worried about ing, they should have a chat with teachers. Parents with younger children are encouraged to take up a nursery place because it provides a routine and helps them develop their social skills. The Government offers a wide range of financial support for families with children aged up to , including Tax-Free Childcare worth up to £, per child per year and you can also apply for a  hours free childcare place before  August.

Tesco has announced a handy scheme for any customer who arrive at its stores without a face mask or face covering. Tesco previously confirmed it would be creating signage to remind customers to don them. But Tesco and the three other supermarket giants said they would not make staff police the new law, which came into effect a month ago, on July . Anybody flouting the rule faces £ fines - reduced to half that figurepaid within a fortnight.  However shoppers who turn up at Tesco without a face mask can buy one at the entrance as the supermarket giant has confirmed it will be selling them for customers who arrive without one, Liverpool Echo reports.Tesco has also confirmed that some staff members may be spotted not wearing a mask due to medical reasons.

Council leader Andrew Western confirmed this morning that the area will be released from local lockdown restrictions that had been in place to limit the spread of Covid-.He said that while leaders wanted to apossee restrictions lted as soon possible, guided by data and when it is safe to do soapos, they didnapost believe next week was the right time, reports the Manchester Evening News. The government, he said, ignored that view. Local leaders said that with schools going back next week, it is a aposdelicate timeapos to ease restrictions. The rate of infection in Trafford has been increasing slightly in the last few days, he added. The boroughaposs current infection rate of . cases per , is almost twice the national average rate of infection of ., Cllr Western said. The borough has aposseen instances of Covid identied in every one of its  electoral wardsapos at some point in the last two weeks, he added. He also highlited that Trafford is aposinextricably linked with other boroughs in Greater Manchester with people visiting these areas on a daily basis to work and socialiseapos. Cllr Western slammed ministers for aposmaking a mockery of local decision makingapos. It is understood restrictions will be lted next week. Earlier this week, restrictions were relaxed in Wigan. The decision means Trafford residents will be able to meet with other households indoors and in their gardens once more, while maintaining social distancing. People cannot meet with dferent households that remain under stricter lockdown measures in other parts of Greater Manchester. Cllr Western said: It was our view – in line with the expert advice from the council’s cirector of public health – that we should see evidence of a sustained reduction in Trafford’s infection numbers before calling for the lting of local restrictions. This is not yet the case, with the last few days showing a slight increase in infection rates again. We understand some will consider this to have been an overly cautious approach, but it has been one made with the safety of Trafford residents in mind. We believe it is slightly premature to lt restrictions relating to households at this time. He added: It is apparent that for all of their claims of working in collaboration with local authorities, the government has decided to overrule the council and lt restrictions in Trafford. Nobody in government has bothered to discuss this with the leader of the council or explained the reasoning for this decision to anybody within the council, and we reiterate our support for the position advocated by our director of public health.

Ronnie Long, , was accused of raping Sarah Bost, , at knepoint in her home in Concord, North Carolina on the evening of April , . He was sentenced to  years in prison for first-degree rape and first-degree burglary. What followed were decades of appeals for his conviction to be overturned. Then, in , Ronnie filed a petition to review biological evidence from the scene and to submit DNA testing. It then emerged that hair samples and clothing fibers didnapost match Ronnie, and it was later discovered that none of the evidence was ever shared with the defense during his trial in . And in , it was revealed that  fingerprints from the crime scene excluded Long as the source of those prints, according to court documents. Despite these revelations, his quest for a new trial was rejected by the Fourth Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals. But earlier month, a court ruled Long’s due process rights were violated under the constitution when he was convicted. Ronnie walked from prison a free man on Thursday. He told reporters outside the court: They will never ever, never ever ever, lock me up again.  This is real. Iaposm going to try to enjoy every minute of it. According to court documents a man entered the home of Bost, who was  at the time, in . He also put a kne to her throat. When Bost was unable to give the intruder any money, the man became angry, cursed her, threw her to the ground, ripped her clothes off, beat her, and raped her. The next day, Bost was shown  photos of potential suspects. Ronnie was not included in the photos and she could not identy any of them as the attacker.  Two weeks later, detectives told Bost that her attacker might be in court on the day she was asked to attend. Long attended court for a separate trespassing charge and Bost said she recognised Longaposs voice. She later picked Long out of a photo lineup.  She told officers there was no doubt in her mind that this person Ronnie Long was the person who entered her house. Despite the lack of physical evidence linking Ronnie to the crime scene and an alibi, he was arrested and later found guilty.  Longaposs mother and the mother of his two-year-old son at the time said he was on a group phone call with them when the attack was reported to have taken place, records say. Long lived with his mother and was preparing to attend a party in Charlotte that night, they said. The fourth Circuit opinion, led by Judge Stephanie D. Thacker, cited a troubling and striking pattern of deliberate police suppression of material evidence. A main argument by prosecutors to the jury, it said, was that police acted honestly.  A petition was launched calling for Ronnie to be released. Nearly , signed it. Speaking outside of the prison, Ronnie told WBTV : Don’t ever give up. No matter how rough it can be, always believe that you can overcome. The name of the game is surviving.“Hopefully incidents like this can be avoided. If you see injustice being done against somebody - then speak out against it. Speak out,you don’t then hate it, hate it with all your heart.” Hi sister Lynda Smith added: “Yeah, this is the happiest news I done had in a long time. “The Long family have really had their moments, and this is lted a big burden off of us.”Jamie Lau, Ronnieaposs attourney, broke the news of his release on Twitter.He tweeted: The State of NC filed a motion with the Fourth Circuit this morning asking that it immediately issue the mandate in Ronnie Long’s case.

Norma Villa had been caring for her -year-old mum Teresa, who had been diagnosed with terminal cancer, for two months. After the pair had discussed the possibility her mother going into a hospice as her health deteriorated, Norma says she went to her bedroom to apostake a momentapos and began apostalkingapos to her father Leandro, who had passed away a decade earlier. She says as she did so she got a notication on her phone, alerting her that movement had been detected on the front porch. When she checked the footage, she saw a aposghostly figureapos swoop down and sit on her swinging porch seat, in the exact spot where her dad had sat whenever he enjoyed a cigarette. Mum-of-three Teresa showed the video to her mum, who believed it was her husband and smiled, claiming that he was there for her. Teresa passed away a few months later in February this year, and -year-old Norma says she now finds the footage of the incident aposreassuringapos. Norma, from Texas, US, said: I believe this could be the ghost of my dad. I felt at peace when I saw the video. The first thing that came to my mind was my dad - I instantly knew it was him.  I kept watching the video and he always sat in that spot and always sat outside to smoke. That was his favourite spot right there. It brings me comfort to think it was my dad watching over us both. I think he was there to reassure me. My mum had been diagnosed with cancer in September and they gave her less than six months to live - she was already half way there. That night she was really sick and we were talking about a hospice already because she was unable to walk anymore. I went to my room and I had a moment. I needed to just let everything out and I started talking to my dad.  I was actually comforted by it by talking to him - I just felt better. As Iaposm lying there my notication on my phone went off that something was on the porch.

And thanks to the National Trust their hard work has been protected.Usually from March to October A La Ronde is open to the public but like all National Trust properties it has been closed during the coronavirus lockdown.Now, a one-way route around the meadow, as well as the grounds, the picnic area and toilets are open, but you must book timed-entry tickets to do so. A La Ronde on the other hand remains closed.A National Trust spokesperson said: I can confirm that the house is not yet open. The grounds are open and there is a one way route around the meadow. Visitors need to book  via the website,  by pm the day before they plan visit. The website will be kept up to date with any changes. The house was ided into a series of square and rectangle rooms, but due to its hexadecagonal shape there were a number of wedge-shaped waiting rooms between them to fill the space. As the pair were deeply religious, and the church they visited was a boat-journey away, they decided to build their own on-conformist chapel on the estate which they called Point In View, which was large enough to hold - people. Beside it were several almshouses which provided a home for Jewesses who had converted to Christianity.  Jane and Mary also created a school room, and planted a number of oak trees around the property, which they hoped would be used to build ships and eventually transport their converts around the world. Their home was decorated with trinkets, keepsakes and other crafty items which marked their love for artistry and design. The endearing story of the -sided spectacle began in  after Janeaposs father, who was a wealthy Devon wine merchant, died.  After helping rebuild Lisbon following the devastating earthquake in  he was rewarded by the Portuguese royal family with a glass factory, which allowed him to expand his business and import bottled wine into England. Three months after he passed, Jane went travelling to France, Italy, Germany, Switzerland, and possibly Spain and Portugal, with her sister Elizabeth, cousin Mary and friend Miss Colville before ing to England. After spending years putting their all into their pride and joy, Jane died in  and was buried in the chapel there, as was Mary in .  Maryaposs will had two principal aims: to preserve A la Ronde and its contents intact, and to allow only unmarried female relatives to inherit. In the s the house was passed to two sisters Stella and Margaret Tudor, who, since they had no money opened the house to the public. In  the pair considered putting the market, raising it by £, but they were advised against it by their friend John Betjeman who said that the house was only worth in the regions of £, to £,.  After they died, the house came into ownership of Ursula Tudor Perkins who eventually sold it for £, to the National Trust in . Nearly a million pounds and  years later the property has been ed to its former glory. It was re-roofed, rooms were repainted in colours which were in keeping with those of the th century and new accommodation for staff as well as visitor facilities were put in place.

What a waste of time.#How are ministers meant to knowtheir measures are having any impact at all or which countries pose a dangerthey don#t hold these numbers  It beggars belief.#I#m convinced that this Scottish Government has no clue about how to manage the easing of lockdown while protecting both people#s lives and livelihoods.#Public Health Scotland#s Covid- statistics report will include for the first time on August  data on the number of people arriving in Scotland from outside the UK, the number required to quarantine and those contacted by government tracers.Ms Freeman admitted early last month that no checks had yet been carried out on whether iniduals arriving in Scotland from abroad had been abiding by quarantine rules because of a delay in accessing Home Office systems.Public Health Scotland now receives the contact details of any passengers identied as requiring to self-isolate as part of an agreement with the Home Office.The body then selects a random sample of quarantined passengers to contact with public health advice and information.Official records show , successful contacts have been made since June , with a further  in progress, and , emails have been sent with additional public health guidance in relation to quarantine and self-isolation.Nicola Sturgeon was challenged on the issue at the Scottish Government#s daily coronavirus briefing on Thursday.The first minister said genomic sequencing work had provided insight into the number of importations of the virus into Scotland between February and March.#Some of this is not quite as straightforward as you might think,# Ms Sturgeon said.#We obviously look at cases very closely on a daily basis, so there will be intelligence being gathered on whether people who have cases have had recent travel history.#But you cannot then make an automatic assumption that somebody who was, for argument#s sake, in Spain a few weeks ago and is now in Scotland with the virus, brought it here from Spain. They may have picked it up here.##And that#s where the genomic sequencing work is an important part of robustly validating that kind of information.#We will always look at the information that can be reliably made available from the daily work that Public Health Scotland do looking at cases but the question of where someone got coronavirus sometimes needs more scientic explanation.#For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles.Newsletter Get top stories straight to your inbox every day.SUBSCRIBE HERE!Latest blaize_config   n t t tCancelation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Eveningwebsite and Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening  n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb + ePaper n t t t n t t t n t t t tDuration: n t t t t Month n t t t n t tSubscribe TodayEnjoy the digital edition of the Eveningnewspaper on your smartphone, tablet and computer.Unlimited access to all articles on the Eveningwebsite.

the streets to pay tribute to tragic conductor in sombre day for scotlands railway","story":"An Aberdeenshire community came to a standstill as the funeral cortege of tragic rail conductor Donald Dinnie passed through the town.The -year-old died in the Stonehaven derailment on August , alongside driver Brett McCullough and passenger Christopher Stuchbury.Mr Dinnie#s funeral was held in private yesterday but his family had invited anyone wishing to pay their last respects to watch as the funeral cortege passed through Westhill.Since the tragedy, tributes from across Scotland have poured in for the conductor described as a #jolly# and #friendly# face on many peoples# commutes.And by pm, hundreds had lined the streets between Hay’s Way and Old Skene Road to say a final farewell.Rather than everyone being clad in traditional black, blue Scotrail jumpers, jackets and unorms all stood out as the country#s #railway family# turned out in full force to pay tribute to the beloved colleague.Neighbours, friends and other members of the Westhill community also took the time to attend.As the funeral procession approached Hay#s Way, a lone bagpiper began to play Flowers of the Forest # a Scottish folk tune  popular at Remembrance Sunday events # and silence fell among the crowd.When the vehicles passed Westhill Swimming Pool a Scotrail staff member began to clap his hands # leading to loud applause breaking out.Alex Hynes, managing director of ScotRail, was also in attendance alongside other senior members of the organisation.In a statement released afterwards, Mr Hynes said: “Today is a very sombre day for Scotland’s railway as we mourn the passing of our friend and colleague Donald.“Our hearts will remain broken for a long time to come, but together with the railway family we will provide support and comfort for everyone touched by the tragedy.”The family of Mr Dinnie had requested that, instead of sending flowers, people make donations to Scotland#s Charity Air Ambulance .The helicopter was present on August  and Mr Dinnie also had a monthly direct debit to help keep it going.The charity posted on a fundraising page set up by his family online, paying tribute to Mr Dinnie.The message said: #Please accept the sincerest condolences of everyone here at Scotland’s Charity Air Ambulance.#Your father was a valued supporter of our work and we greatly appreciate your support at this time.#For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium

He has come back from a long term knee injury suffered last season and seems to be getting better with every game this term.Ryan Hedges replaced Main at half-time and showed what an asset he can be to Aberdeen with a fine hat-trick and Jonny Hayes got on the scoresheet with a great strike.Hedges drives one home from the edge of the box for his second and Aberdeen#s fourth 💥 pic QDeealdsmdash Premier Sports 📺August , It was a good win and performance from the Reds, things will get harder in the second qualying round but another home tie in Monday’s draw would be ideal.Before then the Dons meet high-flying Hibs at Easter Road in the Premiership.It will be a dficult encounter, but Aberdeen couldn’t be going into the clash in better form and they have improved in each of the last three games so and there’s no reason why that can’t continue with a victory in Leith.The eight Aberdeen players who broke coronavirus restrictions were set to find out their punishment from the SFA today.Bans of between two and  games could be handed out, but I hope common sense prevails.The players made a bad mistake and admitted to that. They’ve been punished by the club but will need to accept a ban as well.It was a serious breach, but I hope the SFA don’t try to make an example of them with an excessively y suspension.It doesn#t seem fair that football is being treated dferently to rugby when it comes to getting fans back in grounds.It’s important to get crowds back at sporting events in some form as we try to get back towards some normality.In a stadium the size of Celtic Park or Ibrox certaintly I’d imagine initially around , might have been able to attend socially distanced as part of test events.Yet Celtic were trying to have up to , in attendance for Sunday’s game against Motherwell and it was rejected by the Scottish Government.It doesn’t make any sense to me when  fans will be watching Edinburgh against Glasgow in rugby’s Pro  at Murrayfield tonight.The decision doesn’t seem fair and needs to be explained fully, why is rugby getting treated dferently It seems like football is being punished because of breaches of coronavirus restrictions – but that was by players.It’s doesn’t seem right to me to punish the clubs and fans by delaying theirbecause of wrongdoing by players.The SFA and SPFL should demand that football is treated the same way as rugby.The sooner football test events with fans take place the better for the health of the game in Scotland at all levels.For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles."},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor july 17 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsThe following letter appeared in the Argyllshire Advertiser#s sister title, the Campbeltown Courier, last week, with the reply sent since publication of Mr Redman#s letter.Sir,The SNP is failing councils, as recent figures show that the cost of coronavirus to local authorities could hit more than £ million.Under the SNP essential local services have been underfunded for years, yet it is councils that are spearheading the response to this virus. Without action and proper investment from central government vital public services will be at risk.This news of huge strain on local authority budgets comes as the SNP is delaying in opening up Scotland’s hospitality and tourism industry. Instead of following other parts of the UK and opening the sector on July , the separatists are forcing businesses to wait until July .This delay will cost businesses millions at a time when thousands of jobs are already on the line.The SNP is risking people#s livelihoods. It needs to accept responsibility for that and take action now.Councillor Alastair Redman,Sir,People occasionally ignore the elephant in the room to support their point of view, but in his latest letter, Councillor Alastair Redman has ignored an entire herd in his living room.In his latest rant he states that the SNP is failing councils as the cost of coronavirus could hit more than £ million, but surely these costs would be the same no matter who was in power He also suggests that #essential local services have been underfunded for years# yet fails to mention the years of needless austerity cuts, actioned by his party and their collaborators, to bail out the greedy and risky practices of the banks, which reduced funding to a devastatingly low level in general. It is worth noting that the Scottish Government has put a greater percentage of their curtailed income into NHS Scotland than any part part of the UK. This has helped NHS Scotland to outperform all of the others, in the UK, for the past five years. This is paying idends now.He s to his familiar attempt to insult by referring to citizens who want to take responsibility for making and managing decisions and working to make their country prosper within the priorities set by its citizens as #separatists#. I’m glad to be described as a separatist because the alternative is to be an apologist for an unrepresentative government in Westminster and to abdicate decision making to that same out-of-touch group.It is Councillor Redman’s final point, however, that demonstrates his blinkered sycophancy. His suggestion that the Scottish Government should follow the example of other parts of the UK. Could he really be saying that we should follow the chaotic shambles and incompetence that has emanated from his chums at Westminster  Does he seriously think that any sensible person, irrespective of their own political affiliation and from any of the devolved nations, would swap what their government#s have done for the Westminster model Sadly, nowhere in his missive does Councillor Redman take time to mention the health and safety of our citizens.It is this, together with scientic advice and without political point scoring, that is driving the Scottish Government#s response to this tragic pandemic.Kevin MacKaveney, TarbertSir,Following reports of littering around Argyll and Bute, including the Isle of Islay, the issue was discussed at a recent meeting of Islay Community Council where community councillors heard that items like rubber gloves have been found dumped in ditches.It is always very disappointing to hear about littering and fly-tipping but doubly so in an area like Islay where residents take such an understandable pride in their environment.We also need to bear in mind that items like disposable gloves can pose a threat to livestock. As well as being profoundly antisocial, this kind of behaviour can be positively harmful.Those acting irresponsibly should remember that there can be serious consequences to their thoughtlessness.Donald Cameron, Highlands and Islands MSPSir,We all have a role to play in the recovery of the country’s tourism industry after its reopening on July .Scots could help by taking a trip, visiting an attraction or experience, shopping locally, dining out and booking a staycation.Scottish tourism is facing its biggest challenge in a generation and will need financial support for some time to come to help it recover. The Scottish public has a crucial part to play in helping this happen.It#s easy to not think of yourself as a tourist in your own country but many of the experiences that we often enjoy with loved ones, such as holidays, shopping or eating out, all contribute to our visitor economy.July  marked a new era for the industry as we start to welcome back visitors and take our first steps on the road to a safe and responsible recovery. However, reopening won’t be the same for all businesses, many are still adapting to this #new normal#, so it#s important that we recognise that as we move forward to try and restore our industry.We look forward to helping Scots rediscover their own country in a way that is safe for everyone # visitors, residents and those working within the industry. Recovery will require our collective efforts and we must act as one to ensure the best possible outcomes for the whole of the visitor economy.Malcolm Roughead, VisitScotland chief executive"},{"url":null,"title":"the time for change is is now july 17 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsThis isn’t really a campaign, it’s just the things that we should all be thinking aboutwe want Argyll # and the world – to be a recognisable place for our children and grandchildren to live in.The economic crisis could be seen as an opportunity to get started on the work that we know needs to happen.I think that many people in Argyll could continue to work from home people who have lost their jobs could be retrained, or use their existing skills, to do the work that is necessary for Argyll to become carbon-neutral. Walking and cycling infrastructure needs to be improved, trees can be planted, and renewable energy can be expanded and made more efficient.Transport and food are the most obvious areas for behavioural change in Argyll. We need to be promoting the benefits of electric cars and making them preferable to petrol or diesel cars.We can easily bring food production and consumption closer together by shopping and eating more locally and more naturally. Farming in Argyll is generally quite low impact, but does not have the capacity to feed everyone in the area, meaning that we have to buy in meat which is less sustainably farmed to make up the dference. If everyone ate only the meat that is produced locally, we could dramatically reduce the emissions caused from the transport of imported meat, as well as supporting our local market and ensuring that it remains natural and sustainable. Reducing food waste is also an easy behavioural change.Acting on climate change is all about thinking of others. Across the globe, the people who see the most adverse effects of climate change so far are those who are already marginalised and vulnerable.Kindness and common decency indicate that we must act with the needs of these people in mind, with the knowledge thatwe do not act, ‘these people’ will soon become us and our children.One thing that I think would make a huge dference would bewe all took #our whole selves# to work with us.Whatworld leaders were constantly thinking: #what would my children say about my role in this decision # This kind of moral thinking would make a huge dference in the future of industry and politics, and the more we educate the next generation, the more influence they will have on their parents.Everyone can make changes such as cutting down on their meat and dairy consumption, shopping locally, re-using plastic containers, recycling, composting, reducing food waste, buying fewer new things, using a renewable energy supplier, and cutting down or cutting out air travel.At the Paris Agreement in ,  nations decided to take measures to limit the global temperature increase to . degrees above pre-industrial levels. Our current behaviour will not allow for this.A rise of  degrees celsius above pre-industrial levels will mean that large areas of land around the equator will be uninhabitable, resulting in huge numbers of refugees fleeing for their survival. Sea level rise caused by the rapid melting of the ice caps will mean that small island states such as Kiribati and Tuvalu will be submerged. The combination of the loss of arable land and ocean acidication due to temperature increase will mean global food shortages, such that we have never seen before.The rich will still be able to buy food, but those who are already marginalised and vulnerable will find it increasingly dficult to access basic amenities like food and clean water, further stretching the inequality gap.It’s not too late to make changes, but it soon will be.We all need to have climate change in the forefront of our minds when making any kind of decision, be it personal or business. It is an omnipresent issue and every decision, however big or small, will have an effect."},{"url":null,"title":"science matters are aircraft vapour trails harmful","story":"Dorothy H CrawfordUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsAlthough much reduced by the Coronavirus pandemic, everyone has seen the vapour trails produced by high-flying aircraft as they streak across the sky. But what are they  and are they harmful Officially called contrails , these ephemeral, cloud-like structures are primarily made of ice crystals. They form at altitudes over , metres from water vapour in the aircraft’s engine exhaust as it freezes almost instantaneously at temperatures below minus  degrees celsius. There are, however, plenty of other volatiles and solid components in engine exhaust, including soot particles that often act as a nucleus around which the ice crystals form.Official figures show that air traffic contributes around five per cent of greenhouse gases. Yet these estimates only account for CO emissions. They do not include the effect of contrails, which can persist for hours and even expand into cirrus clouds several miles wide. These clouds, which are most abundant over North America and Europe, trap heat within Earth’s atmosphere, so do they improve our climate or contribute to global warming Air traffic has been steadily increasing year-on-year, so, assuming the coronavirus effect is a temporary one, estimates suggest that the distance flown by passengers will double every  years, and that air traffic will quadruple by . Therefore, it is imperative to determine how the increase in clouds created by contrails might affect us.In a recent study*, scientists used a climate model to analyse the future impact of contrails on climate change, taking into account their predicted increase balanced against any likely changes in engine soot emissions.The results show a three-fold increase in contrail cirrus coverage by , despite a  per cent reduction in soot emissions due to improved fuel and engine efficiency. These predictions cover all major air traffic routes and are mostly due to increased air traffic volume, although a sht to flying at higher altitudes also contributes. The area with the greatest increase will be Eastern Asia, where the largest rise in air traffic is expected.This previously unaccounted for, non-CO, climate impact of air traffic is now reckoned to have a more damaging effect on climate change than all the CO emitted from aircraft engines.*Atmos.

But it has also been a time of positive change and reflection, prompting people to be more creative. Writing, be it poetry, song writing or short stories, for example, has given many a way of making sense of this time, of sharing their feelings and looking after their mental health.For those who have found it dficult to know where to begin, Seil author Kenneth Steven offers this advice to help you start your creative writing journey.For me, there are two essential ingredients when it comes to setting out as a creative writer: time and space. By creative writing I mean poetry, short stories, novels and children’s writing: everything involving the use of the imagination.When someone claims they don’t have time to write, I don’t believe them as it’s a question of making time.PD James started writing when nursing a dying husband: he needed care all through the day. There was a part of the night when finally he went to sleep and she had the chance to put pen to paper, so that was what she did. If we are serious about wanting to write, we will make time.For many years I lived in Dunkeld, close to the entrance to the cathedral. When friends heard my address they would roll their eyes and say: ‘What a place to be. And you’re lucky enough to be a writer.’Except it wasn’t that easy. The truth is the modern world invaded even that idyllic corner of Scotland.First, there were thousands of pilgrim feet and voices. I was driven mad by not being able to find sufficient quiet. My former we watched a great deal of television. It was a tiny flat and the distant murmur of low voices maddened me because I couldn’t concentrate.It was she who suggested # probably to stop the grumbling # that I should have a cabin built in my mother’s garden in Aberfeldy, a place where I could hide away to write. After considering the idea for a few days, I realised she was right.When finally I sat down to start working in that simple shed among the trees, the words poured from the pen. I will never forget those first days. Poem after poem appeared as though by magic on the page. For me # and after many years of leading creative writing sessions, I would suggest for the vast majority of others too # finding real quiet makes all the dference.But it doesn’t have to be a hideaway in a garden it can be a living room or a bedroom or an attic – just at a time when others in the household are asleep or absent.There are few rules for creative writers, but one I have discovered is that we are all larks or owls. We’re either attracted to early morning or late evening.I have yet to meet anyone who has said they’re drawn to the mid-afternoon # what I term # hammock time, though that’s when I wrote in the Aberfeldy cabin. I’ve come to believe strongly you will use the time you are given. If that’s what you have, you will adapt to that rhythm.But I quickly came to realise in my cabin that I couldn’t simply turn on good writing like a tap. We go into our creative space weighed down by the modern world. We live lives beset by emails, phone calls and text messages. We are all expected to respond quickly.I think creative writers are generally poor when it comes to practice writing. The creative lives of visual artists, actors, singers and musicians are dominated by practice. Why should it be dferent for those from the writing community What do I mean by practice writing  Describing the view out of the window going back into memory to capture a moment as evocatively as possible imagining a dialogue between two characters. There’s no end to the possibilities. What practice writing provides is creative grounding. It brings us from being all over the place in our minds to give us creative focus.What this practice allows us to do is to start, then to pour ourselves into what I like to call deep writing. It creates a kind of doorway so the real writing can begin.Kenneth Steven is best-known as a poet. Sixteen of his collections have been published and he writes and presents poetry-related programmes for BBC Radio. He is also a Scottish novelist and children’s author. He’s written two handbooks on writing and led workshops and worked as writer in residence at home and abroad. www.kennethsteven"},{"url":null,"title":"if walls could talk","story":"Susan WindramUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsStrachur Smiddy opened its doors again on Saturday, August , after an uncertain few months due to Covid-.The museum will only be open on Saturdays and Sundays, until Sunday September , but for now families can again enjoy stepping back in time in the th-century blacksmith’s smiddy, which has been carefully repaired and restored to its original state and now acts as a working museum with with forge, bellows and anvil, cobbled floor, tools of the trade and beamed ceiling.Browse through the Smiddy’s collection of fascinating artefacts and tools.

So many people are intimidated by other vehicles. The Bikeability scheme gives children and adults the confidence to ride out safely.#The training, over three days, and was a mixture of games, exercises and on road practice, finishing with an assessment. The village#s fire engine was used to demonstrate to the youngsters how dficult they are to see from the cab of a large goods vehicle, particularly to the rear and near side at junctions.They also learned about primary and secondary road positions, right of way and good observational skills.They were even encouraged to ask their parentsthey do the #Dutch Reach# to keep passing cyclists safe. The Dutch Reach is a simple change of habit to help you open your car door safely. Instead of using the hand closest to the door, it means reaching across to open the door with the hand furthest from the door # your left handyou are the driver. This naturally turns your body towards the window, helping you spot approaching cyclists.Mr Catterwell added: #Thanks to Scottish Fire and Rescue Service for the use of the appliance and the drill yard, the Bike Bothy for administrative assistance and training materials and Graham Love for his excellent mechanical services. Also to residents and holiday makers around Craignish who were mostly respectful of the learner cyclists.#P S pupils Fergus Bennett, Beth Gregory, Magnus Hampton, Kay Neville, Harry Whittle and Reiley Van Der Zel received their Bikeability  badges. P  pupils Ross Potter-Irwin and Henry Small should get their Bikeability badges in term time next year.Through partnership with the Ardrishaig Bothy, Cycling Scotland is offering schools free instructor support, instructor training and resources to deliver Bikeability Scotland training.Bikeability Scotland is the national cycle training programme designed to give children the skills and confidence they need to cycle safely on the roads and to encourage them to carry on cycling into adulthood.

The decision was taken to send me to the Royal Alexandra Hospital in Paisley, and Neil Newman and Billy McArthur drove very carefully on the ersion route to Paisley, avoiding the recently damagedRest and be Thankful route.I am grateful to all those who delivered care to such a high standard, ensuring that my recovery was so successful after excellent treatment at the RAH.Jeremy Houston, PoltallochSir,As I read Councillor Alastair Redman’s letter in the August  edition of the Advertiser I thought how sad it is that a young man should always have such a pessimistic and depressing outlook that he chooses to share regularly with your readers.While we live through a pandemic we have seen the very best in people in our communities working to support and care for each other.Only last week the council publicly thanked the thousands of volunteers for their amazing efforts during the past months.The volunteers throughout our communities worked tirelessly and optimistically, always offering encouragement and kindness helping those who were at home to stay positive during such an anxious time.Local businesses provided an excellent service and continue to do so, enabling people to shop locally without making long journeys.If Councillor Redman cannot see the confident and positive support in all of our communities perhaps he should book an eye test, and he most certainly doesn’t have to travel to Barnard Castle to visit an optician.Councillor Anne Horn, TarbertSir,I was delighted to see the piece in a recent issue of the Argyllshire Advertiser featuring a reader from Tayvallich, setting out his case for #Time for Change#. I share many of his concerns, and commend the series of articles.It would be good to hear from a range of Argyll and Bute residents with their ideas for how we get from #here# towards a better #there#. My personal pet project would be an Argyll and Bute Citizens’ Assembly, that would bring people together to generate real strategies to bring about just and #green# change for our area.A good start would be better transport links, via enhanced road and ferry services.A permanent solution to the Rest and be Thankful would be welcome, of course, but it was really heartening to see how Western Ferries rose to the challenge on Friday Auust .  They magicked away that endless queue at Gourock with great patience and goodwill and double service, showing what can be done.Mary MacCallum Sullivan, ArdrishaigSir,Following the latest landslide and road closure at the Rest and be Thankful, once again the road closure signs were placed at the wrong place on the Arrochar side.Having spoken to several of the local businesses owners, the main issue around the signs are they are too far away from the incident. There are information signs from Balloch to Tarbet advising of the closure at the Rest.Surely moving the signs to Ardgartan would make more sense. Should anyone have to turn then there is ample space to do this. We cannot continue to render two villages effectively closed in case someone has failed to read the signs or cannot turn.Transport Scotland and BEAR Scotland must guarantee that the signs will not be put back in the same place when further disruption occurs, and it will.Jane Ireland, Slanj restaurant, Tarbet"},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures august 21 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsGordon Stewart from Ardfern sent us thisatmospheric photograph, taken from Corranmor Farm on Monday August .A stunning full rainbow appeared that day over Loch Craignish lagoon, captured by Gordon on camera.PIC:no_aYourPictures_Rainbow"},{"url":null,"title":"enjoy cowal highland gathering in the comfort of your own home","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsWith just days to go until one of Scotland’s favourite events takes the virtual stage for the first time, Cowal Highland Gathering’s organisers are preparing to unveil a packed programme to a worldwide audience.Cowal’s Virtual Highland Gathering is an ambitious three-day event which mirrors as closely as possible the programme of the gathering itself.Kicking off on Thursday August , Cowal’s Virtual Gathering features a host of exclusive interviews and performances, together with a look back at some of the highlights of the -year-old event.The Gathering’s Friday night gig is back too, with the Gig at the Gathering Unplugged going live from pm.

and those around us.However, people wearing face coverings every day have been noticing that they have started to break out in acne, rashes and skin irritations.Have you had more breakouts since you started wearing a mask We have spoken to Dermalogica skin care expert and beautician Ashley Richards to find out why this happens and how you can protect your skin.What is ldquomaskne Maskne occurs when sweat, oil and bacteria are trapped on your skin while wearing a mask, creating the perfect breeding ground for breakouts.What causes it Maskne is caused by friction, rubbing, and occlusion of the skin by outside forces.Wearing a mask can trap dirt, oil, swear and humidity around the skin.Friction and irritation from the mask pushes bacteria into the skin, which creates micro-tears, and allows the bacteria and dirt to enter the skin more easily.This will lead to blackheads and whiteheads along the bridge of your nose, cheeks and chin. Masks can trigger ious types of skin irritationsand redness .How can you combat maskne There isnrsquot a prevention for maskne, as we need to continue wearing our masks, but there are ways that you can help combat the issues.Skin Care routineIf you want to combat the impact of maskne then having a good skincare routine is essential.It is just as important to cleanse your skin before wearing a mask as it is to cleanse after wearing a mask.To help your skin heal, Ashley would recommend using a squalane or balm cleanser so help remove make-up, dirt and debris.However,you are experiencing chapped, irritated skin or suffer from sensitivity then a gel based cleanseradvised.Dermalogicarsquos UltraCalming Cleanser helps to calm and cool sensitised irritated skin.ExfoliatingExfoliating is key to clear clogged pores and remove dead skin cells which will help reduce the impact of maskne.There are thousands of dferent types of exfoliators available from chemical, physical and masks but it is always important to follow the recommended application and how often you should use the product.Over-exfoliating your skin can compromise your skins barrier , damage the skins capillaries and dehydrate the skin.Ingredients such as glycolic acid, lactic acid and salicylic acid are great exfoliating athelping fight breakouts.Spot treatmentsUsing targeted spot treatments with ingredients such as salicylic acid and benzoyl peroxide will help remove dead skin cells and decongest pores.Hyaluronic AcidsHyaluronic acid can hold , times its weight in water - so it is like a magnet for moisture.,params: .pushUsing hyaluronic acid regularly will leave the skin feeling super-soft, radiant and reduce the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles.Hyaluronic acid has antibacterial properties meaning it will help soothe and protect chapped, irritated skin.FoundationsOpt for tinted moisturisers rather than a heavy foundation or go bare faced to help cause less clogging in your pores - but donrsquot forget your SPF!MoisturisersHeavier moisturisers will sit on the skin for longer due to the humidity of wearing the mask which can cause further clogging and irritation of the skin.However, donrsquot want to stop using a moisturiser all together as our skin still requires hydration and moisture.Instead try using a light and soothing moisturise such as Charlotte Tilburyrsquos Magic Cream light.Chapped SkinFor those suffering from chapped skin try using a physical barrier cream such as Dermalogicarsquos Barrier Repair.Barrier Repair shields against environmental pollution and helps forty sensitive skin with a damaged barrier."},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus-mobile-testing-unit-hawick---know","story":"A MOBILE-TESTING unitwill run in Hawick for six days, according to NHS Borders.It comes following an outbreak in the townlinked to three businesses.The testing unit will operate from tomorrowuntil Wednesday, September .It will be based in the Teviotdale Leisure Centre car park on Mansfield Road, with tests available between pm-pm.An NHS Borders spokesperson said: \"The MTU can only take a limited number of people each day so it is essential that only people with COVID- symptoms book a test.\"Other household members must self-isolate but should not be tested unless they too are showing any symptoms.\"The symptoms of COVID- are a high temperature or fever a new continuous cough or a loss of or change in sense of smell or taste.\"Tests, which must be booked in advance, can be arranged by visiting this websiteor calling  .The new unit will run alongside the existing facility in Galashiels Netherdale car park, which will operate betweenam and pm.If travellingto a mobile unit is not possible, people can arrange for a home test kit to be posted through their door.NHS Borders jointdirector of public health, Tim Patterson, said: \"I realise that people in Hawick will have concerns about the virus as a result of this outbreak.\"Unfortunately this can lead to the circulation of unsubstantiated rumours, especially on social media.\"I would like to re-iterate that it is crucial for everyone in the community to follow our advice and avoid speculation and rumour about the outbreak.\"Dr Patterson added: \"In terms of schools, all education settings in Hawick are currently safe places for children to learn.\"Unless your child has been asked to self-isolate by NHS Borders Test and Protect team they should attend school as normal.\"However it remains vital that no child attends schoolthey are displaying any COVID- symptoms.\"At the time of publication, a total of nine new cases of coronavirus have been recorded in the Borders in recent days,bringing the regions total to  since the outbreak began.To book a testing unit appointment or a free home testing kit, visit: www.gov.uk get-coronavirus-test or you can call:   "},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus-scotland-book-covid-test-testing-centres","story":"In the last week, demands for Covid testing in Scotland have surged.The First Minister suggests some Scots have had trouble trying to book coronavirus tests over the weekend due to a \"major spike\" in demand, which resulted in technical issues.Butyou are experiencing symptoms, how do you get a test  Heres everything you need to know.When should you take a test If you think you are experiencing symptoms of coronavirus, you should take a test.

Across the UK, as headlines foretold the devastation lockdown would wreak on this seasonal trade ndash footage of acres of wilting plants was grim ndash cannier businesses immediately shted to online and telephone orders. And, as recent figures show, people responded enthusiastically. During that period, Britons spent around pound. billion on garden plants, materials and tools. Contrary to the stereotypical picture of a Mr McGregor retiree, footering around in his potting shed, it was millennials who spent most. Their investment was double that of the rest of us, with the - age group spending an average pound per person, compared with pound among others.Some of that might be explained by the urgent need for equipment to turn a rectangle of grass into a more imaginative space for all the family to enjoy. Irsquom long past their age but still so new to gardening that I recall those early months as a ceaseless outlay on shears, secateurs, spades, forks, trowels, rakes, sieves... I could go on. Hence the need for a shed, which was soon festooned with tools dangling from hooks, propped against walls and stacked on shelves. Think of an Italian deli, with hams and salamis overhead, and floor to ceiling storage. Replace the delicious aroma of cheeses, coffee beans and truffles with potting compost, muddied buckets and oil to keep blades moving, and you get the picture.There are professional horticulturalists where I live who are well under , but thatrsquos probably not surprising. Those who choose to live in the country are already keen on the outdoors, whatever their vintage. Yet there is something of a renaissance occurring in this generation, as interest in their own plot is sparked into le, whether itrsquos an allotment, balcony, or back yard.In response to what you might call a growing trend, Alan Titchmarsh has said that he hopes more young folk will be encouraged to pick up their trowels and dig up drives, to help protect the planet. ldquoItrsquos not just about going on marches, he says. ldquoBeing practical is a hugely underrated resource and skill.Those who have unexpectedly found themselves with time to devote to their patch have probably realised how enjoyable it is too. Being in the fresh air, surrounded by birds, and perhaps with children larking around, has shown how much pleasure can be had in maintaining your part of the world. At this stage of le, competition for peoplersquos spare time is usually ferocious, with the demands of socialising, keeping fit and raising a family. In the past, unless you were actively emulating the Good Le, choosing to spend the weekend planting drills of potatoes or deadheading roses was borderline eccentric.Being forced to spend so much time at home has clearly made people reassess their outdoor space, and consider its potential. Making their plot child-friendly has been a priority for some. But for those who dread the thought of a football landing on tender seedlings and new blooms, there should be no conflict between serious cultivation and youngsters ndash quite the opposite. The earlier children encounter flowers and trees and the wildle they attract, the better for all our futures. And the sooner they recognise the need to treat living things with respect ndash although some trampling and breakage is almost inevitable ndash the more they will understand not just how nature works, but the ways in which we can support it.Irsquove lost count of the number of people who have said how much they have relished this aspect of lockdown. Having nowhere  to go has allowed them to concentrate on matters horticultural, and take time to make decisions or try experiments they otherwise could not have attempted. Having many more unfilled free hours has its upsides, as one neighbour has discovered. When the pandemic took hold she turned her greenhouse into a hotbed of tomatoes and her flowerbeds into a lettuce patchwork, and has been feasting on salads all summer. As have her friends.Inevitably, once the world opens up again, some recent converts will lose interest and the weeds will take revenge. Yet I have no doubt that many will already be hooked. The secret that no gardener ever mentions is that it is addictive. Each tiny success gives confidence to try something more adventurous. Mistakes are inevitable, but so are accidental triumphs. The thrill of discovering strawberries or nasturtiums thriving where before was a bed of nettles, is inspiring. The sight of bees and birds hovering for nectar, seeds and grubs is like preparing a banquet and watching as guests pile their plates high. To be honest, environmental reasons for sustainable, eco-friendly gardening are all but forgotten in the joy it brings. The reason why benches in most well-tended grounds go largely unused is because therersquos always something clamouring for attention. To sit sipping a GT while an unpruned shrub stares at you reproachfully, or a juicy stick of rhubarb cries out to be picked, is almost impossible.In my own limited experience, trying to keep on top of it all ndash and never coming remotely close ndash is part of what it is about. An expert recently told me that a garden will take all the time you give it, and then some. Yet the depths of winter is the time to put your feet up . The rest of the year is for helping the green things around you put down sturdy roots. As millennials can confirm, it has a very stabilising, calming effect on us too.Our columns are a  for writers to express their opinions.

This resulted in  new cases being detected - a positivity rate of . per cent.In the seven days to August , the number of people being tested had risen sharply to ,, with  new cases identied - a .% positivity rate.Many of these iniduals will have been tested more than once across the NHS and community sites we are now performing more than , Covid antigen tests per week - the highest turnover since the pandemic began.: Scotland to roll out -minute Covid testsDespite this sudden upswing in demand - and bearing in mind that the vast majority of testing is carried out on iniduals with possible Covid symptoms - % of those tested are still coming back negative for the Sars-CoV- virus.While some of these may be  negatives, it is also a strong indicator of just how many non-Covid viral infections are circulating in the community causing coughs and fevers.Young children have also long been known to be lsquosuperspreadersrsquo of colds and flu - yet the same does not appear to be true for the newest strain of coronavirus behind the pandemic.Emerging evidence suggests that older children aged  and over can infect others with Covid in much the same way as adults, however, leading the World Health Organisation to update its guidance to advise that teenagers should wear facemasks in certain circumstances.There is less concern about the danger of the virus to children and adolescents per se. The evidence is overwhelming that the age group is at extremely low risk of serious illness or complications.The real alarm surrounds their potential to pass the infection on to adults on campus, or to bring it home to family members who may be a greater risk.Yet even this is unclear.: Fresh call to lt cap on medical school intake for A Public Health England study published on Sunday analysed outbreaks linked to primary and pre-school children during June.Of the million or so children attending,  children and  members of staff were infected in  separate outbreaks - but PHE said most had probably been caused by staff members infecting other staff members, with only two instances apparently linked to pupild infecting other pupils.However, a study by French epidemiologist Arnaud Fontanet at a school in France found that although younger age groups do not \"transmit to the same extent\", \"teenagers are just as contagious as adults\".Dr Simon Clarke, associate professor of cellular microbiology at the University of Reading, told the Independent that it was best to ldquoerr on the side of caution when discussing whether the coronavirus can be transmitted to adults by children.ldquoTherersquos not a mountain of evidence on both sides,\" he said. \"The fact is we know very little about this, precious little.The bottom line, however, is that our testing capacity has not kept pace with the predictable surge in demand caused by schools reopening.The same pattern is occurring in countries such as South Korea, where schools in Seoul were forced to close and revert back to distance learning this week after the th consecutive day of triple-digit daily increases in coronavirus cases. At least  students and teachers have tested positive over the past two weeks in the Seoul city region.Germany too was forced to completely or partially close some of its schools or quarantine pupils and teachers within days of the new term two weeks ago. In Berlin,  schools have been affected by Covid- cases.The messaging in Scotland was clear: schools could only open safely as long as anyone with possible symptoms stayed home and got tested straightaway.: Contact tracing will only prevent outbreakstesting carried out within  hours of symptomsModelling by academics from University College London and the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine predicted that reopening of schools in England in September could lead to a second, bigger wave of coronavirus by December unless a \"comprehensive test, trace and isolate strategy\" was in place. This took into account other factors - such as parents being freed up toto offices- but it illustrates the importance of sufficient and rapid testing capacity.The fact that our testing capacity has been overwhelmed so quickly - evensome of it is confusion among people told to self-isolate wrongly seeking tests - is far from ideal.On the plus side, the test results we do have so far indicate that Covid is only behind around one in every  cases of flu-like illness."},{"url":null,"title":"TV REVIEW   Location  Location  Location  20 Years and Counting  Has it been a show too long ","story":"Channel  All  ***I KNOW what you are thinking.

Sometimes they have even found properties people go on to buy. Mostly, though, each episode is a lesson in home-hunting reality: what the buyer can afford versus what they want. Everything is a compromise, except for the cardinal rule set out in the title.On that, Kirstie had some shock news. ldquoI bought in the wrong area, she told Phil as they reminisced about their first flats . Kirstiersquos mum thought the neighbourhood was safe, but the transport links were rubbish and it was a long way from her friends. So you see, Kirstie has been there, done that, and got the corns from a twice daily slog to and from a distant Tube station to show for it.: Kirsties Keep Crafting review The pair raced through house hunts down the years, starting with their first, a search for a one bed flat in central-ish London. Kate, the buyer, had pound, to spend. Today that would probably get you a part-share in a parking space.A laddish Phil and a foxy Kirstie, all knee high boots, swinging hair and shades, strode the London streets like Julie Burchill and Tony Parsons. Two hip young gunslingers taking on the world. Her voice was softer, her manner less confident. Phil hasnrsquot changed a bit, apart from the receding forehead.The essential building blocks of the show have stayed the same, too. ldquoWe headed to a quiet bar to think things through, said Phil in that first show. Cue the call to estate agents to put in a cheeky offer well under the asking price. Then the tense wait.Before getting to that point there were tours round houses, Kirstie being up front and pushy, Phil adopting a more softly-softly approach. Kirstie hated it when Phil said, as he did often, ldquoItrsquos up to them. Kirstie wanted to give buyers the stats on the best time to start a family so they would stop dithering about the number of bedrooms needed.We did not learn much that was new as Ben and Laura, Jess and Sam, and Michelle and Philip, followed the original Kate into the snakes and ladders game that is buying a house. But then after  years we have probably taken in Kirstie and Philrsquos advice by osmosis. Who does not know by now to look beyond the dreaded woodchip, or the value of knocking through : Which house was crowned Scotlands Home of the Year What we did leave with was a sense that Kirstie and Pip, as she calls him, have done well out of Location, Location, Location.

What a shameful position for anyone to take, either in a personal capacity or as a Scot.Scotlands economy has suffered a succession of catastrophic impacts at the hands of a succession of right-wing ideologically-driven governments, starting with Margaret Thatchers scrapping of Scotlands industrial capacity in the s, through the financial disaster of  and culminating with Brexit in . The fact that oil from Scotlands territory subsidised the de-industrialisation of the s and then supported the expansion of the City of Londons financial sector only underlines the irony of the position held by Ms Stephenson.Scotland will have the freedom to grow its economy only when it is free of interference by Westminster. The next catastrophe, of course, is going to be Brexit. Scotlands population has expanded steadily since ,, but that growth will stall as soon as Westminster is able to deny the immigration we need here. Scotlands GDP is considerably smaller than near neighbours with similar populations such as Norway, Denmark, Ireland and Finland, the reason for that is that these small independent countries can tailor their economies to their needs, not the needs of the city of London and the South East of England.Scotland doesnt need nuclear submarines, aircraft carriersor global military reach, all of which cost a lot more than the pound. billion that Ms Stephenson claims, but we do need infrastructure, health care, education and above all people to grow our economy.The GERS figures may seem to be a godsend to people who think like Ms Stephenson, but all they really do is underline the structural failures and weakness of the United Kingdoms economy.John Jamieson, Ayr.IT is sad to say that some who would refer to themselves as Scots appear proud of the fact that under the current constitutional arrangements Scotland seems, at least on a superficial level, to be \"subsidised\" by the rest of the UK. Of course not only is this assessment distorted because Wales, Northern Ireland and the North of England are apparently more heavily dependent on the largesse of Londoners, but because only tax revenues directly attributable to Scotland are included in Scottish revenues raised while non-directly attributable expenditures, such as defence, are pro-rated by Westminster.Of course the deliberately conjured smoke and mirrors hide the slanted workings of the UK economy which leverages resources from outside of the south-east of England to maximise the financial growth of London. Scotland was effectively in surplus for most of the last four decades but not only was no oil wealth fund created for the benefit of future generations, Scotland did not even obtain close to a population proportion of the massive infrastructure spending in and around London, an economically debilitating relative predicament which is set to continue for the foreseeable future . The people of Scotland are just as capable as those of our southern neighbour, but we can only prosper in accordance with our collective talents when we can invest all our resources in our own country.Stan Grodynski, Longniddry.THE annual furore over the GERS figures is now in predictable full swing.

He said that Scotland was \"the Belarus of the west ndash a small, sparsely populated appendage of England\".

Russia also, it is claimed, compromised the Scottish referendum on independence and the Brexit election that saw us leavethe EU. A civil airliner was brought down by Russian missiles killing  people.

I believe that OLA representing the cattle industry in Orkney can have a strong association with Moredun in the future.#Beth Wells, from Moredun, said “Through meetings we have been fortunate to meet many of Orkney’s livestock farmers, who are well known for their high quality beef production and we are delighted to be developing a closer working collaboration with OLA, which will be of huge benefit to both of our organisations.”OLA is a sub-group of HiHealth Herdcare which is a national cattle health scheme. Karen Johnston, from OLA, said: “We are delighted and very honoured to give our members the opportunity to benefit from expert information and support from such a prestigious and well respected organisation.  We are looking forward to seeing how this partnership progresses and the benefits it brings to Orkney farmers.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Unlike student nurses and midwives, however, those training to be a paramedic are not eligible for a bursary, despite being unable to take up part time work.  To add insult to injury, their counterparts in England do receive bursaries.“This lack of a level playing field risks putting off those we need to see coming into our health service.  The current arrangements do little to encourage young people to pursue a career as a paramedic and store up problems for the future.“When I wrote to the Health Secretary recently on behalf of a constituent, I was told the government has no plans to review the funding options for trainee paramedics. Today, Nicola Sturgeon said she would look into the matter, having also been approached by a young constituent, angry at the unequal treatment.“The First Minister needs to recognise that introducing a bursary scheme would make a real dference, not least in widening access to the profession.  It’s time the Scottish Government properly recognised the dedication of our trainee paramedics by putting them on the same footing as trainee nurses and midwives.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The infrastructure proposals have been designed to enable Orkney to manage a transition away from fossil fuels, while continuing to generate social and economic benefit from ongoing oil and gas activity.The proposals will have #transformational# impact on Orkney#s economy and society. As well as creating as many  new jobs, there will also be a substantial number of job opportunities during the construction phase.OIC leader James Stockan said: “Our vision is to build a truly sustainable business that is a core economic asset for Orkney, but also a first phase in enabling a scale of investment and logistical capability for the UK, which will be of international signicance.“Prime Minister Boris Johnson clearly welcomed our ambition and Orkney’s potential during his recent visit to our islands, describing as a ‘fantastic idea’ our vision for Orkney as a low-carbon, zero-emissions hub of innovation, with Scapa Flow at its heart.“We believe the time is right to maximise the incredible natural assets and geography of Scapa Flow and Orkney, to ensure a long-term sustainable future for our communities. We are open for business now, and ready to work with potential investors and operators to develop the signicant strategic and international opportunities Scapa Flow offers.“The Scapa Deep Water Quay proposal has been included in the Islands Deal list of projects that has received funding commitment from the Scottish and UK governments, and we are continuing to ensure that the funding earmarked for this will be secured.”Central to the project is the unique geographical advantage of Scapa Flow, described by the council as the largest natural deep-water harbour in the northern hemisphere, as the potential setting for internationally signicant marine logistics to serve the new and emerging sectors, including low-carbon fuel transition and offshore wind developments.Scapa Deep Water Quay is seen as the optimal location for construction and operations and maintenance activities, associated with offshore wind, as well as for a liquefied natural gasstorage and distribution hub. At the same time, this infrastructure has the capability to accommodate semi-submersible s of all types, giving Orkney a unique UK competitive edge within the existing oil and gas market.The project team believes it could be delivered by . Other proposals, such as Hatston and Kirkwall, could take three or four years to deliver.Phase two will ultimately develop the islands’ smaller harbours and piers across the islands.Harbour users and key stakeholders were consulted from the outset, to help gain an understanding of the issues, constraints and opportunities associated with harbour infrastructure around Orkney, through workshops and interviews. The range of stakeholders includes local communities, harbour users, potential funders and environmental bodies such as Scottish Natural Heritage.Harbourmaster James Buck added: “Tackling decarbonisation is the strand that binds these proposals together, providing infrastructure and knowledge for renewable energy developments around our waters will allow us to reach climate change targets. “We will also look at the potential for net environmental gain through habitat reinstatement and enhancement.”According to the OIC, Orkney Harbours is one of the most erse and successful council-run port authorities in the UK, with an annual turnover of £ million and nearly , annual vessel movements.The council added that the exact timing of construction for each of the phase one masterplan proposals is not yet known.This will be determined over the next six to  months, and will depend on a range of factors including market requirements, funding and environmental considerations.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Many attendees showed up wearing T-shirts bearing the image and words of the late US congressman John Lewis who, until his death last month, was the last living speaker at the original March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom, which went on to become one of the most famous political rallies in US history and one of the largest gatherings at the nationrsquos capital with over , people advocating for social change.The thousands of participants that were streaming in for the march late on Friday morning stood in queues that stretched for several streets, as organisers insisted on taking temperatures as part of coronavirus protocols. Organisers reminded attendees to practise social distancing and wear masks throughout the programme.Later in the day, Martin Luther King III, a son of the late civil rights hero and the Reverend Al Sharpton, whose civil rights organisation, the National Action Network, planned the event, are expected to deliver keynote addresses that show the urgency for federal policing reforms, to decry racial violence, and to demand voting rights protections ahead of the November general election. vw,vw,px, px\"People attend the March on Washington And to underscore the urgency, Rev Sharpton has assembled the families of an ever-expanding roll call of victims including Mr Blake, George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, Rayshard Brooks, Ahmaud Arbery, Trayvon Martin, and Eric Garner, among others.Mr Arbery and Mr Martin were both killed by white men who pursued them with guns.Following the commemorative rally, participants will march to the Martin Luther King Jr memorial in West Potomac Park, next to the National Mall, and then disperse. vw,vw,px, px\"Martin Luther King Jr delivered his historic I Have A Dream address at the steps of the Lincoln Memorial Turnout in Washington was expected be lighter than initially intended due to city-imposed coronavirus pandemic restrictions that limit out-of-state visitors to the nationrsquos capital. To that end, the National Action Network organised a handful of satellite march events in South Carolina, Florida and Nevada, among others.While participants march in Washington, Rev Sharpton has called for those in other states to march on their US senatorsrsquo offices and demand their support of federal policing reforms. Rev Sharpton said protesters should also demand reinvigorated US voter protections, in memory of the late congressman John Lewis who, until his death on July , was the last living speaker at the original march.In June, the Democrat-controlled House of Representatives passed the George Floyd Justice In Policing Act, which would ban police use of stranglehold manoeuvres and end qualied immunity for officers, among other reforms. Mr Floyd, a black man, died on May  after a white police officer in Minneapolis held a knee to the manrsquos neck for nearly eight minutes, sparking weeks of sustained protests and unrest.Comments are closed on this article.copy -.

But what of other aspects What of community resilience, something I suspect will barely register as a priority for most us when deciding on our weekly shop It may be the case that more people will try and grow more of their own food and local produce will, hopefully, be in greater demand.All very welcome. But what’s really needed is a completely fresh approach to our behaviour as consumers.As the pound in our pocket becomes ever more stretched we need to value it in terms of what benefit it can bring to the wider collective # who can it support, what should it support and how can that can bring about greater resilience within our own communities.It’s not radical or revolutionary. It’s just about taking a bit more time and effort to think about where best to spend our cash, especially when it comes to our most basic of needs.It can’t possibly make sense to get your Sunday roast from the supermarketthe same cut of meat is available at your local butcher at a comparable price . And especiallythat butcher has sourced his meat from the crofter down the road.It takes a bit of extra effort to call in at the butcher, for sure, but add in important elements like food miles and provenance and there really is no excuse, except for our own inherent laziness.It has always amazed me how there is any fish at all on the shelves of supermarkets in this part of the world when the local fishmongers offer far higher quality at a lower price.And, in any case, it’s now perfectly possible to buy direct from the fisherman, with many of them now offering sales to the public.That may have come about through the closure of their overseas markets during lockdown, but what better example of necessity being the mother of invention.If west-coast prawns were coveted by sophisticated palates on the Mediterranean, then they should be more than adequate for consumption a bit closer to home.It’s not that long ago that our communities were completely self-reliant in food.We do demand a more discerning choice these days # no-one would want toto a diet made up entirely of fish, mutton and potatoes.But, with an abundance of quality produce on our own doorstep, surely it makes sense to take more advantage of that and in the process create greater community resilience through sourcing from independent, local retailers.If there’s a downside to that approach, I fail to see it.ONE aspect that looks certain to change, certainly for the foreseeable, is that there will be less air travel.Through the lockdown it is estimated that carbon emissions have been reduced by over  per cent by planes being grounded alone.That’s not even taking account of reductions in car journeys and it is a staggering figure from just one simple change.There are certain elements in the environmental lobby who would have you believe that methane emissions from cattle make a signicant contribution to climate change.Never mind that bovineshave roamed the land for thousands of years without causing much harm.Never mind that it’s only the last  or  years, as our economy became ever reliant on fossil fuels, that the damage to our planet has been made.The reduction in air travel will be for economic, more than environmental, reasons.But the staggering statistics of these last few months should at least mean that when it comes to a real determination in tackling environmental damage the finger of blame will be pointed in the right direction.Then again, maybe cows are a much easier target."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image.jpg","title":"royal celtic societys unique music","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineWork has begun on processing the twenty entries received for a unique competition which set the country’s musicians the challenge of creating a new shinty composition.

Kerry McWilliams, the founder of Lightwork NI, a charity that has provided more than  sessions of direct support to families over the past two months, said the crossover between school and family le was a major issue for many of the people she has worked with throughout the pandemic. Kerry said they have found that while children were largely able to keep in touch with the outside world and their peers through the likes of social media, many were uncomfortable being taught by their parents. And she said the stresses experienced by some groups of parents, such as key workers or those who had lost their income, made it more dficult for adults to support their children effectively. Home schooling was a cause of signicant conflict and distress, she said. Parents told us they found it very dficult to get children to do the work children told us they were afraid of being found out.One nine-year-old boy told me, #I don#t want to do school work with my parents because they think I#m really smart and they#re going to find out I#m not - I get good marks because I cheat and copy and when they see I can#t do the work they#re going to know#. This was a common fear for children - a sense of discomfort as school invaded their homes and family relationships. Most children like to keep school and home separate. Parents felt exposed and vulnerable as they were unable to understand or support their children#s learning.Many couldn#t access ICT equipment or provide internet access for multiple children and this led to frustration. She continued: We have lived through a global pandemic, a moment in history unprecedented in modern society. Families I have worked with have all moved through paralysing fear, powerlessness and panic. They have taken a fresh look at what makes them happy, what is worth fighting for - we all realised it#s not toilet roll - and how far they have sleepwalked into a le they wouldn#t have consciously chosen, and don#t really want to go back to. I believe the legacy and consequences of lockdown will be signicant for everyone both in the immediate future and for many years to come.She said there are a number of steps parents can take in the coming weeks and months to ensure their children cope with theto school, including drawing upon the relationships that were built during lockdown and ensuring children#s voices are heard. She also recommended putting in place routines and precautions to ensure everyone feels safe: Then you can stop worrying. Our worries communicate to children - when you feel confident and optimistic, they will too.

However, not all parents noty us that their children are home educated.Read More Cover up in the school corridor: Northern Ireland#s post-primary pupils should wear masks outside class at all times, says Education Minister Home schooling #biggest cause of family stress#During the - academic year, the EA was notied of  young people as being home-schooled with a further  from April . The Home Education in the North West group also reported an increased interest from parents.Some have jumped at the opportunity and have already sent in their deregisteration letters to their schools, a spokesperson said. Others are now seriously considering keeping their kids home and have joined the group to test the waters.Offering advice, the spokesperson said that home-schooled children still have plenty of opportunities for socialising and that parents can tailor teaching.She added that families should establish a timetable that fits their routine, to make the most of one-to-one attention and use a mixture of online resources and traditional learning.Making use of the local library, spending more time learning outdoors and getting in touch with other home school families in the area was also recommended.Experienced home schooler Susan Keenanfrom east Belfast took her sons Benand Tomout of class for two years, travelling to the Far East with her husband Michael .This term they are ing to class by choice at Sullivan Upper, but Susan said she fully understands why more parents will want to continue lessons at home.Ben started back into fourth year and Tom is due to start third year. Tom#s happy to go back while Ben#s not so sure it#s what he wants to do, she said.So I#ve told him just to try it and see how he feels about it, andhe wants to continue with home schooling he can.She added: I think after lockdown a lot more parents have realised how much you can get done on a one-to-one basis.You can get through the curriculum much quicker at home, but then there is the socialising aspect at school. But I don#t know how much socialising there#s really going to be at the minute.Kids will be in their bubbles and only mixing in their own class.While acknowledging home schooling wasn#t for everyone, she disagreed it damaged future job prospects.Absolutely not, because I do think a lot more rounded learning goes on at home rather than the rote learning you do to get ready for your exams.I know when we went away with our children they learnt about dferent cultures and religions, food and more.So I do think you need to encourage your children to get their qualications in case they want to go university and we didn#t want our decisions to negatively impact on any future choices they will have.

Ralph HewittTwitterEmailAugust   : PMFacebookTwitterEmailTwo of Northern Ireland#s top GPs have urged as many people as possible to get their flu jab this year amid the Covid- pandemic but fear the logistical challenges of administering it.The government plans to double the number of people who receive the influenza jab. The aim is to increase the number of vaccinations from m to m across the UK. Stormont has a target of vaccinating % of vulnerable health groups below the age of . But last year, only % of that group received the jab, while the proportion of at-risk under s vaccinated fell by  percentage points between  and .Chief Medical Officer Dr Michael McBride said that m flu jabs will be available here.The chair of the Royal College of General Practitioners for Northern Ireland, Dr Laurence Dorman, said the upcoming flu jab campaign is the most important ever, as it will be very dficult telling the dference between people with flu and Covid- symptoms - although it#s possible to have both at the same time. He added that flu is a killer anyway so it#s really important that everybody gets their flu jab but this year is even more important than ever.With GPs trying to vaccinate as many patients as possible, Dr Dorman added that the problem will then become doing it safely.We need to get patients through as quickly and as safely as possible, said Dr Dorman. We can#t have people congregating in corridors and surgeries so it is going to be more challenging.We#re actively looking at ways to deal with that. We don#t have the final decision yet but things that we#re looking at are drive-thru clinics, sports halls, church halls and all of those options. It will be challenging.West Belfast GP Dr George O#Neill also felt the major problem facing practices is providing the vaccine in a safe and efficient way.How do you ensure that you don#t contaminate your premises  he said. You could end up having to close down for a deep clean and quarantine some of your staff. There are big issues involved.

It is an eyewatering sum, but it is indicative that health officials are desperate to address the situation. National headlines scream about growing waiting times, of patients languishing on waiting lists - according to most recent figures, .m people in NHS England have breached the nine-week waiting list target. While it is clearly a lot of people, it actually pales in comparison when you look at the figures for Northern Ireland. The Department of Health here published its latest waiting time statistics on Thursday and they basically confirmed what we already knew - that local patients and staff are being routinely failed by a system that is just not fit for purpose. Almost , people here were waiting longer than nine weeks for a first outpatient appointment at the end of June. This means that five times as many people in Northern Ireland are waiting longer than nine weeks for their first hospital appointment per head of the population than their counterparts across the water. Of course, it is nothing new that people here appear to be on the receiving end of an inferior service compared to people in England. In  one of the most prominent doctors in the UK lambasted waiting times here.He said his patients in England would never stand for the delays that had become commonplace here. Fast-forward eight years and the situation has done nothing but deteriorate. Add the effects of Covid- into the mix and it isn#t too much of a stretch to say the health service is on its knees. As health bosses prepared for an influx of critically ill patients of epic proportions as a result of the pandemic, thousands of clinics, diagnostic tests and operations were cancelled. There is little sign that things are going to resume anytime soon with all but the most urgent of cases still being delayed as the threat of a second Covid- wave looms large. Meanwhile, last month patients waiting for operations were dealt a blow when a surgeon said his colleagues were twiddling their thumbs due to a lack of experienced theatre nurses and warned it was likely to be next year before services get back up and running properly. With a lack of hospital beds, winter pressures just around the corner, staff shortages and the pandemic rumbling on, waiting lists are not going to improve anytime soon. According to the figures released yesterday, just under % of the , patients waiting for a first outpatient appointment in June had been waiting longer than a year. Given the challenges facing the service in the months ahead, it is more than likely that will rise further by the time the next statistics are released. Much-needed reform of the service, which will help to address waiting times, is under way, but the absence of a fully al Assembly for a few years hindered much of the progress.

This continues to be the biggest public health crisis in a generation.“Any complacency presents a challenge to us all,”He said there has been a “blatant disregard” for Covid- regulations by some in the hospitality sector.“If you flout the rules you must face the consequences,” he told the Stormont news conference.While praising Hospitality Ulster for their lead in the industry, the Minister said he will now propose to his executive colleagues that legislation should be strengthened to punish those premises who have been flouting restrictions.Chief Scientic Adviser Professor Ian Young said that while Antrim and Newtownabbey continues to see the most new cases of Covid-, there is growing concern over the number of cases in Belfast.“Our low point was the beginning of July when we were experiencing three to four cases of the virus per day,” he says.“Now that is almost  cases per day on average.“The highest incidence of cases recently has been in Mid and East Antrim, but the area he is most concerned about is Belfast, where the number of caes is is rising “consistently and steadily”.“Cases of the virus per day have increased more than tenfold since early July.“At present most of those cases are in younger people and show hospital admissions and bed occupancy are growing slowly,” he said.“Nonetheless it is clear that the virus is spreading and is everywhere in Northern Ireland.”Following two recent Covid- outbreaks at Craigavon Hospital, the Health Minister told the briefing that further clusters hospitals “are inevitable” and he warned that there will be a dficult winter ahead.“We must stick together as a society,” he said.And responding to news that , people in Northern Ireland are waiting for a first consultant appointment, the minister described waiting times as “totally and absolutely intolerable”.“I won’t try to defend them as they are indefensible,” he said, adding that while the pandemic had “blown plans off course” for tackling waiting lists, all Health trusts were still working towards delivering the New Decade New Approach plan announced in January.Belfast Related ContentCoronavirusCoronavirus Northern Ireland: Swann pledges to tackle #atrocious# hospital waiting times as one new death confirmedHealth minister Robin Swann has said he is working to tackle atrocious hospital waiting times but said further outbreaks and clusters in healthcare settings are inevitable as winter months approach.

Education Minister Peter Weir is recommending that school children should wear face coverings in corridors FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappPupils from Bloomfield Collegiate in Belfast wearing face coverings. By Steven AlexanderAugust   : AMFacebookTwitterEmailEducation Minister Peter Weir has announced that guidance on face coverings will be updated to include a recommendation to wear them in corridors of post-primary schools.This will come into effect on August  when schoolson a full-time basis.Pupils ing to school in England will not be required to wear face coverings, with Downing Street saying yesterday there were no plans to change the guidance. The World Health Organisation and UN children#s agency Unicef advise that children aged  and over should wear a mask under the same conditions as adults, in particular when they cannot guarantee at least a one-metre distance from others and there is widespread transmission in the area.The Schools Standards Minister in England Nick Gibb had indicated that hygiene measures put in place in classes meant masks were not required. Mr Gibb told the BBC: If a school puts in place the measures that are in the guidance that we issued in early July, all the hygiene measures that I#ve been talking about, then masks are not necessary for staff or pupils. England#s deputy chief medical officer Jenny Harries said the evidence on whether children over  should wear masks in schools was not strong. However, older pupils in Scotland will be required to wear face coverings in between lessons from next week.Face coverings should be worn by staff and pupils when moving around secondary schools in Scotland from August , according to Holyrood#s Education Secretary.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseEducation Minister Peter Weir is recommending that school children should wear face coverings in corridors FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappEducation Minister Peter Weir is recommending that school children should wear face coverings in corridorsJohn Swinney said that the rule will apply on school transport for primary school pupils aged five and above, and all those at secondary school in communal areas, but not in classrooms.Previous advice in Northern Ireland had made it mandatory for all pupils aged  and over to wear a face covering on public transport, or when large numbers of staff or pupils gathered within an enclosed space where social distancing was not possible.However, they were not generally recommended for routine use in schools.But last night Mr Weir said: Following further advice which I have received today from the Chief Medical Officer and the Chief Scientic Adviser, I am recommending that pupils and teachers wear a face covering in corridors and other communal areas of post-primary schools from next week when schoolsfull-time.The current public health advice is that the use of face coverings provides some benefits however, it is not a replacement for frequent hand washing, social distancing where possible, covering your mouth and nose when you cough or sneeze and regular cleaning of surfaces. It is also important to remember that evidence suggests that the risk of transmission in schools is relatively low compared to some other settings.My existing guidance on the reopening of schools already deals with the use of face coverings. In terms of school transport, the advice remains the same, that we strongly recommend that all pupils wear a face covering on all dedicated school transport including buses and taxis where it is appropriate for them to do so.In relation to communal areas in schools, the guidance already strongly encourages face coverings for activities that entail large numbers of staff or pupils within an enclosed space where social distancing is not possible. Given the risk mitigations in place in schools to limit and contain the spread of Covid-, face coverings are not recommended as being compulsory for routine use in education settings. However, staff and pupils may wish to use them during the routine school day and this is acceptable. Schools should also be aware that some personsare exempt from wearing face coverings.I will continue to keep all guidance in respect of education settings under review in light of the latest medical and scientic advice.Sinn Fein MLA John O#Dowd has said the decision should have been introduced with immediate effect.The Upper Bann MLA and former Education Minister said: The safety of children and young people while at school is an absolute priority for everyone.New guidance from the World Health Organisation has strongly recommended the need to introduce the wearing of face coverings in secondary schools.While the decision to introduce the wearing of face coverings in school corridors, communal areas and school transport is welcome, it should be implemented immediately, not with any delay.This latest move by the Minister is yet another example of lack of clear decision-making and guidance which has caused confusion for parents, teachers and students.Belfast Most ReadShock as popular businessman Raymond Turkington dies in Co Tyrone crashEamonn Holmes faces criticism over #Rule Britannia# slavery debateMuch-loved Park Avenue Hotel that once hosted Arnold Schwarzenegger closes its doorsCoronavirus: Plan to crack down on Northern Ireland pubs amid virus #nightmare# PSNI issues nine prohibition notices to pubs breaching coronavirus guidelines,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Stanley Beckett from Waringstown has been a member of Kilmore LOL  since he was . He has also served  years in the Royal Black Preceptory and the Apprentice Boys. Despite his advancing years and mobility issues, he had never missed a Twelfth celebration until this year, when they were cancelled because of the pandemic. And plans for a large th birthday party at his beloved Kilmore Orange Hall tonight have also had to be put on hold due to the health restrictions. Instead Stanley will celebrate at home with his two daughters, two granddaughters and two great-granddaughters. A well-known face around Waringstown in Co Down, he moved from his home town of Portadown to live in the village after marrying his late we Edith  years ago. The couple had been wed  years when she passed away in  aged . They have two girls, Carol and Sylvia. Stanley is the only surviving member of  siblings. He worked for most of his le in the Co-op.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseStanley with late we Edith and daughters Carol and Sylvia FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappStanley with late we Edith and daughters Carol and SylviaHe retired as manager of its Portadown branch in . He then worked part-time in his brother#s sports and work wear shop Sidney Beckett#s in Lurgan. Although now less mobile, Stanley believes the key to a long le is keeping active - cycling to work to save the bus fare for family holidays in Portrush, tending his vegetable garden, reading, and the odd wee Black Bush. He said: I have a half-acre of garden and I have grown everything in it since  until I was  and couldn#t look after it any more. I haven#t had to buy a vegetable in all that time. One year I was able to freeze lb of peas and lb of beans. I still enjoy reading, although I haven#t had my books changed since March because the mobile library has stopped. I usually read  books a month, mostly westerns or thrillers. I stopped smoking when I was  but I still enjoy the odd glass of Black Bush. Daughter Carol Gardiner fondly remembers her dad#s dedication to his family. She said: Dad was always active and cycled to work in Dunmurry from Waringstown and back for years to save the bus fare so that he could take us on holiday to Portrush. He remembers one year the weather was so bad that we spent most of our time in Barry#s amusements. When the holiday was over he had just six pence in his pocket. Looking back through his le, Stanley remembers a miners# strike of the late s when there was no coal and people used a mixture of sawdust and slack to fuel their fires. However, it is service in the Orange, Black and Apprentice Boys which he said has given him great memories and many friends over the years. He was also a bass drummer with Kilmore Flute Band for  years. Stanley has held numerous offices in each of the dferent groups including lodge grand master and chairman of the Apprentice Boys Mid Ulster Amalgamated committee. He was devastated when the Twelfth had to be cancelled this year, making it the first he had missed in over  years. One of the highlights of his birthday today will be receiving a card from the Queen. He and his we received one on their th wedding anniversary and again on heir th.

He tells Liam Tunney his gripping story, outlining his reasons for wanting to break the stigma of addictionA County Derry man has spoken of his experience with addiction as he prepares for a fundraising challenge in aid of the organisation who helped him deal with it. Dean Groogan, from Ballinascreen, is raising money for the Cuan Mhuire rehabilitation centre in Newry by climbing the seven peaks of the Mourne Mountains this weekend with a number of friends. The -year-old, well-known in south Derry for his story-telling and recitation talent, has spoken about his story to encourage others who may be struggling to seek the help they need. “I know a lot of people that need help, but they dont know where to get it or how to go about it,” he told the County Derry Post. googletag.cmd.push “I wasnt originally going to talk about myself, but I was talking to my girlfriend and people close to me and they said, why are you beating about the bush  “They saidI wanted to break the stigma, I had to be straight and honest, and it made sense. The more I tell my story, itll help people come forward and get help themselves.” Dean had been struggling with drug addiction for a number of years before attending the Newry rehabilitation centre, and says the continued fight to cover up his problems took its toll. “For a lot of years I was struggling. I can make all the excuses in the world about mental health problems, anxiety, depression and guilt, but I got deep into addiction with fake highs,” he said. googletag.cmd.push “I was covering up for a lot of years. I can wear a hundred and one masks and people would think I was in great form, but deep down I was a broken person. “I was hiding that for a long time and I tried a thousand times to get myself sorted, but I would not do it on my own. “It was put to me a few times about getting residential help, but I didnt want it, because it was a pride thing for me. I was embarrassed people would find out. “Eventually I had to put my hands up and say I needed help. I didnt lose my job or my family, so it wasnt rock bottom that way, but emotionally, I was at rock bottom. “I didnt know where to go, I was just a broken person in the depths of depression. Just a broken man. I had to get help and Cuan Mhuire was a le-saver for me.” Dean and Pat McGinn met up a few weeks ago to record a video about Cuan Mhuire. Dean was introduced to Pat McGinn, a former Lord Mayor of Newry and someone who had been through Cuan Mhuire previously. He admits though, thatit wasnt for the intervention of his girlfriend Emma, and close family and friends, he might not have taken that step. “Cuan Mhuire saved my le, andit hadnt been for my girlfriend Emma and my close family and friends, I wouldnt have gone,” he said. “I wont say Cuan Mhuire did it all for me, because they dont just put a magic wand over your head and say thats you free, because you have to put in the work yourself. “I went in and gave it my all and Cuan Mhuire gave me three months to get my head sorted, myself straight, allowed me to recharge the batteries and I came out a dferent man.” Cuan Mhuire was set up in  by Sister Consilio in Athy, County Kildare. The Newry centre was built in  and originally catered for those suffering from alcohol addiction. These days, the spectrum of addiction is much wider. “In this day and age, its not as simple as a man lying drunk in the street. Drugs are everywhere, in every bar you go into, and its so easy for a young person to get hooked on something,” said Dean. “They try it for a bit of craic and the next thing they know, its a few months down the line and theyre in something they cant get out of. It destroys lives. “Drugs are a new thing, people dont really understand. I was speaking to a man who was drinking for years. He said he never touched drugs, butthey had been about in his day he probably would have. “Its so easily available these days and it wrecks families. It rips the soul clean out of you. For me, I detested myself. I knew what I was doing was wrong and that it was wrecking my le. “I just couldnt stop. Addiction is something that you cant get enough of, but that you detest. It was just ruining me and Cuan Mhuire was a le-saver for me.” The Cuan Mhuire centre in Newry. On Saturday, August , Dean and a group of friends will climb the seven peaks of the Mourne Mountains to raise money for the centre. They are already well on the way to their pound, target, and are hoping the trip will be a fun way of raising money and awareness for Cuan Mhuire. “Eight of us are going to start off at six in the morning and tackle the highest peaks in the Mournes,” said the Ballinascreen native. “I know a few boys that have done it in around  or  hours, but were not going to break any records! There are a few men going to meet us halfway up and do us a barbeque, so itll be a days craic as well. “I know money donated to the charity is great, but stigma is the main thing, so Ill be pushing online about the residential care for people suffering with drugs, gambling or drink.” Dean wants to ensure that anyone who finds themselves in need of help knows where to access it, and is especially keen to help men who may be struggling and reluctant to act. “As men, we bottle a lot of things up, personal things like depression or anxiety and people turn to drink or drugs or other highs to mask them things,” he said. “They are taught from no age not to show any emotions, to bottle it up and be a man, and thats not the reality. Theyre turning to other substances to mask the pain and thats just not the way to go. “This is to let them know that places like Cuan Mhuire are out there and will help themthey come forward. “Anything can go through that door thats one thing I found out about it. There are all dferent age groups and all dferent backgrounds and religions. “There are people with plenty of money and people with none. There were even a few people who were homeless whose families want nothing to do with them. “Addiction doesnt care who you are, it will come for you regardless. Putting yourself out there warts and all isnt easy, butit helps someone, thats the reason for doing it.” For more information, visit the Mourne Mountain Challenge Facebook page, where you can find links to the Just Giving page, for those wishing to donate.

The colleges smart new unorm includes a blazer and jumper piped in gold which can be worn with a skirt or trousers. School principal, Martine Mulhern, said the new look came about after pupils said they wanted to be able to decide which they wanted to wear. A lot of the girls prefer to wear a skirt, but they said other pupils should have the choicethey want to wear trousers, she said. The whole idea of respecting other peoples choices is very important. googletag.cmd.push Last year the school council surveyed the pupils who voted overwhelmingly in favour of introducing a trouser option. This led to a long process of designing the new unorm, with the pupils allowed their say in how it should look and feel. The conversation started with Hunters Apparel in Derry who gave us dferent designs and that solid groundwork allowed us to get to the place where we are today, said Mrs Mulhern. The girls were so mature and insightful throughout it all. They knew and understood that there were certain things we couldnt do, but it was so important they felt comfortable. googletag.cmd.push There were a few prototypes before we got to the finished designs, but everyone is delighted with them. They are all loving the new blazer because its very smart and really brightens things up, and a surprising number of them have decided to take the option of wearing trousers. StCecilias worked closely with local unorm suppliers Max Fashions and Select Kidz to keep the cost of the new unorm, which has been adopted by the new intake, down. There will be a gradual phasing out of the old unorm over the coming years. The girls are loving the new unorm and as a school community we are so proud of them for taking the lead, added Mrs Mulhern. The children always come first and we have to listen to them. It was the right thing to do.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Micky Doherty was presented with the Foyle Pride Mark Ashton Award for Outstanding Contribution to the LGBTQ+ community by the citys real Mayor, SDLP Councillor Brian Tierney, at a ceremony at the Holywell Trusts Garden of Remembrance on Saturday night. A spokesperson for Foyle Pride said Mr Doherty, who fronts the citys Pride parade each year, was a truly deserving winner who does so much, for not only the LGBTQ+ community, but also the wider city and district community. Mr Doherty is a tireless charity fundraiser and helped set up a special fund to help local people in need during the oronavirus crisis. googletag.cmd.push Im known in the local area as being a charity fundraiser-theres a charity fundraiser Ill host it, said Mr Doherty. Its just part of me that I like helping people. During lockdown I knew people had started to struggle and they were coming to me and I started to think about how I could help. Because I have been working with charities for a long time people put their trust in me. Mr Doherty was hosting a drive through bingo event last week when he got a phone call to say he had won the Foyle Pride award. I just burst out crying, he admitted. I really didnt expect it so I was just overwhelmed. googletag.cmd.push I just have so much gratitude for the award and for everyone who nominated me and I want to thank them all. Mr Doherty said he wished his late mum, Cathy, could have been there on Saturday to see him receive his award. Its hard to accept that my mammy couldnt be there, he said. Its just not the same without her but I am still filled with so much gratitude for it, he said. Derry LGBT+ campaigner, Suzanna Toland, who passed away earlier this year, was remembered at Saturdays ceremony. It was really nice to see Suzanna recognised for everything that she did, said Micky. She was a very special person.Before she passed away she had set up an LGBT+ disco at Rosie Joes so that people would have a safe place to socialise.   --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The guidance, announced this evening by Peter Weir, comes into effect from August . The Minister said: “My key priority is that pupilsto school on a full-time basis, as soon as it is safe to do so. “Following further advice which I have received today from the Chief Medical Officer and the Chief Scientic Adviser, I am recommending that pupils and teachers wear a face covering in corridors and other communal areas of post-primary schools from next week when schoolsfull-time. googletag.cmd.push ”This updates the existing guidance on the use of face coverings in educational settings. “The current public health advice is that the use of face coverings provides some benefits, however, it is not a replacement for frequent hand washing, social distancing where possible, covering your mouth and nose when you cough or sneeze and regular cleaning of surfaces. “It is also important to remember that evidence suggests that the risk of transmission in schools is relatively low compared to some other settings. “My existing guidance on the reopening of schools already deals with the use of face coverings. “In terms of school transport, the advice remains the same, that we strongly recommend that all pupils wear a face covering on all dedicated school transport including buses and taxis where it is appropriate for them to do so. googletag.cmd.push “In relationto communal areas in schools, the guidance already strongly encourages face coverings for activities that entail large numbers of staff or pupils within an enclosed space where social distancing is not possible.  “Given the risk mitigations in place in schools to limit and contain the spread of Covid-, face coverings are not recommended as being compulsory for routine use in education settings. “However, staff and pupils may wish to use them during the routine school day and this is acceptable. “Schools should also be aware that some personsare exempt from wearing face coverings. “I will continue to keep all guidance in respect of education settings under review in light of the latest medical and scientic advice. Peter Weir added: “The first step in keeping our schools safe is that anyone with symptoms should not attend school. Parents should not send their children to schoolthey have any of the Covid- symptoms including: a high temperaturea new, continuous cougha loss or change to your sense of smell or taste.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Next month, he will be begin to study Sports Psychology at Liverpool John Moores University, with the long-term goal of helping special needs athletes prepare mentally and phsyically for sport. “The College teams up with local sporting organisations, giving us the option of volunteering with them,” said Oisiacuten, who plays Gaelic Football for St Martins GAC in Desertmartin. googletag.cmd.push “This gives me the opportunity to work with some fantastic groups, including Magherafelt Marvels Special Olympics Clubs and Peace Players which promotes ersity through sport. “The practical sessions could sometimes push you out of your comfort zone which was always a good learning experience.” Oisiacutens was awarded the Inspirational Student of the Year award at the end of his first year at the College and while lockdown put sport on hold, he continued to volunteer with Magherafelt Marvels. “Volunteering with the Special Olypmics has given me greater confidence in my own ability and reinforced the importance of giving clear instructions and listering to others,” he said. googletag.cmd.push “We kept in touch and posted home videos on Facebook so the athletes could continue their training at home during the lockdown.” Bronagh ONeill, Sports lecturer at Northern Regional College, said she was delighted with Oisiacutens success. “Oisin was a pleasure to have in the class and the accolade ‘Inspirational Student of the Year’ was so well deserved,” she said. “He was quite shy when he started the course, so it was great to watch him progress and grow in confidence. “He really benefited from volunteering with the Magherafelt Marvels but they have also benefited from his expertise and enthusiasm. I wish him every success at university and in his future career.“ Northern Regional College offers a range of full-time and part-time Sports courses.

Mrs Patricia Herron, Music Co-ordinator at St Eoghans Primary School, Draperstown, has watched Daras talent grow and develop from an early age. “He was maybe P or P when I realised that there might be a little voice in there that needs to be heard,” she told the County Derry Post. “The routine in our school would be that I askany children want to have a go at auditioning for a solo piece, so Dara would come up to the piano and this beautul, soft, quiet voice would come out. googletag.cmd.push “He sang solo at ious religious ceremonies as well, but it was really towards the end of P when his voice was developing so much more. “He was using a lot of ornamentation and trills and it came to light when he was singing an Irish song, with the traditional voice.” It was while singing an Irish song at his primary school show that the wider community began to take notice of the -year-olds phenomenal talent.

Hes very grounded and so are his family.” Daras exploits in The Voice Kids competition have enthused pupils and staff alike at a school where they take performance and the wholistic view of the child seriously. “In St Eoghans, we place a lot of importance on performing, and getting to know childrens talents, discover what they are and develop them,” said Mrs Herron. “Some schools think nowadays that concerts and opportunities to perform take away from learning time, but that is when you learn things like resilience, self-confidence and self-esteem. “The children from this area seem to be very musical and its an important part of our school, but Dara is such an inspiration. “From Primary  right up to Pimary , and indeed the staff, they just want to be like Dara. Any chance to sing now in school, Ill have a line of about a hundred children waiting to audition for a solo part!” After securing his place in the final with a beautul rendition of Sineacutead OConnors Nothing Compares  U on Saturday, Dara will take on fellow contestants George Elliott, Victoria Alsina and Justine Afante in the final. Coach Paloma Faith described his voice at the weekend as one of pure beauty and his primary school music teacher agrees. “To see a young child come in in P, get to be such an amazing singer by the time he leaves school, and then to excel and develop, I just cant wait to see what the future holds for him,” she said. “I heard him in an interview, and one of the lines he used was, I just want people to listen to my voice. “Now people have heard it and theyre sitting up, waiting to hear what comes next.” You can watch Dara in the final of the The Voice Kids this Saturday, August , at .pm on ITV.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

It is understood that the mystery vessel was bought for pound with the unknown owner planning to convert it into an Airbnb boat.  Foyle Search and Rescue , the police and other relevant agencies responded to reports of the boat being stuck on Sunday when they offered the crew assistance. The vessel, Day Dawn N , was last known to be engaged in fishing. according to the Marine Traffic website. Another site, Vessel Finder, also states that it received the latest position of the boat at .pm on August . googletag.cmd.push FSR were tasked on Sunday last, following reports of a grounded vessel. Pat Carlin, of FSR, said the boat was likely to be there until mid-September when the tide would be high enough for it to re-float. “She’s stuck solid,” he added. “We went and assessed the boat, determined that the crew were safe and passed that information on to the police service,” Mr Carlin explained “We provided them with some basic supplies that they needed and basically the vessel is grounded and can’t be move until the tide is lted. “All relevant services were notied and are aware that it’s there.” googletag.cmd.push Mr Carlin continued: “I think they were up on the council pontoon and to the best of my knowledge they may have come from outside the area, I don’t know exactly. “They’ll have no choice but to wait, maybe with the sudden floods tonightthey’ll be lucky and might get re-floated otherwise they’ll have to wait until the tides are high enough.” The PSNI confirmed that police assisted partners, including FSR and Coastguard in liaising with the crew. A report from , shows that Day Dawn N  was bought for the purposes of fishing from Portavogie. It was said to be the first time the vessel had been based anywhere  apart from Kilkeel since her arrival in  from Banff where the wooden-hulled boat was built by John Watt  Sons as a trawler. Harbour master at Portavogie, Neil Warnock, yesterday said Day Dawn was based there but left a couple of months ago. “Somebody bought it for a pleasure craft,” he explained. “It’s not a fishing boat any more, the licence on it was sold off a while ago there. “The last I heard the boat was in Portrush, I saw a picture of it at Portrush harbour after it left here.” At Portrush, the assistant harbour master said the boat owner was only there for three days and he believed the man travelled from the Greencastle direction. He was trying to get himself a permanent mooring, he said, but wasn’t able to secure it. The owner left Portrush heading towards Derry where he tried to get a mooring in the town and ended up on the mud flats. “I just know that he bought that for pound. None of the fishermen like decommissioning so they basically would rather they go off. “So I think he bought it for a pound and wanted to change it into an Air B ‘n’ B, but we couldn’t offer him a permanent mooring in Portrush, so he was only here for three days,” the Assistant Harbour Master added. Meanwhile, a spokesperson for Foyle Port added: “Foyle Port is aware that a small trawler has run aground at Madams Bank in the River Foyle. “There is no environmental threat or impediment to other marine craft. “Once conditions are right we expect the vessel to become buoyant again.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

On a monsoon afternoon at Kevin Lynch Park, a saturated Bun thumped the roof of the then prefab dressing rooms to the sound of campeones. A team he managed with former minor winner Eoin McGuigan, that included Cormac McKenna and Chrissy McKaigue, had brought home the bacon. It was another building block. Also seated for that Monday viewing was Dermot Doherty, a selector under Michael McShane who is now running his eye over the minors. The apple doesnt fall far from the tree. His father Barney and the late Eugene Babs Kelly managed the clubs  winning team.

It couldve been the beginning of dominance, but instead it was a last senior title for  years as Kevin Lynchs and Lavey ruled the roost.

It was a permanent fixture in the calendar. With it, came families bonding together and each success inspired the younger teams to follow. A new wave of minor glory at Ballinascreens Ulster tournament followed, but Kevin Lynchs were still the standard at senior level.  was supposed to be the breakthrough year. After winning a league title, Slaughtneils young guns were the pretenders to the Fr Collins Cup only to be sent home with their tail between their legs again by the Lynchs. It was neighbours Swatragh that took the cup for the first of eight seasons into the Granaghan parish where it still remains. The following year, under Mickey Glover, Slaughtneil eventually wrestled clear of Kevin Lynchs on their way to glory. In Ulster, their gung-ho tactics and bravery put Loughgiel to the pin of their collar in a moral victory to ascertain the level required. For the next two years they faced Cushendall in Ulster, but again came up short. All the while the underage production line continued. The Fr Collins Cup was present at one of the underage management meetings, almost as a sign of the level that needed maintained. With every year, came one or two new players into the squad. The fact that Michael McShane handed Shane McGuigan his senior debut in an Ulster final, while still a minor, was a sign of their commitment to growing the team to a height to challenge the big boys. McShane built a management team to match the players ambitions. Every base was covered. Cormac Donnelly came in as trainer. Their games were all analysed. Like the footballers and camogs, the strength and conditioning made them a finely tuned engine. The pre-game routine was planned to the nth degree, so that all the players had to do was turn up and deliver. And they did. Three Ulsters later and their stature on the national stage has soared. Cuala beat them in the manner Dunloy did in . It was followed by defeat to Na Piarsaigh, a game they surrendered from a position of strength. How times had changed. In the s, when Tom Magill had Lavey at their peak, just winning a championship game was a challenge. Now, not being happy after putting up a performance on the All-Ireland stage told enough about the ambition. The Ballyhale game was the greatest statement of intent, taking the giants of club hurling every step of the way. In the physical stakes, they were able to match them and in the skills of the game they were not found wanting either. In an epic, they came so close to the biggest day of all. This weekend, they enter the knockout championship stage again. They will have the favourites tag. There are no two ways around it. Last week, they saw off Na Magha with virtually a reserve team. Only Jerome McGuigan, suspended against Lavey, started from their All-Ireland semi-final team. Thats how far Slaughtneils hurling story has come. From the days when getting  players for a game was an achievement, they have set a standard of skill, attitude and athleticism that the rest of Derry must strive to reach. Success comes in cycles. In recent times, Kevin Hinphey has followed his father into coaching and led Kevin Lynchs to back to back Ulster minor hurling titles. They have been swimming in Slaughtneils wake, searching for ato the top table. The overall Derry hurling landscape needs them, and others, to narrow the gap. To do so, they will need to match an unrelenting hunger for more success. When you have had barren years like Slaughtneil, you wont want to step off the perch anytime soon.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

In recent times, Kevin Hinphey has followed his father into coaching and led Kevin Lynchs to back to back Ulster minor hurling titles. They have been swimming in Slaughtneils wake, searching for ato the top table. The overall Derry hurling landscape needs them, and others, to narrow the gap. To do so, they will need to match an unrelenting hunger for more success. When you have had barren years like Slaughtneil, you wont want to step off the perch anytime soon.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Like Pantridge, after the war he could neither forgive nor forget and had a burning hatred of the Japanese.During his time in captivity, Pantridge suffered badly from malnutrition, beri beri and other illnesses. Following the Japanese surrender he weighed less than five stone and was a physical wreck.On ing home to Northern Ireland in October  he was still very weak, but was determined to resume his medical career, getting a housemanrsquos position at the Royal Victoria Hospital.Because of his experiences in the POW camps, he decided to specialise in heart medicine.

The Minister cannot allow all this to simply be thrown away.The Strangford MLA added: ldquoThe local community previously stood together to save Exploris and will do so again. I would urge anyone with concerns to make their voice heard and lodge their concerns and together we can save our local economy.It is believed that the poundm aquarium proposal could create more than

a cheatit had been suitable.ldquoBack in  there were a few areas in Barry which were beginning to look a little tired, but it also came with a timeless charm that provided us with the perfect texture and feel that Dave and I had discussed.ldquoAdded to this was the welcome we were given by residents and, in particular, the support of the local council.ldquoPorthcawl was also a serious candidate for the backdrop to this show, but having scouted tirelessly the whole of Barry and Barry Island, I knew that this ticked every box.Mr Evans said Trinity Street was an instant favourite.ldquoI knew Gwenrsquos house was here, he said. ldquoThe terraced houses on a steep hill and its far-reaching views over to Barry Island and docks meant that no matter which direction the camera was pointing, there would be interesting textures and views.ldquoThe next objective was to get inside as many houses as possible to seeany worked for us as Gwenrsquos house.ldquoI letter dropped about  houses to gauge the interest.ldquoIrsquod heard that Matt Lucas was going to be involved so I used his name get to my foot in the door.ldquoThis usually helps.ldquoIn those days very few had heard of James Corden.ldquoI viewed and took pictures of about five houses on that street and Glendarsquos who was one of the first to contact me.ldquoThe decor and character of Glendarsquos house fitted my brief perfectly, but my first thought was that house was a little on the small side.ldquoTo get a film crew and the actors to work in such a tight space would be quite a challenge, butI could convince our director and designer that it could be achieved Gwenrsquos house was found.ldquoI took Dave and Christine along to Trinity Street and both fell in love with the location within minutes.Mr Evans continued: ldquoGlenda was so accommodating.ldquoI remember very well discussing with her the details of how filming on location works, how disruptive the whole process can be and also the location fee.ldquoWhat I do remember was her reaction when I mentioned the amount.ldquoGlendarsquos reply was: ldquoIrsquom so sorry Clive, but I donrsquot think I can cover that.ldquoGlenda thought that she needed to pay for the privilege of having us there and not the other way round.ldquoShe is a lovely lady and still loves being a part of the Gavin  Stacey world.During the locationsrsquo breakdown meeting, we discussed how Pam and Mickrsquos house might look in Billericay so homes were viewed in and around Llandaff and Sully until Dinas Powys was selected thanks to the welcome that was received.ldquoSt Cattwgrsquos Church at Llanmaes was not the first-choice wedding venue for Gavin and Stacey, Mr Evans said. ldquoThey were due to be married at St Nicholas Church at the village of St Nicholas, but a last-minute change of heart by the Church in Wales meant that we needed to find an alternative at the th hour.ldquoA friend and another locations manager called Chris Hill pulled in a favour and we were able to use St Cattwgrsquos.ldquoI dont recall any candidates other than Island Leisure .ldquoWhile filming on the front, Marco opening up early for the crew to be able to get a nice coffee as the weather was pretty unkind.ldquoWe didnt use the interior of the coffee shop as a location in series one, but as it was so cold when we filmed on the seafront the coffees were very welcome.ldquoWe also filmed at the Vale of Glamorgan Resort for the exterior of the wedding fair.ldquoThe interior was shot at the Copthorne Hotel at Culverhouse Cross.ldquoWhile at the Vale resort, the Wales rugby team came into the reception of the hotel.ldquoRuth Jones askedIrsquod be able to set up a photograph of the cast with the Welsh team.ldquoWe got them to agree so out there somewhere are pictures of the Gavin  Stacey cast with the Wales rugby team.ldquoUncle Brynrsquos house was only an exterior in series one so very little was involved in its search.ldquoQuiz night at the Colcot Arms was interesting.ldquoWe were close to completing our filming when the pub opened to the public -

Organisers reminded attendees to practise social distancing and wear masks throughout the programme.Later in the day, Martin Luther King III, a son of the late civil rights hero and the Reverend Al Sharpton, whose civil rights organisation, the National Action Network, planned the event, are expected to deliver keynote addresses that show the urgency for federal policing reforms, to decry racial violence, and to demand voting rights protections ahead of the November general election. vw,vw,px, px\"People attend the March on Washington And to underscore the urgency, Rev Sharpton has assembled the families of an ever-expanding roll call of victims including Mr Blake, George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, Rayshard Brooks, Ahmaud Arbery, Trayvon Martin, and Eric Garner, among others.Mr Arbery and Mr Martin were both killed by white men who pursued them with guns.Following the commemorative rally, participants will march to the Martin Luther King Jr memorial in West Potomac Park, next to the National Mall, and then disperse. vw,vw,px, px\"Martin Luther King Jr delivered his historic I Have A Dream address at the steps of the Lincoln Memorial Turnout in Washington was expected be lighter than initially intended due to city-imposed coronavirus pandemic restrictions that limit out-of-state visitors to the nationrsquos capital.

Rev Sharpton said protesters should also demand reinvigorated US voter protections, in memory of the late congressman John Lewis who, until his death on July , was the last living speaker at the original march.In June, the Democrat-controlled House of Representatives passed the George Floyd Justice In Policing Act, which would ban police use of stranglehold manoeuvres and end qualied immunity for officers, among other reforms.

I have checked and reading through the standing orders I don’t believe you had the authority to do what you did,you read the standing orders in the correct context.“In terms of the standing order it is for the reporting officer to determinea notice of motion is lawful or improper. The Chief Executive is our officer in that regard and he considered the motion and included it in the agenda for the meeting.“You then took the decision, unilaterally, to not have it heard during the meeting.”Councillor Causby asked for the matter to be investigated to clarythe Lord Mayor acted within the bounds of his authority.“My ask is that the Chief Executive and Council’s legal team investigate the eighth edition of’Knowles on Local Authority Meetings’ as it details the proper protocol, it is the guide and case law,” said the DUP representative.“I want to ensure that we get proper clarity to prevent a decision like from being taken again.”Speaking to the Local Democracy Reporting Service after the meeting, Councillor Causby said this call has nothing to do with the decision taken on the naming of the South Lakes Leisure Centre, rather ensuring that the office of the Lord Mayor remains removed from partisan politics.“With regards to the decision taken on the name of the leisure centre, what is done, is done,” said Cllr Causby.“We are not going to overturn that decision, it has already been made. I just want to ensure a moment like this does not happen again.“The standing order the Lord Mayor quoted is ... It concerns motions that are unlawful or improper. The Lord Mayor called the motion improper but that was not his call to make.“Council Baxter should have been informed of the decision prior to the meeting but he was not, nor was the Chief Executive, the Lord Mayor told us on the night he had informed his party colleagues.“He acted outside the process, outside standing orders and, in my view, quite improperly.”When asked about the process of the investigation, a Council spokesperson said “no comment could be made on the matter”.“In line with legislation, a notice of motion is subject to a call-in periodand no comment can be made on the matter until the call-in period has lapsed,” the spokesperson said.“In this case, as legal advice on the interpretation of the standing order is to be provided, it would also be subject to legal privilege.”Read our coverage of the original debate hereA message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

Peter Cardwell at Hillsborough Castle.“I hope the book is a fun, frank and honest account of what it’s like to work in Westminster.”It’s his first time as an author and already his book has set tongues wagging across social media.Special advisers are a part of the government, yet who they are and what they do is much misunderstood. Key advisers to Cabinet ministers and the Prime Minister since the s, their role is shrouded in mystery, despite acres of newsprint devoted to high-profile members of the cohort, such as Alastair Campbell and Dominic Cummings.Peter Cardwell’s book lts the lid on the people Piers Morgan called ‘these miserable little creatures’, revealing who spads are, how Cabinet ministers use and interact with them, how much influence they have and how they deal with the civil service. Featuring numerous anecdotes from dealing with counter-terror emergencies in COBRA to explaining what a dental dam is to the Justice Secretary, to having your inside leg measured in a Minister of the Crown’s office, this book has it all.BBC Political Editor Laura Kuenssberg said: “Peter allows you to peep behind the curtain of a much caricatured but little understood part of our political universe. With the structures of government in flux it’s a timely look at how some of the key relationships in Westminster work, and how they sometimes misfire.”Michael Crick, veteran political journalist and investigative authorsaid: “A book we have long needed.Peter Cardwell’s book fizzes with stories and humour from his experience as an adviser to four dferent ministers, and his years as a Westminster journalist with BBC Newsnight, ITV and Sky News.”https:www.portadowntimes news uk-news ni-man-peter-cardwell-loses-job-boris-johnson-reshuffle-A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

Over my years as principal, we have had great support from the club and some of our past pupils have gone on to represent their county.For me, the notable achievement has been to see the way in which past pupils have progressed in a iety of chosen careers and been successful in so many walks of le.Another achievement is the way in which the staff both past and present have worked together as a team to have accomplished so many things over the past  years, not least to have been awarded Outstanding in our last inspection report.The development of the St. Cairealls Community Playschool on the school site has also brought me great joy over the past ten years to see it now as a successful pre-school provider with DENI status and funding for our local children.Having spent so many years of my le in St Cairealls P.S., it has become a second home and the staff and pupils a second family. Retiring for me brings mixed emotions. However , I am looking forward to having more time to spend with my family, my husband Kevin, our daughters Emer, Niamh and Fionnuala and their partners. Also our son Michael and his partner and my two precious grandsons Micheal and Braidan. Mrs McHugh concluded: I want to offer good wishes to the future of this very special school – St. Cairealls Primary School, Aghyaran and success and happiness to my successor, Mrs Michelle Ellis.  addthis, Leave your commentTyrone Constitution- High Street, OmaghBT BDTel:     , ,, , ,  .jsp, , ,   , ,success:  ,  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" Order your photos n n n \" Advertise with us n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_feeaeafafbd   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_fedffedf   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html .  ,.vc_most_readMost Popular Stories.   , ]]  []js  d js.id  idjs.src  \"connect.facebook.net en_US #xfbmlversionv.\"fjs[],p ^http: .test http:httpsjs+: fjspo  text javascript   truepo.src  https:apis.google js plusone.js s  document[] s"},{"url":"http://www.tyronecon.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/1598431969897.jpg--post_primary_pupils_now_to_wear_face_coverings_in_corridors.jpg?159843197000","title":"post primary pupils now to wear face coverings in corridors ","story":"Education Minister Peter Weir has announced that guidance on face coverings will be updated to include wearing them in corridors of post-primary schools. This will come into effect on  August when schoolson a full-time basis. The Minister said: “My key priority is that pupilsto school on a full-time basis, as soon as it is safe to do so. “Following further advice which I have received today from the Chief Medical Officer and the Chief Scientic Adviser, I am recommending that pupils and teachers wear a face covering in corridors and other communal areas of post-primary schools from next week when schoolsfull-time. This updates the existing guidance on the use of face coverings in educational settings. “The current public health advice is that the use of face coverings provides some benefits, however, it is not a replacement for frequent hand washing, social distancing where possible, covering your mouth and nose when you cough or sneeze and regular cleaning of surfaces. It is also important to remember that evidence suggests that the risk of transmission in schools is relatively low compared to some other settings. “My existing guidance on the reopening of schools already deals with the use of face coverings. In terms of school transport, the advice remains the same, that we strongly recommend that all pupils wear a face covering on all dedicated school transport including buses and taxis where it is appropriate for them to do so. “In relation to communal areas in schools, the guidance already strongly encourages face coverings for activities that entail large numbers of staff or pupils within an enclosed space where social distancing is not possible. “Given the risk mitigations in place in schools to limit and contain the spread of Covid-, face coverings are not recommended as being compulsory for routine use in education settings. However, staff and pupils may wish to use them during the routine school day and this is acceptable. Schools should also be aware that some personsare exempt from wearing face coverings. “I will continue to keep all guidance in respect of education settings under review in light of the latest medical and scientic advice. Peter Weir said: “The first step in keeping our schools safe is that anyone with symptoms should not attend school. Parents should not send their children to schoolthey have any of the Covid- symptoms including: a high temperature a new, continuous cough a loss or change to your sense of smell or taste.” The Department’s New School Day Guidance will be updated to reflect this recommendation.  addthis, Leave your commentTyrone Constitution- High Street, OmaghBT BDTel:     , ,, , ,  .jsp, , ,   , ,success:  ,  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" Order your photos n n n \" Advertise with us n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_feeaeafafbd   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_fedffedf   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html .  ,.vc_most_readMost Popular Stories.   , ]]  []js  d js.id  idjs.src  \"connect.facebook.net en_US #xfbmlversionv.\"fjs[],p ^http: .test http:httpsjs+: fjspo  text javascript   truepo.src  https:apis.google js plusone.js s  document[] s"}]
