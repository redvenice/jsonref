Given the deluge of personal minutiae – from Harry’s emoji habit to Meghan’s favourite hair highlight shades – as well as their litigiousness when it comes to undesired invasions of privacy (they are currently engaged in legal battles with the Mail on Sunday and an American paparazzo), this seems about as credible as Diana’s similar protestations of innocence, all of which Morton scotched about 10 seconds after she died. But whereas Diana chose a tabloid hack as her Boswell, who knew a good story when he saw it, Harry and Meghan opted for two royal journalists. This means the reader is subjected to the Sylvie Krin style of writing that is de rigeur in the genre (I could just about stomach Harry and his “famed ginger locks”, but details of his and Meghan’s glamping trip to Botswana, on which “their days were spent getting closer to nature and their evenings, closer to each other” made me briefly furious that the book hadn’t come with a health warning). Less forgivable than the predictable fluff is how the authors fluff the tale. Because Harry and Meghan definitely have a story to tell, but it is not the story in this book.By now, everyone – and certainly everyone who will buy this book – knows the outlines of this saga: Harry, the scampish prince, meets Meghan, the beautiful American actor, who wows him with her glamorous civilian ways (“In fact, Harry,” Durand and Scobie exclusively reveal, “lived within a bubble of sorts”). They marry and live happily ever after – if by “living happily ever after” we mean the British tabloids were wretched to Meghan, her father Thomas behaved even worse, Harry fell out with his brother and then he and Meghan opted out of the whole shebang and moved to Los Angeles. (The book opens with a Ralph Waldo Emerson quote beloved of people who post slogans on Instagram: “Do not go where the path may lead, go instead where there is no path and leave a trail.” Whether shacking up in director Tyler Perry’s $18m mansion in Beverly Hills is quite the pathless existence Emerson had in mind is a question for another day.)Morton proffered up Diana’s eating disorder and Charles’s affair with Camilla the most Scobie and Durand get are that Buckingham Palace was bad at protecting Meghan from the press, and William and Kate weren’t very warm to the new couple. That Meghan was treated abominably by an institutionally racist and sexist British press is a fact, and the book, with satisfying brevity, alludes to one particular tabloid columnist whose obsession with Meghan ranges from hysterical to certifiable. He is deftly dismissed as a social-climber with a grudge “after not receiving an invite to the wedding.”The Sussexes were hung out to dry by the palace and the press the question the book fails to answer is why, when they were such a boon to the brand. Last year there was a widely circulated rumour that they were being used to distract from some ugliness involving William. Finding Freedom has the space to respond to every other media claim, but on this it stays schtum.Their silence may tell its own story. Despite all the fuming, the book is very cautious when it comes to the senior members of the royal family, and it’s interesting that it’s Kate who is the focus of the criticism rather than William. It may well be that, despite claiming he has finally found freedom, Harry is keeping a door open to his gilded cage. His mother could have told him that pulling punches doesn’t make for a satisfying book, but perhaps he also learned from her that burning bridges doesn’t make for an easy life.• Finding Freedom: Harry and Meghan and the Making of a Modern Royal Family is published by HQ (£20).

She explains that after her husband lost his small Hermès diary, she managed to find a replacement on eBay, listed under “small vintage leather goods”. The diary arrived, almost a twin to the original, with the “same smooth leather, but redder, softer with a well-used sheen”. And there was another difference. In the address section, Benkemoun found telephone numbers, written in brown ink, for Breton, Brassaï, Braque, Balthus, Cocteau, Éluard… “the greatest postwar artists listed in alphabetical order”.Benkemoun describes herself as an “obsessive” sleuth and discovers that the 1951 diary belonged to Dora Maar, photographer, artist and Picasso’s mistress and model (subject of Weeping Woman). She decides to tell Maar’s story through her notable addressees and even includes, charmingly, Maar’s plumber (he installed a bathtub for Picasso).It is a brilliant idea but – if the word can be used in this context – marred. The problem is that the subject arrived by chance, a biographer’s blind date (who knew eBay could deliver book ideas?). Benkemoun had no pre-existing interest in Maar and is disturbed to discover that she swung to the right in old age and kept Mein Kampf on her bookshelf. She considers abandoning her subject. What she does not do is to consider in any depth Maar’s precarious mental health. She describes a first meeting with Picasso in which Maar, wearing black gloves embroidered with small flowers, repeatedly dropped a knife between her fingers until her blood flowed: “Picasso was overwhelmed, enthralled. A psychiatrist might have been wary of this form of self-mutilation.” Benkemoun should have been warier, too – and more curious. Nor is she much interested in Maar’s photography. Her book is glitteringly anecdotal. It scores as artistic pickpocketing – unauthorised rummaging. But she misses altogether the melancholy fact that what her husband now possesses is the address book of a recluse, the contacts of a woman who lost touch with the world.• Finding Dora Maar: An Artist, An Address Book, A Life by Brigitte Benkemoun (translated by Jody Gladding) is published by Getty (£18.99).

The Chinese Communist party, for which dominating rural China in order to encircle its cities and win the civil war is part of its historic backstory, is now intent on doing the same internationally. Using whatever lever comes to hand – generously financing a thinktank in Washington, owning a part-share of Rotterdam port, encouraging “friendship” clubs like Britain’s 48 Group Club – it is aiming to create an international soft “discourse” and hard infrastructure that so encircles western power centres that the dominance of the party at home and abroad becomes unchallengeable.China, we know, has very different definitions of terrorism, human rights, security and even multilateralism to those accepted internationally. The book spells them out and shows how intent the party is on winning international acceptance for them as vital buttresses to its power. Acts of terrorism include not eating pork or speaking out against one-party “democracy”, as the Uighurs and denizens of Hong Kong are learning. Human rights should be understood as the people’s collective right for Chinese-style economic and social development. Multilateralism means states acting in harmony with China and its view that economic development is the alpha and omega of all international purpose – the vision set out in the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI).The BRI is well known as President Xi’s signature policy, through which China partners with governments to build and enhance ports and the wider transport infrastructure across Asia and Africa. I knew the way the BRI is characterised as representing a “community of common destiny for humankind” is nothing more than a front for China’s geopolitical aims, but I had not realised the stunning scope and reach of it. The BRI is the centrepiece of China’s efforts to reorient the world around the interest of the Chinese Communist party. It is breathtaking in its audacity.Signatories to the BRI – most small states in Asia and Africa and even within the EU Italy and Greece – get access to Chinese grants and loans for developing their infrastructure. The overt quid pro quo is that Chinese civil and military traffic are prioritised in ports and airports, or as People’s Liberation Army Navy sources put it, within the BRI they “meticulously select locations, deploy discreetly, prioritise cooperation and slowly infiltrate”. But the BRI accreditation process also requires signatories to accept “China’s benevolence” – “harmonious” globalisation that accepts China’s definitions of terrorism, security, human rights and multilateralism. Any signatory had better not recognise Taiwan – or object to events in Hong Kong. As party insiders confirm, the BRI is aimed at delivering the party’s geo-strategic dominance.Integral to the BRI’s work is the party’s now huge and sophisticated United Front Work Department – Mao Zedong described it one of the party’s three “magic weapons”. Essentially it coordinates the party’s “scientific” efforts to win “friends” – in ethnic groups, foreign political parties, western thinktanks, overseas Chinese communities, private companies, non-Chinese nationals sitting on the advisory boards of Chinese companies like Huawei. Its methods range from organising sympathetic conferences and writing cheques to occasionally organising the clandestine seduction of foreign dignitaries to steal their secrets and the hacking of foreign computer systems.Under President Xi the BRI and United Front have become the twin battering rams to project Chinese power. As Hamilton and Ohlberg say, the pretence that party and state are two different spheres has been dropped under Xi. China and the Chinese Communist party are coterminous – and every enterprise in China, state-owned or private, is surveilled by a Communist party committee.All western states have until the last few months chosen to look the other way. After all the Chinese economy is now the world’s second biggest – and its huge investment in tech is conferring leadership in AI and 5G. The consensus has been that you have to engage with it. Britain has been no slouch. Recall George Osborne and Boris Johnson’s visit to China in 2013, innocently opening the door to the party’s control of part of our new nuclear industry – or David Cameron enjoying a beer with Xi in a Cotswolds pub heralding a “new golden era” in Anglo-Chinese relations. The party looks particularly kindly on Britain’s 48 Group Club, founded in 1954 to promote Anglo-Chinese trade, whose members include businessmen such as Tom Glocer, former chief executive of Reuters, along with ex-politicians Tony Blair, Michael Heseltine and Peter Mandelson. But its efforts don’t stop there. Academics, former ambassadors and even journalists like Martin Jacques, author of When China Rules the World, advocate of China’s view of globalisation and critic of Hong Kong protesters, are all cited as good examples of how the party indulges its friends with privileged access. There are parallel efforts across the EU and in the US.But Xi and the party’s ambitions have begun to be rumbled and challenged – a development that this book underpins. Subverting the Hong Kong treaties and breaking international law to suppress its millions of protesters under an extension of Chinese law, the suppression of the Uighurs and the growing trade aggression of the Trump administration, particularly on Huawei, have triggered the party’s first major reverses since Tiananmen Square in 1989. Boris Johnson may say he won’t be pushed into becoming a kneejerk sinophobe, but Huawei is to be excluded from Britain’s 5G network by 2027. Yet seven years ago, playing to the Europhobe gallery, he set out to charm China as an alternative to the EU. How long will his determination to confront China, post-Brexit, last? This book’s convincing message is plain. Don’t be gulled by soft talk of global harmony, or the prospect of access to the world’s second-biggest market. The Chinese Communist party aims to construct a world in which Enlightenment values are subordinate to its own. The BRI and United Front are subduing criticism and reaction even as I write.

A couple out having dinner together under the scheme would count as two covers.The average claim was close to £5, which means the scheme cost around £50m in its first week. The Treasury has set aside £500m to fund the initiative.Rishi Sunak launched eat out out help out to help the struggling hospitality industry, and described the uptake as “amazing”.“Britons are eating out to help out in big numbers. And they aren’t just getting a great deal – they’re supporting the almost 2 million people employed in this sector,” the chancellor said.“These amazing figures show that our plan for jobs is delivering.”HMRC said 83,068 restaurants had signed up to the scheme. They range from independent cafes, pubs and restaurants to mainstream chains such as McDonald’s, KFC, Wagamama and Toby Carvery, and include Michelin-starred restaurants.The half-price meal offer appears to have benefited retailers, which have also been hit hard by the pandemic.

In a sign of shoppers returning to the high street and ramping up spending online, separate figures from Barclaycard – Britain’s biggest credit card provider – also revealed a bounce-back in overall consumer spending.The release of pent up-demand in July fuelled a rise in food and drink spending in particular, according to both surveys, while spending in sports and outdoor stores rose sharply as the warm weather encouraged more people to spend time outside.Hairdressers, nail bars and beauty salons starting to reopen their doors after four months of enforced closure lifted spending, while furniture stores and electronics retailers reported their strongest figures this year.Despite signs of a recovery taking hold, many shops continued to struggle, with many people still reluctant to go out and office workers continuing to work from home.Paul Martin, UK head of retail at KPMG, said September would prove the real test for consumer spending and the strength of Britain’s economic recovery, in a month when spending typically rises after the end of the holiday season and when adults spend money on their children returning to school.“With the furlough scheme unwinding and wider economic uncertainty set for the autumn, consumer anxiety will likely rise along with it. This will place more scrutiny on disposable income and make life even tougher for retailers,” he said.Following the non-essential retail lockdown and continued weak levels of demand at some stores, growing numbers of retailers are announcing job cuts and shop closures across the country – including at major high street brands such as Boots, John Lewis and Marks and Spencer.Helen Dickinson, chief executive of the BRC, said: “While the rise in retail sales is a step in the right direction, the industry is still trying to catch up lost ground, with most shops having suffered months of closures.“The fragile economic situation continues to bear down on consumer confidence, with some retailers hanging by only a thread in the face of rising costs and lower sales.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5eac0be29f8916ba7344e52c337283c3c3cf979c/0_187_5600_3360/master/5600.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4cfb828a04c23197ad76b84ed66158ff","title":"trans rights feminist letter rebecca solnit","story":"Growing up in San Francisco, the loudest, proudest queer town around, made it clear to me that gender was what you made of it Dear ladies who are fearful and hostile to trans women,That I grew up and spent most of my life in San Francisco I consider one of my greatest strokes of luck, because it was in its heyday the loudest, proudest queer town around. Even as a straight girl, maybe especially as a straight girl, I benefited endlessly from that. I went to my first gay bar here when I was about 14, with a gay man who was the kindest person in my adolescence. The drag queens who were his friends were also kind, and fortysomething years later my life in and around the queer community has been largely an experience of kindness. Of kindness and liberation, because all these people made it clear to me that gender was what you made of it, and biology is not destiny, and that was really helpful.As I’ve watched transphobia explode in the American right and the British whatever, I’ve thought over my own experience. San Francisco has been for a century or so a sanctuary city for dissident, rebel and queer people, so I suspect I have lived my whole adult life in a place with more trans people per capita than almost anyplace else. Transphobes are always warning us that if trans people live in peace and legal recognition and even have rights, there will be terrible consequences, but I assume that we here have long realized, at least to some extent, that dreaded future, and we’re all fine.Despite this, people – many of whom are supposed to be feminists – keep coming up with lurid “what ifs”. My response to them is: trans women do not pose a threat to cis-gender women, and feminism is a subcategory of human rights advocacy, which means, sorry, you can’t be a feminist if you’re not for everyone’s human rights, notably other women’s rights.Second wave feminism produced the classic 1972 children’s album Free to Be You and Me, which I’d like to point out was not titled Free to Be Me But I Get to Define You. Back then we thought gender really was kind of binary and defined by genitals science has gotten smarter in the decades since and we now know it’s a complex interplay of chromosomes, hormones, primary and secondary sexual characteristics and other stuff, some of which is in the brain, not the pants, and also that quite a significant number of people are born intersex, and some are misgendered at birth, and male and female never were airtight categories anyway. Cultures from Native America to India have long recognized that there are other ways to be gendered. This complexity and fluidity can be a blessing and it’s something feminism embraced when it demanded that “woman” not be a category be so tightly defined by roles, relationships, appearances and limits set upon our options.At this point in my life I have trans friends and nonbinary friends, bisexual, gay and lesbian friends who are poets and photographers, doctors and nurses, climate organizers and professors and historians and one gay Buddhist priest who’s also a Sister of Perpetual Indulgence, speaking of San Francisco things I’m proud of. I’m not speaking for any of them so many queer and trans people have already spoken up eloquently, but perhaps there’s something useful for a cis-gender straight woman to say to other cis-gender women, which I’m gonna say as someone who is also a hardcore feminist: the major threat to women, straight or not, cis- or not, always was and still is straight men and patriarchy.Every category is leaky and there are exceptions to every rule, but that’s where the lion’s share of violence against women comes from, as rape and domestic violence and harassment and murder. One of the really weird fears about trans women is that they’re men pretending to be women to do nefarious things to other women, but that’s either a fear of straight cis-gender men who do horrific things to women incessantly all over the world, in which case the problem is still straight men, or a deep misunderstanding of what trans women are. And yes, men who want to harm women could dress up as women, but they could also pretend to be repairmen or emergency workers to get into our homes, and actually have, and we haven’t banned repairmen and emergency workers yet.As a young woman dealing with endless street harassment and menace from straight men, I used to breathe a sigh of relief when I got to the Castro District, because that was the only place I was confident I would be safe. Reflecting back on these four decades, I figure I must have spent a ton of time around trans people in bars and clubs and street parties and protests (and yeah, public restrooms) without really noticing, which is maybe the point. OK, in 2015, at the last night at the Lexington Club, San Francisco’s last lesbian bar, I did gradually realize that the many nice young men in the crowd were trans men.Patriarchy would like gender to be fixed and a lot of its violence is punishment of women who aren’t submissive enough, men who aren’t straight enough, and anyone else who steps out of line. It’s no coincidence the American right is obsessed with border walls and with airtight gender definitions and racial discrimination to keep others in their places. Also, I can’t believe we even have to talk about the bathroom issue, which on this continent is a strictly rightwing rile-the-base issue. I have been using public restrooms in this exceptionally gender-erse city for the past 40-something years, and also reading the local and national papers, plus I know a lot of schoolteachers and parents of schoolchildren, and in all that time I have never actually heard of, or read of, let alone seen, an incident in which a trans woman or girl somehow caused unpleasantness in a women’s room, and it does not appear to be something anyone worries about here. In the Year of Our Lady 2020 there’s still a fuss in the UK about the bathroom business.When there is so much real violence against women, it’s a sad waste of time to focus on imaginary maybe presumably it-could-theoretically-happen violence. Trans women pose no threat to cis-women, but we pose a threat to them if we make them outcasts and pariahs (and insisting they use men’s bathrooms endangered them horribly). Trans women live dangerous lives, because gender nonconformity is punished in innumerable ways, speaking of patriarchy, and black trans women are murdered at a horrific rate, generally by cis-gender men.There’s also a hullabaloo about young people choosing to be trans who may change their minds. I’m sure they exist. Also, we all know they’re rare, and that people are not trying on genders like they were Halloween costumes, because this is not easy for them. We all know that being cis-gender straight is the easiest and most encouraged thing to be, and if some young women are daunted by the prospect of being women under patriarchy, the thing to fix is patriarchy, ie apply more feminism here.What I also know is how formerly many people whose assigned sex did not correspond to their gender identity were unable to find the chance or the courage to transition until later in life and how often they had ruinously miserable lives beforehand. Lots of them wrote books about it, so anyone who wants to know it can know it. It’s great that people can transition earlier, and in those early cases parents and medical experts tend to be exceedingly careful about how those decisions are made, and a few of those parents are my friends and family, and in their kids’ cases it’s worked out really well. We all need to trust them and recognize that that’s their business and not ours.Finally there are about 4 billion women and girls on Earth, and we are not in danger of being erased. But also there is no one-size-fits-all definition of what a woman is some of us are born with absent or ergent personal parts, or with chromosomal or hormonal anomalies we come in many shapes and styles (patrolling bathrooms against trans women has led to some nonconforming cis-gender women being harassed and humiliated). It’s not about having a uterus or breasts or periods or about giving birth, because women are not breeding stock (and, sorry I can’t stop boasting about my city: the first man to give birth was in San Francisco). Some of us had mastectomies or hysterectomies or in the case of Angelina Jolie, who I’m pretty sure everyone accepts as a woman, both and so many other variations exist, because nature is restlessly creative and gender is more a spectrum and a circus than two lockboxes.I was proud of being from the queerest town around before Silicon Valley ate it for breakfast. And now, though there is so much else to loathe about my country now, I’m proud to have supported Elizabeth Warren’s run for the presidency, in part because during it she said more about trans rights than pretty much all the other national politicians in the US put together. I’m proud that Brooklyn put on a giant march to say that trans black rights matter, that San Francisco has the world’s first trans cultural district, commemorating the 1966 Compton Cafeteria Riot (sorry New York, our uprising was three years before Stonewall, and yeah everyone who thinks trans women are some new thing, they were central to both these 1960s insurrections). I’m thrilled that, miraculously, the US supreme court ruled in June that trans and queer rights are protected rights in the workplace. One of the beautiful things about that is that the basis for that decision comes from the 1964 Civil Rights Act those who stood up for racial justice so long ago laid the groundwork for gender justice too.It’s all connected, or rather we are, and that’s good news."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5d5a378ba3bfb22f4609af30861e77c23f0d84d5/0_174_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n\u0026s=212a2bdba71d0d0b4c682d74ce068624","title":"guardianwitness send us a story","story":"You can send a news tip direct to  journalists here.

They casually dish out hugs, wipe tears and help blow snotty noses, all without any hint of anxiety or signs of protection. These people work in children’s nurseries.I found it so strange to see people, as a matter of routine, put aside the messages coming out of press conferences around the world about the risks of being in close contact with others. It’s something they have to do each time they pick up and hug a crying and blubbering child. They don’t reach for masks and gloves, but for the kids instead.Leaving the outside world full of people in masks and gloves dodging each other on buses and in shops, ever vigilant of their own personal buffer zones, and coming into the local authority-funded nursery is like going back in time to when other people weren’t a mortal danger to us all.But they tell me it has to be this way. Without normality and contact and support, the children will suffer. Just as plants need water and sunshine, children need a loving and caring environment. As the Harlow experiment from the 1950s and 60s showed, primate infants will forgo food for care and contact, and whether the people in the nurseries know of this experiment or not, they are all convinced that without care and contact the children will suffer.They are so sure of this that they are willing to place themselves in harm’s way. Of course they take precautions, such as constantly cleaning, but you’re fooling no one when you pick up a blubbing child that then tries to bury itself into your neck.These people’s radiant beliefs are so tangential to those that result in empty clapping outside No 10 that I find it almost hard to find my bearings, until I’m back on the streets and surrounded by sideways glances once more.“I’ll be honest, at first, it was quite frightening. I’m sure we’d all like to stay at home and keep safe, but that’s just not the way the whole world works. I’d imagine the parents that have to go to work too, and how they feel leaving their children. It’s so important for their day at work, that they know that their children are safe and happy at nursery. I’m a mum, and I’m a key worker, and that for me would mean everything.“I imagine that they’re going to work every day frightened – will they get ill, what will happen to their child, how are they going to keep the roof over their heads? And so allI could do is come into work myself and put my best foot forward, thinking if we can make their children’s life a little bit better, it’ll make their day a lot better too. At least they know that their child is safe. And so I just thought, come on, you know? My son’s safe, he’s out of harm’s way. And as long as I keep myself well, I can keep on doing what we’re supposed to be doing.“But I also wanted to show my son a good role model: that through tough times, through uncertain times, I can still get up and be positive, and bring a little bit of positivity to the children here in the nursery too, because they don’t really understand what’s going on. It’s quite frightening for them – the world’s changed all of a sudden in their eyes. So I just thought, I’m a mum, come here to the nursery and let the children’s parents know that they’re in safe hands – that was my everyday get-up-and-go thought.”“Kids require contact because they need the reassurance that that brings. You’ve got to understand that these are very young children, and they’re still very vulnerable. They need to feel like they’re in a secure and safe environment, and so you have to show them that kind of love. It’s just not possible to stand 2 metres away from them, wearing a facemask and gloves. Your face is one of the primary ways in which you communicate with a young child, especially as a lot of the time their language isn’t there yet.“If we’re treating the children differently from how we did before this whole situation – if we were not giving them cuddles, if we were not being attentive to their needs, if we were not in close proximity with them – then they’ll pick up on that, and we’ll have a bigger problem because the children won’t feel safe and secure.“To be honest, it didn’t really bother me being in close proximity with others while everyone else in the country wasn’t, because I know what this job entails. To do it properly, you need to have that tactile environment, and so there’s no point in saying I’m not going to do X, Y and Z. You’ve just got to get on with it.“We’re not doing anything different now, we’re still doing what we were doing in January, in November and last summer, and that is to provide children with a really stimulating, loving and caring environment in which they can flourish. It’s as necessary for a child as sunshine and water is for a plant.”“With Covid, we are much more thorough with the cleaning. Previously we’d clean the toys, tables, door handles and surfaces probably twice a day, but now it’s every 30 minutes. That’s a major, major difference, and it’s taking up much more of our time.“Another is splitting the rooms. So for example, the toddler room now has no more than 10 children, although before it was more like 20. And it’s going to be an ongoing challenge because we’ll need a lot more staff to be in different areas. And even a lot more rooms.“I think everyone needs to understand that with children it’s not possible to social distance. They don’t understand, and you can’t just tell them ‘don’t hug your friend’ or ‘don’t go near your friend’ – that would just create an atmosphere that’s really negative for the children. On the one hand, you’re aiming for everything to be as normal as possible, but at the same time we have a duty to ensure that the environment is safe and that we’re following the guidelines that are set out by the government, though much of that is confused. “The management here are trying their best with the information that they’re being given by the government, but so much of that doesn’t seem to take into consideration that every centre is different, and that they can’t all just adapt and do all of these things that they’re telling us to do. It’s just not possible. For this reason, I think that the way we’re currently working is just not sustainable.“Before we had a much closer type of communication with the parents. They could actually come into the centre’s classroom and directly drop their children into the room, and see them go off and play with their friends, whereas now we just straight away take them from their parents and take them into the room ourselves. And at pickup we have to take the child to the entrance to meet their parents, and if you’re trying to give feedback to, say, five parents, it’s a little bit awkward and rushed, and so the parents might feel like they’re not really as involved in the centre as they were before. They don’t actually know what’s going on behind closed doors, and they don’t see the beneficial changes that we’ve made.“Because of the fear and anxiety of parents, some of the children might not come back to school. It is a worry for me, especially as a practitioner, knowing that some children are going to be left without an education, especially those children who are vulnerable and who need more of a push than other children. To accept that as a reality, is quite disheartening.”“These children’s parents are working on Covid wards, they’re GPs having to do emergency appointments, they’re seeing people face to face, and when they’ve finished their shift they’re coming to us. We open that gate, and what do they want to see? A child with a smiley face, that’s really tired and has had a really great day. The kids pick up on the slightest thing, so if you’re stressed you’ve got to turn it on. You want their journey through Covid to be as positive and happy as it could be.“I do think that there are some people, including myself at times, who have been in quite a fragile state of mind. I’m exhausted, more so than I ever have been, because you’re using your nervous energy. You’ve got worries as well, so you don’t sleep as well as sometimes.“When I get back home I’m exhausted. I use the buses as I don’t drive. And then it’s wash your hands, take your clothes off, have a shower – and I make sure and I’m wiping down everything in my home too, so it’s not just your shift here. But you do feel a sense of achievement, and I do feel that you need to have that, in order to go home, rest, eat some nice food, have a glass of wine and then come back the next day.”“The age group that I work with are too small to understand anything to do with Covid. Some of them don’t even speak yet. And when a baby cries, you can’t just leave them crying over there with you watching. They’re babies, we can’t do that. Even with the older children, when they come for a hug, you can’t just tell them to keep a distance.“It was weird in the beginning because, despite what I said about hugging the children, those children are coming from outside and we don’t know where they have been or whether they’ve had contact with anyone else, and so of course it was worrying to be at work and then go home and see my family, my two children and my husband, after that. But I can’t just tell a child to stay away from me. I can’t do that. They’re too small, they don’t understand that and they aren’t gonna get it.“In the classroom, we’ve had to remove everything like rugs, soft toys, blankets, Lego, books – everything. And the toys which we have kept on our floor, we have to spray them every single day to wash them and make them ready for the next day. So we make sure we spray everything, which is a lot more work, and you have to do it every day for them because they do touch it, in fact everybody touches it, or maybe they put in their mouths. So I make sure it’s nice and clean for them as well. They need it done for them.”“At first the pandemic was scary, but we have to face it. I think that if it’s meant to be, it’s meant to be. You can’t lock the door and stay away from it. And if you accept it, it’s not difficult. Then you don’t feel like you’re scared or vulnerable.“The first two weeks, I didn’t go out as I was off from work. And then, when I did go out, my eyes were hurting from the sun as it was so bright. And so from that day I said I’m not going to stay inside all the time because it’s not good – not for your brain, for your body, or for everything else.“Some children here are coming from other nurseries, and that transition for them is very difficult. You need to make them both come here and be happy, all at the same time. It’s easy to put pressure on yourself, but when you do, the children get pressure as well. So first, the adults have to become calm, to get nice and smooth, and then the children will be too.“Without contact, it’s no good for them. It’s no good because children, when they play, they talk and move, and their brain and emotions develop. When they communicate with friends, they pick up speech. When they move, they become strong. So we just have to be calm, and then do as normal.”“This is the foundational stage for the child, one where they start to develop, and if they miss something there can be under-development. It’s important that they create a bond with people, with significant others, and with the people next to them. And if you are distant, you cannot create this bond. Instead you will disconnect with the child.“Children like to play, and if I say to them ‘no, no, don’t come to me,’ the child can look at me confused and ask ‘why don’t you want me? Yesterday you were playing with me, but today you won’t play with me?’ It’s very important for them to have continuous care and continuing provision, both educationally and emotionally, and if you’re far away from them, you lose this connection.“Without this, a child might start to cry, become very quiet or withdraw. If this happens at this age it could have a detrimental effect on the child, educationally and emotionally. But I think, in my personal opinion, the effect is more emotional, because at this stage the child needs this emotional support, and this attachment, to develop a better foundation.”“I’ve been at this nursery for 30 years, and in that time I would say this is the biggest challenge I’ve had to face, because it’s unlike anything we’ve ever known before. Friday was the announcement you’re going to close, and Monday we were back open just for vulnerable children and the children of key workers, all from different places.“So the phone started ringing and the referrals started to come in. I think the challenges were: how do these children adjust to new environments? What could we do to make sure that they had a good transition, to reassure parents from home, and send out messages and activities to them? We were really, really busy, with a small skeleton team. Myself and Fiona, the deputy manager, have worked really closely with Nick from Haringey council, and that’s been really instrumental in terms of advice and support.“I don’t think we have come up for air yet. Every day brings a different challenge. You come in and something’s changed, for example more calls for places for children whose families are key workers.“Previously we were offering places to 130 families, and now we’re accommodating 77 families, which is a lot of children in this environment. We’re working at a high percentage. But there are families staying at home who are not now having that face-to-face contact, and are not having their issues resolved quickly. Like before, a parent would come up and say: ‘Can I speak to you for a minute?’ And I would always make time. I’d have a little conversation, share a few techniques, and within two or three weeks that stress is over. But now it’s very different, which is a worry.“In general, looking at the national picture, I’m very worried, and not just educationally. By only staying home, children’s socialising and wellbeing is compromised.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/be07b0e89d940d654dc77d1ebb2954bf1e04f39b/0_384_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7258e1eadee92dbb51de8c7d6c2c527c","title":"undergraduate students what plans do you have for freshers week","story":"If you are set to begin an undergraduate course in the UK this autumn, we would like to hear from youWith nightclubs closed and social distancing measures in place at hospitality venues – including pubs – across the UK, freshers’ week is likely to be a toned down affair for first-year university students in September.Many universities have set their sights on virtual events such as remote freshers fairs and Zoom comedy nights as a way to welcome young people to campus life, while parties in halls are likely to be banned.

Its leading character, British commanding officer Lt Col Nicholson, played by Alec Guinness, at first refuses to allow his officers to perform manual labour on the infamous “railway of death” and the bridge linking Bangkok and Rangoon. Nicholson eventually compromises, deciding that if they are forced to work on it, they will design and build the bridge properly and with pride.Details of behind-the-scenes clashes are revealed in letters held at the National Archives, showing War Office objections, and the anger of a member of the Fepow committee – Far East Prisoners of War – who stressed officers were obliged to focus on escape and sabotage, rather then cooperation with their Japanese captors.On being sent the script, a Maj A G Close, from the War Office’s PR department, wrote: “I do not think much of this story. In the first instance it is quite untrue and only very occasionally resembles the facts as they were at the time. I am perhaps biased as I worked for three and a half years on this particular railway.” He had sent the script to others “and they agree with me that it would not go down well with the British public”.The deputy director of PR at the War Office agreed, saying it was difficult to believe that any British commanding officers would have acted in the way that the character Nicholson did.The scriptwriter Carl Foreman, who was blacklisted in Hollywood after admitting to being a communist party member, and was not credited in the final film, tried to reassure the War Office, highlighting script changes, and the fact the film did portray acts of sabotage.Eventually the War Office grudgingly agreed to RAF cooperation, but stressed it was “not entirely happy about this film story, which does contain certain inaccuracies and which does not, in our opinion, always authentically portray the behaviour and conduct of British officers”.The War Office sought a long disclaimer at the beginning and end of the film, rejected by Spiegel, who favoured a shorter one. In the end Spiegel’s wording was used, but only at London screenings, and not in other parts of the country.This incensed former PoWs, including Lt Gen Arthur Ernest Percival, general officer commanding Malaya, who surrendered on 15 February 1942 at the fall of Singapore, a fall Winston Churchill described as “the worst disaster and largest capitulation in British history”.As chairman of Fepow, he wrote to the War Office: “It is reasonable to expect that the public who see the film will think that the events which take place in the film are typical of what actually happened … our members are as a body justifiably proud of their conduct as prisoners-of-war. They suffered a great deal for it and they would now deeply resent the presentation of any film which tended to misrepresent and cast aspersions on their conduct.”In a blog to be published on the National Archives website this week, Sarah Castagnetti, its visual collections team manager, said: “These letters reveal the difficulty when fiction conflicts with a very personal reality.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/346141717c66e8ff9347d8eaa3b58addfe94a342/68_1147_924_554/master/924.jpg?width=1200\u0026amp;height=630\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=crop\u0026amp;overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026amp;overlay-width=100p\u0026amp;overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026amp;s=9eb612c8a8f224b4d03ed9984cddb28e","title":"harry dunn ministers urged to consider virtual trial for anne sacoolas","story":"Dunn family’s MP, Andrea Leadsom, says virtual trial is ‘way to achieve closure’ after US declined extradition requestThe government has been asked to consider a “virtual trial” for Harry Dunn’s alleged killer.Anne Sacoolas was charged with causing death by dangerous driving after a crash in August last year that resulted in the 19-year-old’s death.Sacoolas, 42, claimed diplomatic immunity following the collision outside RAF Croughton in Northamptonshire and was able to return to the US, her home country, sparking an international controversy.In a letter to the home secretary, Priti Patel, on Monday, seen by the PA Media news agency, the Dunn family’s constituency MP, Andrea Leadsom, described a virtual trial as a “way to achieve closure ... without undermining the US decision not to accept the extradition request”.Leadsom also wrote to the solicitor general, the foreign secretary, the Crown Prosecution Service and the justice secretary to put forward the idea of a virtual trial or a trial in Sacoolas’s absence.The family’s spokesman, Radd Seiger, said the family “would not object” if a decision was taken to conduct a remote trial.In the letter, Leadsom said: “You may be aware that the anniversary of Harry’s death falls on August 27 and this is obviously an extremely difficult time for the family.“They are very anxious to obtain closure on these terrible events before that date and seek urgent comments on the possibility of the trial of Anne Sacoolas virtually or in her absence.“She could remain on US soil, have a virtual trial with a UK court, and should there be a custodial sentence, she could serve it in the US under the existing prisoner transfer agreement.“Now the ‘loophole’ that allowed Anne Sacoolas to claim diplomatic immunity has been closed by our foreign secretary’s excellent efforts, it must be clear to all that the claim of immunity was the wrong thing to do and that a virtual trial is a way to achieve closure for Harry’s family without undermining the US decision not to accept the extradition request.”Dunn’s family said their “final goodbye” to him last month as they scattered his ashes in his favourite place: Portland Bill, near Weymouth in Dorset.Reacting to the letters, Dunn’s mother, Charlotte Charles, said: “How justice is administered is not a matter for me as a victim of this very serious crime.“However, I’m very grateful to Andrea Leadsom for working hard on our behalf to ensure that justice is done for Harry.“I can see that she has written to the authorities suggesting that Anne Sacoolas is tried remotely from the US and we’re grateful for her looking at ways in which justice can be achieved.”Charles continued: “For me and my family, it is all about doing the right thing and ensuring justice is done. I did not make it to hospital in time to comfort Harry. He died just before I got there.“I did make a promise to him that we would get him justice and that is just what we will do. I have every confidence that the authorities will make sure it happens.”An extradition request submitted by the Home Office for Sacoolas was rejected by the US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, in January.The US state department later described the decision as “final”, despite the loophole which allowed Sacoolas to claim diplomatic immunity being closed by both countries last month.Giving his thoughts on the possibility of a remote trial, Seiger said: “Anne Sacoolas must face the British justice system like any of us would have to and that is what will happen.“It is obviously up to the authorities how that takes place. The suggestion of a remote trial is a novel one and as far as I am aware would be totally unprecedented in our legal system.“Anne Sacoolas must go through the English legal system. That has always been our case.“How she does that is a matter for the authorities who have always been clear that they remain intent on ensuring she comes back to face justice.“But I can say that were a remote trial to be considered by the authorities and a decision taken to do it that way, particularly in the middle of this pandemic, the family would not object.“Let’s wait and see if this is a viable way forward.”The Home Office said it was a matter for the attorney general’s office, which confirmed a letter had been received but declined to comment further."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b88bd21487d21449a85b82d616f846f70b8ec98a/0_39_4384_2631/master/4384.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=296139fa0482478e48d795537b2f2c7b","title":"hadley freeman on the future of the royals","story":" columnist Hadley Freeman discusses the fallout from the publication of Finding Freedom, a biography of Harry and Meghan, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, and the latest allegations surrounding Prince Andrew columnist Hadley Freeman tells Rachel Humphreys why 2020 is not shaping up to be a great year for the royals.

They are travelling across the Channel on a magic carpet that can take only two people at a time. So, in order for everyone to get across there will need to be 9 trips in total from their starting point in England: 5 across carrying two people, and 4 returning carrying one person. (Magic carpets cannot fly empty, which is why one person needs to travel back. All the friends are able to fly alone on the carpet if need be.)The faster the carpet flies, the bumpier the ride. Babs can fly at a speed that gets her to France in 1 minute. Charles feels queasy at that speed: his maximum speed gets him to France in 5 minutes. The others can get to France without suffering debilitating travel sickness no faster than 6 mins (Hattie), 7 mins (Joan), 8 mins (Kenneth) and 12 mins (Sid).1. What is the least amount of flying time, in minutes, required to get everyone from England to France without anyone suffering from queasiness? (When two people are on the carpet together, the crossing will take as long as it takes the slowest of the two.)Perhaps the most obvious strategy is for Babs, who can travel fastest, to take everyone over one by one, returning by herself, since she will save everyone time on the return journey.If she does this, she takes 5 min with Charles, and 6, 7, 8 and 12 mins with the others. Her total time in minutes is thus 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 12 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1  42. This is indeed the best strategy with the given times in the question.2. Let’s say that the friends’ tolerance for travel-sickness means that their fastest journeys take the following times: Babs (1 minute), Charles (3 mins), Hattie (7 mins), Joan (9 mins), Kenneth (11 mins) and Sid (13 mins).If you tried the above strategy of Babs taking everyone over one by one, the total time would now be:This is not the best strategy any more. You know this because I told you that all the friends can get to France in less than the answer to question 1, which is 42 minutes. So we need to look for a better strategy.The insight here is that the slowcoaches must go over together. If Sid will take 13 minutes, much better for Kenneth to go with him, which avoids the need for another traverse to take 11 minutes. So let’s put Sid and Kenneth on the same ride.However, if Sid and Kenneth go on the first traverse, one of them will have to return to pick up someone else, which rather defeats the object. So let the fastest two go over first, leaving someone there to return with the carpet once Sid and Kenneth get there. In other words:Step 1. Babs and Charles go over. Charles stays in France and Babs returns: 3 + 1  4 minsStep 2: Kenneth and Sid go over, and Charles returns: 13 + 3  16 mins.Step 3: Babs and Charles go over again, and Babs returns: 4 mins.Step 4: Hattie and Joan go over, and Charles returns: 9 + 3  12 minsStep 5: Babs and Charles go over: 3 mins.If you used the ‘slowcoaches together’ strategy for Q1, the total time would have been 46 minutes. So that strategy is not always the best one.I hope you enjoyed today’s puzzle. I’ll be back in two weeks.I set a puzzle here every two weeks on a Monday. I’m always on the look-out for great puzzles.

It had lain idle and fallen into disrepair over a number of years. It is the only track of its kind in the north of England and attracted a Covid-19-limited capacity of 100 competitors and 500 spectators for its first event, entitled Dragtastic, on the weekend of 8 August 2020.The fundraising effort and venue revamp was organised under the auspices of Straightliners, the West Yorkshire-based motorsport event organiser and club which tapped into its thousands of followers on social media. The revamp involved a complete resurface of the drag strip.The prestigious track was set-up in the late 1970s as York Raceway by the Murty family, who organised drag racing events for decades. It isa well-loved drag strip that has played a part in so many racers and enthusiasts lives. It became the north of England’s premier drag racing venue and generations of families have come here to test their nerve and machines. Unfortunately, Melbourne Raceway closed down in 2017, a heartbreaking development for the motorsport community.The relaunch of Melbourne Raceway is the next chapter in motorsport history in the north of England. The community came together and saved this iconic venue, once again reborn to live another day.Competing side by side in a two-lane raceway, the racers take off from a standing start after dramatic tyre burnouts and the first past the finish line wins. All runs are electronically timed under the auspices of the UK Timing Association (UKTA), with competitors receiving a personal performance print-out showing their times and speeds.Event organiser and founder of Straightliners, Trevor Duckworth, thanked everyone for their fundraising effortsand help in order to getting the eighth-of-a-mile track ready for the event. “It’s new tarmac, drivers,” he said at the start. “Don’t expect super fast times today. We need to lay down some rubber and get it going,” he said referring to the practice of heating up the tyres on the start pad. This makes the vehicle tyres grip and perform better but over time it makes the track grippier and therefore faster. As the first event got under way and rubber was laid, Duckworth said: “I had a dream and it’s now very much a reality. Melbourne Raceway lives and it’s time to create new memories and inspire the next generation of racer and teams.”Mark Flavell’s Funny Car 7.8 litre recorded the fastest time of the day powering down thetrack in 5.41 seconds.One of the big draws at the event was Force of Nature, a steam-powered rocket motorcycle designed, built (with the help of others) and ridden by Graham Sykes from north Yorkshire and powered solely by steam. Built for drag racing, record breaking, exhibitions and events, it uses the latent energy of super-heated pressurised water released through de Laval nozzles, where it turns to steam and creates the thrust to propel the bike.Another big name attendee was Kevin Nicks, who holds the world record for fastest shed. Nicks was racing on his latest creation Barrow of Speed, which he built on a zero budget during the coronavirus lockdown.Duckworth said: “I had a dream. It’s now very much a reality. We have had some very unexpected hurdles but we prevailed and I can honestly say this is something remarkable. Melbourne Raceway lives. It’s almost time to create new memories and to inspire the next generation of racers and teams, who knows what the future holds? But I can tell you this: we surpassed expectations in many ways, and you have all done me proud. Long live Melbourne Raceway.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a4c0181bd4c88a7d14e577199eb9d8abeebf63d7/0_118_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3207c57c1532254dca3dccf9d6d18060","title":"luke campbell boxing ryan garcia","story":"Eight years after winning Olympic gold at London 2012, the lightweight on lockdown frustrations, fighting after losing his father and excitement over a potential bout against Ryan Garcia“It’s been a fucking mess,” Luke Campbell says bluntly in his kitchen which spreads out into a vast living area. His home, in a suburban mews on the leafy outskirts of Hull, is as airy and spacious as boxing during Covid-19 is bleak and restrictive.“Since November I’ve trained for two fights. Neither happened. One because I was going for a world title and the other because of the pandemic. Fights are all over the place now and people talk so much shit. Like announcing fights without any sign of them happening. It’s absolute bollocks. I enjoy training with the lads and I’m getting better. But boxing’s pretty shit at the moment.”It’s a sign of how hard the Covid crisis has hit boxing that even the mild-mannered Campbell should talk so graphically. On Tuesday it is eight years to the day since Campbell won Olympic gold in the ring at London 2012. Since then he has become a gritty and impressive professional who has fought twice for a world lightweight title. In September 2017 he endured a split-decision defeat against Venezuela’s Jorge Linares, having lost his father to cancer shortly before the fight, and then last August he put up a creditable display over 12 rounds against Vasiliy Lomachenko who operates near the very top of the world’s pound-for-pound rankings.Over the past six weeks, while boxing has made a low-key return behind closed doors, Campbell’s name has been used repeatedly to hype a potentially intriguing and lucrative fight against the young American Ryan Garcia, who has a flawless 20-0 record with bouts won by knockout. Garcia is one of the rising names in US boxing partly because he has an Instagram following of almost 7 million but, also, owing to his speed and power. Yet it is difficult to know whether Garcia is actually world-class because he has not met anyone of the calibre of Campbell or Linares, let alone a master in Lomachenko.Garcia and his promoters, Golden Boy, have been calling out Campbell as the test he needs to prove his credentials beyond being a good-looking social-media sensation. The World Boxing Council also joined in the hoopla by issuing a statement that Campbell and Garcia would fight for their interim lightweight belt. A few weeks ago the fight seemed certain but now, stewing at home with frustration as boxing’s usual bluster becomes even more meaningless, Campbell explains he has had not had a single approach from García, his promoters or the WBC.How has Eddie Hearn, Campbell’s promoter, reacted to the speculation around Garcia? “Eddie’s put one offer to them and they declined it. That’s the last time he talked to them.”This seems depressingly typical of boxing. Unlike the UFC, where testing fights are made quickly and as a matter of routine, boxing remains a mess. The UFC is a dictatorship, and their MMA fighters earn less than boxers, but they supply a steady stream of compelling contests.McGuigan and Campbell are an excellent combination – as proved against Lomachenko. While the result was rarely in doubt, and the scorecards gave the Ukrainian a lopsided victory, Campbell was always competitive. “I actually hurt him in the first and the seventh,” Campbell insists. “The scorecards were shocking because that was a very competitive fight. But he’d always do enough at the end of the round to win it.”From the outside it resembled a dazzling Lomachenko masterclass. Is he as difficult to fight as he is a delight to watch? “He was very good at distance control,” Campbell says, “but I didn’t feel there was a lot of difference. I didn’t feel like: ‘Oh, I’m in here with the No 1 pound for pound in the world.’ But that’s showing how good I am as well. The stuff he’s done to other fighters, he couldn’t do to me. So I was disappointed I lost.”Was his father in bad shape when Campbell left for America in the autumn of 2017 to fight Linares? “Everyone nicknamed him Titanium Man,” Campbell says wryly. “He had been on his deathbed three times. The doctors would say he’s got minutes left and so I’ve said goodbye to my dad lots of times. But he’d bounce back every time. So he seemed OK when I was in the States. But then my older brother rang me one evening in Miami. I knew it was bad news because it would have been around one in the morning at home.”The devastating news of his father’s death hit Campbell hard. “My mum said: ‘Your dad would’ve wanted you to carry on.’ So that’s what I did but I should’ve pulled out. I was having panic attacks in those last two weeks before the fight. It would happen whenever I thought that my dad’s not here any more. It’s a different kind of grief when you lose a parent. I just wanted the fight out the way so I could breathe and mourn my dad. When the fight started I went down early. It was a flash knockdown and I wasn’t hurt. I just thought: ‘You’re embarrassing yourself. Get up. Let’s go to work.’”Many ringside observers, including one of the three judges, thought Campbell won the fight. The deciding scorecard was 114-113 in Linares’s favour. “I thought I won seven clear rounds so it was hard to take,” Campbell says. “I flew home on my own but I didn’t really want to go back because I knew it was his funeral the next day. That Christmas was really hard. I was burning up on the inside, getting angry while grieving.”It will be three years next month since his father died and Campbell seems at peace now. He explains that his dad, who had worked for years as a miner, never watched him box live. “He had eight discs taken out of his spine because of the damage done when he worked underground. It left him a bit hunched and weak. Maybe he felt vulnerable because my dad was a strong guy before it all happened. He didn’t like seeing himself that way as he was a proud man, and when he went out he wanted to feel good and look smart. So he never came to the fights but he was always there in spirit and watching on TV. He always told me the same thing: ‘Come out like a lion and you’ll be an Olympic and world champion.”Campbell has completed the first objective and he will fight on in pursuit of his dad’s second prediction. But the worrying impact of boxing, especially on his family, is plain. Campbell has been with his wife Lynsey since he was an amateur boxer and she never misses a fight. “But she’s always really nervous. Nowadays she always gets ill after my fights because of the nerves. She is wiped out because it’s so hard for her to watch. She feels helpless.”Campbell understands their concern. “Massively. It’s dangerous, innit? And you’re not just thinking about yourself when you’ve got a family. I don’t want to get punched in my face for the rest of my life but I still have massive passion for the sport. I strive to be the best day in, day out.”He is bruised under his right eye after sparring but Campbell emphasises that, while working so hard despite not being paid since he fought Lomachenko a year ago, he is better off than most boxers in lockdown. Some professional fighters are having to do ordinary work to pay the bills. It’s different for Campbell – as his lavish home shows.Anthony Joshua, who also won Olympic gold in 2012, has earned multimillions in and out of the ring. But Campbell feels no resentment towards the heavyweight with whom he is friendly. “That’s the problem in life nowadays – too many people look at what they haven’t got. I just think: ‘I’ve got a beautiful wife, family, good friends, beautiful home. I don’t need anything. I won’t change nothing.’“If someone had said to me 15 years ago you could be the most successful amateur in Great Britain history, Olympic champion and then one the best lightweights in the world, would you take it? You kidding me? Of course I’d take it.”Campbell needs to get back into the ring, hopefully against Garcia, in the next few months. “I feel physically and mentally great,” he says. “I can have as many years as I want in the sport because I’ve lived the life and haven’t got too many miles on the clock. I feel my best is yet to come. We just need to get past all the talk and make things happen.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3aadad0a8824399386edcfa0beb1c6d8b65ff581/0_20_3642_2187/master/3642.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d117b82967510f69e56ffcfb5370f49c","title":"secluded pleasures why test cricket remains the best sport not to watch the spin","story":"Following England’s win over Pakistan via patchy wifi was thrilling and a reminder that the game has often been enjoyed from a distanceI spent last week in Shropshire, where my family and a few others had clubbed together to hire out Wilderhope Manor, the wonderful and historic National Trust property and youth hostel whose splendour and all-round magnificence must make it among the most unlikely places in the country to find creaky bunk beds, rubberised mattresses, shared toilets and bargain accommodation.Despite its antiquity the property is equipped with many modern conveniences including wifi, the only problem being that the modem is housed in a cafeteria that was locked for the duration of our stay, and the signal stubbornly refused to worm its way through the massive stone walls that have held up the house for the last 450 years or so. With mobile signal largely nonexistent internet access was thereby limited to a small corridor outside the cafeteria’s locked door, and strongest in a pocket of space little more than a metre square in which we placed a single chair. Much of the time access to the outside world was limited to the inidual who occupied this seat.For most of our stay this was not an issue. But as England’s first Test against Pakistan built towards its thrilling crescendo, it was as if we had been cast back a century or so.We waited outside for updates, and every now and then the person occupying the Chair of Knowledge or one of those hovering at their shoulder hoping to pick up the occasional crumb would bowl out of the entrance portal – front door really would be underselling it – to announce the fall of a wicket, the completion of a half-century, or the latest marker on England’s fourth-innings victory surge. Though our imaginations had to do an unusual amount of work to fill in the details, the tension felt on that Shropshire lawn must have at least matched that experienced by those at the ground or watching on television. It is an unusual thing to boast about but nevertheless surely accurate that there can be no sport more thrilling to not watch than this.As so often, the ’s former cricket correspondent Neville Cardus illuminated this path. In February 1923 the  had two reporters covering England’s final Test against South Africa, with the series at stake. Only one was actually in Durban the main report was filed by Cardus using nothing but the scoreboard and his imagination. “There was lurid cricket at Durban yesterday,” he enthused at the end of day three. “Even in the bare reports, even here miles and miles away from the spot, the heat of the conflict can be felt. To the cricketer of imagination yesterday’s news, as it filtered through from hour to hour, caused the mind’s eye to see the line of battle moving now this way, now that.”Much as I imagined Chris Woakes, beard freshly trimmed, hair slick with sweat, cracking a drive through the covers before removing his helmet to salute his half-century at Old Trafford, Cardus conjured images of Phil Mead, Jack Russell and the remaining cast members of a bespoke production being played out entirely for, and indeed by, him. “Mead now on guard with Sandham, and how he must have crouched over his bat, brows knit, his eyes glints of suspicion at every action of the bowlers … every South African must have paused to wipe honest sweat from the brow and to ask if grit and perseverance deserved no better reward than this, after having well-nigh moved a mountain of adversity out of the track … we can imagine how silently the South Africans now moved about the field, how vehemently the bowlers directed their bolts.”Though it was by general proclamation a fine match, the difference between the two reports suggests that the sport witnessed in the mind’s eye of one writer was by a margin more entertaining than that caught by the actual eyes of the other. Where Cardus wrote of the partnership between “honest Russell, no fancy artist maybe but a batsman of sterling craft” and Mann “of the stolid face and heavy, passionless movement”, the un-bylined second report says that “by dogged cricket” the pair made it to tea, and “afterwards the batsmen resorted to stonewalling”. Mann was then out for 15, the second and final wicket claimed by the splendidly named Conky Conyngham in his only appearance for South Africa Russell became the first Englishman to score centuries in both innings of a Test, and England went on to win by 109 runs.Imagine then the extra drama of not only waiting to receive updates from a key match but being able to see each update physically coming towards you, and having to wait for its journey to be completed before discovering if the news it carried was good or bad. “The Yorkshireman often uses his pigeons to convey the result of important sporting events,” the Pall Mall Gazette reported in 1897. “The writer was at a cricket match last year in which great interest was aroused, as it was the semi-final tie of a cup competition. The supporters of the visiting team came provided with pigeons, one of which was despatched with the score at the fall of each wicket.” Imagine the plight of those at home, desperate for information, tension rising, forced to ponder whether a particularly lengthy delay between updates was down to a good partnership or a peckish sparrowhawk.After England’s Ashes-clinching victory over Australia in the final Test in 1926 the Illustrated London News published a wonderful photograph of the huge crowd, several thousand strong, that had gathered outside the offices of an unnamed newspaper on the Strand, just a few miles from where the match was being played at the Oval, to follow occasional updates on what turned out to be the last day’s play. For all that the sport has spent much of its modern history worried about the apparently waning popularity of this or that form of the game there are many pastimes that can only dream of attracting the kind of audience which has on occasions gathered not to watch cricket.• This is an extract from the ’s weekly cricket email, The Spin.

Its creator reflects on the ‘emotional weight’ of BritishnessMike Bartlett’s 2017 play Albion returned to London’s Almeida theatre in February, the week after Britain left the EU. It didn’t mention Brexit but the story reflected its mournful isions. Then the Covid-19 pandemic struck and dwarfed the drama’s concerns of nationhood, patriotism and nostalgic notions of Englishness.Or did it? “Some were saying in the early stages of Covid that the virus had blown those isions out of the water,” says Bartlett. “Actually, I don’t think it has … Everything that has happened in regard to questions of national identity has become fundamental to what we want to do coming out of this.”The production’s director, Rupert Goold, reflected that “plays, like plants, grow over time”. Albion has gathered nuance each time it is repotted. It features a metropolitan, middle-class family who move to the countryside. Britain’s relationship with Europe was still seen by some to hang in the balance when it was first staged. By the time of its 2020 revival, Bartlett felt it to be a very different play.Several others plays by Bartlett have been brought back in the past year, from Snowflake at the Kiln to Love, Love, Love (whose run at the Lyric Hammersmith was cut short by Covid-19). On screen, his series Doctor Foster has been hugely successful, while his play King Charles III has also been adapted for TV. His BBC drama Life, expected to air this year, stars Hamilton, Alison Steadman and Adrian Lester, and revolves around a shared house in Manchester. Again it seems to untangle the issues of our day in its exploration of community and what we owe to other people. “We are all atomised, especially recently, but even before lockdown. It’s about people finding connections and also how we form a community when society doesn’t believe in it.”So much of his work burns with urgent themes – Earthquakes in London looked at climate change, 13 at religious belief in the 21st century and Game at video-game violence. These issues never set the plays’ agenda in themselves, says Bartlett, but are foregrounded by the more complicated drama of human relationships. Albion sought to explore the emotional aspects of the arguments around Britishness. “It’s not an academic debate about the EU, it’s absolutely fundamental to who people feel they are in the world. I felt it important to understand the emotional weight of it.”Would he describe Albion as a family drama or political play? “The phrase I stumble over is ‘political play’. I do think there’s a thrill to seeing a play that talks about what we’re talking about now. I love writing about politics and power. But the reason I stumble is because it conjures a more didactic, opinion-based drama that forces politics on the audience. We have already had to listen to so many opinions in politics and the media.Bartlett’s lockdown in Oxfordshire, with his wife and their children, has been pleasant enough. “I have a garden, I’m alive and healthy. We have been lucky to keep working remotely and to be able to enjoy a bit more time with the children. I’ve been doing some home schooling and finding that maths is more difficult than I anticipated. A lot of people will treasure this time with family – or at least, the lucky ones will.” He is acutely aware of the wider tensions that now lie exposed. “One thing the lockdown has done is magnify existing issues – of mental health, inequality, class, race, the value of the NHS.”Has he had the appetite for online theatre? “I have young children and getting to the theatre was quite hard so having it online is great.” He contests the suggestion that it’s a “lesser” form, citing the TV dramas of the 1970s, like I Claudius, which were staged like plays. “It’s half play and half TV drama. I was already feeling that there was a form there that was interesting.”When theatres reopen, what kind of drama does he want to make? “I want to see less plays documenting experiences that we’ve just been through and more stories that engage with the other side of this,” he says. “The question of what world we want to create.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/16a95cee046b8e81af273332d7701bc844829e08/5_346_4747_2849/master/4747.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8f57c89ffed321b8b93d886fe51106ba","title":"theatre festivals adapt summer covid brighton norwich belfast london","story":"From Brighton to Belfast, socially distanced performances are popping up in unexpected spaces, including the beach, a shopping centre and a church‘Dive in!” commanded the cover of Brighton fringe’s 2020 programme, listing more than 5,500 performances across 170 venues in May. But audiences couldn’t even dip into it. Amid the wave of cancellations caused by the coronavirus outbreak, the largest open-access arts festival in England was rescheduled for autumn. With dozens of other jamborees, including Edinburgh fringe, postponed or scrapped, the summer looked gloomy for arts lovers.“It was heartbreaking,” says Nicola Haydn, artistic director of Otherplace, which runs The Warren, a popular group of Brighton venues. Haydn had planned to celebrate The Warren’s 15th birthday with a programme featuring almost 300 visiting companies. She’d spent a year putting the lineup together. When it became clear they couldn’t go ahead, “none of us knew what the future held”.Now, Brighton boasts a brand new Warren venue on the beach. Comedy, music, magic and anarchic theatre will be staged outdoors, with audiences watching from picnic tables. While some theatres have been adapted for the age of coronavirus, this one has been designed in direct response. Rather than purchasing inidual tickets, audiences book one of 50 tables, which fit up to six people. Masks must be worn until audiences reach their table, drinks are ordered online and there’s “shed loads of hand sanitiser” available. “We’ve worked hard to reassure people the safety measures are there,” says Haydn.Plenty of innovative work has been made online during lockdown, she acknowledges, but for Haydn “there’s nothing like live performance” – and the new Warren stage has a stunning backdrop, too. On this summer’s warmer days, she has been wary of the beach because of overcrowding but the theatre offers a socially distanced space to enjoy entertainment in the sun (or otherwise, as there’s a rain-or-shine performance policy). The shows have been programmed to lift spirits: there’s a solo panto from dame Mama G, Shit-Faced Shakespeare doing a drunken Midsummer Night’s Dream and a cabaret featuring West End stars whose musicals were shut down. Haydn says a spirit of collaboration is in the air – her beach venue has comedy nights organised by the local Komedia club.Arts organisations are similarly joining forces in Norwich for an outdoor festival, this one in a big top pitched in a city-centre park. The tent belongs to local circus company Lost in Translation. Norwich theatre’s six-week season, Interlude, is a collaboration with Norwich Arts Centre, The Garage and other venues. “We’ve turned it around in about 24 days,” says Stephen Crocker, the theatre’s chief executive. “It’s quite the Herculean effort!”As government guidance is constantly updated, Interlude’s organisers are poised to be flexible. If there is a local spike in coronavirus cases and gatherings are restricted again, “we’d have to weather the storm”. Unlike some of this summer’s theatre activity, the festival is financially viable, primarily because of the support of local authority partners including the council. “The nighttime economy relies on venues,” says Crocker. “This is a boost for bars, restaurants and retail.”EastSide Arts festival in Belfast goes one step further, placing a summer show inside Connswater shopping centre. The King of East Belfast is written and performed by Stephen Beggs, and was planned for the festival before the coronavirus outbreak. It has been reconceived as a 45-minute production with Beggs performing at a three-metre distance from an audience of 22 who, in line with shopping centre restrictions, all wear masks. Another festival show, Late Lewis – a musical production about the author CS Lewis with a cast of four – will be fittingly staged in Belfast’s CS Lewis square, with its Narnia sculptures as a backdrop.Festival director Rachel Kennedy says the square, part of Connswater Community Greenway, was a lifeline for locals during lockdown and she was among those who visited it for daily exercise. “Now people can gather again a little more, they are able to return,” she says, acknowledging that there has been excitement among festival audiences about rediscovering live theatre. The festival’s theme this year is “moments of joy”, which has energised and inspired artists. “Lockdown has taken the joy out of life,” says Kennedy. “People miss laughing with their friends, being around other humans.”EastSide Arts festival is presenting a variety of live outdoor performance and digital productions. That mix is mirrored in the Virtual Collaborators festival, which runs for two weeks online and culminates in a weekend of shows in the grounds of St John’s Church in Leytonstone, east London. The outdoor festival is funded by Waltham Forest council as part of an initiative to bring culture back to the borough. It is the latest phase of a project that Danusia Samal launched in the early days of lockdown to enable creatives to collaborate remotely on a series of films. The festival is co-produced by theatre company Part of the Main whose artistic director Olivia Munk had planned to direct an immersive clubbing experience, Populist, at Brighton fringe and has also had to postpone her Edinburgh show Bloody Mary: Live! (it’s also a podcast).“The first couple of weeks of lockdown was about picking up the pieces of things that had been cancelled and asking … what now?” says Munk. The Virtual Collaborators festival was designed as a replacement for Edinburgh fringe, which offers a vital showcase to emerging artists. Munk was “floored by the generosity” of others in the industry who have offered advice and resources including free rehearsal space to those taking part in the festival. They are lifting up the next generation of artists, she says.Planning live events during a pandemic means everything feels provisional. As a producer, you’re usually one step behind where you want to be in your schedule, explains Munk. “But this is the first time I’ve felt it’s OK to be behind because the world is collectively behind what is happening.” The festival aims to give artists and audiences confidence that people can still connect and create work during the crisis. Contingency plans are in place should lockdown restrictions return in London. “Mostly what we have to count on, regardless of government guidelines,” says Munk, “is our spirit and our vision.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9869d06b77bb8c5c87e5e9a75c4fb2ad1cc19f32/21_0_5368_3223/master/5368.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3481514b26043ac8482a25222b257867","title":"italians do it better an expert guide to hosting an amalfi inspired dinner party","story":"Giulia Rhodes speaks to some in-the-know Italians about how stunning seafood and verdant produce can add a touch of the Amalfi coast to your next dinner partyFrom authors and actors to designers and directors, the glamorous set has long flocked to Italy’s Amalfi coast. And it’s not hard to see why.A film-set perfect 25-mile ribbon of mountainous coastline, its colourful villages, fragrant lemon groves and deep blue sea form a Unesco world heritage site.And as with all Italian regions, the local food and drink is inextricably tied to the culture which means that even if you can’t actually strut your stuff in Positano, you can cook up a bit of Italian sunshine in your kitchen.Alessandro Savelli is CEO and founder of UK-based Pasta Evangelists, which makes premium fresh pasta and sauces for home cooking – with next day delivery across the UK – in addition to its coveted concession in Harrods, now back open for business following the easing of lockdown restrictions.He learned to make pasta with his grandmother. Step one, he says, is to understand the culture. “I am Italian. I love food. I love pasta. I love cooking. Meals in Italy are when the family comes together to talk and enjoy delicious food. It is the highlight of our day. Food is not just seen as a necessity.”He celebrates the regional roots of Italian cuisine, sharing culture and stories to support local speciality pasta dishes. The food of the southern Italian Amalfi coast is different to that of his native Genoa, in the north, but it is close to his heart.“We go every year. My wife is from Naples and we married in Capri. I love it. The people are friendly, funny and loud, and the cuisine has everything – from amazing fish and seafood, fruits and vegetables to wonderful pizza and pasta. I discovered dishes that only really exist in that area.”His personal favourite is spaghetti alla nerano, with fried courgette and provolone cheese. While scialatielli – somewhere between linguine and tagliatelle in shape – with Amalfi lemon, ‘nduja sausage and mascarpone, features on the Pasta Evangelists’ Amalfi week menu.“Pasta dishes are about simplicity, freshness and few ingredients. We can bring that to your home,” he says. Although he admits he can’t deliver the full experience. “In Italy, we do tend to take the sunshine for granted.”Carla Bollati, a retired doctor from Turin, was introduced to the area around Amalfi by her late partner Gennaro, a Neapolitan. “I have a deep sentimental attachment,” she says. “And the tastes are a lovely way to travel to happy memories.”She was struck by the area’s scenery from her first visit. “It is a crowded landscape that cannot be changed. But there is also such special light and colour, the perfume of lemons, so many wonderful flavours. All the senses are covered.”The people and cuisine of the south are, she says, another huge draw. “They cook with what the area has to offer. Try a mozzarella there and you will understand what it is supposed to be.”Culinary roots and rules are revered, she adds. “If I cooked Neapolitan pasta e fagioli – with beans – for Gennaro, it had to be with broken odds and ends of pasta. Shells just wouldn’t be right. We Italians are so tied to the history of our food and the habit of coming together to eat it.”Italian food expert and cook, Paola Maggiulli, who runs the Tiny Italian supper clubs and cookery courses, agrees. But she insists it is a very inclusive tradition. To create an authentic Italian dinner, she says, the starting point is confidence.“Anyone can make Italian food. It is about flavour, not technique. With a few quality ingredients you can make incredible dishes.”Having spent much of her childhood in her father’s south London Italian deli, she recommends taking time to shop for good ingredients and learn the stories behind them.“In normal times, what is special about Italian food is the connection and time with other people. That might be planning the menu with friends or helping your grandmother prepare Sunday lunch for the extended family. Community and family are everything. Sharing the experience of eating with people you care about just makes you feel better.”So what would Maggiulli serve for a feelgood dinner inspired by the Amalfi coast?“I would want those incredible lemons,” she says, suggesting simple spaghetti with lemon, parmesan, olive oil and basil as a first course.“Amalfi seafood is beautiful, too. So perhaps a main of braised octopus, mussels cooked in white wine, or a frittura mista platter of fried squid and prawns,” she says. A chocolate and almond cake – a torta caprese after the island of Capri – would end the meal nicely.When you host your party, build the convivial atmosphere by serving the food on large dishes in the middle of the table, for guests to help themselves, and make sure the conversation, as well as the drinks, are flowing.For the latter, Daniele Umoette, former bar manager and drinks brand ambassador from Carpi in the northern region of Emilia-Romagna, suggests a gin spritz aperitif to kickstart the evening.“Mix blood orange flavoured Malfy Gin Con Arancia with Fever Tree Sicilian Lemon Tonic and a splash of prosecco over lots of ice in a nice glass, and garnish with some fruit such as blackberries, pink grapefruit slice and some aromatic herbs such as sage,” he says.Admittedly, your after-dinner stroll will probably be a little less glamorous than the nightly passeggiata in Positano. Maybe next year.

This year, with staycations booming, boutique bell tents are all the rage, and whether you’re a Hyde Park regular, or head to the Isle of Wight every summer, you don’t have to miss out. Pitch your tent in the garden – or indoors if it’s raining – swing open the patio doors, pour yourself a Malfy Gin and tonic, and cue up your festival playlist. Designer wellies optional.UpcyclingNesting has taken on new meaning as we’re spending more time than ever at home, meaning that we are looking to make our personal spaces as cosy and reassuring as possible. With major home improvement projects put on hold, we’re looking at subtler ways to spruce up our living spaces, often going hand-in-hand with the crafts we’ve taken up to help while away our extended free time. Repurposing old units and reupholstering much-loved chairs are at the top of many DIY lists – and when it comes to themes and patterns, rainbows and bright, uplifting shades are the order of the day.Micro garden partiesWith our close friends and family having been out of bounds for so long, we’re getting to know the neighbours. WhatsApp groups for inidual streets and blocks of flats are springing up across the country as we look closer to home for friendship, support and entertainment.Scaled-down garden parties comprising small groups of neighbours dressing up and bringing over their own food and drinks – nibbled and sipped at a respectful distance – make for eclectic gatherings and unexpected new friendships being forged.Staying ‘in-in’Now we can no longer go “out-out” – and with loungewear fatigue firmly setting in – summer is about dressing up for virtual socialising. Many of us are seeing more of our friends than ever as we plan regular catch-ups via online video calling, from family quizzes to propping up a virtual bar with friends, while Royal Ascot 2020 saw thousands of us donning fascinators in front of the TV in aid of frontline charities. So as the weather warms up, it’s time to cast off your lockdown look and raise a glass of Malfy Gin in style.Locally sourced picnicsWith public transport still only used for essential travel and some of our favourite parks and gardens closed, we’re exploring the green spaces closer to home for a suitable patch of grass on which to spread our blankets.The best-dressed picnic baskets are filled with treats that support local producers, from honey collected by local beekeepers and veg from the farmer’s market, to unique small-batch cheeses and British charcuterie sliced on to artisanal sourdough. Explore your local high street to see what gems you can unearth.Home cooking with a little helpOnce we realised how much mess keeping a sourdough starter alive entails, the appeal of devoting ourselves to becoming expert home chefs faded fairly fast. With more food businesses pivoting to offer meal kits designed to be finished off at home for that personal touch, there’s no better time to start enjoying gourmet food delivered to your door (without worrying about it getting cold). For a taste of Italy, Pasta Evangelists offer artisan pasta and sauces via next-day delivery across the UK, which can be whipped up at home in minutes. With dishes inspired by culinary traditions found across Italy, from Venice to Sicily, you can be taken on a foodie journey with all the taste and minimum effort.Growing lupinsSince lockdown began, gardening has shot up in popularity, with garden centres opening some time before other non-essential businesses. From window sills to flower beds, this summer is about attempting to turn green spaces into a riot of colour to rival the rainbows pinned in people’s windows, and the West Country Lupin has been particularly popular. Packed with uplifting colour, lupins are easy to grow and soothing to look at, making them the ideal flower to plant this summer.Virtual destination toursGrounded globetrotters are fulfilling their wanderlust by taking virtual tours of some of the world’s most stunning spots. Choose from tours offering 360-degree views of popular destinations such as Tokyo or Machu Picchu, or watch a live stream from San Diego Zoo or California’s Monterey Bay Aquarium.You can even take a treadmill walk through the Colosseum – made even more authentic by concocting a refreshing gin spritz with Malfy Gin Rosa to take with you on your virtual tour.CottagecoreAnyone not ensconced in a countryside pad with an acre or two of garden attached is currently looking enviously towards the idyllic-looking lockdowns of those who are. As even the most ardent city-dweller wrests with sourdough starters and homemade crumpets, we’re being calmed by a trend that has been dubbed “cottagecore” – an aesthetic oozing with images of perfect-looking pies, vases filled with wildflowers and verdant countryside. Get the look by adding some floral frocks or shirts to your wardrobe.Malfy Gin is available to purchase in selected Tesco, Sainsbury’s, Morrisons, Asda, M\u0026ampS, Waitrose and Co-op stores, as well as Ocado and the Malfy Gin Amazon brand storePlease drink Malfy Gin responsibly.

We don’t know what the impact is.”A Faculty spokesperson declined to comment on the criticism, but said that the project analysed public posts from Twitter containing words relating to the pandemic, such as “covid” or “coronavirus”, as part of an endeavour to help the government detect emerging issues relating to the pandemic in local communities.They said personally identifiable information, such as Twitter usernames or profiles, was stripped out from the data at the point of collection, meaning it would be impossible to use the information to profile any inidual or group of people.Carlo expressed scepticism that social media posts would provide the government with an accurate insight into public attitudes. “Twitter is not representative of public opinion as a whole,” she said. “I think there are a lot of questions to be asked about the premise.”An MHCLG spokesperson said: “We are satisfied that the service provided by Faculty was of a high standard, and delivered on value for money.” They added that the contract expired in July.The MHCLG social media work is one of several government contracts awarded to Faculty relating to coronavirus. In March an existing contract to support the NHS with AI initiatives was expanded so that the firm could help create a “coronavirus datastore” for the government, visualising NHS data to help inform ministerial decision-making.The company has several links to figures in the Vote Leave campaign and the Conservative party. Two of its investors, Theodore Agnew and John Nash, are current or former Conservative ministers.In 2016 the firm was recruited by Cummings to provide data science and machine learning technology for the Vote Leave campaign. The work was carried out by Ben Warner, the brother of Faculty’s CEO, Marc Warner.Ben subsequently worked on the Conservative party’s 2019 general election campaign, and was later recruited as a data science adviser to Downing Street.Last month the  reported Cummings had paid more than £250,000 to Faculty via his private consultancy firm, Dynamic Maps. Both parties have declined to explain what the payments were for. Faculty has previously said it would no longer accept political work.The Scott Trust, the ultimate owner of the , is the sole investor in GMG Ventures, which is a minority shareholder in Faculty."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/904114a91bfebc0b04b9aa0d93ebbc5c49b70953/0_22_1280_768/master/1280.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=91eecf7cb0459f7d260210fe266b6dcd","title":"share your reaction on the belarus election result","story":"If you live, work in Belarus or are an expat, we would like to hear your thoughts on the election resultProtests have broken out in Belarus after Alexander Lukashenko, who has ruled for 26 years, claimed he had won a landslide victory in an election marred by accusations of vote-rigging.In clashes that took place on Sunday, riot police used rubber bullets, flash grenades, teargas and a water cannon to quash protests.Whether you live, work in Belarus or are an expat, we would like to hear your reaction to the election result.

These unique primates are adept at fashioning tools from stones to crack nuts, and sticks to fish for food.It also dashes the hopes of communities who have been campaigning for the right to return to villages in the forest from which they were violently displaced decades ago.“We have always lived in harmony with this forest and its ersity, but people just want to make money,” said Chief Victor Yetina, a ruler among the Indigenous Banen people.The decree covers 68,000 hectares in the east of Ebo forest, which Banen people and other Indigenous groups consider their sacred ancestral home.He said his people were planning to bring legal action to try to force the government to reverse its decision.Sylvie Djacbou, a forest campaigner at Greenpeace Africa, said logging in the forest would be a “death sentence” for endangered primates, and he urged the government to cancel the plans and designate Ebo forest as a self-managed park instead.Cameroon is among the world’s largest exporters of timber, which it predominantly sells to China. President Paul Biya’s government, in power since 1982, has come under increasing pressure to boost the economy owing to the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic.Yetina said the move contravened a 1994 forestry law because the government had failed to sufficiently consult affected communities or settle claims to the land before signing the decree. Banen people were forced from the forest in 1963 as Cameroonian soldiers and guerrillas fought each other in the aftermath of independence from French colonial rule.More than 40 villages were resettled within a strip of land about 10 miles from the forest edge. Yetina said a promise by the government of the time that they could return when the fighting ended was never honoured. In response to mounting criticism, Cameroon’s minister for forestry and wildlife, Jules Doret Ndongo, said the government was committed to conservation in the forest, and that logging would not harm its bioersity.In 2006 the Cameroonian government pledged to turn Ebo forest into a national park, but this was opposed by local communities who feared their land would become state property. A minister recently complained that the government had grown tired of waiting for international donors to support the project."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c4c83f213b962c805ab3ac621daa1e3f80acd0ba/806_96_3591_2156/master/3591.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1c4d809a3392c7d28686d23c925da8cb","title":"new zealand records first new covid 19 cases in 102 days","story":"Auckland back in lockdown as PM Jacinda Ardern confirms four people from one family have tested positiveNew Zealand has recorded four new cases of Covid-19, after more than 100 days without any community transmission of the disease, the prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, has announced at a late-night press conference.Auckland was swiftly put under a three-day lockdown after four cases were confirmed in one family there. The family had not travelled overseas and the source of the infection is unknown.This is significant because the country had not recorded transmission of the virus within the community in more than three months and daily life had returned to normal, except for strict border controls.All 22 known cases of the virus before this announcement were among returning travellers quarantined in isolation facilities.The latest case in New Zealand was diagnosed on Monday in a person in their 50s who lives in South Auckland a second test on Tuesday also came back positive. The person had no history of overseas travel.Three other family members of the six in the house have tested positive for coronavirus the others have tested negative.One of those diagnosed was a preschooler. The family’s contacts – and multiple workplaces – are being tested.Ardern said “many questions remain” about the four new cases of Covid-19 diagnosed in the community, after 102 days of no such cases in the country.She announced that as of 12pm on Wednesday, Auckland, New Zealand’s largest city, would be placed in a restrictive phase of lockdown for three days.Ardern said the most important thing was “tracing this case back to its original origin”. “We have not been able to determine the source of these cases,” she told reporters.Those diagnosed had no known link to the managed isolation facilities for returning travellers, nor to the country’s borders, where all recorded cases of the virus have been registered.Now, officials are asking Aucklanders to stay at home for at least three days – starting from noon on Wednesday as they attempt to trace the source of the infections. Under the so-called “level three” rules – one step down from the strictest level – Aucklanders should not go out unless they need to travel for work, or they are shopping or exercising.Contact with others should be kept to a minimum, with all schools and childcare centres, and most businesses, closed. Supermarkets will remain open, and takeaway food and coffee will be available.In the meantime, case numbers are expected to rise.“We’re expecting to see other cases,” said Ashley Bloomfield, New Zealand’s director-general of health. “We want to find those other cases as soon as possible and identify or isolate any contacts.”Since early June, when all remaining restrictions – except the strict border controls – eased on the country, New Zealanders have revelled in being one of the safest and most relaxed countries in the world when it came to Covid-19 so much so that Ardern and Bloomfield had begun to warn in recent weeks of “complacency”. The country would certainly see a community outbreak of the virus again, they said.“I know that this information will be very difficult to receive,” Ardern said in the live broadcast news conference on Tuesday, when she announced the new cases.“As a team we have also been here before,” she said. “We know that if we have a plan and stick to it we can work our way through difficult and unknown situations.”The city-wide lockdown – the wider Auckland region is home to nearly 2 million of New Zealand’s 5 million people – was a “cautious” approach, said Ardern, but the three-day window gave officials time to gather the necessary information about the outbreak before she made longer-term decisions.“Moving an entire city and New Zealand’s largest city into level-3 restriction is not something we’ve taken lightly,” she said. But she added it would not have been possible to effectively isolate one small part of the city.In recent weeks, New Zealanders have watched in horror as cases surged once more in the Australian state of Victoria – a situation Ardern has referenced often when urging vigilance among the population. She and officials had been concerned with the number of people reportedly declining Covid-19 tests, and piecemeal uptake of the government’s contact-tracing app.Now New Zealand is among the growing list of countries to record success in quelling the virus – only to see a resurgence.Ardern “absolutely” understood New Zealand’s disappointment, she said. “That is a completely natural feeling. We have 102 days and it was very easy to feel like New Zealand was out of the woods.”But, she added, New Zealand had “gone the longest” of any country in the world without community transmission. “Because we were the only ones, we always knew we had to plan.“My request is not to be dispirited or disheartened,” she said.Only those who are returning home are allowed to enter Auckland – and only those who live elsewhere are allowed to leave New Zealand’s largest city.Ardern warned against panic-buying at Auckland supermarkets ahead of the Wednesday lockdown, but photos on social media showed large crowds and long queues following the news.The restrictions on the rest of the country are less stringent but will be noticeable for a population that has grown accustomed to no coronavirus regulations. NewZealanders outside of Auckland should not gather in large numbers, should work from home if they can, and should wear masks if physical distancing is impossible.New Zealand is less than six weeks from an election, with lawmakers crossing the country in whistlestop tours. Ardern – who has recently been in Auckland where the Covid-19 outbreak has been recorded – said she would remain in Wellington for the next three days.She would not be drawn on how much longer the restrictions could last if the source of the Auckland infections was not found, or whether she was considering a delay to the election scheduled for 19 September."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9edf738166addbcbc137ada89f0e340881913b71/0_272_8108_4865/master/8108.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ad72eb57c718a4c58a9199de0320693a","title":"uk coronavirus live news covid 19 latest updates a level exams","story":"Scottish education secretary to make emergency statement as pressure grows in England over A-level resultsHi, I’m just picking up the blog for a short while whilst Archie is having his lunch.

Email nazia.parveen@the or follow me on Twitter https:twitterNParveenG and send me a DMSturgeon says that tomorrow she will give her conclusion on the Aberdeen restrictions at the Scottish parliament, and that she’ll be back here on Thursday, “hopefully talking about something other than football”. And that’s it.My weary fingers and I are off for a quick break. You’re in Nazia Parveen’s capable hands in the meantime.Back at Sturgeon and Leitch’s press conference, Sturgeon (who has definitely got sick of being asked about football at this point, incidentally) is asked how you ensure that 2020 results are not looked at unfavourably by future employers. “Welcome to the reality of governance,” she says ruefully. “These decisions particularly in a time of crisis are not easy.” She’s interesting on what changed her mind on exam results, syaing that previous concerns she raised have been increasingly outweighed by fearing that young people from working class backgrounds will feel that the system is weighted against them, and she doesn’t want them to feel that way. “Maybe we just need to accept that 2020 is unique,” she says. “If it is the case that some young people’s teacher estimates are above what statistically they would be expected to get in an exam, when you weigh that against the disadvantage young people are being served up by covid, maybe we’re just balancing that out a little bit.”Johnson also tells reporters that the UK economy faces more “bumpy months” ahead following the latest rise in unemployment. Speaking on a visit to Herefordshire, the prime minister said the government was committed to making the “colossal investments” needed to rebuild the economy.“We always knew that this was going to be a very tough time for people,” he said. “What we are going to have to do is to keep going with our plan to ‘build, build, build’ and build back better, and ensure that we make the colossal investments that we can now make in the UK economy to drive jobs and growth.“Obviously what we want to see is a return to economic vitality and health. Some parts of the economy are undoubtedly showing great resilience but clearly there are going to be bumpy months ahead and a long, long way to go.”Meanwhile, Boris Johnson has been asked about reports that work by Public Health England suggested secondary school pupils transmit coronavirus like adults. He says: “I’m very, very impressed by the way schools have got ready.“Obviously we need to make sure that we don’t have a second wave, that we do everything we can to avoid a second wave.“I’m afraid you are going to see outbreaks, we have seen them across the country in the last few weeks and months and we have also seen the immense efforts that local authorities have gone to, local communities have gone to, to get that outbreak under control.“The most important thing for people to remember is that you have got to get schools back, we will get schools back, but also we have got to stick to our discipline - so in schools they have some very well thought through plans for how to manage it.”On exam results, Sturgeon is asked what it would take for education secretary John Swinney to get “a red card”. She dodges the question and says she is focused on the substance of the issue.Sturgeon says she is anxious to get the jobs guarantee mentioned earlier up and running as quickly as possible. She says that “we want to make sure there is every opportunity possible for young people given what lies ahead of us” when it comes to considering university places. She notes that the proportion of the press conference devoted to the football breaches is an indication of how the issue is a distraction from more important matters.Sturgeon says she doesn’t want to issue blanket punishments to football but the game has to “get its house in order”. Leitch says he is “very confident” that the football authorities understand the issues, he has “some confidence” in managers and captains and that they had a “wake-up call” in his meeting with them, and he has “less confidence in the inidual player behaviour”. “That’s the bit we require in addition to the clubs and the regulatory bodies,” he says.Sturgeon says that when deciding whether to extend or lift restrictions in Aberdeen, the number of cases and whether “chains of transmission are sufficiently broken”, as well as acceleration or deceleration of growth, will be considered. Leitch says that in recent days there has been a slowing of growth but “we are not back to normal” in Aberdeen. “I am encouraged... but remember the virus doesn’t work in 24-hour chunks, it works in 7 and 14 day chunks, so we’re not yet over that hump completely.”Leitch says that Celtic player Boli Bolingoli “went to Spain to a high-risk country that we have assessed that you shouldn’t go about your business as normal... he put both his team and the opposing team at risk. Therefore there has to be an implication of that in public health terms, not disciplinary terms. If that had been me or the first minister who had flown to Spain, we would have to take that seriously.”Sturgeon says she is not ordering the football authorities to cancel Celtic and Aberdeen games, but that “given the circumstances” she is “being clear” that she would not expect to see either team play over the course of the week.“It’s a responsibility they owe to their fans not to put football in jeopardy,” she says. “I appreciate it’s inidual players who made the wrong decisions but football clubs have a responsibility to try to make sure they don’t. I don’t want the football season to be in jeopardy.”Leitch says how dismayed he was by the Celtic news and says they put public health at risk as well as the return of wider elite sport. “I hope you can hear in my voice how disappointed I was... it’s a series of breaches now.” He says the guidance and rules are crystal clear and that he looks forward to Scottish football coming up with a solution itself.Sturgeon now takes questions and addresses concerns over the behaviour of footballers after the news that a Celtic player breached the coronavirus rules - a second such incident in the game in Scotland after one involving Aberdeen. “What I regret is that some football players seem incapable of living up to their responsibilities,” she says, and mentions that Leitch had a meeting yesterday with managers and captains to reiterate their responsibilities - during which the Celtic news came through.“This is just not acceptable,” she says, noting that “the vast majority” of the public are respecting the guidelines. “This can’t go on... I want to get to a situation here where clubs and players live up to their responsibilities.”She says that she doesn’t want the price of this to be paid by fans, as well as clubs and players which are living up to their responsibilities. After talks this morning with clubs, which she says more will be said about today, she says Aberdeen and Celtic will not be playing over the coming week. “Let me put this as clearly as I can in language that the football world will understand: consider today the yellow card. The next time it will be the red card because you will leave us with absolutely no choice.Leitch sets out Scottish government guidelines and how they relate to the school environment. He highlights that face coverings should be worn for face to face interactions between adults lasting for more than 15 minutes and says that children and adults alike should use them on public transport. He notes that adults in schools should avoid crowded places and not gather together in communal areas like staff rooms. He says staff and pupils should wash their hands regularly, and that adults should maintain a 2-metre distance from each other as much as possible and even from children if they can.Leitch says primary school children do not need to distance themselves from each other but that secondary school children should do so as much as possible, for example through one way systems in corridors. Finally, he says people should self-isolate and book tests if they have systems. He says that this final precaution is the most important to keeping schools open.Sturgeon notes that schools are starting to return today, which she calls a “very important milestone”. “While it will cause some anxiety... it is nevertheless a really welcome moment,” she says. “Today’s return really has been made possible by the progress all of us have made in suppressing the virus but we know... that that progress remains fragile and we need to remain vigilant and cautious.” She encourages people to work from home if they can to protect that progress.She says the Aberdeen outbreak shows the continuing risk. “All of us need to think about our own actions particularly on physical distancing,” she says, urging people not to “create bridges” for the virus to spread. She links schools staying open to continuing to suppress the virus. She reiterates the government guidelines and hands over to Jason Leitch, national clinical director of the Scottish government.“The public health crisis of Covid is creating a very significant economic crisis,” she says. “A major focus of our efforts has been... to do everything we can to prevent youth unemployment... today’s figures have confirmed that this pandemic is likely to lead to an increase in youth unemployment.” She talks about a “youth guarantee” for jobs and a need to drive an increase in apprenticeships. “Today we are allocating an additional £10m to recruit and train apprentices,” she says.Sturgeon says she will not speak about the exam situation, which she will leave to John Swinney’s emergency statement later.She says that 253 cases have been identified in Aberdeen since 26 July, 165 associated with one cluster linked to Aberdeen pubs. The rate of increase appears to be slowing down, she says. She says that the 875 contacts linked to the pub cluster have been traced and that this is an “enormous credit” to the test and trace team. But she says that “we are likely to identify new cases and new contacts for the next few days”."},{"url":null,"title":"climate","story":"\u0026lsquoExtensive Irish commitment to data centres\u0026rsquo could cause cost to consumer, study findsBuyers may want to go green, but for those travelling long distances the range is smallReform needed to safeguard \u0026euro6bn income while promoting electric vehicles, economist warns"},{"url":null,"title":"heritage","story":"Michael Viney: The wayside ashes of the west stand as defiantly healthy emblems of their kindInidual ants are certainly not smart, but their group wisdom may exceed our ownMichael Viney: Irish numbers have more than doubled since the counts of Operation Seafarer in 1970Michael Viney: A predator denning in parks, gardens and wasteland gets mixed responsesA beefed-up, independent National Parks and Wildlife Service would be just the ticketMichael Viney: Wild grasses have loved the mood swings of our climate this yearAnother Life: As one of many of the world\u0026rsquos declining seabirds, puffins are now receiving much more necessary and serious attentionAnother Life: A new book on the founders of the Tyler Prize shows their political influenceAvian science journal Ibis reports \u0026lsquogreat conservation concern\u0026rsquo about the speciesAnother Life: Dairy farmer Bruce Thompson examines impact of worming drug on beetlesMichael Viney: Crumbling hilltop trig pillars\u0026rsquo played key role in the mapping of IrelandAntipodean flatworms pose risk to indigenous variety which could have severe knock-on effectsAnother Life: Some floaters circle territories and sneak the odd \u0026lsquoextra-pair copulation\u0026rsquoMichael Viney: Plant intelligence rests in the ways by which they solve their problemsA Life on Our Planet is a terrifying catalogue of our self-sabotaging transgressionsGreys carry squirrel-pox virus which is fatal to Ireland\u0026rsquos native redsAnother Life: The disappearance of this bird from cities has prompted much researchRobinson has followed Mair\u0026eacutead, his wife and collaborator, into the list of Covid-19 fatalitiesWill Covid-19 begin a resurgence of the 1970s withdrawal from growth-driven capitalism?Greater industry involvement required if bovine TB to be eliminated by 2030 targetMichael Viney: Camera traps are now used as a regular part of hare monitoring"},{"url":null,"title":"confronting","story":"A news podcast from The  that covers Ireland\u0027s response to the Coronavirus outbreak.

A spike in coronavirus cases has forced the reintroduction of local restrictions in Kildare, Laois and Offaly. Photograph: Collins PhotosIreland and other European countries experiencing a resurgence in Covid-19 cases should consider reinstating selected restrictions to avoid further increases in cases and deaths, according to a new risk assessment by the European Centre for Disease Control.The ECDC says there is a “true resurgence” in cases in several countries as a result of physical distancing measures being relaxed.The assessment comes as the Government plans to roll out a national testing scheme in food processing plants with more than 50 employees.Officials from the Department of Agriculture met the HSE on Monday to discuss the new testing regime for workers in the food companies.A senior source said the plans will involve weekly testing in all plants in Kildare, Laois and Offaly for an initial period of four weeks.Alongside this, testing will be directed at companies with more than 50 employees nationally although risk assessments will be carried out on smaller companies and testing may follow there too.Officials are examining the national testing capacity and turnaround times but a source said the Government hopes to have the new serial testing scheme up and running by next week. Overall planA spokesman for the HSE said an overall plan would be sent to the National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET) later this week, after engagement with key stakeholders. The ECDC risk assessment says further incidences of Covid-19 “can be mitigated if sufficient control measures are reinstalled or reinforced in a timely manner”.Alongside a tailored and comprehensive testing strategy, the speed of contact tracing is important to reduce transmission, it says. Efforts should be made to shorten the time needed for each step in the testing, notification and contact-tracing process.Despite the rise in cases, it says countries should be better prepared to control any resurgence given the public health measures in place.Speaking at a NPHET briefing on Monday, acting chief medical officer Dr Ronan Glynn said Ireland is still “in a good place” relative to many places in the world, despite recent increase in case numbers. New figures from the ECDC show the incidence of the virus in Ireland rising above that in the UK for the first time on Monday. Dr Glynn said over the past 14 days, 879 cases have been notified, giving a 14-day incidence of 18.5 per 100,000. He said Ireland’s rate was much lower than the UK’s outside counties Kildare, Laois and Offaly, where a spike in cases has forced the reintroduction of local restrictions.Regional restrictionsWarning of “ups and downs” in the number of cases to be reported over the coming days, he said it would be next week before officials could assess whether the regional restrictions were working.A further 57 cases were reported by the NPHET on Monday – lower than expected – and no deaths. The emergency team has brought forward its next meeting to Wednesday to focus on the evolving situation in the midlands.Meanwhile, Tánaiste and Minister for Business Leo Varadkar is due to meet with publicans on Tuesday, and a meeting with Minister for Public Expenditure Michael McGrath is also planned. Sources say the Government is coming under increasing pressure from pubs to set a date for reopening and to provide extra financial support in the meantime. WaiverGovernment TDs are also calling for an enhanced economic package to support the region. Fianna Fáil TD for Kildare North James Lawless said supports “over and above the July stimulus” were needed. He has submitted a list of potential policies to his party colleague, Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform Michael McGrath, including a waiver on licensing fees, a rebate or grant for businesses that saw stock spoiled, measures to support the hospitality sector and an extension of the local authority rates referral. The issue of supports will be discussed at the Cabinet subcommittee on Covid-19 on Tuesday.

File photograph: Cyril ByrneThe .Independent TD Michael Healy-Rae has said he does not believe it is the job of shopkeepers to enforce the wearing of face coverings in their outlets. The Kerry deputy said he would be prepared to point out signs in his shop saying that masks are mandatory, but would not refuse people not wearing coverings entry to the store.“A little gentle reminder is ok,” he told Newstalk’s Pat Kenny show on Tuesday. “We are not going to be at the door saying you can’t come in, but we are highly recommending to people that they do obey.”Regulations making face coverings mandatory in shops and other indoor public settings such as hairdressers and museums came into force on Monday.Similar to the regulations requiring people to wear face masks on public transport, those in breach of the rules can be fined up to €2,500 or face six months imprisonment.The regulations apply to shops, supermarkets, shopping centres, retail outlets, hairdressers, nail bars, museums, libraries, and cinemas. The requirement does not extend to restaurants, bars, cafes, or post offices, credit unions and banks. Premises providing healthcare services such as opticians or dentists are also exempt.‘Repeat offenders’Mr Healy-Rae, who operates a petrol station and supermarket in Kilgarvan, said he believed it was right that members of the public had been asked to wear coverings.“If you forgot you’d be embarrassed, by seeing everyone else complying you’d be reminded,” he said.“We all make mistakes, so I would take no notice of someone not complying, but only the once. I would not like repeat offenders. We all want to do our best.“But I really don’t believe it’s the place of shopkeepers to enforce. I want to make my shop attractive, I don’t want to have a heavy hand.”Mr Healy-Rae said he wanted to thank staff in shops across the country - who had two jobs to do - protect themselves and their customers.Wearing a mask was for the public good, he said, and he had no problem complying himself.It was important to be positive, he added, and the day would come when people could be within 2m of each other again.

Vacancy data also showed a “sizeable fall in demand for labour”, NISRA noted, with April showing the lowest number of vacancy postings since records began in 2014, while the average number of hours worked fell to the lowest on record between April and June. The data contained in NISRA’s Labour Market Report, which is released monthly, shows the impact of the coronavirus pandemic on the North’s economy. It is required by law that the Department for the Economy is notified of a proposal to make redundant 20 or more employees.According to NISRA, the number of proposed redundancies reached almost 2,000 in July, following almost 2,500 in June. A further 163 were proposed between August 1st and August 10th. However, true figures are likely to be higher, as companies are not required to notify the Department for the Economy of redundancies of fewer than 20 employees. The redundancies were mainly in the manufacturing, wholesale, retail and transportation sectors. More than 8,750 redundancies were proposed in the year until the end of July, more than double the number recorded in the previous 12 months and the highest on record. The number of confirmed redundancies - 3,112 - in the most recent 12 months was 74 per cent higher than in the previous 12 months, when there were 1,785 confirmed redundancies. A total of 610 redundancies took place last month. There is a difference between the number of proposed and confirmed reduncancies because of the notice period employers must give staff. The number of vacancies notified to the Department of Communities from April to June fell to 7,900, less than half the previous quarter. Earnings for the same period fell by 1.5 per cent to £1,681 (€1,868) on average per month.The number of people claiming unemployment benefit rose by 500, with NISRA noting it was the third consecutive month the claimant count was above 60,000. These were “levels previously seen in 2012 and 2013,” it said. “The headline employment rate decreased over the quarter and the year, but at 71.7 per cent remains relatively high and above rates in 2018,” NISRA found. “However, within those included in the employed total, 21 per cent were temporarily away from work and 40 per cent were working fewer than their usual hours. “This has had a large impact on the number of hours worked across the economy the average number of hours worked per week is now the lowest on record at 27.1 hours per week, a decrease of 6.8 hours per week or 20 per cent over the year,” the agency found.

Of the £355 million the package involves £200 million towards a new free-to-use Trader Support Service that will assist with import, safety and security declarations on behalf of traders.The other £155 million, according to Mr Gove’s office, will fund the development of new technology to ensure the new processes can be fully digital and streamlined.Mr Gove’s department said the “new service will be available to businesses bringing in goods from Great Britain or the rest of the world, providing guidance as well as dealing with their requirements for moving goods into Northern Ireland”. The £300 million confirmed by Mr Gove for the Peace Plus programme will help “to support peace, prosperity and reconciliation projects on the island of Ireland”.Mr Gove who, accompanied by Northern Secretary Brandon Lewis, was visiting Northern Ireland on Friday, said the £650 million investment underlined the British government’s “absolute commitment to the people and businesses of Northern Ireland as we move towards the end of the transition period”.“Our new free-to-use Trader Support Service will provide vital support and guidance to traders, while our £300 million investment in reconciliation projects will help to preserve the huge gains from the peace process and the Belfast Agreement,” he said. “As we continue to engage with businesses, and our discussions with the EU proceed, we will update these resources to ensure that traders are ready for the end of the transition period,” added Mr Gove.Mr Lewis said the Trader Support Service “will ensure that businesses of all sizes can have import processes dealt with on their behalf, at no cost”."},{"url":null,"title":"asia","story":"Prime minister Jacinda Ardern announces a strict lockdown for Auckland and a return to restrictions nationwideReaders queue from 2am to buy the pro-democracy tabloid after owner Jimmy Lai\u0026rsquos arrestsFair Work Commission\u0026rsquos decision that man made \u0026lsquooffensive\u0026rsquo video overturned on appealMaria Ressa\u0026rsquos news organisation Rappler is a buffer against dictatorship in PhilippinesLai has been a prominent democracy activist and an ardent critic of BeijingAuthorities warn against complacency as other countries battle a resurgenceCrack in hull of Japanese-owned ship is spilling oil into country\u0026rsquos famed blue lagoonsAttitudes still shaped by legacy code of conduct that dictates women must be submissive and patientAircraft with 190 passengers and crew on board overshoots runway in heavy rain in CalicutAbe avoids reference to nuclear treaty during scaled-back ceremony due to coronavirus\u0026lsquoWhat frightened me the most was how we got used to the piles of dead bodies\u0026rsquo \u0026ndash survivorIndia\u0026rsquos supreme court handed site to Hindus last year in culmination of complex disputeChina says attempts by Washington to engage more closely with Taipei \u0026lsquodoomed to fail\u0026rsquoCountry\u0026rsquos move closer to China set to be confirmed after unusually subdued pollThree men stuck on tiny Pikelot Island after boat ran out of fuel spotted by military aircraftAustralian state to deploy military, impose hefty fines to enforce Covid-19 isolationNorth Korea subject to UN sanctions since 2006 over nuclear and ballistic missile programsAt least 29 killed in terror group\u0026rsquos assault on prison in eastern city of JalalabadPolice officers and government officials suspended following deaths in Punjab stateInfections surge in Latin America while China reports highest total since MarchStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4327438.1597141546!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"covid 19 new zealand s largest city in lockdown after first local case in 102 days","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tNew Zealand prime minister Jacinda Adern announced a return to a coronavirus  lockdown for Auckland. Photograph: Brendon O’HaganBloombergNew Zealand has recorded four new cases of Covid-19, after more than 100 days without any community transmission of the disease, the prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, has announced at a late-night press conference.There are four confirmed cases of Covid-19 in one family in New Zealand’s largest city, Auckland. The family had not travelled overseas and the source of the infection is unknown.This is significant because the country had not recorded transmission of the virus within the community in more than three months and daily life had returned to normal, except for strict border controls.All 22 known cases of the virus before this announcement were among returning travellers quarantined in isolation facilities.The latest case in New Zealand was diagnosed on Monday in a person in their 50s who lives in South Auckland a second test on Tuesday also tested positive. The person had no history of overseas travel.Three other family members of the six in the house have tested positive for coronavirus the others have tested negative.Ms Ardern said “many questions remain” about the four new cases of Covid-19 diagnosed in the community, after 102 days of no such cases in the country.She announced that as of 12pm on Wednesday, Auckland, New Zealand’s largest city, would be placed in a restrictive phase of lockdown for three days.Ms Ardern said the most important thing was “tracing this case back to its original origin”.“We have not been able to determine the source of these cases,” she told reporters.Those diagnosed had no known link to the managed isolation facilities for returning travellers, nor to the country’s borders, where all recorded cases of the virus have been registered.All schools and childcare facilities will be closed in Auckland from tomorrow, except for classes for the children of essential workers.– Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4327420.1597139712!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"russia approves covid 19 vaccine after less than two months of human tests","story":"Russian president Vladimir Putin says he knows that Russia\u0027s Covid-19 vaccine is effective because his own daughter was part of the trial.

Photograph: Alexey NikolskySputnikAFP via Getty Images.Vladimir Putin said on Tuesday that Russia had become the first country in the world to grant regulatory approval to a Covid-19 vaccine. The vaccine was approved after less than two months of human testing, a move hailed by Moscow as evidence of its scientific prowess.The development paves the way for the mass inoculation of the Russian population, even as the final stage of clinical trials to test safety and efficacy continue.The speed at which Russia is moving to roll out its vaccine highlights its determination to win the global race for an effective product, but has stirred concerns that it may be putting national prestige before sound science and safety.Speaking at a government meeting on state television, Mr Putin said the vaccine, developed by Moscow’s Gamaleya Institute, was safe and that it had even been administered to one of his daughters.“I know that it works quite effectively, forms strong immunity, and I repeat, it has passed all the needed checks,” the Russian president said.He said he hoped the country would soon start mass producing the vaccine.Larger trialIts approval by the health ministry foreshadows the start of a larger trial involving thousands of participants, commonly known as a Phase III trial.Such trials, which require a certain rate of participants catching the virus to observe the vaccine’s effect, are normally considered essential precursors for a vaccine to receive regulatory approval.Regulators around the world have insisted that the rush to develop Covid-19 vaccines will not compromise patient safety.

I’d hazard that your choice says something about you. Traditionalists plump for Sean Connery, while those of an edgy or progressive bent favour Daniel Craig. One colleague argues persuasively for George Lazenby, proving that we humans are indeed a erse bunch. (Being immature, with a weakness for puns and a well-cocked eyebrow, mine is Roger Moore.) Many viewers simply choose the first they saw in a cinema.The magazine Radio Times aims to set the record straight, polling tens of thousands of readers in a knock-out tournament between the six actors who have graced the role. The results are fascinating. Connery finishes top – no surprises there. Intriguingly, Timothy Dalton’s gritty, criminally underrated Bond ends up in second place, ahead of Pierce Brosnan and Roger Moore. Daniel Craig was eliminated immediately.This seems quite the upset when you consider that not long ago, many critics were hailing Craig as the greatest ever Bond. Yet his films have never recaptured the high watermark of his debut in Casino Royale, directed by Martin Campbell, the architect of another game-changing reboot, Goldeneye. The series soon turned in a worthier and more tedious direction axing much of what was distinctively “Bond” gadgets, sexual chemistry – and yes, smutty wordplay – replacing them with bewilderingly fast-moving action sequences and CGI. Then the ultimate sacrilege Bond’s trademark Martini was supplanted in one scene by a Heineken bottle, amid so much product placement I almost wondered when they would start calling him “007UP”.There are constant efforts to unearth deeper emotional meaning from Bond exposing him as a tortured white elephant of “toxic masculinity”, rather than the elegant, seductive gentleman spy of our fantasies. This perhaps explains recent films’ obsession with Bond’s origins reflecting our own identitarian times. The end result may be more multifaceted than, say, A View to a Kill, but it eliminates much of the fun. Only the most committed fan would return for round two of Quantum of Solace.I suspect many of the Craig enthusiasts aren’t great lovers of the franchise – more likely scholarly critics, the perennially woke, or else they like him precisely because he is more Bourne than Bond. For my money, Craig is to Bond what the Duke and Duchess of Sussex are to the Royal Family both tend to alienate traditional fans while energising new audiences.Over the weekend, Dad and I watched Moonraker, one of the sillier Moore outings. We groaned as Bond tries to remain incognito among the sightseers of Venice by driving through St Mark’s Square on a hovercraft-gondola mounted on a giant Union Jack, while waiters spill drinks and a pigeon performs a double-take. We cheered as the Defence Minister, upon spotting the obligatory footage of Bond and his love interest in intergalactic flagrante, says, “My God, what’s Bond doing?”, to which Q responds: “I think he’s attempting re-entry, sir”. Bond is nothing without this element of prep school humour.In years to come, we may look back on Connery’s victory over Craig as a vital milestone in this mini culture war. While elitists push for an ever-more tortured Bond, normies like me will seek solace in double-taking pigeons and exploding pens.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and

since the end of June - but data suggests the rise is being driven by more infections in younger people and increased testing. A total of 1,062 people tested positive for Covid in the 24 hours before 9am on Sunday - nearly a fortnight after Prime Minister Boris Johnson warned of the possibility of a \u0027second wave\u0027 of infections.But the rise appearing in the UK\u0027s daily case numbers may in part be due to more testing - as infection rates climb among younger people while community testing is ramped up . According to the latest surveillance data from Public Health England, the infection rate is rising among all age groups under 65, and falling in every age group above 65 - those most at risk.Among the 15 to 44 age bracket, the infection rate has risen by 35 per cent over the last five weeks.It now almost matches the rate of infection among the over 85s, who have been the most disproportionately affected and at risk group throughout the pandemic.It suggests the recent rise in cases is being driven by cases in younger people who may not have previously been picked up by the testing regime.In the week to August 2, the rate of infection among 15 to 44 year olds in England was 11.9 per 100,00 people - up 35 per cent from the week ending July 5 at 8.8 per 100,000.It has climbed back to roughly the same rate seen in mid-June, while the infection rate among the over 85s has dropped dramatically before levelling off.At the height of the pandemic, in the week to May 3, the infection rate was at 302 per 100,000 people among the over 85s, and 44.1 in the 15 to 44 age bracket.When accounting for tests, the proportion of new cases being detected under Pillar 1 of the testing regime - for those in clinical need and public health workers - have been falling for weeks.The average number of new cases per 1,000 tests in Pillar 1 has dropped from 12.6 in early June to 1.4 by August 6.In the same period the number of tests conducted under Pillar 1 has risen from 248,338 in the week to June 7 to 357,242 in the week to August 6 - indicating a significant drop in cases.Within Pillar 2 - tests conducted by commercial partners in drive-in centres and community testing - there has been a recent uptick in the rate of cases picked up.In the last two weeks the number of cases picked up per 1,000 tests in Pillar 2 has risen from 8.2 to 9.4.Over the last fortnight the number of weekly Pillar 2 tests has risen from 545,662 to 615,648, suggesting a corresponding rise in cases in the community.But the overall trend in Pillar 2 cases has been relatively static since early July, when accounting for tests conducted.Significantly more tests are now taking place across the UK, with over one million (1,091,904) conducted in the last week alone.That represents 14 per cent more than the average weekly number in July and over eight times more than the equivalent figure for April.The rise in new cases is not evenly spread across the country, and in many areas there has not been a corresponding rise in the positivity rate of tests conducted among those in clinical need.While the infection rate in London has doubled since mid June, from 3 cases per 100,000 people to 6, it has been accompanied by a 50 per cent reduction in positive Pillar 1 tests, while the proportion of Pillar 2 tests coming back positive has risen from 0.8 per cent to 1.2 per cent.In the North West, which has seen the infection rate climb from 9.6 to 17.4 in the space of a month, the positivity rate has risen from 0.8 to 1 per cent in Pillar 1, and 2.1 to 2.5 per cent in Pillar 2.Meanwhile, those who are hospitalised with Covid now have much better chances of survival.Deaths in intensive care units are at their lowest level since the pandemic began, according to data from the Intensive Care National Audit \u0026amp Research Centre, with just two deaths in the final week of July.Though there is a significant lag between spikes in new cases translating into increased deaths, data shows that the ratio of those dying from Covid-19 in ICUs compared to those being discharged has fallen, which could indicate hospitals are grappling with the most severe cases more effectively. During April approximately two patients were dying for every three discharged, while now one patient is dying for every three discharged.However, the data for more recent weeks represents just a fraction of the numbers of patients ICU\u0027s during the pandemic\u0027s peak - in the first week of April, 1,037 patients died from Covid-19 in critical care while 1,354 were discharged.By contrast, in the first week of July, 19 died while 31 were discharged.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your

marriages mandatory","story":"The Government must overcome the fear of being labelled Islamophobic and make the registration of sharia Muslim marriages mandatory, according to a new report.Around 100,000 sharia marriages take place in the UK every year, of which up to 75 per cent are thought to be unregistered.Many Muslim women are unaware that they lack legal protection and access to marital rights after they have got married in an unregistered ceremony. For women in such unregistered religious-only marriages, orce has no legal status in UK civil or family law, leaving them facing destitution without financial assets or property as well as being shunned by their community.The report by the Civitas think tank, called Fallen Through the Cracks, cites a number of case studies featuring Muslim women in marital captivity and forced to hand over custody of their children in return for a orce.Author Emma Webb accuses successive governments of failing to address this well-known problem, claiming reluctance to act may be the result of a fear of being accused of Islamophobia.Despite calls from Muslim women activists and the international bodies, everyday women continue to suffer horribly because of completely unjustifiable shortcomings in our legislation, she said. Despite bigamy being illegal in the UK, the fact that religious-only marriages can go under the radar effectively allows men to enter into polygamous relationships that leave the women with absolutely no marital rights or legal protection under UK law. This leaves women and their children vulnerable to abuse, exploitation and destitution – it simply cannot be allowed to continue.The report recommends that the current legislation be amended to make the registration of all religious marriages in England and Wales mandatory, in line with the proposals of the Marriage Act 1949 (Amendment) Bill. It also calls for the Divorce (Religious Marriages) Act 2002 to be extended to cover Islamic orces, as was previously achieved for the Jewish community, and suggests an education campaign be launched to make people more aware of the consequences of unregistered religious-only marriages.Peers Baroness Cox and Lord Carlile both endorsed the report, published on Tuesday. More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad

an integrity row after the broadcaster admitted that some postal competition entries have been accidentally omitted from prize draws.Ofcom has instigated an investigation into the matter after an internal audit prompted ITV to report itself to the broadcast watchdog. On six occasions, the audit found that some viewers who submitted contest entries by postal vote were unable to win.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesITV viewers are charged £2 to enter competitions advertised on programmes including This Morning, The X Factor and Loose Women if they submit their entry via text message, phone or online. Postal entries, however, are free.According to ITV, six competitions were identified between 2014 and 2019 in which postal votes were excluded, which represented a “very small proportion” of the total entries.Whatever happened to the one-hit wonder?Andi Peters applauds ITV for ‘getting more black faces’ on TVNew series of I’m a Celebrity to be filmed in the UKThe omissions are allegedly the result of “isolated incidences of unintentional administrative errors”. The broadcaster has not named the competitions involved. In a statement provided to The Times, a spokesperson said: “The integrity of all viewer competitions run by ITV is a priority for us, therefore any related error is taken seriously.“The six competitions amount to roughly one third of one per cent of our competitions since 2014, and a tiny fraction of total entries.”Ofcom has the option to impose fines of up to £250,000 or five per cent of annual revenue (whichever is greater), once its investigation into ITV is complete.ITV has reportedly used computer software to simulate all six compromised competitions, and has determined that none of the overlooked postal entries was denied a prize.ITV came under criticism in 2007 for making millions from premium rate phone-ins on series such as Ant \u0026amp Dec’s Saturday Night Takeaway. It was revealed that participants’ entries were being ignored, despite being told their vote would influence the programme.At the time, Ofcom ordered ITV to pay £5.675m, a record sanction imposed on a broadcaster by the watchdog.The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Swindon is now the fourth worst affected area in the UK when measured as a proportion of population, having seen a 200 per cent increase in new cases over the last seven days.It has nearly as many new cases per person as Leicester, which was the first place to see tougher local restrictions put in place after the nationwide lockdown lifted.The UK as a whole remains a long way off its peak levels from April and May, when daily new cases frequently reached above 5,000.Yet local spikes could see the recent upwards trend continue if not brought under control, as has been the case in other countries like France and Spain.Having endured a big surge in cases during the early stages of the pandemic, London has since seen its number of daily cases drop at an even greater rate than the rest of the country.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

At a time when Londoners from all walks of life are struggling due to the impact of coronavirus, the importance of love and care from others has been magnified tenfold.The phrase comes from a work made by the artist Bob \u0026amp Roberta Smith – one of several fantastic lots in an auction kicking off today at sothebys to support The Independent’s Help the Hungry appeal.Over the past four months we have raised more than £7.5m for food redistribution charity The Felix Project – a cause for which we have pledged to raise £10m as well as to open central London’s largest community kitchen.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe auction is an opportunity to get your hands on works by some amazing artists – more likely to be seen on the walls of a museum than your living room. They can also be viewed at Sotheby’s, 34-35 New Bond Street.Ceramic has been a recurring motif for Ai Weiwei (a 1995 series of photographs showed him dropping a Han dynasty urn) and he has often used porcelain, for centuries a secret formula known only to Chinese makers. Flowers, too, are significant – when his passport was taken Ai put a bunch of fresh flowers in a bike basket outside his studio every day until he was able to travel freely. This small plate holds a great deal of meaning.Yinka Shonibare deconstructions of icons of western power couldn’t be more current. This elegant woodcut print, using vivid Batik textiles, transposes animal masks from Mali onto the faces of English aristocratic figures enriched off the back of colonisation and slavery. The patterns of textiles overlay the repeating patterns of power and show how history’s long fingers reach into our present.Unfailingly optimistic, Bob \u0026amp Roberta Smith’s work is always a call to care. He’s known for his colourful and impassioned but peaceful slogans (“Make Art Not War” seems like a good standard to live by) and his advocacy of art as a tool for education and understanding. We Have Only Got Each Other quotes his late mother, the artist Deirdre Borlase, spoken in response to the isions revealed during the Brexit campaign — but its universal meaning is clear.I’m a sucker for a good drawing – I’ve always felt that even at 500-odd years distance, it’s the form that brings you closest to an artist the sweep of a human hand that has just left the page. After many years of deeply mining her own emotions and experiences in her work, Emin is an artist at the height of her powers. Her raw, almost agonisingly expressive draughtsmanship gets me every time and this little sketch nails the feeling of having a really good cry.These three etchings – a supremely generous donation from Anish Kapoor, more usually known for the interactive theatricality of his large-scale sculptures – exude a quiet drama. Their simplicity belies their seductiveness velvety and intense, they draw you in, never quite revealing their secrets.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Wallinger was inspired by X-rays of Old Masters, which he thinks of as akin to spirit photography: “The revelation of the invisible, supernatural life of a painting.”A reminder of the pre-lockdown era, when we were able to wander the Hayward Gallery and bathe in the sea of pulsating colour that was Riley’s superb exhibition. This screenprint is from a series that vibrates right off the paper (Tate owns an edition of Elongated Triangles 5, so you’ll be in good company if you get your hands on this one).The essence of things is what Michael Craig-Martin seeks in his work, and colour is part of seducing the viewer to really look at the objects that make up our world. These sculptural reliefs in polished steel come from a series that pays homage to designers and architects whose vision has shaped what we think of as “modern”. You can’t sit on them, but look at them. Aren’t they beautiful?Help the hungry\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

In Minsk, which saw the worst violence, water cannon, stun grenades and rounds of rubber bullets were deployed against protesters. In two instances, a police van drove into crowds. At least four people ended up in intensive care, with one man reportedly in critical condition. In other cities across the country, officers reportedly laid down arms and crossed to the side of protesters. Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe unity opposition candidate Svetlana Tikhanovskaya, who claimed victory in the face of the scarcely credible 9.9 per cent assigned to her by the official preliminary results, called on police and army officers to stop the violence. “I want to ask them to remember that they are part of the nation too,” she said. Hours before voting ended, Belarus had all but declared a state of emergency. Footage of soldiers and military equipment entering the capital was widely shared by locals.By 6pm local time (3pm GMT), most of the capital’s central squares and government buildings had been cordoned off. Transport systems were shut down. Roads in and out of the capital were also closed. The regime’s obvious nervousness extended to widespread efforts to control the internet. Major disruptions to mobile networks were reported from the morning, with connections practically grinding to a halt at around 10pm local time. Proxy servers, used widely in these parts to get around censorship, became unreliable.Belarus’s upcoming election spells out two very different futuresUnidentified forces want ‘massacre’ in Belarus, says LukashenkoBelarus charges opposition politicians with assisting Russian plotJournalists and other independent observers appeared to be a target. At around 2pm local time, three reporters from the Russian liberal outlet TV Dozhd were handcuffed, held to the ground, and arrested. Just before midnight, AP photographer Mstyslav Chernov was admitted to hospital with suspected concussion after being beaten by riot police while in their custody. Sunday’s events came at the end of an unexpectedly panicked campaign for Belarus’s longtime leader – one that saw opposition candidates jailed, protesters snatched from the streets, the president claim a scarcely believable Russian-backed plot, and where the opposition candidate was forced into hiding on the eve of voting.Svetlana Tikhanovskaya, 37, was never supposed to mount a serious challenge, only entering the race after President Lukashenko jailed her husband, and presidential hopeful, Sergei Tikhanovsky. Famously dismissive of women in politics, Mr Lukashenko seemed to believe the housewife and former translator didn’t have a chance.

Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailBut her invigorating, earnest campaign surprised Belarus and it wrong-footed Mr Lukashenko. Few expected Ms Tikhanovskaya to reach an agreement with the campaign teams of other banned opposition candidates – but she managed to do so in just 15 minutes. Few believed she could lead a clear campaign – but she did so with simple promises to deliver fresh elections, walk back authoritarian changes to the constitution, and free political prisoners.Flanked by Veronika Tsepkalo, the wife of Valery Tsepkalo, another barred candidate, and Maria Kolesnikova, campaign manager for jailed Viktor Barbariko, Ms Tikhanovskaya’s opposition campaign took on unmistakably feminist, modern slant. It also brought over 200,000 people to the streets in support – an astonishing achievement in Belarus, a police state of just 9 million people, and where dissent often leads to jail.Underestimating Ms Tikhanovskaya was not the only mistake the usually clever and adroit Mr Lukashenko made in the run-up to the elections. His electoral rating was hit hard by a perceived cavalier approach to the Covid-19 epidemic: he claimed the virus was avoidable with vodka, trips to the sauna and work in the potato fields. His management of the country’s increasingly desperate economic position – and its rapidly unwinding model of Soviet planning with Russian subsidies – also provoked much anger. The extraordinary campaign to unseat Belarusian ‘dictator’ LukashenkoGiven the fact independent polling is illegal in Belarus, it was never entirely clear quite how vulnerable “Europe’s last dictator” actually became to Ms Tikhanovskaya’s challenge. But results from a handful of more reliable Minsk polling stations appeared to support the opposition claim that Ms Tikhanovskaya had, in fact, won — and convincingly.Unprecedented numbers of voters appeared to answer Ms Tikhanovskaya’s call to turn out late on Sunday — and the logic this would make falsifications more difficult. But Lidia Yermoshina, a key Lukashenko ally and chief vote counter as the head of Belarus\u0027s election committee, described the huge queues as “provocations” by the opposition. In an earlier interview on state TV, she described the opposition as a “totalitarian sect”.Independent exit polls conducted outside polling stations in foreign embassies also painted a starkly contrasting picture to the official figures. According to these surveys, Mr Lukashenko received just 6.25 per cent, compared to Ms Tikhanovskaya with 79.69 per cent. Ahead of the end of voting, Mr Lukashenko dismissed his rivals as being “unworthy of repression”. But he also seemed to make ominous warnings for those intending to protest. “All our structures and special services are ready and waiting,” he said. “There is no reason for our country to be plunged into chaos or civil war. I guarantee you that.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Health Minister Mikhail Murashko said a course of two shots would provide immunity for up to two years. Russia has embraced the race to approve the world’s first vaccine, with Kirill Dmitriev, head of the country’s sovereign wealth fund, likening the search to the Soviet launch of the world’s first satellite in 1957. Moscow announced the new coronavirus vaccine would be codenamed \u0027Sputnik,\u0027 in reference to that success. Russia claims to have approved first vaccine – follow liveRussia is one of two dozen countries involved in vaccine trials. In July, the United Kingdom accused Russia of hacking data from advanced trials at the University of Oxford — to the consternation of Moscow. The Russian vaccine uses adapted strains of the adenovirus, a virus that usually causes the common cold, but researchers have failed to produce evidence of its safety or efficacy. Testing was carried out on soldiers and medical students, with regulatory approval arriving several months ahead of the scheduled completion of clinical trials. That speed and lack of transparency has fuelled concerns that geopolitics may have been prioritised at the expense of science.

They added: It is thanks to our sources that we have been able to share the definitive story of the Duke and Duchess of Sussex.A source told The Sun Online: The book will explore the journey that Meghan and Harry went through in coming to the conclusion that they did. It will make clear that far from it being a snap decision that they took a long time to make it.The seeds of Megxit were sown before they even got married. The truth is that Harry had been deeply unhappy for a long time.And he and Meghan openly discussed going in a dferent direction well before they got married.”The Sussexes have insisted they had nothing to do with the book, while the authors have said they did not speak to them directly.Royal aides are worried that the book will blame Prince William for the Megxit fiasco in January.Aides are privately braced for Wills to be “painted as the bad guy”.An insider described how they fear that the future king, , could be portrayed as “unsympathetic, unfeeling and unsupportive” towards the Sussexes when they decided to split from the Royal Family.Dirty laundry aired this way could be as damaging as Princess Diana’s “there were three of us in this marriage” reference to Camilla in a bombshell  TV interview, the insider claimed.A source said aides have been discussing among themselves that the book will unfairly show only Harry and Meghan’s side of the rt, even though it is not an official ­biography.Kensington Palace said it would not comment on the book.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But a new spike in cases in recent days has forced the country to impose new restrictions. We look at what that means below.The Labour party has hit out at the current test-and-trace contract with outsourcing firm Serco, describing it as #ineffective and not fit for purpose#. Labour say the service should be led by directors of public health and supported by primary care and NHS labs.Shadow health minister Justin Madders added: #Labour has been calling for a locally-led contact tracing system for months # its welcome that local authorities are now finally being given additional support to tackle the virus in their areas.#But its clear Boris Johnsons £ billion centralised contact tracing system is nowhere near world-beating as he claims and the system is unable to fight local outbreaks successfully.#Quizzed by reporters on the safeof schools, the PM insisted: #I have no doubt that it can be done safely. Schools are doing a huge amount to make sure that it is done safely.#Just for the sake of social justice, ensuring that all our kids get the education they need, we need to get our pupils, our children, back to school in September and I am very, very impressed by the work that has been done to make those schools Covid-secure.#The PM was asked today about reports that work by Public Health England suggested secondary school pupils transmit coronavirus like adults. Responding to the reports, Boris Johnson said #Im very, very impressed by the way schools have got ready.#Obviously we need to make sure that we dont have a second wave, that we do everything we can to avoid a second wave.#But he added: #Im afraid you are going to see outbreaks, we have seen them across the country in the last few weeks and months and we have also seen the immense efforts that local authorities have gone to, local communities have gone to, to get that outbreak under control.#The most important thing for people to remember is that you have got to get schools back, we will get schools back, but also we have got to stick to our discipline # so in schools they have some very well thought through plans for how to manage it.#NHS staff should have regular tests for coronavirus, scientists say, after a new study highlighted the proportion of staff carrying the disease with no symptoms.The new study, published in the journal Anaesthesia, found that one in six maternity health workers have had Covid-.In total,  anaesthetists, midwives and obstetricians from University College London Hospital and St Georges Hospital, with no previously confirmed diagnosis of Covid-, were given antibody tests # which show whether or not a person has previously been infected.And one in three of these were completely asymptomatic # meaning they continued to go about their work as usual, potentially passing the virus on to mothers and their new babies.The authors wrote: #This has signicant implications for the risk of occupational transmission of SARS-CoV- for both staff and patients in maternity units.

Deaths and hospitalisations, thousands a day in April, are both down to double figures.⚠️ Read our coronavirus live blog for the latest news  updatesPositive cases have ticked up a little, but largely because more tests are done. The Office for National Statistics believes victims have in fact fallen sharply in a week, from one in , of us to one in ,.The tiny fraction unfortunate enough to need intensive care have a FAR greater chance of survival now than in April thanks to greater understanding of the disease.Even our overall Covid death toll is likely to be cut by thousands because of the absurd flaws in how Public Health England counted them.Regional flare-ups, based on handfuls of new cases, appear not to result in more deaths. No wonder some locals consider new lockdowns an over-reaction.And experts predict the economic hit may not be as bad as feared, assuming schools reopen fully next month and millions get back to work.From a poor start, things are looking up.THIS Government promised to take back control of our borders. When will it Yes, it has detailed plans to regulate the flow of legal EU and non-EU migrants once Brexit is complete. Quite right. But its record on tackling those landing illegally on our shores in ­soaring numbers is dismal.Not one of the , who have arrived since May has been ed to France. The French wave them off from Calais and our Border Force plucks them from British waters.We can hardly blame these unfortunate people for taking their chances when they know that our Government will look after them and that, despite its rhetoric, it lacks the will to deport them.There is nothing to deter them, then, except the Channel — and in this weather it’s a millpond anyway. Tasking the Navy with turning the boats back is vital. But it overlooks that thousands of migrants a year wouldn’t pay criminal traffickers for their passagesuccess wasn’t virtually certain. As long as we let them stay, more will keep attempting the crossing.IT’S more unusual nowadays, but for ­centuries Britain put celebrities through ­hideous ordeals locked in castles.Thomas More, Anne Boleyn, Guy Fawkes and a stellar cast from history lived out ancient versions of I’m A Celeb, Get Me Out Of Here in the Tower of London and where.

But also because he was only  years old and had been married to his beautul we Lissie for just a month.It was heartbreaking to see the photos of the pair overflowing with love and happiness at their wedding — while knowing his le had been needlessly ended.Our hearts went out to Lissie, who no doubt is still trying to make sense of the tragedy. So too his mother and father. For any parent, such a loss is unthinkable. Nobody should have to bury their child.It is against the natural order of things, especially when your beloved son or daughter has been murdered.That kind of pain will never go away. It becomes the defining moment of a parent’s le.Who would blame someone in that position for opting out of le ­altogether and sinking into inertia and depression  To me, that even seems the most likely response.Instead, his mum Debbie Adlam has hit the campaign trail, arguing for longer sentences for anyone who kills a policeman.PC Harper’s killers were convicted of manslaughter but cleared of ­murder.Henry Long, , who drove the getaway car, was jailed for  years. His accomplices Albert ­Bowers and Jessie Cole, both , were each given  years.Unduly lenient sentences, to my mind — and probably yours too.On Wednesday, Lissie began a campaign to bring in “Andrew’s Law”, in memory of her late husband. She wants anyone who kills a police officer, firefighter, nurse, doctor or paramedic to be jailed for le — meaning a minimum of  years.Mrs Adlam, who has been robbed of growing old happily with her beloved son in her le, has joined the campaign.“We got to the end of our trial and we didn’t feel like justice had been done,” she said. “We felt like we had been punched.“We didn’t walk away feeling that we had done Andrew proud.”That is the nub of the matter. She wants to do right by her late son. And I imagine she will not rest until she feels she has done that.It is only when tragedy strikes that many people realise how strong and determined they can be.Nothing can bring back PC Harper. ButAndrew’s Law comes to pass, acting as a deterrent to other criminals, at least one positive will have come from an otherwise senseless death.The need for justice is a stronger force than most of us can comprehend. I think of Stephen Lawrence’s mother Doreen, whose le changed overnight when her son was ­murdered in a racist attack in .She campaigned tirelessly for reforms to the police service and founded the Stephen Lawrence Charitable Trust.She forged positive change from the tragic murder of her son, ­showing the strength of her feeling and the scale of her loss.I think also of Michael and Sara Payne who also campaigned with great determination after the murder of their eight-year-old daughter Sarah.As a result, parents and ­carers can now formally ask the police for information about a person who has contact with a childthey fear that person poses a threat.Then there is the Jodie Chesney Foundation, set up by Peter Chesney to tackle kne crime after his daughter was murdered last year.When faced with unimaginable loss, some people respond by taking action to change things.They are gripped with the strength to move mountains — and get the law changed.We salute their courage and their determination to find light amid the terrible darkness of their loss.How sad it is seeing footage of Keeley Bunker dancing with her trusted friend Wesley Streete, who walked her home that evening . . . then went on to murder her.Keeley was a beautul young woman, just  when she died and with her whole le ahead of her.But her “friend” chose to end that le.It is tragic seeing any le wasted – and for what  Streete’s own gratication.Let us hope he is haunted by his actions and choices for the rest of his le.Wonderful news this week as the parents of poor Charlie Gard – who died of a rare genetic condition three years ago – gave birth to a healthy baby boy.As Connie Yates said: “The world feels a whole lot more beautul this morning”.I am so happy for them after the tragedy of losing Charlie, and what a beautul baby.Congratulations.WARNINGS this week that menopausal women could be unfairly denied entry to pubs and restaurantstheir hot flushes are confused in temperature checks for Covid symptoms.Take note: No one in their right mind should keep a menopausal woman from her chilled white wine . . .It feels a bit like a sword of Damocles is hanging over the nation at the moment, with yet more job cuts announced this week – at LGH Hotels, Pizza Express and Wetherspoons.Thousands more workers are living in fear of redundancy. It is a scary prospect. But don’t panic.The best defence is preparation. Find ways to be positive. That means not taking it personally.The ROLE is redundant, not you. So don’t view redundancy as a reflection of your ability or your worth.Know your rights and get the best settlement you can. A proper redundancy process comes with a consultation period, which will give you time to weigh up your options.My advice is to engage in that process. Ask for written clarication of any offer andyou are unhappy in any way, there are plenty of employment lawyers you can talk to. Or free help is available from Acas.Sort out your finances. Work out how much money you need for day-to-day living and,you can, keep some back for emergencies. Cut out spending on non-essentials and work out how to manage everything from mortgage payments to credit card debt.You might have to tighten your belt for a bit but that’s not the end of the word. For many people, redundancy is a chance to consider what they might do dferently.That is easier said than done but try to see it as an opportunity – to go freelance, start a business, become a consultant, get another job or re-enter education – rather than an ending.I love a romantic gesture as much as anyone.But the -year-old man who spelled out “Marry Me” using  tea lights made me wonderhe might have found another way.The candles set fire to the living room and seriously damaged the flat he shared with his girlfriend.But she still said yes!And at least she knows what she is getting herself into.It is always hard seeing photos of people enjoying a holiday in the sun when you are working.And this year, more than ever, I’ve been consumed with envy of the lucky souls who somehow got away despite all the travel restrictions.Having seen multiple beachtastic photos of Coleen and Wayne Rooney, who jetted off to the Caribbean what seems like weeks ago, is it wrong of me to admit I’ll be quite pleased when the holiday season is over We need a word for the irritated envy of others’ amazing holidays.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Labour councillors and MPs shake their heads about the dangers of opening while never reflecting on the risk of keeping schools closed.Even Labour’s new leader Sir Keir Starmer is worried about safety . . .  and his own children attended school during lockdown.The risks to children from Covid- are next to non-existent. Teachers are more likely to be hit by a bus than contract coronavirus from kids.Butthe risks of the schools opening in September are minimal, the cost of schools staying shut is beyond measure.Already, a generation of kids have seen their education become another victim of coronavirus.Some , of them could not sit their GCSEs in spring. And , could not sit their A levels.The years below them, due to sit those le-changing exams next spring, have lost six months of their education they will never recover.A report by the National Foundation for Educational Research said  per cent of state-school children had between none and one online lesson a day during the long months of lockdown.The most disadvantaged children have suffered the most.The schools are due to open in just  days and the vast majority of parents — almost  per cent — want them to start as planned.But even as Gavin Williamson was making his bold promise to throw open the school gates, Business ­Secretary Alok Sharma was mewing that school closures would be ­considered on a “case by case” basis, while Schools minister Nick Gibb bleats he can’t “decree” that every pupil will be back at their desk in September. These timid Tories must start showing some spine.With the schools closed, parents cannotto work. Already unemployment is soaring. Already there are hard times ahead.If parents and their children stay at home during the autumn months, this country will be on its knees for years.The A-level results will be announced this Thursday and the class of  will finally discover the damage that Covid- has done to their dreams.For the first time ever, A-level grades will be estimated, and there are countless families across the country holding their breath, me included.But for the millions of children meant to be in school, the future is even more uncertain.If their schools do not open in September it will be a craven act of surrender to extremist teaching unions.And a national tragedy that ­effectively chucks an entire generation on the scrapheap.IT is  years since Cameron Diaz made her movie debut opposite Jim Carrey in The Mask and six years since her last film.Cameron says retiring from the movies has brought her the peace she has always craved.And, of course, having an estimated £million in the bank usually has a calming effect.The thieving simpletons responsible for his death will all be free before they turn .The police get endless stick these days. But PC Andrew Harper was the best of us.Andrew had been married to his childhood sweetheart Lissie for just four weeks when he was dragged to his death after becoming entangled in a tow rope dangling from the back of a car being used to steal a quad bike.Driver Henry Long, , got  years. Albert Bowers and Jessie Cole, both , got  years. Not once have they shown even a flicker of remorse. But the law allows a third of a term off sentences for murder and manslaughter.Now Andrew’s widow Lissie has launched a campaign for “Andrew’s Law”, which will mean a full le term for killing  workers.“I wish to ensure any widows of the future will not have to experience the same miscarriage of justice,” says Lissie, . “I pledge to my late husband to never stop until I have made the dference this country needs.”I know that every reader of this paper will wish Lissie well.The sentences handed down to Long, Bowers and Cole might be what we would expect for manslaughter convictions.But God knows it does not feel very much like justice.“NO one here gets out alive,” sang The Doors’ Jim Morrison.Jim could have been thinking of Public Health England, the quango of clowns charged with protecting the nation’s health and wellbeing.PHE has developed a unique way of counting our corona- virus dead. If you catch Covid-, PHE claims you as a virus victim evenyou recover and die many months later of something .Who does their maths, Diane Abbott PHE’s madcap counting system means all , cases of coronavirus in England will eventually be added to the UK’s Covid- death toll – because we all have to go some time.PHE receives £million of your money a year to produce this garbage.The explosion has left more than  dead, , hurt and , homeless.Israa Seblani, , is the bride who was posing for wedding photos at the very moment the Lebanese capital was devastated by the huge blast.A doctor herself, Israa helped the wounded before seeking safety. A reminder that, even in the midst of tragedy, there is still kindness, decency and courage.CALAIS politician Pierre-Henri Dumont says: “Maybe we should do more” to stop migrants crossing the Channel. Love that “maybe”, monsieur!Priti Patel threatens to send in the Royal Navy but that shouldn’t be necessary.

Court documents claim they also gave themselves the same nicknames used by Harris and Klebold - and sent each other pictures of the two killers.It is alleged they planned to carry out the bloodbath when schools ed next month as most classes have been closed since March.Detectives reportedly viewed Schultz and Robins Facebook profiles and obtained search warrants to view their private conversations.Police are said to have discovered multiple messages planning out massacres at Rochester High School and Caston High School in Rochester, Indiana. Robin allegedly said he wanted everyone there dead, according to a probable cause affidavit. He allegedly wrote he would kill a security guard before roaming the halls killing people before heading into classrooms.Robin allegedly even estimated how long it would take a SWAT team to arrive at each Rochester and Caston schools. Police claim Robin revealed he had an itch to shoot up a school, claiming he had once sat outside Rochester Middle School for  minutes with an AR when he was in eighth grade.He wrote that he planned to kill  or more people, with  magazines packed in a duffel bag, and then himself before reportedly deciding it was too risky.Meanwhile, it is alleged Schultz wrote to one unnamed friend that “we are gonna do it i wanna shoot up a school with him”.He added: “I want him to stay out of trouble till we can shoot up the place.Police allegedly found a June  conversation revealed more details about the plan - including a potential suicide pact.Robin is reported to have said im killing myself after I kill a bunch of people and but im killing myself after I kill a bunch of people.Allegedly, Schultz said: I does exist donny just like no matter what im doin the same for u bc u guys are my family we had bad childhoods and we will always stick together u guys fr mean everything to me.In another conversation on Facebook, Robin is alleged to have said he had a gun locked in my dads safe and later discussed shooting up an airport, festivals or Black churches.Police also alleged Schultz had multiple conversations on Facebook about either trying to buy illegal narcotics or others asking for his help selling illegal narcotics.Robin also alleged had a friend buy him a hat for the band KMFDM , whose lyrics were posted by Harris before the Columbine massacre.

And were not going to take it lightly.Marrs added more information about the case would be released in the coming weeks.Charges of  conspiracy to commit murder and intimidation were filed against the pair on July .Schultz is being held at the Fulton County Jail and Robin, still a minor, is being held in a juvenile detention center but will be transferred when he turns  later this month.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Hassan also added that Prime Minister Hassan Diab will head to the presidential palace to hand over the resignation in the name of all the ministers.Speaking to reporters, Hassan said: The whole government resignedPresident Michel Aoun accepted Diabs resignation and asked the government to stay on in a caretaker capacity until a new cabinet was formed.Rage had been mounting as rioting swept the streets of Beirut following the blast last week that injured , and left at least , people homeless.The horric explosion was one fth the size of the nuclear bomb dropped on Hiroshima.It emerged that numerous officials - including Lebanese president Michael Aoun - knew about the stash of , tonnes of ammonium nitrate in Beirut which caused the disaster. Warnings had been issued years before as the killer cargo was seized from a ship owned by a Russian businessman who had gone bankrupt.Several ministers had already stepped down amid murmurings that the government was on the brink of collapse.The cabinet, formed in January with the backing of the powerful Iranian-backed Hezbollah group and its allies, met today after a slew of resignations.Justice minister Marie-Claude Najms, information minister Manal Abdel-Samad,finance minister Ghazi Wazni, defence minister and deputy PM Zeina Akar, and environment minister Damianos Kattar all resigned in quick succession.Kattar blasted the system as flaccid and sterile, while Abdel-Samad said the government had let the people down.Meanwhile, Lebanese MPs Paula Yacoubian and Samy Gemayel resigned, with the latter confirming two other colleagues from his Kataeb party had also quit.Yacoubian had called for the entire Lebanese government to resign - and said it was her duty to step down over the failures that led to the explosionThe apparant collapse of the government came as prosecutor Ghassan El Khoury began to question the heads of government agencies over the explsion.Lebanese people had been calling for the entire regime to go following the disaster which came after the months of anti-government protests.Joe Haddad, an engineer, told Reuters: The entire regime needs to change. It will make no dferencethere is a new government. We need quick elections.Food shortages and unrest are mounting in the city as the disaster compounded anger stemming from a severe economic crisis and the coronavirus pandemic.Eli Abi Hanna, whose home was destroyed, said: It was easier to make money during the civil war. The politicians and the economic disaster have ruined everything.And meanwhile, Prime Minister Diab said on Saturday he would request early parliamentary elections.It wont work, its just the same people. Its a mafia, said Antoinette Baaklini, whose workplace was demolished in the explosion.University student Marilyne Kassis added: It will always be the same. It is just a political game, nothing will change.The killer cargo of , tons of ammonium nitrate was confiscated in  from the Moldovan-flagged ship Rhosus while en route from Batumi in the ex-Soviet republic of Georgia to MozambiqueThe ammonium nitrate was sold by Georgian fertiliser maker Rustavi Azot LLC, and was to be delivered to a Mozambique explosives maker, Fabrica de Explosivos.It was however impounded by Lebanese authorities, and sat on the dockside in Warehouse  for six years until it blew up last Tuesday.Reportedly the blast was sparked when a reckless welder caused a fire at nearby Warehouse  - which then spread to the explosive Warehouse .Hang up the nooses trended across Lebanese social media as grief turned to fury in the days following the explosion.Sources close to the investigation blamed the incident on inaction and negligence, saying nothing was done by committees and judges involved in removing the explosives.Public Works Minister Michel Najjar told Al Jazeera he had only found out about the presence of the explosive material stashed at the port  days before the explosion.No minister knows whats in the hangars or containers, and its not my job to know, he said.Badri Daher, Director General of Lebanese Customs, told broadcaster LBCI that customs had sent six documents to the judiciary warning that the material posed a danger.He said: We requested that it be re-exported but that did not happen. We leave it to the experts and those concerned to determine why.Another source close to a port employee said a team that inspected the ammonium nitrate six months ago warned thatit was not moved it would blow up all of Beirut.Two documents revealed that Lebanese Customs had asked the judiciary in  and  to ask the concerned maritime agency to re-export or approve the sale of the ammonium nitrate.One of the documents cited similar requests in  and  - suggesting repeated warnings about the danger were overlooked by the authorities.It is a white crystalline solid and is highly soluble in water - with the chemical formula NH₄NO₃.The chemical is applied in granule form into the soil and quickly dissolves under moisture, allowing nitrogen to be released.Another use of ammonium nitrate is in the food industry where it is used as a nutrient in producing antibiotics and yeast.In most countries, it is used to make explosives for mining, quarrying and civil construction because of its low cost and ready availability.It has been the cause of numerous industrial explosions over the last three decades, including the explosion at a chemical plant in Toulouse, France, in  that killed  people.Ammonium nitrate was also used to create the explosives used in the  Mumbai train bombings.By itself, ammonium nitrate is not regarded as dangerous but under certain conditions, it can become deadly.The chemical is classied as an “energetic material” meaning that it produces heat as it decomposes.If there is a signicant amount of ammonium nitrate it can generate enough heat to catch fire and continue to burn eventually causing an explosion. Prime Minister Diab had vowed those responsible will pay the price - but the focus of the probe and public anger has turned on the regime.International aid is being mobilised across the world to help support the victims and search for the dead among the rubble.The US, UK, France, Gulf states and even rivals Israel have offered money and assistance - but Canada has refused to give cash directly to the Lebanese government due to fears of corruption.Royal Navy vessel HMS Enterprise has arrived to carry out survey work in the port to establish the extent of the damage.British engineering experts have found the blast was unquestionably one of the largest non-nuclear explosions ever to take place.The team from the University of Sheffield has calculated the strength of the blast based on the videos and photographs of the catastrophe.They believe the explosion was the equivalent of , to , tonnes of TNT.Protests mount as , people gathered at Martyrs Square and some demonstrators stormed government ministries and the Association of Lebanese Banks over the weekend.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Max Lapre, renowned for his strict leadership of the Dutch government, ordered five elite tribesmen to be gunned down.Its claimed that the tribe wanted to seek vengeance on a white man. Rockefeller reportedly swam  miles to shore and after washing up on the beach, he was speared through the ribs.He was then smacked around the back of his head until he was dead - and the tribe began their ritual. The tribe first removed Michaels head, then slit him down from the neck to his back. His intestines were then removed. Legs and arms would go into the fire while the group chanted. His charred body parts would be passed around for everyone to taste.His blood, which they saved, would be smeared over their bodies. Once the head was fully cooked, they would scalp it, remove his brain and eat it.If theyd killed Michael that was how it wouldve been done, the author said.The Dani tribe sometimes transformed decapitated skulls into pillows or used them as bowls to eat the flesh of rival tribe members.Headhunting stopped in the s. Within the tribe, men reportedly had sex with men, they shared wives, and practised polygamy. They sometimes drank each others urine and covered themselves in human blood during bonding rituals.In their eyes, killing the American was revenge for the deaths of tribesman at the hands of the white Dutch. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

This exhaustive list includes assurances that schools will take specic measures to stop children drinking hand sanitiser, extra support for the wellbeing of staff suffering from workload worries, anxiety or the effects of trauma and insisting classes be held “one week on, one week off”.Union members have been urged to present this checklist to headteachers and to expect its completion.It is not helpful. Unions should be working with schools to ensure there is a safe , not creating ision — which is what this will do. If we keep looking at checklists of things that need to be ticked off, we will never get schools reopened.It will never be perfect for everyone. Nothing is. There are always dfering opinions.When askedthe checklist raised the bar too high, NEU president Amanda Martin responded: “This is people’s safety. What cost is safety ”Of course safety is important. But unions should be pulling together and supporting schools, rather than making it very dficult for them to come back.Before my school reopened, I was stunned to hear some unions were encouraging teachers not to engage in conversation with head-teachers. How is that helpful to anyone We have a responsibility to children to be back. If we don’t come back now, when We can’t keep putting it off. We must come back at some point and September is as good a time as any.It is about common sense and making sure the school community is as safe as it can be. Get the basics done from the off and tweak it as we go. That is how it should work.And I know — because I made it work.When we reopened our school in June we followed the guidance the Government set out to the letter.We didn’t have any cases of staff or students falling ill with the virus.We installed a marquee in our playing field to create extra space, as well as supplying portaloos and mobile handwashing facilities to keep pupils and staff safe.Classes were kept apart with inidual entrances and exits. Yes, we are a smaller school with fewer children.But I have fewer staff and less space to play with.As a community, the school came together, did the right thing and got the children back. That’s what it is about: Working with your community — the pupils, parents and staff.Inevitably, there was going to be some sort of drop in pupils’ learning. But children are really resilient. We saw that when they came back.They were straight back into six-hour days, with a full timetable of learning.They dealt with it really well. Actually, they loved coming back to the stability and routine of what they knew.As much as you try to put in a timetable at home, you don’t follow it because the environment is very dferent.I have two children myself and know how hard it was during that time . . . and I’m a teacher.My we and I were both working full-time from home. To get my six-year-old to do more than an hour’s work was incredibly dficult.You don’t get the same experience sitting in front of a screen watching a teacher online as you do being in a classroom interacting with other people.I strongly feel schools have a responsibility to give parents the opportunity to get back into some sort of normality with work.Because we brought all our children back, parents were able to work better from home and do the things they needed to do.We had a number of parents who were made redundant during lockdown.With not having the children at home, they had the chance to look for other work. Meanwhile, their kids were safe.Just this week, Professor Russell Viner, president of the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health, said the “very low” risk to children from Covid- meant the reopening of schools is safe.Research carried out in  institutions across the UK will confirm “there is very little evidence” of coronavirus transmission where pupils have ed.I hope this will help reassure parents, as the negative impact of keeping children away from classrooms runs deeper than their education.The effect on the mental health of our nation’s youngsters could be catastrophic. The social impact of schools is vital.We were back for a month before the summer holidays and that was one of the overriding factors parents talked about. Lots of children were sad, very quiet and not their normal selves during lockdown.But coming back to school really changed them. That was evident from day one.Parents had been concerned about their children’s mental health and could see how happy they were to be back at school, where they were able to interact with their friends and peers and reignite those friendships.It was wonderful to hear children laughing and enjoy- ing each other’s company.That is something you can’t get in lockdown — the social aspect of school le.Schools are at the heart of most communities.Andschools can get back safely, the rest of the community will hopefully follow back into some normality.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

That is why I am urging universities to be as flexible as possible in their admissions and to hold places for those whose grades are being appealed.“Our ambition for students this year is no dferent to any other year and it is in everybody’s interest to see them progress.” But Education Secretary Gavin Williamson said he was confident the exams moderator Ofqual was grading fairly.He said: “Im confident the system Ofqual has put in place is fundamentall a fair one, that will award the vast majority of students a calculated grade that genuinely reflects the grade they would have achieved.“Provisional data published by Ofqual suggests that the number of As and A*s being awarded will increase compared to last year and moderation has ensured students from all backgrounds have been treated fairly.“We know that, without exams, even the best system is not perfect. That is why I welcome the fact that Ofqual has introduced a robust appeal system, so every single student can be treated fairly - and today we are asking universities to do their part to ensure every young person can progress to the destination they deserve. It comes as a study by UCL claims that predicting A-Level grades is a “near-impossible task” and needs an overhaul.In a study by academics from UCL Centre for Education Policy  Equalising Opportunitiesand Oxford Brookes Business School studied data from , pupils’ GCSE performance to see whether they could accurately predict their subsequent A-level results.They found that even by removing any opportunity for bias – and running additional checks on pupils’ gender, ethnicity and socioeconomic status – they could only predict one in four pupils’ best three A-levels correctly.The paper also shows that high-achieving comprehensive school pupils are more likely to be under-predicted compared to their grammar and private school counterparts.Among high achievers, where under-prediction is most common, the team found  per cent of comprehensive school pupils were under-predicted by two or more grades compared to just  per cent of grammar and private school pupils.Professor Lindsey Macmillan , said: “This research raises the question of why we use predicted grades at such a crucial part of our education system.“This isn’t teachers’ fault – it’s a near-impossible task. Most worryingly there are implications for equity, as pupils in comprehensives are harder to predict.”GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

How does that make sense  Tell that to any mother in the world.Meghan’s decision caused uproar with those who believed that as the taxpayers part-fund the monarchy, they have a right to see Archie on his christening day, according to the book.Finding Freedom claims revealed today include:The christenings of most other royal children including the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge’s three children were attended by media and widely publicised.Instead Meghan and Harry released just two pictures of baby Archie after the christening – a family portrait and an intimate black and white picture of the three of them.The book goes on to describe how the couple made a similar decision when they decided to keep the  members of the press covering their African tour away when Archie was taken to meet Archbishop Desmond Tutu, instead taking their own pictures.Details of Meghan’s own baptism ahead of her wedding to Harry – and her strong faith – are also revealed in the book.Although she was not brought up religious, friends claim that Meghan has always had a strong belief in God, which helped her get through her “darkest moments”.Meghan used to pray with one of her best friends at Northwestern University and used to gather the cast and crew of Suits together for a “prayer circle” before starting work.She decided to get baptised into the Church of England “out of respect to the Queen”, according to the book and the ceremony was held at St James’s Palace’s Chapel Royal.While the Queen, William and Kate did not attend the ceremony, there were  guests – including Charles and Camilla – present to watch Meghan have holy water poured on her head as a choir performed.Guests then celebrated at a dinner party at Clarence House, hosted by Prince Charles.Meghan had to have several meetings with the Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby ahead of the baptism, where she discussed “personal matters” including her orce to Trevor Engelson and what she had learned from that failed marriage.The book also gives a glimpse into baby Archie’s first year of le in which “hands-on” dad Harry was in charge of “changing most of Archie’s diapers” to give Meghan, who was nursing the baby, a break.Harry liked that to be “his ‘job’ especially as Meghan has so much more to do”.Little Archie also enjoyed baby swimming lessons and music classes.Meghan brought him by herself to the Happy Clappy music class in Windsor, where he played with a tambourine while royal protection officers waited outside, the book said.He also loved being read to by his parents and his favorite book was Is Your Mama a Llama by Deborah Guarino.During the couple’s Africa tour, little Archie learned to mimic the sounds of the animals outside during a stay at the high commissioner’s residence in Cape Town.Once they left the UK following “Megxit” and moved to the Mille Fleurs estate in Victoria, Canada, worried Meghan and Harry baby-proofed the mansion to protect the tot, who was described as growing “at the speed of light”.As well as covering sharp edges with “discreet rubber pads” and moving furniture out of the way they also tried to “paparazzi-proof” the property by installing extra fencing.They proudly boasted to friends how Archie – who they nicknamed Bubba – was in the th percentile for his height, according to the book authors.It has been previously reported how the book told how Prince Harry was “delightfully surprised” when he took Meghan on a camping trip and she took bathroom breaks in the woods.Meghan, , and Harry, , have insisted they had nothing to do with the book, while the authors have said they did not speak to them directly.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Mr Argar told BBC Breakfast:is not something thats a prospect at this point.The Department for Education has been very clear that that poses a challenge to the ability to teach and the ability to learn in a certain context. The health minister said the measures already in schools - including keeping each class as a bubble that has to social distance from other bubbles - was more than enough to keep kids and staff safe. He said: We are essentially setting up dferent class groups or year groups as social bubbles.Were there to be a case and schools are a low risk environment then we could implement a version of the local lockdownthe testing, the tracing, for those classes to contain any such outbreak. He added: At the moment we believe the measures that have been put in place in terms of social distancing around those bubbles and around the facilities are the right ones. Boris Johnson said this lunchtime during a visit to a hospital that he thought schools and teachers have done a fantastic job or getting ready for the new term. He told Sky News: I have no doubt that it can be done, it can be done safely. schools are doing a huge amount to make sure it can be done safely.Just for the sake of social justice, for ensuring that all kids get the education they need, we need, to get our pupils back to school in September.But Mr Argar saidthere was strong scientic evidence suggesting wearing masks would keep any fresh outbreaks in schools at bay they would consider introducing them. The Government has stressed that all schools in England will open for all pupils on September . The PMs official spokesman tried to allay fears schools could close againareas were thrown into local lockdowns. He said yesterday Schools would be the absolute last sector to close in any local lockdown.Other venues would be expected to be closed first in the event that strict lockdown measures would have to be applied.It is a national priority to get schools open and keep schools open.He said a detailed and robust plan had been developed in the event of pupils coming down with the virus, adding: Local directors of public health would agree appropriate measures with the schools – for instance, the bubble which the infected child was in not attending school for  days.Test kits will be available for schools to help them quickly get a child or member of staff testedthey need to.Mr Argar assured worried parents that it was safe to send their kids back to schools after a study suggested teenager could spread coronavirus just as easily as adults. Last night The Times reported the fresh study from PHE is expected to say that older, secondary school pupils can transmit it just like adults do.Kids under  already are not required to wear masks in areas where adults are expected to wear them - such as public transport. He said: That isnt complete research, that work is still underway and I dont want to prejudge what that will and wont say.Multiple international studies from France, Australia and Denmark have shown children are much less likely to become infected and pass it on to other people, Mr Argar said. He said: One study does not a consensus make. Parents can have confidence that their children can go back to school. Kids in Scotland were the first children in the UK to head back to full classrooms since March today, with all schools in Scotland set to be reopened by August . Social distancing measures have been put in place - including staggered lunch breaks and extra time for hand washing between lessons. Boris Johnson visited a school yesterday as teachers prepare for kids to come back to classrooms. He said it was the nations moral duty to ensure children can restart face-to-face learning again. The PM added: “Its not right that kids should spend more time out of school, its much much better for their health and mental wellbeing, obviously their educational prospects,everybody comes back to school full-time in September.  To receive The Sun’s Coronavirus newsletterevery tea time, sign up here.To follow us on Facebook, simply ‘Like’ our Coronavirus page.Get Britain’s best-selling newspaper delivered to your smartphone or tablet each day – find out more.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Princess Michael sparked fury by wearing the “racist” symbol to the Queen’s annual festive lunch in , where she met Meghan for the first time. The royal, who is married to the Queen’s cousin Prince Michael, was forced to apologise and was said to be “distressed that it had caused offence”. Finding Freedom, out today, claims Meghan wonderedthe brooch, of black man wearing a gold turban, was “sending a message”. Co-authors Omid Scobie and Carolyn Durand claim Princess Michael’s choice of brooch was “at the bare minimum” an “insensitivity to Meghan’s African American roots and the racism she had encountered since pairing up with Harry. The authors write: “When it comes to royal fashion, much thought goes into every detail.“Princess Michael’s choice of brooch could have simply been a mistake, but in the back of Meghan’s mind, she wonderedthere wasn’t a message being sent in the pin of the torso of an African man wearing a gold turban and ornate clothing.”Finding Freedom claims revealed today include:Blackamoor is a style of artwork dating back to the s, usually found in sculpture, jewellery and textiles.Black men and women are often depicted as slaves and blackamoor is now considered to have racist connotations. Scobie and Durand say Meghan felt Prince Michaels apology for wearing the symbol came too late as “the damage had been done”. The authors write: “Regardless, the damage had been done, particularly since the Queen’s purpose had been to make Meghan, who had just moved to England, feel at home for the holidays.”Blackamoor jewellery and art dates back to the s and was highly prized by collectors. It is now considered to be racially insensitive and even the name has been slammed as a term of abuse for anyone with dark skin.The figures - usually men but sometimes women - are shown fixed in positions of servitude, such as footmen or waiters, or persony fantasies of racial conquest.Some argue that many European ornaments often depict black people as exotic noblemen and women.The figures are usually painted with gold leaf in a highly decorative style and can be worth signicant sums of money. It was not the first time Princess Michael  - dubbed Princess Pushy - had been embroiled in a race storm.In , she was accused of insulting black party guests at a New York restaurant by allegedly telling them to “go back to the colonies” in a row over noise.She strongly denied the claims and said she had said she would be “ready to go back to the colonies” during the dispute with the table.The royal also later referred to African people as “adorable” in a TV interview discussing her travels through the country. Finding Freedom sheds new light on the intimate details of Meghan and Harry’s relationship and their departure from royal le.

But children over  years old pass on the virus more effectively as their bodies start to act like small adults, one researcher told The Times. The new details will cast fresh doubt on plans to get all pupils back in Englandaposs schools from September. And they are humiliating for Tory ministers - who just hours ago were trumpeting how the study would show schools are safe. Ministers have now mounted a frantic U-turn, insisting the study is unfinished and no one has seen the results, despite a Cabinet minister boasting about it on Sunday. Details of the study of  schools were first leaked to the Sunday Times, which reported the risk to and from primary school pupils was low. Education Secretary Gavin Williamson then took the rare step of issuing a statement about the study - despite the fact itaposs not been released yet. He claimed: The latest research which is expected to be published later this year - one of the largest studies on the coronavirus in schools in the world - makes it clear there is little evidence that the virus is transmitted at school. Boris Johnsonaposs official spokesman said the study was expected ahead of September - likely in the next week. But that approach appears to have angered some researchers who spoke to the Times, saying there was more to the study than meets the eye.  A source told the newspaper: “Secondary children are most likely to get infected, have silent infection, transmit infection and get sicker. There’s a genuine concern that secondary school children are not the same as primary school children. Once community control of Covid- is lost then outbreaks are seen in secondary schools. Health minister Edward Argar today U-turned on Gavin Williamsonaposs claims and said people should not be pre-empting what the study would say. He told Sky News: It’s still a work in progress. I haven’t seen the final results and I don’t think anyone  has. So I think we should be cautious about reading too much into that work in progress. It’s important work, but it isn’t complete yet.

The book, which hit the shelves today, is set to cause upset behind palace walls as it details the Sussexaposs struggles and frustrations. These include:Harry believed Williamaposs staff were throwing him under the bus to make the older Duke look good Meghan and Harry were forced to sack Archieaposs first nanny due to an incident during the night The Queen was very fond of Meghan and gave her a royal masterclass. She also reportedly said she was very clever and good at understanding whataposs required Meghan cried before final royal engagement as she said goodbye to staff who had become like family and told staff I canapost believe this Meghan was bundled into back of car during intense and scary SAS training after receiving a large number of threats Hackers stole hundreds of Meghan and Harryaposs wedding photos, including snaps of the QueenMeghan and Harry claim to have had no involvement in the book, with their team releasing a statement denying they were interviewed for it ahead of the publication. However, itaposs packed with a huge amount of details of their private lives and behind-the-scene information, resulting in many questions from royal experts. Weaposve looked at some of the most explosive claims. Harry thought Williamaposs staff were aposthrowing him under the busapos Omid and Durand confirm months of speculation about a rt between Prince Charles and Dianaaposs sons. As well as detailing the fact that Harry believed William was being snobbish, and was angry when his brother kept referring to Meghan as this girl, there were more general concerns about staff.  A source told the book: Harry was upset that it was playing out so publicly and that so much of the information being reported was wrong. There had been moments where he felt people working with his brother had put things out to make William look good, evenit meant throwing Harry under the bus. It was a confusing time, and his head was all over the place - he didnapost know who or what to believe, and he and William werenapost talking enough either, which made everything a lot worse. Meghanaposs tears before final engagement as emotions aposfinally set inapos The Sussexes said their goodbyes to royal le at the Commonwealth Day Service at Westminster, when they joined the Queen, Prince Charles, Camilla, Kate, William and other senior members of the firm for the annual celebration. While the couple looked happy and relaxed as they took their seats, Scobie and Durand claim it was a very dferent story just moments before when emotions final set in. They write: Harry quietly slipped through the door of the  Room to say hello, and the reality - and the emotions - finally set in. Meghan turned around to hug goodbye the last remaining people in the room, including an author of this book. With the state room almost empty except for a few familiar faces, the tears the duchess has been holding back were free to flow. She embraced some of the dedicated team members whose tireless efforts - to promote the coupleaposs work, launch landmark projects, and deal with the near-daily crisis brought on by the tabloids - had come to an abrupt end. aposI canapost believe thisapos, she said, hugging one of the young female aides she had become close with. Though Team Sussex was a much smaller operation than the more sophisticated offices at Clarence House and Kensington Palace, in the short space of a year since setting up, they had become like family. Meghan then went to change into the stunning green outfit she chose for the historical event, joking with staff that it was her last hat for a while. Meghan underwent SAS training, which she found aposintense and scaryapos After their relationship was made public, Meghan received a a large number of threats, the book claims.She was therefore given two days of SAS training, which she found intense and scary. Scobie and Durand write: The training - which all senior member of the royal family except the Queen have completed at SAS headquarters in Hereford - is preparation for all high-risk security scenarios including kidnapping, hostage situations and terrorist attacks. The authors describe how the duchess was bundled into the back of a car by a terrorist and driven to a location before she was saved by officers. As well as this, Meghan also had training to prepare for a new le as a royal - just like the Duchess of Cambridge. The book claims: Set to undergo the same informal training Kate had embarked upon following her engagement to William - a series of instructions that covered everything from how to most gracefully exit your chauffeured sedan while wearing a pencil skirt to when to courtesy to members of the family several rungs up the hierarchy from you - Meghan was connected to a team of experts. Meghan and Harry were forced to sack Archieaposs nanny after aposirresponsible behaviourapos Despite initially not wanting a nanny, the couple started looking for a night nurse to help them sort out Archieaposs sleeping routine. However things didnapost go well and they were force to let the woman go in the middle of her second night working from them. The book states: They decided to hire a night nurse to establish a sleep schedule and be an extra pair of helping hands. But their time with the couple brief. Meghan and Harry were forced to let the nurse go in the middle of her second night for being unprofessional and irresponsible. Despite the bad experience, Meghan and Harry decided to try another nanny, however the first experience had left them too nervous. The book continues: Neither found themselves comfortable sleeping through the night without going to check on Archie regularly. So after a few weeks they decided to let her go and take on the nighttime duties themselves, instead employing a nanny to help them in the day. Envelope containing racist musings and unidentied white powder sent to palace During her time in the royal family Meghan was subjected to a number of racist threats, including a terrying incident where a letter filled with white power was sent to Kensington Palace, the book claims.  The authors write: Kensington Palace security specialists intercepted a letter addressed to the couple. While on the outset it seemed to be much like any other piece of mail received by the busy mail room based at Clarence House, this one was filled with racist musings and an unidentied white powder. The material, feared to be anthrax, turned out to be harmless. At least physically. The night of the incident, though, Meghan barely slept, later admitting to a friend that she worried the incident was her aposnew normalapos. A good friend of Meghanaposs called her Grace Under Fire, because despite whatever pressure she was under, she didnapost fall apart. Russian hackers stole hundreds of the couples personal photos, including wedding pictures The book also claims that a computer programmer in Russia managed to get their hands on hundreds of Meghan and Harryaposs engagement and wedding photos.  The authors write: Among the stolen images were pictures of the couple sharing personal moments during their engagement photo series as well as others from their wedding day reception . The large set also included outtakes with eyes half closed and other unflattering moments meant for the trash can. The book claims that the hacker published the photos online, but many fans just believed they were fakes. As well as causing upset, the data breach also made they extremely concerned about security. The authors write: Harry and Meghan were aposalarmed to hear that it was so easy to get such personal files of theirs. The Queen was very fond of Meghan There have been many reports in the months since Meghan and Harry quit about the Queenaposs upset and disappointment at their decision. However the new book also details how the Monarch felt about Meghan prior to that, during her early days in the royal family.  The two royal women undertook their first joint engagement - a day in Chester in June , just a few weeks after the royal wedding - which was a huge success.Despite a few hiccups which proved Meghan was understandably still learning the ropes, including a slightly awkward moment when the Duchess asked who should get in the car first - they were seen laughing and chatting and seemed to thoroughly enjoy each otheraposs company.Scobie and Durand write: The Queen had a level of confidence in Meghan, because as a Palace source shared, aposshe handles these situations flawlessly because sheaposs always well prepared and respectful. Sheaposs very clever and good at understanding whataposs requiredapos. The source continues: The Queen was wonderful, warm, and generous toward the new Duchess. She made sure Meghan knew what was going on and made her feel very much at home because it was her first trip. Scobie and Durand also note that the Queen gave Meghan a beautul pair of earrings, featuring pearls and diamonds, to mark the special day.  They write: Meghan, an avid learner studying all she could on royal protocol, was often seen carrying binders full of research so she didnapost put a foot wrong. She took her new role incredibly seriously. That day was dferent, though she was getting a royal master class in training from the Queen herself. Harry was apospleasantly surprisedapos when Meghan peed in a bush In the early days of their relationship Meghan and Harry travelled to Botswana for a romantic getaway. Despite making a luxury lodge their main base, they spent five days of the trip alone in the wilderness. It was during this time that Harry realised just down-to-earth Meghan was, and was delightfully surprise by how she was roughing it. The Duchess reportedly packed very little clothing and cleaned her face with baby wipes and happily wandered into the woodlandsshe needed a bathroom break. A friend of the couple told the authors: The fact that theyaposre both as happy just throwing on a backpack and going out to eplore...I honestly think these experiences will never stop for them. Meghan Markle was convinced Princess Michael of Kent apossent hurtful messageapos with brooch Princess Michael of Kent was widely criticised for wearing a brooch many believe is racially and culturally offensive for a Christmas event, and the book claims Meghan was convinced she was sending her a message. Meghan was invited to spend Christmas with the royals in Sandringham in , breaking tradition as she wasnapost yet officially in the family, and joined them for a church service at St Mary Magdalene.  However Scobie and Durand claim the celebrations were overshadowed by Princess Michaelaposs blackamoor brooch. Blackamoor is a style of Italian decorative art dating back to the end of the Middle ages and typically displays images of African men wearing head coverings and rick jewels to contrast with their skin colour.

Leicester was the first city to have some of its newly-found freedoms reversed when the coronavirus infection rate there became too high. In the subsequent weeks towns and cities across the UK have been locked down to dferent degrees and to much less fanfare. This has left many Brits unsure exactly what it is they should and shouldnapost be doing.To clear up the confusion Lockdown Checker has launched an easy to use website which allows users to type in their postcode and find out the local rules.For example, a person typing in a postcode for Na h-Eileanan Siar in Scotland - which has the lowest case rate at . per , - will conjure up very dferent results from a Leicester local - where the rate currently stands at almost . per , people. In Na h-Eileanan Siar in the Outer Hebrides only national lockdown rules apply. That means locals can visit non-essential shops and meet another household indoors. They may also dine in restaurants and banish the brisk Scottish air with a dram in the pub. Those in Leicester are not so lucky. Lockdown Checker records that the city is an aposarea of interventionapos, meaning the government is treating it as a special case.  While those in Leicester may visit non-essential shops, they are not permitted to meet indoors with another household. In the coming weeks the developers of the site hope to add the number of coronavirus cases per , population to the widget. It was reported earlier today that Oldham recorded  new cases of Covid- in the last seven days to August , official government figures show. This means that there are  new cases per , people in the local area - the highest current rate in England, and above previous hotspots Leicester and Blackburn with Darwen.

Their lives, quite literally, depend on it. Here in the UK, black and mixed-race parents have been having a very dferent but equally necessary chat for years – on how their skin colour will affect their lives. No white parent will ever have to go through such a rite of passage with their kids – which probably explains the failure in certain quarters to appreciate the frustration at the Labour MP Dawn Butler being stopped by police over the weekend. Or the indference at the BBC over the ’N’ word row. Channel ’s excellent show, also called The Talk, brought the brutal truth into our living rooms last week. Little Mix singer Leigh-Anne Pinnock spoke of being told “your race will hold you back a bit”. Unfair This Morning presenter Rochelle Humes wept as she recalled the racist abuse she’d suffered when having the talk with her daughter. “My legs were red,” she said. “Because I tried to rub my skin off.” Sky News presenter Gillian Joseph said: “You do have to rob your children of their innocence at quite an early age.”As parents we are indeed having to move quickly to manage our kids’ expectations of a brutal, unfair world and the unconscious bias that comeswith being black or mixed-race.We have no choice but to prime them with history. And arm them with examples of the fact that we exist in a society within which you are more likely to be vilied for reporting, calling out or standing up to discrimination than the actual perpetrator. The social media abuse aimed at Ms Butler for revealing she’d been stopped by police for no discernible reason other than being in ‘a nice car’, is one such example. “Don’t get me started on ‘you match the description’,” said Britain’s Got Talent winner Ashley Banjo on The Talk. If you are black or mixed race, you just know. It’s a fair bet thatMs Butler had not identied herself she’d have been handcuffed and patronised before her feet could touch the ground – just as the Olympic athletes Ricardo dos Santos and Bianca Williams were last month. Many of Ms Butler’s white critics claim to have no problem being stopped by police. The dference is, few of them share the mistrust of the police which black people have – based on an apprehension they could be at best humiliated in public, and at worst mistreated.

Kim Farry, , went to prison for theft and subsequently was branded the country’s ‘shoplting queen’. Since coronavirus lockdown though, the gran-of- has been “changing lives” by leading virtual fitness classes, helping people lose weight and fight addiction. She has previously been turned down for work as an escort because of her criminal record. She hopes the work will “finally give her a break in le” as she’s become “heartbroken” at desperately trying to change her image. And though Kim, a former cleaner, admitted she loved the money she made as a career criminal, she’s vowed she’ll neverto her law-breaking ways. Speaking from her council house in Fulham, southwest London, Kim today told : “I look back and the money every day was good but I definitely won’t be doing all that again. I did it to support my family. It became my job I classed it as my business. “Now I don’t want to sponge of benefits too. I don’t want to live in the council flat. So now I’m changing lives and I’m determined to finally get my break in le. People tell me they are inspired by my journey so I enjoy helping others.  “I lead the fitness classes, I help people change their diets, lose weight and change a few things about their attitude sometime. “I use YouTube and Facebook videos and have  people who watch my videos regularly. I have had people talk to me in tears as they’re so pleased. I think that is so nice. These are strangers.” Kim started the venture after she couldn’t afford huge prices for gym membership before they closed for lockdown. And, after admiring the work of Joe Wicks online, Kim thought she’d have a go.  The mum added: “Gyms are expensive. I do everything for free. I’m self-taught and enjoy it. It became more and more popular and I think it shows I’m trying to show I’m a good person. “At the end of the day, I was a shoplter, not a paedophile or anything.” Kim, who says she started stealing  food and clothes aged just nine to help support her parents and eight younger siblings, considers shoplting an aposaddictionapos. She went on to steal  larger household goods, including ovens, chests of drawers and other furniture from well-known retailers across London.  The former criminal took clothes and designer bags as her obsession grew over the decades. She said: “It is an addiction. I was addicted, just like people can be addicted to drugs or food. I overcame it and so, since the fitness classes, I’ve also helped people cope with addictions, which can be bad in times like lockdown. “These people are inspired by my journey. It’s strangers again who are addicted to anything, whether that be drugs, food or drink or whatever and I just help them.

Speaking on January th of this year while attending a dinner for his Sentebale charity, Harry spoke about his sadness at stepping down as a senior royal. He went on to explain that the decision he and Meghan had made was not taken lightly and said he would continue his charity work to make real long-lasting impact for all those that have been left vulnerable. In his final line of the emotional speech, Harry echoed his late mother in saying people he met during his work as a royal gave him an education about living, as documented in new biography Finding Freedom. The book says this was no coincidence - as Harry had made a point of refreshing his memory of a speech Diana made in  when she announced her withdrawal from public le. Harry told the audience: I will continue to be the same man who holds his country dear and dedicates his le to supporting the causes, charities and military communities that are so important to me. Together, you have given my an education about living. In a similar fashion, Diana gave thanks to those she had met during her time in the royal family while giving a speech after the official separation of her and Charles was announced. Speaking in , Diana said: In the past  years, I can honestly say that one of my greatest pleasures has been my association with people like yourselves. During those years I have met many thousands of wonderful and extraordinary people, both here and around the world. The cared for and the carers. The wider public, may I say that Iaposve made many friends.Iaposve been allowed to share your thoughts and dreams, your disappointments and your happiness. You have also given me an education. By teaching me more about le and living than any books or teachers could have done. Finding Freedom, co-authored by Omid Scobie and Carolyn Durand, has been publicly released today. It documents the fairytale start of Meghanaposs entry into the royal family - to their stepping down as senior royals and move to America. The book also looks at other members of the royal family and their relationship with Meghan and Harry throughout their romance. It is suggested in the explosive new read that Meghan felt disappointed Kate Middleton didnapost reach out and offer her any advise on how an outsider could cope with a new royal role. Speaking more generally about Meghan and Harryaposs time in the royal family, Scobie said: History will remember them as a couple who were perhaps failed by the institution of the monarchy.

They are often depicted as servants and symbolised the subjugation of the Moors - a term describing the Muslims of medieval Spain or anyone of Arab or African descent.

Princess Michael has previously been accused of racism. In  she was overheard telling African American diners in a New York restaurant to go back to the colonies.  Finding Freedom, co-authored by Omid Scobie and Carolyn Durand, has been publicly released today.

Dressed in their finest formal gear, the couple held hands as they arrived at the annual event alongside the Queen, Prince Charles, Camilla and the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge. While they looked happy and relaxed at the televised event, a new book claims things were very emotional behind the scenes as the reality of their le-changing decision finally hit. Meghan hugged staff who had become aposlike familyapos during their time working together, simply saying I canapost believe this. As she made her final preparations and got ready for the event, she also joked with staff on the fact she was wearing her last hat for a while. In their biography Finding Freedom, royal journalists turned authors Omid Scobie and Carolyn Durand describe what happened on that historical day. They write: Harry quietly slipped through the door of the  Room to say hello, and the reality - and the emotions - finally set in. Meghan turned around to hug goodbye the last remaining people in the room, including an author of this book. With the state room almost empty except for a few familiar faces, the tears the duchess has been holding back were free to flow.  She embraced some of the dedicated team members whose tireless efforts - to promote the coupleaposs work, launch landmark projects, and deal with the near-daily crisis brought on by the tabloids - had come to an abrupt end. aposI canapost believe thisapos, she said, hugging one of the young female aides she had become close with. Though Team Sussex was a much smaller operation than the more sophisticated offices at Clarence House and Kensington Palace, in the short space of a year since setting up, they had become like family. Meghan then went to change into the stunning green outfit she chose for the historical event, joking with staff that it was her last hat for a while.  There was further upset when a last minute change to the schedule meant they were left out of the royal procession and wouldnapost walk into the abbey with the Queen. The book claims the couple were not consulted and were very disappointed by the decision. Scobie and Durand also write that William and Kate barely acknowledged Meghan and Harry, despite their efforts to say hello. They write: While Meghan and Harry both greeted Kate and William with smiles, the Cambridges showed little response. It was the first time the two couples had seen each other since January.aposHarryapos, William nodded, ignoring Meghan. For the minutes that followed before the Queenaposs arrival, William and Kate continued to sit with their backs to the couple, only turning around to chat with Edward and Sophie, who sat behind them, next to the Sussexes. Although Meghan tried to make eye contact with Kate, the duchess barely acknowledged her.The book makes a number of references to Meghanaposs relationship with her sister-in-law the Duchess of Cambridge, which royal experts claim have left Kate extremely upset.Andrew Morton, who wrote Princess Dianaaposs tell-all biography, told the New Idea that while Kate is putting on a brave face, she is devastated. He said: There’s no doubt the rt between Harry and William has deeply affected Kate. It upsets her.  Speaking to People magazine ahead of the publication, Scobie said: A lot of damage has been done.He also told the Times : Although Meghan tried to make eye contact with Kate, the duchess barely acknowledged her.To purposefully snub your sister-in-law... I donapost think it left a great taste in the coupleaposs mouths. But Kateaposs daughter Princess Charlotte helped to ease the tension between the women due to Meghanaposs adoration of the little Princess. During the early days of their relationship, Meghan lived with Harry at his Kensington Palace home Nottingham Cottage.  The small two-bed was just around the corner from the Cambridges, which meant they were extremely close and spent a lot of time with Charlotte and her brothers George and Louis. Meghan also bought her sister-in-law a soft leather Smythson notebook which brought them together. However, Scobie and Durand claim that most of the tension was between Harry and William. They say the fallout began when the younger brother was unhappy with the Cambridgesapos reaction when he first told them about his new girlfriend, Meghan. Their first meeting happened at Kensington Palace a few months into Meghan and Harryaposs relationship, but writing about the event the authors write that Kate is an extremely guarded person who keeps a very tight group of friends.

The Duke and Duchess of Sussex travelled to Botswana in  just months after going on their first romantic date in London. Using the trip as a chance to get to know one-another, Meghan and Harry spent five nights away from their luxury log cabins in the wilderness to camp alone. According to new biography Finding Freedom, Harry was delightfully surprised by how down-to-earth Meghan was when it came to roughing-it for the week. The Duchess reportedly packed very little clothing and cleaned her face with baby wipes and happily wandered into the woodlandsshe needed a bathroom break. Harry and Meghan were said to have bonded over their love of nature during the trip, and the pair ed a year later after getting engaged to work with elephant conservation groups. A friend of the couple said: The fact that theyaposre both as happy just throwing on a backpack and going out to eplore...I honestly think these experiences will never stop for them. Finding Freedom, co-authored by Omid Scobie and Carolyn Durand, has been publicly released today. It documents the fairytale start of Meghanaposs entry into the royal family - to their stepping down as senior royals and move to America.The book also looks at other members of the royal family and their relationship with Meghan and Harry throughout their romance. It is suggested in the explosive new read that Meghan felt disappointed Kate Middleton didnapost reach out and offer her any advise on how an outsider could cope with a new royal role. Speaking on Good Morning America ahead of the bookaposs release tomorrow, author Omid Scobie said: These are two women who really have little in common. Being a newcomer, and knowing Kate was once a newcomer, I think there were times where she knew that Meghan felt that she could have, or needed a bit more support from Kate, but didnapost get it in some of those important moments.  Asked about the story of Meghan making Kate cry at a bridesmaid dress fitting, he said: it couldnapost be further from the truth. Extracts of the book published last week support this point, but say there were a few awkward moments between the two women. The authors write that while there were no rows as such, there were some awkward moments between the royal wives. It is claimed Meghan had hoped Kate would reach out to her, but didnapost lose sleep over it when she did not.

Another source told the book: Harry was upset that it was playing out so publicly and that so much of the information being reported was wrong. There had been moments where he felt people working with his brother had put things out to make William look good, evenit meant throwing Harry under the bus. It was a confusing time, and his head was all over the place - he didnapost know who or what to believe, and he and William werenapost talking enough either, which made everything a lot worse. The fallout between the two men was so serious it was openly discussed at a staff retreat in , the book claims. An insider tells the authors: Itaposs no secret, the future of this monarchy relies solely on the four people currently in Kensington Palace.  The public popularity only lies with them. When he [the Prince of Wales] becomes King, the only way it lasts isthe four of them are not at war. We cannot have them at war. The book also gives details of some of the issues which led to the tension between William and Harry, with particular focus on one comment the elder brother made about Meghan. In the early days of their relationship, the Cambridges were keen to meet the woman who had captured Harryaposs hearts, so they set up a meeting at Kensington Palace. But commenting on the first meeting, Scobie and Durand write that Kate is an extremely guarded person who keeps a very tight group of friends.

Light travels further than sound. You sometimes see the lightning flash but you are too far away to hear the thunder. Daniel Walker tweeted: In Manchester and you can hear nothing. It is the end of the world as we know it. Creepy yet beautul lightning.  Thunderstorms were also seen in North Wales, Wirral, Liverpool, Solihul, Redditch, Prescot and other parts of the country. Another Twitter user wrote: Best storm in living memory.  minutes silent lightning show and now, my god Mother Nature is p*****. Beginning to wonderArmageddon is a thing after all. One woman from Redditch shared pictures and video of a dark thundery storm cloud above her, with clear skies around it. She described the scene as aposlike something out of Harry Potterapos.  Bethany Calderbank tweeted a clip of the lightning above Liverpool and said it was aposlike a silent discoapos. Ryan Woods added: Witnessing the weirdest lightning storm Iaposve ever seen in my le. No rain, barely any thunder, but almost constant lightning thataposs been going on for nearly an hour now. Gareth Clarke also saw the display above this home in Prescot in Merseyside. He said: What a fantastic display of lightning from the top floor of my house in Prescot last night. Went on for ages, silent and constant and no rain #MotherNature A Twitter user from Preston, Lancashire, added: Night turned into day last night in the silent storm we had. The extreme weather also saw Wales hit by flooding and hailstones aposthe size of golf ballsapos. The community of Capel Curig was hit with hail so heavy it set off car alarms. The shower was caught on camera by local Jenny Davies, who runs local sport and leisure group Snowdonia Nordic Walking.  As the clip begins, Jenny is filming outside as the hail lashes down on her car. The sound of the hail is deafening, as golf-ball sized pellets rain down from the grey sky. Suddenly, the shower activates the car’s alarm which begins flashing erratically and illuminating the mist. Downpours sparked flooding in Aberystwyth yesterday as several centimetres of rain hit the town over the course of  minutes.  The deluge proved too much for part of Aberyswythaposs drainage system, which overflowed. Photos taken in the town show a large lake of water covering the streets and roads. The Met Office had predicted thunderstorms for the whole of the UK yesterday after issuing a yellow weather warning. It had also warned of more than two monthsapos rainfall in just a few hours as heavy downpours washed out the heatwave.  Forecasters even anticipated a worst-case scenario of up to mm on Monday afternoon and evening in some parts. Bonnie Diamond, a meteorologist with the Met Office, previously said: There is a pretty broad warning in place today, but there is another for central UK - the Midlands up to the North West of England to about Cumbria, and into Wales - which we are watching really closely.

Jonah Douglas, six, was playing outside when his mum, Bethany, , accidentally reversed over him while driving a ride-on lawnmower - after initially thinking sheaposd run over a paving stone. He was rushed to hospital where doctors told his devastated mum his foot couldn’t be re-attached and they performed a Symeaposs amputation through his ankle. His parents Bethany and Gabe, , feared the sports-loving kid would be out of action for the rest of the year but Jonah has surpassed all expectations and is walking without assistance just two months following the major surgery. Bethany said: “He has well exceeded what I was hoping for him.“It was very emotional seeing him walk with his prosthetic. I cried the whole first day of him walking on it. “He has been on the trampoline bouncing and having lightsaber fights with his brother since. “I’ve not seen him running yet but I’m sure it will come soon. “It’s inspiring to me as an adult. We can learn so much from this kid and his mentality.” Bethany reversed over Jonah’s foot as he approached the lawnmower from behind, to grab hold of a cup of water which was balancing on it. The mum-of-five, from Mount Vernon, Missouri, says she felt a bump and thought she had run over a paving stone before hearing Jonah’s screams over the hum of the lawnmower. The ex-trauma nurse had previously warned her children to keep away from the lawnmower, but Jonah thought he was safe from behind and didn’t expect the machine to reverse. Tragically, it was the second amputation the family have had to deal with in six months, Jonah’s sister having lost her right leg above the knee at the end of last year following complications related to a car accident she was in.  Bethany said: “We had just got her out of hospital at the end of February of this year and then a few months later we had another amputation to deal with. “Sometimes you think, have I done something wrong  “It’s complicated to get your heart and head around. “There’s hope because they are both still here though. That’s the silver lining.  “They’ve just lost a couple of legs in the process.” The family have since sold the lawnmower in a garage sale but Bethany says the tragic accident won’t stop them getting another one in the future.

However when the sweet treat arrived for her event, she soon spotted a major issue with it.  The mum-to-be took to TikTok to share the hilarious blunder with her followers. Posting under the username @crazypiggies she revealed how sheaposd sent a baker a photo of a cake she liked saying this is what I wanted.The image shows a cake with white frosting and bees made out of icing, with the words what will it bee on the top, next to a beehive. The sponge inside the cake would be coloured pink or blue depending whether she was having a boy or a girl. But when the cake was delivered, it wasnapost exactly what she hoped.  Some kind of communication error had clearly occurred and instead of a surprise colour inside, the entire cake had been covered in blue icing - showing she was expecting a little boy. There was also a creepy miniature baby doll on top, instead of a beehive and the cake contained real flowers instead of edible ones made from fondant. Luckily the woman was able to see the funny side of the situation and had a good laugh over the whole thing.Her post quickly went viral, being watched over four million times and garnering over , likes."},{"url":null,"title":"greece enforces strict night time","story":"NewsGreece enforces strict night-time curfew on islands as country hit by second waveOfficials have imposed strict measures on Mykonos, Santorini, Corfu, Rhodes, Zante and Crete, with bars and restaurants closed overnight following a surge in casesShareCommentsByRosaleen FentonExclusives Reporter:,  AUG Updated:,  AUG NewsRestaurants and bars on the Greek islands must close from midnight \" %, rgba, rgba, url\"Get our daily coronavirus email newsletter with all the news you need to know direct to your inboxWhen you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

The country registered  new cases on Monday, with a total of , cases and a death toll of . It follows another  cases on Sunday, the highest number since the pandemic started. A strict lockdown has already been imposed on the Greek island of Poros, after  people tested positive. Now strict new measures - including mandatory face masks - will run until August , as officials battle to keep the outbreak under control.  All restaurants and food shops must close between pm and am, and all live events are suspended.  A maximum of nine people can gather together for a public or private event. And four people can eat together at a restaurant or cafe - unless they are related, in which case, six people are allowed. On Monday, it was announced that travellers coming from Belgium, the Czech Republic the Netherlands, Spain and Sweden must present a negative coronavirus test to be allowed in from th August. It must be a PCR test taken up to  hours prior to travelling. There are concerns that futher travel restrictions could be placed upon holidaymakers entering the country - including Brits. Thousands of holidaymakers have jetted to Greece after Spain was removed from the apossafeapos list, meaning many holidays could be at risk. Professor Gkikas Magiorkinis, one of the country’s leading epidemiologists, told Sun Online Travel: Itaposs a turning point. If this dramatic increase in cases continues, then we will be seeing more than  to  cases a day.  Holidaymakers entering Greece must fill out a Passenger Locator Form before flying - or risk not being allowed into the country. Wizz Air has apologised after it wrongly stopped a number of holidaymakers from flying to Greece due to confusion over the forms. The airline prevented them from boarding the plane after claiming they had wrongly filled out the form - which is mandatory for all travellers entering Greece. The form has created a headache for airlines and families - with some travellers told they cannot fly due to errors. After filling out the form, travellers should receive an email acknowledgement and a QR code. The QR code must be printed out or available via mobile phone.

I didn’t enter mine and nor did my partner. “We were stopped due to not having a middle name on our PLF forms. We were sent to a supervisor and manager who were not helpful at all.

Following the incident, a spokeswoman for Wizz Air confirmed that the holidaymakers were not allowed to board as a result of having no Passenger Locator Form , mistakes on their form, or insufficient detail on their form, such as missing middle names. Other furious travellers claim to have been affected by the same mistake. One holidaymaker tweeted: @Wizzair you are an absolute joke of an airline.

I still wanted to go back home for a few weeks to a month but unfortunately I cannot do that this summer.“It is what it is but I love staying in Dundee and staying in Scotland and enjoying all the things we have to do here because it is such a beautul place.”For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles.Newsletter Get top stories straight to your inbox every day.SUBSCRIBE HERE!Latest blaize_config   n t t tCancelation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Eveningwebsite and Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening  n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb + ePaper n t t t n t t t n t t t tDuration: n t t t t Month n t t t n t tSubscribe TodayEnjoy the digital edition of the Eveningnewspaper on your smartphone, tablet and computer.Unlimited access to all articles on the Eveningwebsite.

the jeopardy of the nation’s heritage.Italian-born Edoardo Bedin, who now lives in the city, is a furloughed employee of the National Trust for Scotland, and he is using his time away from work to complete a five-week hike between  of the heritage body’s properties.He began the journey on July  at Crathes Castle, walking south towards House of Dun near Montrose, and arrived on the isle of Arran yesterday to visit Brodick Castle.If all goes to plan, Edoardo will complete his epic walk on August , when he will stop off at Pitmedden Garden before crossing his personal finish line at Haddo House near Methlick.The challenge is raising awareness and funds for National Trust for Scotlandproperties across the country that have been forced to close due to the Covid- crisis.Edoardo is one of hundreds of NTS employees who will learnthey are being made redundant in the coming weeks, as the trust struggles for funds without income from tickets and gt shops.Supporters have offered him a place to stay each night, with accommodation ranging from a summer house and a tent in a garden to complimentary rooms in hotels.Local Rotary Clubs have been particularly helpful, offering overnight stays for over half the trek so far.Taxi drivers have given him free lts to his start points, he has been invited to rest in gardens and some people have even offered to do his laundry for him.Edoardo has also been boosted by a number of walking partners – with several of his fellow NTS staff and volunteers among them, alongside families, pensioners and dogs.He was even taught Swahili by a couple on Fe’s coastal path.He said: “The beauty of Scotland#s scenery is immense.“I#m loving all of this – the geography, the views, the people. This is a country worth this walk.”Today Edoardo will be walking from Ardrossan to Stewarton in East Ayrshire, in preparation for ticking off his twelfth NTS property at Holmwood House in Glasgow tomorrow.His journey can be followed by searching ‘Hitting the Road for the Love of Scotland’ on Facebook, and his fundraising page can be found at www.justgiving fundraising hittingtheroadfortheloveofscotlandFor as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles. blaize_config   n t t tCancellation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Evening Express website including all Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening Express n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb and ePaper n t t t n t t t n t t t tDuration: n t t t tMonthly n t t t n t tSubscribe TodayUnlimited access to all articles on the Evening Express website.

From a personal point of view, it’s always special to come up against Dundee United.“United was the main part of my football career and I’ve got so many great memories from my time at Tannadice, so it’s always nice to play them. With the teams we’re playing we might even get a live TV game out of it, that could be a great showcase for the club.”Meanwhile, former Peterhead midfielder Jack Leitch has signed for Stirling Albion after three years at Balmoor.For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles. blaize_config   n t t tCancellation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Evening Express website including all Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening Express n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb and ePaper n t t t n t t t n t t t tDuration: n t t t tMonthly n t t t n t tSubscribe TodayUnlimited access to all articles on the Evening Express website.

Once again, the separatists# numbers simply don#t add up.Councillor Alastair Redman # Kintyre and Islands wardSir,Exactly two years ago I was diagnosed with stage three, oestrogen positive breast cancer.I’d just come back from a week#s holiday in Spain with Isabel and Margaret. Days before I went on holiday I’d had a biopsy following referral from my GP. Although there wasn’t a cloud in the sky, my holiday was definitely clouded by impending results#I had chosen to wait until after my holiday to get them.The journey that Monday to go to Gartnavel is one I’ll never forget. My partner Frank didn’t shut up the whole way there, obviously he was nervous. I couldn’t be bothered with the small talk and just wanted him to shut up. Obviously I was nervous and he was just trying to keep my mind off it, but I was too busy silently praying. The number  is something I see all the time so I spent the whole journey looking for the number on someone’s licence plate #I saw it everything would be ok. I didn#t see it. That might sound a bit daft, but fear does crazy things to you.Walking into the consultant#s room and finding a nurse waiting there confirmed my worst fears. #It’s a wee cancer,# said Mr Wilson. The words echoing in my head, I couldn’t hear anything after that. I remember taking a deep breath and looking at Frank. I will never, ever forget the look on his face.My only question that day was #am I going to lose my breasts # The answer was no, and thankfully Frank was there to take in what was being said my head was spinning. The question I really wanted to ask was #am I going to die # I was too scared to ask that question.I didn’t cry until I walked out the hospital, then I bawled. Frank was amazing, and he didn’t talk like a budgie on the way home.The journey home was horrendous. I was terried about telling my mum. How do you tell your mum that her only child has cancer  I hadn’t told her anything about finding a lump. I couldn’t cope with worrying about her worrying about me # butit happens again I#d do it dferently and she’ll be the first to know. By the time I got home I had no more tears left.The relief telling mum was a huge weight off my shoulders. What ensued after my initial diagnosis was two weeks of crying every day. Telling the girls at work was so emotional, and in fact I was exhausted with it all.Once surgery and treatment plans were in place I was in a better place. Time to get the head down and get on with it, and that#s what I did. I was full of positivity and determination, and I think my sense of humour helped enormously.The treatment was bad, but it was necessary. The ongoing treatment is bad but it#s necessary. I’m alive and that’s what matters. My le has changed forever, nothing will be the same. My le has been ided into Before Cancer and After Cancer  I now have a new #normal#.I don’t know what the future holds, who does, but I intend to live my le happily, positively and most definitely to the fullest!I will never forget the support, both physically and emotionally that I received from my nearest and dearest, and of course from the whole community. The strength you have given me continues, and for that I am truly grateful.Please, pleaseyou find an abnormality or you just feel something isn’t quite right, act upon it and seek attention.I know it’s a dficult time with this horrid virus but it’s important to remember that early detection saves lives.Stay safe and take care.Yvie Young, Lochgilphead"},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures june 26 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsAvril Lockhart from Cairnbaan sent us this week#s photograph.Taken at Bellanoch, the photo shows the bike that Avril, as a key worker, has been lent by Alec Ohnstad of the Ardrishaig Bothy.

However, there are still numerous restrictions in place, including no operation of locks and bridges, limited services and limited staff available on the ground. This remains the position.#We are, however, pleased to let you know that Scottish Canals is planning to re-open canals to navigation in line with the announcement that Scotland’s tourism sector is preparing to reopen during phase three of the Scottish Government route map on July .

The noise is constant and intrusive for  –  hours in a day, the decibel level in excess of  dB where sounds above  dB are harmful to hearing.This is a serious issue for residents who cannot open their doors and windows, cannot use their gardens, pets are terried, it is often impossible to have a conversation, or a phone call. The noise from hundreds of bikes is explosive and destructive.The speeds are terrying, they travel in intimidating packs, the noise is threatening and the bikers have no respect for the communities they are speeding through. They pass multiple residential entrances with limited sight lines with no care for risk. The offensive noise seems to come from two actions modying motorbike exhausts and extreme acceleration in legal bikes.If a car made a similar noise, spewed out the same polluting omissions, or did the same ridiculous speeds they would be pulled over by the police, but bikers appear above the law.As technology reduces the noise pollution of cars, planes and other forms of transport, it seems motorbikes are exempt. Bikers claim #loud pipes save lives# but is safety really the motivation for deliberately creating excessive noise Noise counts as a statutory nuisance it either unreasaonably and substantially interferes with the user or enjoyment of a home or other premises or is likely to injure health.The problem on A is known to all the statutory agencies, but nothing is done.If this is a national problem, what action needs to be taken Concerned Loch Fyne-side resident Sir,I am not qualied to judge economic competence, but considering the party he represents, I think that Councillor Redman might find it advisable to be wary of the phrase #colossal mismanagement# .For my part, I would consider a degree of incompetence to be preferable to the great damage caused over the last decade to  per cent of the UK’s people, as well as to its institutions and its reputation by the cruel, self-serving, xenophobic, elitist, dishonestregime currently in Westminster.Name supplied, LochgilpheadSir,Our charity#s support for blind and partially sighted people affected by the coronavirus lockdown has received a £, boost from the Scottish Government#s Wellbeing Fund.With this extra funding we will be able to support an additional  people and respond to the increased demand for more in-depth, one-to-one emotional support.The practical and psychological effects of losing your sight can have a signicant impact on people’s well-being, and this current situation has exacerbated the anxiety and isolation felt by many.Access to essential services such as food and medicines is more dficult as is social distancing, vital information on staying safe isn#t always in accessible formats, and many of our older members aren#t always confident about using new technology to stay in touch with others.Everyone accessing RNIB#s confidential counselling service will receive eight weekly sessions with an accredited counsellor, delivered via telephone and online, with each session normally lasting an hour.The funding will enable us to reduce the waiting list for emergency mental health sessions and also let existing clients access additional sessions.The RNIB helpline is available on   .James Adams, RNIB Scotland directorSir,Every pub across Scotland should be allowed to stock and sell beer from local independent brewers, to help them recover post-lockdown.CAMRA, the Campaign for Real Ale has launched the #Cheers for Choice# campaign.The campaign wants these arrangements to be relaxed, and MSPs are also being urged to support the Tied Pubs Bill being put forward in the Scottish Parliament by Labour MSP Neil Bibby. The legislation would give tied pub tenants protections in law, including a right to be able to sell guest beers in their pubs.Allowing small and independent brewers to sell into all pubs will also improve consumer choice and allow pub-goers to support local brewing businesses.It also makes business sense, with  per cent of pub-goers saying they would be less likely to go back to a pubit doesn’t have a range of brews from small and independent producers.Sarah Crawford, CAMRA Director for Scotland, Kirkcaldy"},{"url":null,"title":"could a two way conversation transform scotlands health","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSome of us have learned in lockdown the importance of other people, and have been longing for these first personal contacts.There have been surprises in discovering just what is important in le, and the comfort of knowing you are not alone in your likes, as your favourite brand of chocolate is again sold out.We have also been made aware that the way we behave makes a dference to the future. It has taken a national emergency to get the government to acknowledge that it needs our compliance and, for that, must give us the information we need.Suddenly the choices we make are seen as vitally important, and we have a part to play in achieving success for ourselves and our community. Can this be a foundation for a future partnership that could transform the health of Scotland and the pressure on our services As a physiotherapist I became aware that there was little that one could do to impose solutions there had to be a relationship that involved two way listening, mutual trust and support to do what was necessary. In this pandemic Nicola Sturgeon has said that we have behaved in a way that saved lives and protected the NHS.When this is over we could be at the beginning of another le-altering journey.It will demand a huge sht in expectations. There is an amazing bias in society towards the idea of decrepitude and dependency in old age, when in fact encouraging dependency increases a slide into that very state. During past months many of these attitudes have been exposed and caused outrage but they are long standing and deep seated.If you have been trying to escape into fiction you might have no better idea of what is possible. Alison Flood interviewed crime writers about their work, and this is what she found.Ian Rankin is now writing about a John Rebus who has health issues, James Lee Burke has his detective Robicheaux meditating on mortality in his early s and Mark Billingham has slowed his Tom Thorne down a bit because he is in his s. Michael Connelly does not believe that it is credible to have his Harry Bosch with a badge and gun and still working for the LAPD, this in a country where the President is  and one of the presidential hopefuls .Worst of all, Sara Paretsky created a feisty, strong woman for her books, only to succumb to popular misconceptions and stop her age at  because she didn#t #want Vi to be helpless#.These fictional creations battle the evils they see in their society. Now that it is realised how our inidual decision making makes a dference, whatever our age, we have no need to feel helpless.It is time to ask for the information and support we need."},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures july 3 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSimon Macdonald from Kilmichael Glassary submitted this week#s featured image.

Perhaps for the first time in their lives they have heard the bark of deer or spotted something in nature that is totally new to them. And many will have seen footage of the animals and creatures that tentatively stepped into urban settings whilst humankind remained under lockdown.But that is changing as we ease back into a new normality.Economics and peoples’ livelihoods are, of course, firmly entwined with modern day living, human survival and wellbeing it is extremely important that we find a route to recovery and many are suffering deeply. But what we do not want to do is fall back into the same old traps that were so detrimental to the wildle, nature and ecosystems of our planet. Finding a way forward and a new balance is not just crucial for other species but for that of our own children and future generations too.Many will have been shocked at the sudden increase in fly tipping during lockdown plus the thoughtless parking and abandonment of picnic rubbish, disposable barbecues and indiscriminate toileting as lockdown eased. All have grave consequences for wildle and nature.The result is the burning, choking, strangling, trapping or poisoning of animals, birds, plants and aquatic le.Taking care of our surroundings and appreciating nature is a real joy. Teaching children the beauty of the outdoors and how to care for it can bring a lelong love for natureyou love something you usually wish to protect it.And learning never stops for any of us. Sometimes it is the basics that are needed before we move on to the complexities of natural navigation or learning our stars.So for this month here is one tip : learn how to go to the toilet in the outdoors!Doing this responsibly and teaching your children makes for a lelong enjoyment of walking and exploring without the bane of wondering where the next toilet is. I know many people who find it incredibly dficult, not great when in the middle of nowhere miles from home.In a nutshell the key is to carry out all paper and sanitary waste in a sealable bag, to go aMountaineering Scotland has excellent online guidance on how to dispose of your natural waste.I hope, like me, you will wish to continue to enjoy nature and take the time to care for and immerse your senses in this beautul world we live in."},{"url":null,"title":"golf clubs set to benefit from covid support fund","story":"Fiona ScottUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsGolf clubs that have been affected financially by the coronavirus pandemic are being offered support via a funding package funded by the Royal and Ancient Golf Club of St Andrews.In total the funding is worth £, and clubs affiliated to Scottish Golf can apply for grants being made available via two separate allocations the Covid- Fixed Costs Grant and the Club Relief Fund.Fixed Costs Grant will enable every affiliated club in Scotland to apply for aThese can include but are not exhaustive of sanitation products, Covid-related health and safety equipment, professional fees, signs, training, video conferencing licenceand any other Covid-related spend.The Club Relief Fund has been created to provide financial support to clubs who have been impacted by the pandemic and is concentrated on enabling clubs to reinstate or to increase expenditure in key areas to either improve member experience or boost income generation potential.Clubs applying to this fund are required to complete a four-stage application to ensure the review committee have the correct information available to allocate funds.The information required includes:• Standard Club Criteria and AgreementA Scottish Golf spokesperson said: #While the provision of this funding is most welcome, we do anticipate the volume of applications to be high and the criteria outlined will be strictly applied to ensure that the funds available are distributed where most needed.#We continue to explore other funding options for clubs to access and will communicate any additional opportunities should these arise.#The application process for both grants is open now until Friday July .

It is now one of the most beautul drives in the place, and as a drive it would be destroyed.#The line from Glasgow to Oban took  years to build and finally opened in , proving extremely popular with holidaymakers for many years. The proposed branch line from Dalmally to Inveraray was never built, despite plans to #hide# the railway from the duke’s view. A plan from  shows a proposed tunnel to carry the line through the duke’s policies near to the castle. This proposal, like many others, was defeated in the House of Lords.Instead, provision was made at Dalmally for a waiting room, the #Duke’s Room#, at Dalmally Station where visitors arriving by train could await the arrival of a carriage in comfort.This is just one of innumerable fascinating stories stored within the Argyll Papers, the family and estate archive of the Campbell family, dukes of Argyll.The Friends of the Argyll Papers was established to support the development of the archive and to promote its use and enjoyment by a wide audience.It has been described as one of the most important private archives in Britain, offering a rich resource for Scottish and British history from the th to the st centuries.

Without action and proper investment from central government vital public services will be at risk.This news of huge strain on local authority budgets comes as the SNP is delaying in opening up Scotland’s hospitality and tourism industry. Instead of following other parts of the UK and opening the sector on July , the separatists are forcing businesses to wait until July .This delay will cost businesses millions at a time when thousands of jobs are already on the line.The SNP is risking people#s livelihoods. It needs to accept responsibility for that and take action now.Councillor Alastair Redman,Sir,People occasionally ignore the elephant in the room to support their point of view, but in his latest letter, Councillor Alastair Redman has ignored an entire herd in his living room.In his latest rant he states that the SNP is failing councils as the cost of coronavirus could hit more than £ million, but surely these costs would be the same no matter who was in power He also suggests that #essential local services have been underfunded for years# yet fails to mention the years of needless austerity cuts, actioned by his party and their collaborators, to bail out the greedy and risky practices of the banks, which reduced funding to a devastatingly low level in general. It is worth noting that the Scottish Government has put a greater percentage of their curtailed income into NHS Scotland than any part part of the UK. This has helped NHS Scotland to outperform all of the others, in the UK, for the past five years. This is paying idends now.He s to his familiar attempt to insult by referring to citizens who want to take responsibility for making and managing decisions and working to make their country prosper within the priorities set by its citizens as #separatists#. I’m glad to be described as a separatist because the alternative is to be an apologist for an unrepresentative government in Westminster and to abdicate decision making to that same out-of-touch group.It is Councillor Redman’s final point, however, that demonstrates his blinkered sycophancy. His suggestion that the Scottish Government should follow the example of other parts of the UK. Could he really be saying that we should follow the chaotic shambles and incompetence that has emanated from his chums at Westminster  Does he seriously think that any sensible person, irrespective of their own political affiliation and from any of the devolved nations, would swap what their government#s have done for the Westminster model Sadly, nowhere in his missive does Councillor Redman take time to mention the health and safety of our citizens.It is this, together with scientic advice and without political point scoring, that is driving the Scottish Government#s response to this tragic pandemic.Kevin MacKaveney, TarbertSir,Following reports of littering around Argyll and Bute, including the Isle of Islay, the issue was discussed at a recent meeting of Islay Community Council where community councillors heard that items like rubber gloves have been found dumped in ditches.It is always very disappointing to hear about littering and fly-tipping but doubly so in an area like Islay where residents take such an understandable pride in their environment.We also need to bear in mind that items like disposable gloves can pose a threat to livestock. As well as being profoundly antisocial, this kind of behaviour can be positively harmful.Those acting irresponsibly should remember that there can be serious consequences to their thoughtlessness.Donald Cameron, Highlands and Islands MSPSir,We all have a role to play in the recovery of the country’s tourism industry after its reopening on July .Scots could help by taking a trip, visiting an attraction or experience, shopping locally, dining out and booking a staycation.Scottish tourism is facing its biggest challenge in a generation and will need financial support for some time to come to help it recover. The Scottish public has a crucial part to play in helping this happen.It#s easy to not think of yourself as a tourist in your own country but many of the experiences that we often enjoy with loved ones, such as holidays, shopping or eating out, all contribute to our visitor economy.July  marked a new era for the industry as we start to welcome back visitors and take our first steps on the road to a safe and responsible recovery. However, reopening won’t be the same for all businesses, many are still adapting to this #new normal#, so it#s important that we recognise that as we move forward to try and restore our industry.We look forward to helping Scots rediscover their own country in a way that is safe for everyone # visitors, residents and those working within the industry. Recovery will require our collective efforts and we must act as one to ensure the best possible outcomes for the whole of the visitor economy.Malcolm Roughead, VisitScotland chief executive"},{"url":null,"title":"the time for change is is now july 17 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsThis isn’t really a campaign, it’s just the things that we should all be thinking aboutwe want Argyll # and the world – to be a recognisable place for our children and grandchildren to live in.The economic crisis could be seen as an opportunity to get started on the work that we know needs to happen.I think that many people in Argyll could continue to work from home people who have lost their jobs could be retrained, or use their existing skills, to do the work that is necessary for Argyll to become carbon-neutral. Walking and cycling infrastructure needs to be improved, trees can be planted, and renewable energy can be expanded and made more efficient.Transport and food are the most obvious areas for behavioural change in Argyll. We need to be promoting the benefits of electric cars and making them preferable to petrol or diesel cars.We can easily bring food production and consumption closer together by shopping and eating more locally and more naturally. Farming in Argyll is generally quite low impact, but does not have the capacity to feed everyone in the area, meaning that we have to buy in meat which is less sustainably farmed to make up the dference. If everyone ate only the meat that is produced locally, we could dramatically reduce the emissions caused from the transport of imported meat, as well as supporting our local market and ensuring that it remains natural and sustainable. Reducing food waste is also an easy behavioural change.Acting on climate change is all about thinking of others. Across the globe, the people who see the most adverse effects of climate change so far are those who are already marginalised and vulnerable.Kindness and common decency indicate that we must act with the needs of these people in mind, with the knowledge thatwe do not act, ‘these people’ will soon become us and our children.One thing that I think would make a huge dference would bewe all took #our whole selves# to work with us.Whatworld leaders were constantly thinking: #what would my children say about my role in this decision # This kind of moral thinking would make a huge dference in the future of industry and politics, and the more we educate the next generation, the more influence they will have on their parents.Everyone can make changes such as cutting down on their meat and dairy consumption, shopping locally, re-using plastic containers, recycling, composting, reducing food waste, buying fewer new things, using a renewable energy supplier, and cutting down or cutting out air travel.At the Paris Agreement in ,  nations decided to take measures to limit the global temperature increase to . degrees above pre-industrial levels. Our current behaviour will not allow for this.A rise of  degrees celsius above pre-industrial levels will mean that large areas of land around the equator will be uninhabitable, resulting in huge numbers of refugees fleeing for their survival. Sea level rise caused by the rapid melting of the ice caps will mean that small island states such as Kiribati and Tuvalu will be submerged. The combination of the loss of arable land and ocean acidication due to temperature increase will mean global food shortages, such that we have never seen before.The rich will still be able to buy food, but those who are already marginalised and vulnerable will find it increasingly dficult to access basic amenities like food and clean water, further stretching the inequality gap.It’s not too late to make changes, but it soon will be.We all need to have climate change in the forefront of our minds when making any kind of decision, be it personal or business. It is an omnipresent issue and every decision, however big or small, will have an effect."},{"url":null,"title":"science matters are aircraft vapour trails harmful","story":"Dorothy H CrawfordUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsAlthough much reduced by the Coronavirus pandemic, everyone has seen the vapour trails produced by high-flying aircraft as they streak across the sky. But what are they  and are they harmful Officially called contrails , these ephemeral, cloud-like structures are primarily made of ice crystals. They form at altitudes over , metres from water vapour in the aircraft’s engine exhaust as it freezes almost instantaneously at temperatures below minus  degrees celsius. There are, however, plenty of other volatiles and solid components in engine exhaust, including soot particles that often act as a nucleus around which the ice crystals form.Official figures show that air traffic contributes around five per cent of greenhouse gases. Yet these estimates only account for CO emissions. They do not include the effect of contrails, which can persist for hours and even expand into cirrus clouds several miles wide. These clouds, which are most abundant over North America and Europe, trap heat within Earth’s atmosphere, so do they improve our climate or contribute to global warming Air traffic has been steadily increasing year-on-year, so, assuming the coronavirus effect is a temporary one, estimates suggest that the distance flown by passengers will double every  years, and that air traffic will quadruple by . Therefore, it is imperative to determine how the increase in clouds created by contrails might affect us.In a recent study*, scientists used a climate model to analyse the future impact of contrails on climate change, taking into account their predicted increase balanced against any likely changes in engine soot emissions.The results show a three-fold increase in contrail cirrus coverage by , despite a  per cent reduction in soot emissions due to improved fuel and engine efficiency. These predictions cover all major air traffic routes and are mostly due to increased air traffic volume, although a sht to flying at higher altitudes also contributes. The area with the greatest increase will be Eastern Asia, where the largest rise in air traffic is expected.This previously unaccounted for, non-CO, climate impact of air traffic is now reckoned to have a more damaging effect on climate change than all the CO emitted from aircraft engines.*Atmos.

Taking a holiday in the United Kingdom offers people the chance to uncover some stunning scenery, wonderful attractions and superb accommodation without having to jump on a plane. Here, we take a look at the type of places you can stay, the rules you need to follow and how to enjoy a great staycation.Scotland’s colourful countryside, breathtaking beaches and glorious gardens are ready to welcome visitors this summer.Many locations are reopening, but have restricted visitor numbers and pre-booked time slots, so we recommend looking at the official websites for attractions and organisations before you travel, so that you’re in the know before you go.The national tourist organisations of Scotland, England, Wales and Northern Ireland have launched a UK-wide industry standard and ‘We’re Good to Go’ mark. The mark means businesses can demonstrate that they are adhering to the respective government and public health guidance, ensuring they can welcome visitors back with confidence.Do remember that our four nations have dferent guidelines, advice and timescales for reopening tourism. Please respect government guidance on social distancing and also any regional lockdown measures that are provided by the respective nation.Summer is here and Britain is beginning to reopen, providing everyone with the opportunity to start dreaming about a holiday. And this year a staycation could give you some much needed rest and recuperation, while also helping get the holiday industry back up and running. Hotels, campsites, bed and breakfast accommodation and other places to stay are now openingthey can follow the guidelines relevant to their locality to ensure that their guests will be safe to stay and spend days wandering our award-winning coastlines, exploring our green spaces and getting inspired in our cities. Each accommodation provider is unique and those that have reopened have had to adapt depending on the nature of their business, including the size and type of accommodation.But these changes mean it is safe for visitors to come and enjoy a change of scenery. But even when we are away from home, we still need to follow the guidelines.Speaking earlier this month, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said: “As lockdown eases, we should focus on supporting the livelihoods of business owners and their employees up and down the country – all of whom are opening their doors for the first time in more than three months.“They are our local restaurants, hairdressers, libraries, museums, cinemas, and yes, pubs. They are also hotels, BBs, indeed much of our tourism industry.“All these businesses and their workers have put in a heroic effort to prepare their venues for this reopening, to work out a way to trade in a way that keeps their customers safe.“But the success of these businesses, the livelihoods of those who rely on them, and ultimately the economic health of the whole country is dependent on every single one of us acting responsibly. We must not let them down.”Mr Johnson emphasised that evenwe are now allowed to spend nights away from our own homes, we must still follow social distancing rules. When out and about, we need to remember to look after ourselves, one another and the environment around us.

At the moment, only self-contained accommodation can open, so the website only allows those types of sites to be booked.  They’ve introduced a new feature on the website where each business can indicate what new safety measures they’ve put in place.  Among the most popular places among potential visitors is Pembrokeshire, with secluded spots outside of national parks all proving popular.·         Wales is open for camping from  July.Northumberland’s oldest castle hotel, Langley Castle near Hexham, has reopened to visitors, with all the appropriate “defences” in place. The castle, which has survived attacks by Border Reivers and a fire that left it as a ruin for centuries, has again been buzzing with guests who have been impressed by the sanitary and social distancing measures that Langley has already put in place. The management team makes many arrangements upfront, such as menu choices and payments, as part of the social distancing procedures that are required. Other changes affect check-in and check-out times, to enable the housekeeping team to carry out deep cleans. Executive general manager Margaret Livingstone-Evans said: “We have stayed upbeat and optimistic and have managed to generate enquiries throughout lockdown, by being creative about the ways in which we can make things happen, in a safe way.” More details at langleycastleFor more information on staying safe, please go to visitscotland"},{"url":null,"title":"creative writing how to begin","story":"Kenneth StevenUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsThe last few months have been a dficult and unsettling time. But it has also been a time of positive change and reflection, prompting people to be more creative. Writing, be it poetry, song writing or short stories, for example, has given many a way of making sense of this time, of sharing their feelings and looking after their mental health.For those who have found it dficult to know where to begin, Seil author Kenneth Steven offers this advice to help you start your creative writing journey.For me, there are two essential ingredients when it comes to setting out as a creative writer: time and space. By creative writing I mean poetry, short stories, novels and children’s writing: everything involving the use of the imagination.When someone claims they don’t have time to write, I don’t believe them as it’s a question of making time.PD James started writing when nursing a dying husband: he needed care all through the day. There was a part of the night when finally he went to sleep and she had the chance to put pen to paper, so that was what she did. If we are serious about wanting to write, we will make time.For many years I lived in Dunkeld, close to the entrance to the cathedral. When friends heard my address they would roll their eyes and say: ‘What a place to be. And you’re lucky enough to be a writer.’Except it wasn’t that easy. The truth is the modern world invaded even that idyllic corner of Scotland.First, there were thousands of pilgrim feet and voices. I was driven mad by not being able to find sufficient quiet. My former we watched a great deal of television. It was a tiny flat and the distant murmur of low voices maddened me because I couldn’t concentrate.It was she who suggested # probably to stop the grumbling # that I should have a cabin built in my mother’s garden in Aberfeldy, a place where I could hide away to write. After considering the idea for a few days, I realised she was right.When finally I sat down to start working in that simple shed among the trees, the words poured from the pen. I will never forget those first days. Poem after poem appeared as though by magic on the page. For me # and after many years of leading creative writing sessions, I would suggest for the vast majority of others too # finding real quiet makes all the dference.But it doesn’t have to be a hideaway in a garden it can be a living room or a bedroom or an attic – just at a time when others in the household are asleep or absent.There are few rules for creative writers, but one I have discovered is that we are all larks or owls. We’re either attracted to early morning or late evening.I have yet to meet anyone who has said they’re drawn to the mid-afternoon # what I term # hammock time, though that’s when I wrote in the Aberfeldy cabin. I’ve come to believe strongly you will use the time you are given. If that’s what you have, you will adapt to that rhythm.But I quickly came to realise in my cabin that I couldn’t simply turn on good writing like a tap. We go into our creative space weighed down by the modern world. We live lives beset by emails, phone calls and text messages. We are all expected to respond quickly.I think creative writers are generally poor when it comes to practice writing. The creative lives of visual artists, actors, singers and musicians are dominated by practice. Why should it be dferent for those from the writing community What do I mean by practice writing  Describing the view out of the window going back into memory to capture a moment as evocatively as possible imagining a dialogue between two characters. There’s no end to the possibilities. What practice writing provides is creative grounding. It brings us from being all over the place in our minds to give us creative focus.What this practice allows us to do is to start, then to pour ourselves into what I like to call deep writing. It creates a kind of doorway so the real writing can begin.Kenneth Steven is best-known as a poet. Sixteen of his collections have been published and he writes and presents poetry-related programmes for BBC Radio. He is also a Scottish novelist and children’s author. He’s written two handbooks on writing and led workshops and worked as writer in residence at home and abroad. www.kennethsteven"},{"url":null,"title":"if walls could talk","story":"Susan WindramUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsStrachur Smiddy opened its doors again on Saturday, August , after an uncertain few months due to Covid-.The museum will only be open on Saturdays and Sundays, until Sunday September , but for now families can again enjoy stepping back in time in the th-century blacksmith’s smiddy, which has been carefully repaired and restored to its original state and now acts as a working museum with with forge, bellows and anvil, cobbled floor, tools of the trade and beamed ceiling.Browse through the Smiddy’s collection of fascinating artefacts and tools.

Work has continued since then to raise money to complete the project.With the cost of the original scheme estimated at £ million, the charity decided to scale back its ambitions and make it a phased project that could be added to as funding allowed.The first priority was to remove buildings containing asbestos on the newly-purchased site, at an estimated cost of £,.More than half of this sum was granted by the A#Chruach wind farm fund, provided by Ventient Energy, but the balance was still to be found and with the building warrant to remove the buildings running out in October time was getting short.That was when A and C Building Contractors Ltd, Kenneth James Construction Ltd and M Kerr Roofing stepped in to save the day.Andy Morrison and Craig Owen, of A and C Building Contractors Ltd, approached MAYDS centre manager Fiona Kalache to find out what was happening with the buildings and how the project was progressing. They decided to contact the other firms and they all agreed to help the charity by completeing the first phase of the project for the amount of money currently available.Andy and Craig explained: #MAYDS really helped us out when we were putting together our business plan and setting up so we wanted to say #thank you# and repay the favour. We are happy to be helping a local charity, especially when it is going to create something good for the community and youngsters in the area.#Kenny MacLeod added: #It is great to see something happening for young people and for Lochgilphead. Often it seems like lots of things are happening around Lochgilphead but never in the town itself, so this is an important development that will be really beneficial.#Fiona Kalache offered her thanks to the construction companies: #This is a huge relief as we have been struggling for some time to get funding for the full costs. The main thing was to get the buildings down before our building warrant ran out, giving us a clear site to start construction of the skate park.#These builders have gone out of their way to support us by doing work in kind and reducing costs so that we can now move forward with our planned development. We are so grateful to them for stepping in to support the young people of Mid Argyll and finally allowing their vision to progress. Thanks also have to go to A#Chruach wind farm. It has funded a signicant part of the costs quoted and have continued to support us throughout.#This will make a big dference to the lives of young people in the area. Many of them currently travel through to Dumbarton to access the type of facilities we hope to offer. We plan to use the back end of the site for basketball hoops and other play equipment and hope to attract children from all over Argyll, creating a fun, safe space for young people.#Once the site is cleared, security fencing and lighting will be installed. Then work will start on putting the steel skate park jumps and ramps in place. MAYDS would welcome any help to raise money to meet the cost of this work.MAYDS works with young people up to the age of  across Mid Argyll and Islay, offering training, support, youth clubs, drop-ins, cyber cafe, trips and much more. People receiving help include young carers, young parents, young people with disabilities and young people looking to engage in fun activities or access training courses.The skate park project has received support from Lochgilphead Community Council and from Mid Argyll members of Argyll and Bute Council.Betty Rhodick, Lochgilphead Community Council member on the A#Chruach wind farm fund , commented: #I am delighted to see things progressing.

I#d thought with it being near a pre-historic site they might say no, but he thought it sounded great. I was a bit taken aback. The forestry people were also up for it and all of a sudden it was all go,# said Gabi.Weather depending, it should take  days from start to finish. The first job is to clear brambles and other trip hazards before the lime washing can be applied.Dr Aaron Watson from Kilmartin Museum will be documenting the project.Gabi continued: #When I was researching what to white the stumps with I knew I wanted to use something traditional to Scotland that would not contaminate the place. Limewash is used to paint houses here. Then I discovered it creates crystals. Rockart was made using quartz # they would peck at rocks with it to make their marks. I liked the link. It was a good coincidence.#The shape will change depending on where it is seen from.

He stood frozen, watching it for more than  minutes.According to his statement: \"The craft came close enough for me to see that it was definitely metallic and had several points of dfused light on its underside, inside a darker coloured rim.\"It was only as the disc flew off at high speed that Macpherson felt able to raise his camera and take two photographs. He said: \"The crafts acceleration was phenomenal ndash by the time Id wound the film on between the two shots, it was a mere dot in the sky.\"By his own admission, Macpherson had no interest in the subject of UFOs.

We managed just one overnight stay in Glen Nevis.It has always been a favourite glen of mine.Its beauty challenges the majestic Glencoe, but its landscape is gentler and less rugged, and the upper reaches of the glen take you back in time, to the majesty of the ancient Caledonian forest.In the days when I was a tour guide, I always thought that mist and rain were an essential part of a trip to the Highlands.People would refer to hot and sunny weather as good weather, but Irsquod always say that in the Highlands mist and rain can be good weather too.On such days, the weather would add the veil of mystery and unpredictability that makes the landscape so intriguing.Hardly ever was the approach to Glencoe the same because of the weather it changes the landscape in ways the imagination could never predict.Swirling mists which dress the peaks, layers of low lying cloud which suddenly break to allow sparkling rays of sunshine itrsquos spine-tinglingly magical.On days of so called good weather, when the skies were a cloudless blue, I always felt there was something missing in the experience.I know all this might sound like patter from VisitScotland attempting to persuade rain drenched tourists that they are lucky to have experienced the true mystery of our country but for me it has always been true.Of course, days of endless pelting rain are no fun and can spoil a holiday, but for me, some mist and rain, in moderation, makes a Highland holiday all the more memorable.Such was our experience last weekend, with two days that seemed to be in dferent seasons.When we arrived we were lucky to be able to put up the tent just in time, before the rain got heavy.Itrsquos always an awkward moment for me putting up our tent in full view of other campers, as we struggle to remember which pole goes where and try not to look like we need assistance.It couldrsquove been easy to be despondent at the weather. Dark brooding clouds shrouded the sides of Ben Nevis, bringing rain that threatened to dampen everything but I refused to let it dampen our spirits.I recited the famous quote: ldquoIn Scotland there is no such thing as bad weather just bad clothing.We had a hearty camp stove meal and then set off for our walk in the Nevis Gorge.Itrsquos a well kent walk now, but when I was first taken many years ago before the internet it was a relatively unknown secret. I still remember the sense of awe as I heard the roar of the river below, and the sight of the distant waterfall An Steall as we emerged from the gorge.Our trick was to go on our walk when it was raining, and after teatime so we had the place almost to ourselves, well apart from the midges.Our midge repellent was gold dust, and Irsquove always found the trick in avoiding midges is to keep moving, which we did, except for once, and we momentarily paid the price.It was a walk in the childhood footsteps of my younger self, where my young children were re-pacing along the route also taken by their older siblings years ago.It was about saying ldquohere is a place important to me, part of who I am itrsquos yours now,you want it to be.Yet not saying it with words, but by making memories that I hope will last as long as mine have.The rain and mist was all part of it, and yes even the midges. As often happens, the weather began to clear as we headed back.The sun broke through and the clouds developed a sparkling yellow tint. The mountains appeared, like giants awoken and rising to their true height.Sunshine briefly warmed our faces and it seemed a gt from the gods for our endurance.The kids danced and sang the song ldquoI can see clearly now the rain has gone as they saw a rainbow.I knew the rain hadnrsquot really gone so we didnrsquot dally.We made it back to the car, tired with sore legs, but before the next dark cloud arrived.That evening we recounted our experiences in the tent, and I told stories about the Jacobites and the old Highland way of le, and the connection to the Battle of Prestonpans on our own doorstep.The kids listened, partly because we were camping and they had no screens, so no choice but Irsquod like to believe partly also because we were in a land where stories and legends are steeped in the soil and they now felt a small part of them.It lashed with rain all night. But its rage had ended by morning and the new day welcomed us with sunshine.New adventures beckoned, with other memories to impart, on what was to become our sunny day.Loch Oich, rich in family memory and where the ashes of both my parents were scattered.Then Loch Ness, a fitting end to a pilgrimage, especially for my monster daft wee boy, and his sisters who love the mystery of the story.Such was our short ldquostaycation this summer.Wersquod followed what I have always called The Road of Legends which is the title of my yet to be published novel, an abridged version of which will be serialised on this page very soon."},{"url":null,"title":"column-tourist-home-help-love-area","story":"I WAS on holiday a couple of weeks ago and on one of the days I went to the local amenity

Reduce light from the hall. Make sure there are no electronics sending out light e.g. a digital alarm clock with a lit display, sleep buttons on equipment etc.\"You may want to put black curtains at the window or wear an eye mask to limit the light getting into the eye.\"Sleep Scotland suggests wearing an eye maskOn the other end, you should also get lots of light in the morning to help you feel awake and alert.They added: \"Exposure to light at the right time helps keep the circadian clock on the correct time schedule.\"Make sure you open the curtains and turn on the lightsyou need to. Going for a walk is a great way to start the day.\"RoutineIt is only natural that during lockdown many of us have found that we have lost our routine and have been staying up later and lying in bed longer in the morning.Sleep Scotland said: \"Your body clock works best when you stick to a schedule.\"In an ideal world, yoursquoll go to sleep and wake up within a half hour of the same time each day, even on weekends.\"The routines of the day also give us powerful signals and demands that the body remain alert for certain tasks and events.\"Regular waking and bed times, alongside regular meal times are very important for regulating your body and its s.\"Sleep PressureSleep pressure is the term used to describe the feeling of tiredness we have, due to the activity we undertake through the day.Sleep Scotland say it is important to be active in order to make sure we create the sleep pressure and drowsiness that will help us to fall asleep.They argue that having a nap can relieve our sleep pressure, meaning we find it harder to fall asleep at bedtime.Take a tech breakNaturally during lockdown many of us have resorted to using screens to help keep us entertained,to work and to socialise with friends.And while most modern tech has a blue light filter, it does not filter all light.More importantly, the things you do online are usually things that stimulate your brain and make it harder to turn off when you get into bed.Therefore, Sleep Scotland say you should unplug from all screens at least an hour before bedtime.They added: \"In the hour before bed, ensure you focus on

Journalism, as Jon Lee Anderson says in his foreword, was his first and most enduring love. Reading this selection of  pieces, you canrsquot help but think that many nascent writers would benefit from an apprenticeship in a trade too often derided and underrated.When in  Maacuterquez won the Nobel Literature Prize he used part of the money he received to buy a magazine, Cambio, and relaunched it with a new set of editors and contributors, of whom he was one. Cambio didnrsquot survive but while it did its owner had a ball.What is clear from The Scandal of the Century is its authorrsquos relish for a form that requires its practitioners to be multi-talented and endlessly adaptable. The best journalists ndash and on this evidence Maacuterquez fully merits his place at the table ndash are insatiably curious and find everything fascinating, from the earth-shattering to the seemingly banal. He was a huge fan of Hemingway, who also wrote for newspapers before turning to fiction. Once upon a time in Paris, Maacuterquez spotted his hero on Bouled Saint-Michel. What should he do  Don his literary beret and express his ldquounconditional admiration or try to interview him as any self-respecting hack would  What he did was cup his hands and, ldquolike Tarzan in the jungle, bellow from one side of the street to the other, ldquoMaeeeeestro! Hemingway responded: ldquoAdioacuteoacuteoacuteoacutes, amigo.Though born in Colombia, Maacuterquez spent a good part of his le as a roving reporter in Austria, France and Italy. In From Paris, With Love, he recalls arriving in  and seeing people kissing everywhere in contrast to Bogotaacute ldquowhere it was even dficult to kiss in bedrooms. It was the time of the Algerian War, when it was the norm for anyone who ldquodidnrsquot have a Christian face to be slung into jail. The police thought he was Algerian even though he looked like ldquoa door-to-door salesman. It was, he writes ruefully, the only revolution for which he was ever imprisoned.While his career as a novelist burgeoned and critical and commercial success beckoned, Maacuterquez never forsook journalism and was forthright in denouncing General Pinochet in Chile and in his support of Fidel Castro. He was deeply critical of the US blockade of Cuba and consequently mocked as an idiot savant by hawkish Republicans. In The Cubans Face the Blockade, he reports on the effect the embargo had on the population. Even clothes were rationed. At first nine items were rationed which was upped to  within a year. Toys were next. But there was an upside: that Christmas was the first in the history of Cuba when every child received a toy.The eponymous piece recounts the story of how the mysterious death in  of a young Italian woman sparked a scandal that reached deep into Italian society and showed a more sordid side to La Dolce Vita. It runs to some  pages and Maacuterquez spins it like a thriller, artfully reminding less attentive readers to pay attention to salient facts.Several of the pieces relate to writing. All are required reading. In Misadventures of a Writer of Books, he refers to his occupation as ldquosuicidal. Most readers, he suggests, have no idea of the effort and anguish that goes into producing a book and the meagre reward their creators receive. He estimates that a good writer needs at least two years and , cigarettes to produce a book of  pages. So why write  ldquoYoursquore a writer in the very same way you might be Jewish or black."},{"url":null,"title":"blackness-isnt-monolith","story":"TELEVISION has the power to spark nationwide discussion about poignant ndash and often, uncomfortable ndash topics.

It looks at how dad Oliver responds when he catches his teenage daughter Justina sneaking out of the house to attend a Black Lives Matter march.Meanwhile, Lavender focuses on an uncomfortable conversation new mother Jordanhas with her white mother Lyndseyafter giving birth to a baby with a black man.Lastly, Look At Me ndash from playwright and director Lynette Linton ndash follows a couple called Michael and Kay, played by Paapa Essiedu, who has recently been seen in the amazing I May Destroy You, and Pippa Bennett-Warner, who youll recognise from Gangs of London .The drama shows the young professionals being stopped by the police while on the way to a date, and the impact that has.PERSONAL PROJECTS\"Blackness isnt a monolith, and its really important to have loads of dferent stories,\" says Lecky, when discussing the aim of her film.\"Having a mixed-race black woman during this climate, who has white family members and finds it dficult talking about race, and still feels all the hurt and the pain of whats going on, I think its a story thats really needed. And to be cast in it too means Im able to do what I actually want to say with this piece.\"Meanwhile, Ssemuyaba wanted to show ndash through her characters who first met as children, and are now in their late twenties early thirties ndash how the way we talk about race has changed.\"In the past, I dont see colour was seen as a very progressive thought, whereas I think now everyone understands that thats not the point.\"I am a black personyou dont see colour, that means you dont see the microaggressions and the macroaggressions and you also dont see the way the world treats me dferently from people of other races.\"As for Bucchan-Nelson, who has worked in TV for a long time, and has \"often been the only black person in the room\", he felt that \"there is a perception that all black people feel the same way about most things.\"And so even with the Black Lives Matter movement, I wanted to kick off my film with two black people disagreeing on the validity of the movement,\" he explains.\"Just to shock people into sitting up and understanding that there are conversations and dferences of opinions within this community, just like every other community.\"COMPLEX FEELINGSAll the writers confide putting their stories out there has been an emotional process ndash and a surprising one too.\"This is what I love about being a writer: sometimes you dont know that you have something to say until youre given the opportunity to say something,\" reflects Lecky.\"It kind of just came out of me, really.\"\"For me, the politics of my writing is usually the subtext I Trojan horse it into a bigger and glossier story,\" follows Ssemuyaba.\"And so to do something where its very much in the foreground, it is the text, was quite emotional, but also quite daunting, because youre laying yourself out there and dealing with quite sensitive and nuanced topics so I wanted to make sure I was getting it right.\"Bucchan-Nelson, who has worked on Sky One drama Bulletproof, opens up about how researching the Black Lives Matter movement for his script had an impact on him emotionally.\"Having to pull on the real-le trauma that has inspired this is not fun,\" he elaborates candidly.\"Its really taxing to constantly read about people in the world who undervalue my le.\"But I guess the reward is getting to write something that hopefully, in some small way, works towards correcting that.\"HOPEFUL FUTUREThere seems to be more and more conversations surrounding ersity in the TV industry, but have the writers noticed a sht yet \"Id say Ive noticed a frenzy rather than a sht!\" responds Ssemuyaba. \"You just want the same level of respect and treatment as white writers.\"Were still in the midst of whats going on and Ill be excited and intrigued to see whats happening.\"\"Yeah, Ive noted something, but I think its too soon to say whether its a change,\" muses Bucchan-Nelson, before adding: \"I am encouraged by the conversations.\"There are certain people Ive worked with for a very long time, where weve never spoken about race, it just hasnt come up, and weve just worked together and weve got along, and they have gone out of their way to call, to ask me questions about my experience of working with them and how can it be better...\"I can only see it as a good thing, really.

Exams having been cancelled, thanks to the pandemic, Scottish school teachers were given the delicate task of imagining what their charges might have achieved had the tests taken place. Teachers in some of the most deprived areas gave what could only be called optimistic estimates of their students likely attainment in the Highers ndash about % higher than in previous years.The Scottish Qualications Authority, SQA, which is supposed to ensure fair play in assessment, took one look at this unprecedented grade inflation and said: Youre not on. Schools were estimating examination success wildly out of step with their own recent performance.:Iain Macwhirter: Heres how a New Union could keep us living apart togetherSo the SQA moderators took an axe to the results to make them look a bit more credible. The results in the poorer postcodes went down by %, which still left grades inflated over previous years. In the more affluent schools, where estimated grades were around % above par, they adjusted scores by %.Thats an oversimplication, but in a sense it doesnt matter. What it looked like was the SQA brutally crushing the hopes and dreams of poor students while only marginally reducing the scores of pupils in the posher colleges.Assessment by algorithm is always going to be a poor fit with reality. So, Shaun did well in his prelims, but he might have coasted the rest of the year whereas Siobhan got such a shock that she worked her derriere off for the next six months. Why are they both being cut down I mean, arent teachers themselves the best judge of performance  Why didnt the SQA just suck it up, accept that this was an exceptional year and that Covid  engendered a study revolution in less advantaged neighbourhoods.:Iain Macwhirter: Sturgeon should bring Salmond in from the cold ndash hersquos just too dangerousThats what the educational experts on Twitter argued, including the outspoken educational pundit, James McEnany. They complained that most of the , pupils who had their futures stolen were from working class neighbourhoods and that this confirmed education is biased to the rich.The consultant, Sir Keir Bloomer, who helped devise the Curriculum for Excellence, disagreed insisting that the adjustment process was ldquojustied and necessary. And the First Minister agreed. She said bluntly that the estimates submitted by teachers were simply ldquonot credible. Accepting grade inflation on that scale would bring the entire standardised assessment into disrepute.This was Nicola Sturgeon trying to be wise before the event. Sure, the estimates were doing wonders for the attainment gap. She couldve gone into the May Holyrood elections saying that she had delivered the greatest narrowing of the educational class gap in history. But the First Minister is much too canny.Students who narrowly failed last year would be furious for a start. The very people now berating her for crushing the hopes and dreams of the less well off would be attacking her for undermining the credibility of Scottish education. Ms Sturgeon would have been accused of closing the attainment gap by fraud.The More or Less programme on BBC Radio would be calling it the most shocking misuse of statistics since the UK government claimed that it was conducting , Covid  tests a day, when all it was doing was sending out kits.But the ldquoclassist accusations wont go away. A hundred or so young people gathered in George Square holding banners saying ldquoTrust our Teachers and ldquoI am not my postcode. Sturgeon is being called the ldquograde snatcher, echoing the claim that Mrs Thatcher was the ldquomilk snatcher.Part of the problem is that the SQA seems incapable of giving a coherent and convincing explanation of its methodology. Tens of thousands of appeals are expected against what parents regard as an arbitrary and unfair process that took no account of real pupil attainment.The Deputy First Minister, John Swinney, is in for a torrid time. Indeed, he has been having a torrid time for as long as I can remember. There has been persistent grumbling about the Curriculum for Excellence which seems anything but. The PISA international performance scores have gone south. Standardised testing of primary one children led to accusations of child abuse. Progress on the attainment gap has been glacially slow.Mr Swinney held out against the teachers % pay demand just long enough for teachers to threaten a strike, at which point he gave in and awarded them an eye-popping .% over three years. Nice work.Last month, parents across Scotland revolted at pandemic plans to give children as little as one day a week of ldquoblended learning. That forced an embarrassing U-turn as Mr Swinney promised full-time, full-fat education from this month onwards.:Iain Macwhirter: Does Nicola Sturgeon still want independence  Some in the SNP arent so sureBut the Educational Institute for Scotland says that only a fth of their members are confident itrsquos safe to reopen the schools. Its still not clear what is going to happen this week. Will teachers turn up  Will parents send their children We appear to be seeing,not the second wave of Covid, then the long tail of the first wave. Lockdown is in the air again. Its conceivable that children couldto school just long enough to exchange infections before being sent home again.Its not Mr Swinneys fault of course. This is a pandemic after all. Teachers unions have the Scottish Government over a barrel ndash and they know it. Parents are incensed as only parents can be when they feel their offspring are being treated unfairly.But it might be time to put poor John Swinney out of his misery. The Deputy First Minister has been a sterling defender of the First Minister, the ultimate safe pair of hands. But those hands arent looking so safe any more. He is beginning to look like a work horse that has taken more beating than it can stand.A fresh face,such a thing exists in the  year old Scottish Government, in charge of the education brief might help get the government over this hurdle. In the last SQA exams crisis in  the then Labour education minister, Sam Galbraith, had to step down after being mauled by, er, one Nicola Sturgeon.The SNP is streets ahead in the polls and that is unlikely to change any time soon, given the dire state of the opposition parties in Scotland. But there are a lot more parents in Scotland than there are teachers. It would only take a few thousand parental votes to go astray in May to deprive Nicola Sturgeon of that absolute majority she needs for an independence referendum.This is a full scale crisis, possibly Nicola Sturgeons worst yet. Young people are up in arms. The teaching profession is in a state of perennial discontent. The very credibility of standardised assessment may be in doubt.

The turmoil caused to so many by the SQArsquos downgrading fiasco has been a nightmare for all the young people affected. I welcome the First Ministerrsquos admission that the Scottish Government ldquogot it wrong and her commitment to putting it right.While I hope that John Swinneyrsquos statement to Parliament today will begin to recty the mistakes made by the SQArsquos inadequate and unfair grading system, I believe the best way to do that is by reversing all downgrades.Tomorrow it will be the turn of Fiona Robertson, Chief Executive of SQA, to explain to the Scottish Parliamentrsquos Education Committee what went so catastrophically wrong with the pupilsrsquo assessments, which replaced this yearrsquos exams.As Professor Lindsay Paterson of Edinburgh University has pointed out, the grading system has failed the three key tests of fairness, integrity and safety. He points out that the assessments ldquoare about the school rather than the inidual pupil. It meansyou are an outstanding pupil in a poorer attaining school, you will have had your result dragged down. Andyou are an average student in a good performing school, it is likely you have benefited.In all exam categories, youngsters living in the  per cent most deprived areas were nearly two and a half times more likely to have their results downgraded than those in the more affluent areas. This is completely unacceptable.With the threat of cancellation still a possibility for next yearrsquos exams, we must ensure that what happened this year, never happens again. Lessons must be learned and learned fast.One of the factors which appeared to influence the extent to which teachersrsquo recommendations for inidual pupils were downgraded was to ensure that the overall increase in pass rates since last year didnrsquot undermine the credibility of the system.Tragically, there is little doubt that the scale and flawed rationale of the SQArsquos downgrading exercise has done far more damage to the credibility of the system than an inflated increase in the annual, overall pass rate would have done.The SQA chief executive has many questions to answer:Why was a grading system devised under a veil of secrecy  Why were warnings from the Education Committee that such a process risked the credibility of the entire exercise ignored  Why was the grading system biased against schools in deprived neighbourhoods, thus undermining the Scottish Governmentrsquos number one aim of reducing the attainment gap Depending on what John Swinney announces today, there may still be questions to ask about how any outstanding downgrade issues are to be dealt with, the details of the appeals systemone is still needed and whether it will genuinely recty all the injustices caused by the downgrading fiasco. Will there be independent supervision of any appeals process Will the SQA guarantee that the appeals system wonrsquot be articially manipulated to keep the overall pass rate below a certain level and that the appeals will be based solely on the performance of inidual pupils As distraught parents and pupils wait anxiously to hear what is going to happen next, we need assurances from the SQA, that they will do everything in their power to bring some much-needed fairness and justice to the young people affected by this whole episode along with an assurance that this will never happen again.Alex Neil is SNP MSP for Airdrie and Shotts"},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/11681524.jpg?type=article-full","title":"nicola-sturgeon-im-sorry-exams-fiasco","story":"ldquoWe did not get this right and Irsquom sorry for that, the First Minister said, striking a very dferent note from last week, when she defended the results.She said then thatthe Scottish Qualications Authority had not ldquomoderated teacher estimates used instead of exams because of Covid, the jump in grades would be ldquonot credible.Camleys Cartoon: U-turn on exams fiasco.She also encouraged pupils to appeal against grades they felt were unfair.However after a nationwide backlash at more than , grades being marked down, and with her deputy facing a no confidence vote, Ms Sturgeon dramatically changed tack.Hinting that the appeal system originallyplanned was now being ditched, she told the daily briefing that every young person would now get a grade that reflected thework they had done, and not all would need to appeal.But she stressed no young person would see their grades lowered from those received last week.She said: ldquoWe will not expect every student who has been downgraded to appeal. This situation is not the fault of students, so it should not be on students to fix it. Thatrsquos on us.She also said she still had confidence in her education secretary John Swinney, who will now be in charge of fixing the mess.After the SQA botched exam results in , the then Labour education minister was moved to a new job.Ms Sturgeon said: ldquoIn a very dficult and unprecedented situation, we took decisions that we thought on balance were the right ones, and we took them with the very best of intentions.ldquoThese were broadly the same decisions that have been reached for England and Wales as well.ldquoBut our concern, which was to make sure the grades young people got were as valid as those they would have got in any other year, perhaps led us to think too much about the overall system, and not enough about the inidual pupil.ldquoThat has meant that too many students feel that they have lost out on grades that they should have had, and also that that has happened as a result, not of anything theyrsquove done, but because of a statistical model or an algorithm.ldquoAnd in a addition that burden has not fallen equally across our society.ldquoSo despite our best intentions, I do acknowledge that we did not get this right and Irsquom sorry for that.ldquoBut instead of doing what politicians sometimes doo and dig our heels in, we are determined to acknowledge that and put it right.Ms Sturgeon went on: ldquoThere are deeper questions we will need to resolve for the longer term, about the impact of exams on the attainment gap and the dference between exams and teacher judgement.ldquoBut the most immediate challenge is to resolve the grades awarded to pupils this year.ldquoWe will not expect every student who has been downgraded to appeal.ldquoThis situation is not the fault of students, so it should not be on students to fix it.\"Thatrsquos on us. And we will set out tomorrow exactly how we intend to do that.Last year, the national attainment rates at A to C for National , Higher and Advanced Higher were . per cent, .% and .% respectively.But when teachers estimated the grades for their pupils after exams were cancelled because of the lockdown, the rates jumped by .,  and . percentage points respectively.The SQA then looked at past yearrsquos data, including inidual school data, to reduce the pass rates to what it considered more realistic - .%, .% and .% respectively.As the overestimation was greatest in schools in deprived areas, the subsequent reductions were also greatest for those schools, leading to claims poor pupils were being treated unfairly and marked down because of their schoolrsquos track record, not their own efforts.In the question and answer session at the daily briefing, Ms Sturgeon said the governments priority was to \"recty\" the SQA situation, and backed Mr Swinney, despite him approving the SQA approach that has now falllen apart.\"I accept that we did not get this right, therefore the onus will be on the government to fix this.\"She added: \"I dont attach any blame to the SQA for this. This is ministers responsibility.\"She said she understood many pupils would think it \"deepy unfair\" that they were being graded by an algorithm.She said: \"Im not prepared this years cohort of pupils, particurlarly those from the most deprived communities, to think that their hard word does not countthe system is determined to be against them.\"Ms Sturgeon said had done \"a lot of soul-searching and a lot of listening to young people\".Teacher estimates which would have seen a Higher pass rate of % among young people from the most deprived backgrounds, compared to around % last year.Last week, Ms Sturgeon said that% increase in a single year was\"unprecedented and thereforenotcredible\"Asked about this following the announcement of a rethink, she said: \"I didnt say teacher assessments are not credible.\"I said an overall outcome that led to a -point increase in the pass rates -and when I used those numbers last week I was talking about the bottom % in terms of deprivation -that I didnt think that outcome would be seen as credible.\"She added: \"What Im saying now is I think, whatever the view of that is, in my mind now a bigger problem is leaving an impression with young people that it doesnt matter how hard you work at school, some algorithm is going to get in your way.\"Im not prepared to have that, and that is why we will set out the alternative approach...tomorrow.\"Shortly before Ms Sturgeon spoke, Labour published the text of its no confidence motion.It urged MSPs to record their lack of faith in Mr Swinney ldquoin light of his mismanagement of schools education and in particular of this yearrsquos awarding of grades to Scotlandrsquos school pupils and the unfairness of the system applied by the SQA.Scottish Labour education spokesperson Iain Gray said: ldquoJohn Swinney has presided over the greatest scandal in education in Scotland for decades and for five days refused to acknowledge any failure.

For months he was warned repeatedly to turn back before it was too late. There was another way and he rejected it.ldquoWe need a solution to this chaos, and we need to hear a compelling case for why John Swinney should be the one to carry this out.ldquoIf the Education Secretary had listened to teachers and experts and acted earlier, thousands of young people would not have been put through a system that denied pupils equal opportunities and reinforced inequalities.\""},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus-scotland-five-things-take-away-daily-briefing","story":"Speaking at her daily briefing in Edinburgh, the First Minister also addressed the Aberdeen lockdown, the number of Covid- cases in Scotland, the countryrsquos schools reopening and Transport Scotlandrsquos Travel Safe campaign.Here are five things to take away from todayrsquos briefing::Nicola Sturgeon: Im sorry for exams fiascoSQA Exams ApologyThe First Minister apologised for the SQA exam results and said that the Scottish Government will ensure that every young person gets a grade that recognises the work they have done.She said: ldquoLet me be clear about this - in a very dficult and unprecedented situation, we took decisions that we thought, on balance, were the right ones, and we took them with the very best of intentions.Nicola Sturgeon added: ldquoOur concern ndash which was to make sure that the grades young people got, were as valid as those they would have got in any other year - perhaps led us to think too much about the overall system and not enough about the inidual pupil.ldquoAnd that has meant that too many students feel that they have lost out on grades they should have had - and also that has happened as a result, not of anything theyrsquove done, but because of a statistical model or an algorithm.

The idea of a \"postcode lotteryrsquo is now firmly embedded.Reporters, researchers, politicians, and placards have all repeated ious versions of Ruth Davidsonrsquos claims in the Mail on Sunday that ldquothe most disadvantaged pupils were more than twice as likely to have their grades lowered than wealthier students. It has become such an article of faith for so many that it is incredible to realise that it all stems from a basic statistical misunderstanding of a single set of tables.The only data thus far available to compare estimates and moderated results by relative social deprivation, are  tables in the SQArsquos Equality Impact Assessment. These tables comparethe percentages that would have achieved a C-grade of betterthe estimates had been accepted with the equivalent percentages after moderation was applied.It is true that they show that the percentage achieving Grades A-C was reduced by a greater amount for pupils from areas of higher deprivation. The obvious interpretation is that such pupils must have been more likely to have had estimates downgraded. Simple conclusions from statistics are often misleading.The tables tell us nothing about estimated As or Bs being downgraded to Bs and Cs and so provide no basis to conclude whether any group has been more likely to be downgraded.Intuitively, the most likely phenomenon shown by this data is that the more deprived groups were likely to have included a larger number of estimated borderline passes. If all groups are then treated equally they end up with more such passes downgraded but not because of unequal treatment.For the statistically minded: imagine twp frequency distributions with dferent means and a pass mark to the left of those means. Now move them both left by the same amount. Yoursquoll get tables very similar to those published by the SQA.That of course is no consolation to the pupils who have narrowly missed a C grade, but what about the situation at other grades  Although the SQA has not published such statistics, it is likely that the situation is reversed at Grade A. Intuitively, because of the higher number of A estimates to begin with in less deprived areas. Or, for the maths geeks, repeat the thought experiment but with a higher cut-off point to the right of the mean. It seems very likely that the number of estimated As downgraded will have been higher for more affluent areas ndash this is just the reverse effect of what happens at Grade C.If, as is starting to seem likely, the grades awarded are revised to match the estimates, the most striking feature might be the large number of extra A grades for rich kids. Such are the unintended consequences of basing policy on a simplistic analysis of data.That nobody seems to have noticed this is perhaps the truest indictment of our education system.Andrew Morrison, Dunfermline.IN the past twenty years there has never been a release of school examination results that met with universal acceptance. It will never happen. It cannot happen. Politics demands it so.Previously, any cohort of students in any subject, which had two or three per cent increases yearly, would be criticised as showing subject matter being \"dumbed down\". Conversely,two or three per cent reductions are recorded yearly, then criticism is voiced that exams are being set too dficult. If subject results are static, then the complaint is that progress is not being made.The usual subjects ndash CfE badly designed poorly implemented, teachers pay too low and staff over-stressed, classroom assistants under resourced and the like ndash have all been eclipsed this year by the Covid  pandemic.The option of having no results awarded this year would never have flown.The assessing by teachers resulted in high over-estimates and the SQA algorithm model is the outcome.A wonderful coalition has now come together through Ian Gray, Donald Ross, Willie Rennie and Jamie Green united in favour of taking teachers assessments at face value and removing any SQA equalisation to past pass levels. .Just how does this now work With pass marks this year raised % on last year, come   in months time, are we to see every student in every exam receive a top grade  Why bother with examinations  Alternatively, next year sees a huge fall in pass marks to equalise this years leap The total number of places at Scottish universities and colleges will never equal the number of secondary schools passes. Therefore evenevery student received A graded passes there will still be an entry sting process and disappointment is now moved from the school pass stage to the tertiary selection stage.Every possible solution offered in this matter will fail some faction in society.Robert Wolfenden, Biggar.THE calls for John Swinney to resign are ludicrous. We have to recognise that teacher estimates are far from infallible. I once predicted a D for a pupil and in the exam he scored A ndash although my other predictions were broadly consistent.A moderation process was essential, since the average prediction was  per cent better than typical of former years exam results. To have allowed the predictions to stand unmoderated would have been unfair to pupils of previous years.If ire is to be directed anywhere it should be towards the school, or even the inidual teacher, whose predictions in previous years had been seen to be consistently over-optimistic. With due consideration at appeal, we would hope that cases of genuine underperformence will be recognised and rectied.James McKelvie, Carmunnock.NOW that the SQA has developed a robust algorithm to adjust results down, it can be used regularly in the future to adjust for deprivation by increasing grades. This would have the effect of allowing for inequality, encouraging effort, boosting self-confidence, and achieving the policy goal of reducing the attainment gap. Win, win and unarguable logic given the current detriment logic.Bob MacKinnon, Inverness.IS there room for an alternative view of the importance of examinations and education in these stressful times Writing as someone who left school with a couple of dodgy Highers, I can tell young people who have been disappointed in their results that this is not the end of the world or even the road, its only the beginning. Having sought employment in an occupation which genuinely excited me, I was interviewed by some \"suits\" in London. The interview ended in a bit of a barney between one of the interviewers and my rather bolshie self about politics . I left the interview room thinking \"Oh well, Ill just have to think of something .\"I was rather surprised therefore to be accepted on to a training course against some quite stf competition, and which led to a long and interesting career. It turned out that they were looking for bolshie young people who would stand up for themselves.However, that was only the beginning of my education. I eventually graduated with honours in History with Frenchfrom the Open University, at the age of . As most people of my age will tell you, education is a le-long experience, both for good and ill. I spend more time reading and learning now than I ever have before.My message to young folk at thiscrucial time in their lives is: believe in yourself stand up for yourself argue your point with anyone who will engage and just make friends with those who wont above all keep learning from every experience you encounter and dont worryyou fail from time to time.John Jamieson, Ayr.WHILE I agree that the disruption to young peoples education has a massive effect, I would say that a positive outlook has to be kept. I did not have the opportunity to go to university, but I have always read widely, and I educated myself.

Little did he know the idea of sourcing surplus food in March would have such an impact and demand.ldquoThe paradox of food insecurity and food waste in Scotland, the UK and worldwide is a shame on ourselves as a society but also our governments, said Mr MacLachlan. ldquoWe are all guilty of ignoring the bag of carrots that has one that looks a bit lsquopast itrsquo.\"Itrsquos understandable, but by all doing that, wersquove condemned that kilo of carrots to landfill, undermined the value of the farmer and land that produced them, reduced the worth of the shop staff and, quite often, with household food waste, will not use the full bag before they spoil at home.ldquoAt Empty Kitchens, Full Hearts, wersquove created a system that takes the literal tonnes of food going to waste, gives it to chefs who need to keep busy and connected with friends and their passion, and deliver to and feed  people three meals a day seven days a week for free.\"Wersquove done this from nothing and so when politicians ask how they can help us all I can really ask is lsquomake the need for Empty Kitchens, Full Hearts a thing of the past. Make services like ours redundant.Read more: VE Day : We still had a job to get on with says navy veteran on his memories of hearing the war was overThe project saw rapid growth during lockdown and as we ease out of lockdown some other similar projects are winding down. However, in the last month alone Empty Kitchen Full Hearts has taken on more than  new clients who had been helped by other services.Volunteer Hatty Webster found out about the project through social media and offered her services after being furloughed.ldquoIt was the middle of May when I was furloughed and I knew I couldnrsquot just sit about and that I would need something to do, said Ms Webster. ldquoI found the group online and signed up and was happy to get involved. However, it is sad that in Edinburgh in  there is a need for this at all. We donrsquot means test and feel there is a matter of dignity for anyone facing food insecurity. Anyone of us could find ourselves in this situation given what has happened to people and their livelihoods in lockdown.ldquoWe have delivered to people who are vulnerable or shielding and the response and feedback from people has been great.ldquoWe have food packs with breakfast, lunch, and dinner and ones for kids as well. People have also enjoyed coming to our base for the daily meals as it has given them a chance to speak to people as well.ldquoThere is very much a need for what we are doing and I hope we can be around for as long as there is a need. The volunteers have all got stuck in from helping in the kitchen, packing, serving and delivering. Although we would love to hear from any volunteer drivers as we are in need of help there.And while other lockdown services are closing or reducing their operations, Empty Kitchens, Full Hearts has launched its second fundraiser since it opened.Just yesterday they delivered  food day packs, which contain healthy meals from what volunteer chefs have been able to create with donations they have received, across Edinburgh.Ms Webster added: \"The need for our services continues to expand which is why we have had to start a second Crowdfunder. pound will feed a family of four for a day. pound will feed a family of four for two weeks and one day. We are absorbing clients from other organisations who are referring people to us now and our client list has grown to .\"\"We run two shts a day sothere are any chefs out there who can help, we would love to hear from them as sadly there doesnt seem to be an end in sight for us yet.\"Peter Kelly, Director of Poverty Alliance said even before Covid- hit, one in five people in Scotland were living in poverty, but the crisis has pulled increasing numbers of people into destitution.Mr Kelly said: ldquoThe latest figures show there was a  per cent increase in the number of people applying for Scottish Welfare Fund crisis grants in May compared to the same period last year. Local authorities and the Scottish Government must make sure the Scottish Welfare Fund is accessible and well promoted so that people arenrsquot forced to rely on emergency food supplies.ldquoIn a decent society, everyonersquos income should provide them with enough to live on.

Thankfully, the North Highlands are reassuringly unchanged and offers the ultimate natural remedy to modern le.ldquoGetting off the beaten track and taking time to explore the regions of the north Highlands by land, river and sea will help us all take care of our wellbeing.ldquoWhether walking, hiking, swimming, appreciating our history and heritage or getting a taste for our world-renowned Highland food and drink, we must all be mindful of the environmental impact on this fragile landscape.David Whiteford, chair of the North Highland Initiative, said: ldquoLe often moves at a slower pace here in the most northerly counties of Scotland.ldquoThis does not, of course, mean that opportunities for business growth and development are reduced ndash quite the opposite.ldquoHowever, this slower pace of le is one of the biggest draws for first-time visitors travelling not only to drive the North Coast , but to explore the North Highland region as a whole.ldquoWhile we donrsquot want to discourage visitors from completing the NC route in its entirety, our lsquoHighland Timersquo campaign encourages more in-depth exploration of each of the five counties which make up the North

Access to a nutritious school meal has never been more important for childrenrsquos health. Even before the pandemic struck, the latest figures on childhood obesity revealed that almost a quarter of Primary  pupils in Scotland were starting school at risk of overweight or obesity, with the proportion of schoolchildren at risk growing in the most deprived areas.The picture has darkened since March. Five million children in the UK are now living in households that are food insecure. Over half of children who would have received free school meals are reportedly eating no vegetables, while just under half are eating no fruit. Meanwhile, the Trussell Trust reported an unprecedented  per cent rise in food parcels given to children in April .The UK Government has announced its intention to launch a new anti-obesity drive, while the first independent review of UK food policy in almost  years has just published its initial recommendations for a National Food Strategy for England. But there are some measures ndash like serving healthy food in our schools ndash that we already know work.Nearly , children attend Scotlandrsquos schools. For some of them, the school lunch is the only hot meal they will receive all day. Only % of packed lunches meet the nutritional standards that apply to school food, but a meal thatrsquos freshly prepared from unprocessed ingredients, low in additives, sugars, fats, and salt, and high in seasonal fruit and vegetables ndash like the majority of meals on a Food For Le Served Here menu ndash is an opportunity to make a real impact in fostering good health. Right now, itrsquos not one we can afford to miss.But school lunches arenrsquot just calories on a plate. Investing in sourcing and serving fresh, local, and sustainable food has knock on benefits for jobs and the environment. Prioritising meals that are made from scratch in the kitchen protects the jobs of the unsung heroes of childrenrsquos nutrition: the skilled frontline catering staff working in our schools.Whatrsquos more,councils take the opportunity to source produce from local food suppliers, school meals can play a role in supporting the local economy too. In an average year, Scotlandrsquos public sector spends almost pound million on food and drink. Now more than ever, that public money should be spent in a way that supports local food businesses.Many local authorities ndash such as the  Scottish councils that hold our Food For Le Served Here award for their school meals ndash are already making great strides in supporting local businesses. Like everyone , their service was badly disrupted by lockdown. But those who have prioritised sourcing local produce for their meals and food boxes are clear about the benefits it brings.Argyll and Bute Council included locally made bread rolls in their food boxes, which meant the bakery was able to bring a worker back from furlough. And the delighted messages and phone calls that the council received when it included Scottish strawberries and cream in the boxes showed how highly people valued fresh, local produce.Jayne Jones, commercial manager at Argyll and Bute Council and chairwoman of ASSIST FM, recently told a meeting of Scotlandrsquos local authority Food For Le Served Here award holders that the council is committed to its ldquogood food first approach as the schools go back. The operational challenges canrsquot be underestimated, but the effort that has gone into making lunchtime safe is more than worth it.A poll showed three-quarters of people living in Scotland want to see measures that prioritise a green recovery from the pandemic. We need to build on this appetite for change. In putting good food on the table in our schools, the public sector has the power and skills not only to protect childrenrsquos health, but to help Scotland to build back better from this crisis.Sarah Duley is Head of Food at Soil Association Scotland."},{"url":null,"title":"glasgow-potato-day-leads-love-allotment-life","story":"And here we are at the eighth annual potato day in Glasgow, perusing the spuds, checking out the ieties on offer. My ego draws me each year to the Catriona iety. We are a strong grower with high yield, blue and oval with a light yellow flesh and excellent flavour.There are no Catrionas this year and I am popped. It is February and, unruffled about the news of some virus from somewhere , we merrily eye the seed potatoes, pick up some shallots and some onion ieties for the allotment. At the seed swap table packets are switched with some excitement. Its not my allotment, its the allotment of the potatoes-are-treasure pal, but I love potato day because I love time in the company of people who have passion for not obviously passionate things.There is a tatty bash - a competition to chit and grow a potato in a bucket. The heaviest yield wins. I love to win so pay my donation and take my bucket.At home I pop my new friend in an egg box and stick her in a corner of the kitchen. Then work becomes very busy because suddenly everyone is very ruffled about a virus from somewhere  that is now here.By late March we are locked down and I am looking for things to do at home that arent Netflix or housework.I remember the, by now, lumpen alien thing in the corner of the kitchen. Green little sprouts have formed from the smooth surface of the misshapen brown egg and I decide to plant her in the bucket and see what comes next.Having lived my le in flats, my grandmothers garden was really the only chance I had to see how things were grown and tended. She had a rhubarb patch in the back garden and rose bushes in the front. There was always mint growing and she took great pride in the lilac trees that lined the back fence.I regularly drive past my grans house and was livid recently to see that the new owners have chopped down the lilacs, decades of care thoughtlessly felled.In my flat, now, I have three pot plants but a potato was uncharted territory. Very rapidly a pointy green nose began to poke from the top of the soil. My morning routine now revolved around a peek into the bucket to see what was happening next. A morning cuppa became a pot so there was enough to share with Tater.And yes, I know the tea thing is an old wives tale but those of us living alone in lockdown must take our comforts where we can.The speed at which Tater shot forth from the soil was quite something, I could almost see her growing.Unassuming, an under appreciated staple, the potato alleviated famine in Europe, changed the course of modern agriculture and is credited for the rise of the west. Impressed by their blossoms, Marie Antoinette is said to have worn them in her hair while Louis XVI threaded them through his buttonhole.I have eaten potatoes in the Andes mountains in Peru, where the tuber originated. I have driven over the Hoover Dam in an Idaho plate vehicle displaying the state motto: Famous Potatoes. I have eaten a potato cooked in a h#ng# in New Zealand.Yet here in a bucket in my living room is my favourite spud so far.Im worried Tater isnt getting enough sunlight but Im also afraid someone might interfereI leave her outside unattended. With heart heavy at the loss of our shared morning cuppa, I take the bucket and the fast growing contents to the allotment where the fresh air and sunshine sends her star-shaped leaves shooting into a constellation of dense green.Of course, being regularly at the allotment, it would be rude not to make myself useful. Suddenly Im weeding, planting runner beans and onions, tucking zucchini plants into compost.I am itching each day to get to the plot to see how my garlic cloves are growing and check on Tater. Truly you never know where le will lead you.Its amazing to me that no one has invented see through soil. This is torture, knowing all the good stuff is happening underground and we cant see it. Whats in the bucket  How many tubers are down there This must be what pregnancy is like: some outward signs of new le flourishing but all the best bits happening out of sight.Finally Taters leaves are turning yellow and her stalks spilling over the edge of the bucket. It is her time.\"Its like digging for buried treasure,\" I say as I wriggle the soil around. Well. My careful ministrations have resulted in... are you ready...  potatoes.I send a photograph to my friend. \"Very impressive,\" he replies, \"Not award winning but very good.\" Not award winning  I have an absorbing new hobby and its edible.

Pamela Walker, NHSO ambulatory care manager has explained that services are gradually being remobilised, with the situation ing to normal, but there are limitations on the number of patients who could be operated on every day due to the additional COVID- restrictions. “We can now do four general anaesthetics every day ,# she said. #However, patients needing local anaesthetics are being fitted in around the general anaesthetics and this is reducing the number of those still waiting for a procedure increasing the number of procedures being safely undertaken.”The theatre Day Unit teams are also limited to doing surgeries linked to one discipline a day as space in the Day Unit is reduced from ten to six trolleys. This is because some of the space normally used for theatre Day Unit has been given over to the COVID ventilation unit which, is to remain in place for the foreseeable future.“But we are working through the lists and we are confident that all those waiting will be attended to,” Ms Walker added. “While some people might feel we have forgotten about them, this is not the case. The impact of COVID means there have been long delays.”Senior charge nurse, Diane Gray, said those coming for a general anaesthetic had to have a COVID test  days before their surgery, then shield with everyone in their household for  days, then have another COVID test the day before their operation.“We understand that not everyone wants to or can do this,# she said.#If a patient is waiting for elective surgery but they don’t want to shield for two weeks, they can let us know and we will contact them again when the guidance changes. It is important for them to know that they will not be prejudiced or moved to the bottom of the list.Both Ms Walker and Ms Gray said that the decision to have an elective procedure during this time rested with the patient. They understand that this is a very dficult time, that the situation is continually changing and that not everyone wants to come into a hospital environment.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The council is also looking at ways to fill gaps in childcare provision for children under two and after school care for older children.The move is in tandem with schools and marks a signicant milestone in the Government’s “route map” out of lockdown as Scotland continues to make good progress in suppressing COVID-.OIC executive director of education, leisure and housing James Wylie said the focus is very much “getting it right for every child” in ing to these services after a challenging period of many months.“The decision to close Early Learning and Childcaresettings has had an impact on the lives of children and families throughout Orkney,# Mr Wylie explained.#There was little time to prepare, or scope to explain, the changes to our youngest children. Their relationships and friendships were abruptly interrupted as well as their learning.“Our focus must be on supporting children when they are in settings, to form a secure and emotionally resilient attachment base which will stand them in good stead as they grow and develop.  Nurturing and attached relationships are essential to creating the conditions for children to flourish in early learning and childcare.“All children have a right to play, to learn and to access experiences that meet their physical, social, emotional and cultural needs, and they have a right to associate with their peers. The health and wellbeing of children and adults is vital and these important rights and considerations have all been factored into the development of a framework for reopening and delivering ELC services.“We now know that young children are less likely to be affected by or transmit the virus. This means we are able to reduce some of the restrictions on ELC delivery laid out in previous guidance. However, we cannot yetto normal ELC practice – we all need to ensure that we continue to manage services and mitigate risks.”Mr Wylie pointed out that every child will have dferent levels of required support. He explained that some children have additional support needs and it will be important as part of the risk assessments carried out to consider the inidual needs of a child. Where there is a need to work in close proximity with adults and children the appropriate safety measures should be put in place based on that risk assessment.There will be a short transitional period for introducing our youngest children back into their learning and childcare services this week and this will y within each setting. The aim is to have all children, where possible, back into their settings by August .In line with government advice, there will be no requirement for physical distancing between children in nurseries. In nurseries two metre distancing will not apply between adults and children as, this does not meet young children’s social and emotional needs. However, adults will need to stay two metres apart wherever possible.Similarly, no PPE is required when undertaking routine educational activities. However, staff will continue to follow existing guidance on PPEit is required. Enhanced hygiene measures will be undertaken where necessary.Anyone showing symptoms of COVID- should not attend the childcare setting.A list of FAQs has been compiled to assist all as settings reopen their doors — they can be found here www.orkney.gov.uk CV-EL-FAQcopy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

DaoineNow there is much within the machinations that occupy the precious time of our Comhairle officers that could well be regarded as relatively ‘trivial’, although I will fully concede that even the most improbable deliberations might well form the centre of somebody’s entire universe.But when we, as a community, or section of that community, continue to press for answers and resolutions to a subject that has already been explained fully to us, then we should ask ourselves one important question: “Are we doing this for the greater good, or because we are trying to promote our own agenda ”. about some of the material that was included in the Scottish Government’s RSHPguidelines and how I felt that some of it was completely over the top for inclusion in any classroom.Several concerned parents had written to me, asking what on earth was going on.I enquired of both the Director and Chair of Education and Children’s Services as to the validity of these concerns.I was happy to note that the ‘plot’ wasn’t as sinister as had been portrayed by some ‘concerned’ groups both within the counciland on anti-social media.Some alleged that the Comhairle were somehow, through the back-door and under the cover of the Covid- crisis , trying to sneak through an agenda which went against the “moral values of this community”.An inflammatory accusation, one that was sure to ignite passions and ring yet another Pavlovian bell.Except that, far from being subject matter that was about to get rammed down our children’s throats, not just ‘promoted’ it was simply an extreme example of what was included for reference, should anyone wish to avail themselves of it.Yes, some of it was fairly graphic stuff and, as I’ve said before, I was hugely alarmed that it was even considered for anything to be found in our classrooms.But, as is the case with material which has been taught in our schools for at least a couple of centuries the devil is in the detail .Luckily we have seen teachers, historically, opt to use the message of love, forgiveness, compassion and mutual understanding from this particular tome ignoring the more sinister aspects where death, retribution, punishment and all kinds of nastiness are very much front and centre.Choosing your testaments wisely is what this is primarily about.We are lucky to have an educational framework where common sense prevails, otherwise there could be very many distractions in the subjects of Biology, Geology and quite possibly Physics.I attempted to be amusing about a topic which has very legitimate, obvious, and serious, implications for our most impressionableyoung people.I hoped I was taking a cue from people who think that a banana dipped into a jar of Nutella is a suitable metaphor for something.Possibly the obesity crisis I think a jar of Bovril might have been funnier.If people wish to identy as a Unicorn and have sex with the pavement, then that’s fine too, but not surely for inclusion in ‘guidance’ material.Yes, I have to admit that I also jumped onto the bandwagon, until I had the situation clearly explained to me and was told to trust the teacher’.They will be given the ultimate discretion and they know best what’s appropriate for their young audience.We do ‘much ado’ well here.When ‘Ironside’ and ‘Bob the Budget Builder’ steered the Comhairle and helped many local businesses through the worst of the effects of the ongoing pandemic, we turned inward and focused on upholstery.With Bernie, Angus and the Education Department, all under immense pressure to get a hugely problematic school year underway on time, we are more focused on what won’tbe getting taught, rather than what will, and how.Andour kids come home from school with a penchant for strange combinations of fruit and nut sandwiches, then it will have been discussed with the Head Teacher and Parent Council first.A lot of the contentious issues which occupy us here in the Western Islesare perceived to exist somewhere between a conservative, culturally protective, radically Christian, ‘right’, and a somewhat more progressive, more liberal, secular, bunch of left-wing snowflakes.Most of us are somewhere, far more certainly and squarely, in the middle trying to make sense of it all.If we cannot empower and trust our teachers to do what’s best for the most vulnerable amongst us, then we will have failed both.The man of the week, last week, certainly in the northern half of this county, was the irrepressible David Black.Three rounds crammed into  hours saw him claim the Thompson Bruce Trophy at Stornoway and take an early lead in Scarista’s  ‘Blue-Riband’ event.Rounds of +  around Lady Lever Park on Friday and Saturday saw him edge out Eddie Rogers,  +  by just a single shot over  holes.A further shot adrt saw Murdo ‘Griddy’ MacLeod,  +  in third slot.Iain ‘Juke Box’ MacKay won the handicap trophy with two excellent rounds of nett  for a  total.In between his Thompson Bruce exploits, Davie also posted the leading score in the, two-round, Harris G.C. Club Championship.His  was  shots ahead of nearest challengers, Billy Fraser and Cal Robertson, both on .Starting with six straight pars, he succumbed to bogies at the ‘amen’ of corners, the deadly-deceiving brace of par-s at   .Naturally he bounced straight back birdies at the new th, and the th brought him back to level.He swapped a birdie for a bogey at  and  to see him home safely.Only a sht in plate tectonics will see him throw away this lead.Midweek at Stornoway saw the Glennie Trophy claimed by Iain Moir on  Stableford Points. Starting his opening four holes, five-over par, couldn’t have been good for his confidence.He was just one-over for the next .In the Junior section, Calum Gbounced back from his recent humblings at the hands of brother, Geordie H in the Par Bogey competition.Six ahead of the course, he demolished the rest of the field by  clear shots.In the Scarista midweek competition, Billy Fraser kept up his, season-long, decent form, partnering Chris Sutton to a fine win in the Pairs Greensomes.Their  was two ahead of Russell Tennant and Alan Gunn’s, .Benbecula’s finest continue to battle it out for their season-long Order of Merit, Dami Steele ing a semblance of normality, bouncing back from a week out of the top spots to consolidate his lead at the top.His round wasn’t, however, good enough to claim the full points last Tuesday evening, Domhnall MacKay storming to a -pointer and the maximum Point haul.Apparently Donald has been keeping his powderdry and intends, after a decent sabbatical, to make a strong charge over the coming weeks."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/TOURISM-2-copy.jpg","title":"litir do luchd ionnsachaidh","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine.’.

This is a unique piece of art which has given the village something to appreciate and be proud of. The creator of this horse is Bertie McNeilly, who is a leading member of the village Bloom team. He is a self taught sculptor who created this le size sculpture using nothing but recycled horseshoes. The shoes were supplied by a local farrier. This specially designed sculpture is something which has added another dimension to their in bloom activities and, being made from horse shoes, might even bring us good luck in any future competitions!Bertie said he had this challenging task in his mind for some time.“We, in the Cullybackey Community Partnership, are always looking for something which will enhance the village and will also appeal to our “In Bloom” judges.

The idea came from local lady Barbara Montgomery who assisted CCP Margaret Murphy to put together this amazing display.Margaret said as well as taking the opportunity to recognise the NHS and all support workers, she would like to thank the Cullybackey people who have taken time to knit or crochet hundreds of flowers to enable them to “put on this amazing display.”CCP have continued throughout this lockdown period to enhance the village with numerous floral displays which has resulted in the village looking amazing! The colour and vibrancy has helped to lighten the mood of everybody in the village and those travelling through it.When in the area look out for the horse and all the displays andyou want to learn more about the work of the Cullybackey Community Partnership, ring Joanne on .

After the devastation caused by the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, , British and Commonwealth troops were posted to Japan to help support the US occupation and reconstruction effort.Among them was Tom Clarke from Ballymena and his daughter Sandra gave theaccess to her collection of photographs of her father and spoke about his memories to mark this sombre anniversary.Sandra, who lives in the village of Lundin Links on the coast of Fe, still keeps in contact with her old friends locally via social media.“Dad was born to Joseph and Jeannie Clarke nee woodcock at Clonavon Place. “He must have been a character in his earky years because he ran away to Belfast at  to try and join the RAF, but he said they gave him a good kick in the backside and and sent him home,” laughs Sandra.SELECTIONEventually Tom met the selection criteria and joined the RAF, subsequently being posted as groundcrew to the Far East where he served in Burma, India and Japan. “My dad was fiercely, proud of his time in RAF. He valued the comradeship and the friends he made during times of hardship far away from home. “I suppose that’s why he took so much interest in the Burma Star Association in later years. He could talk with people who’d been out in the South East Asia theatre and who had experienced similar things.”When Tom was quizzed by his prooud daughter about his role in the war he often preferred to joke about his experiences.“I asked my dad how many planes he had shot down but I remember him saying the closest he got to flying, was laying in bottom of flat bellied boat going into Hong Kong harbour! “Lots of servicemen ended up with bad illnesses out in the Far East and Dad was no exception.“I remember him telling me how he suddenly took sick in the street. He had to throw up and it was then that his  teeth came out and fell into the stream of filthy water which was running down the alley.“He had to chase after them and give them a rinse off - he was never going to get replacments in India during the war!” But it was in the immediate aftermath of the conflict that Tom became one of a very small number of British servicemen to be posted to the Japanese mainland to help with the clean-up of the devastated cities.With the prospect of terrible losses in any military invasion of Japan, the decision had been taken to unleash the Atomic Bombs in a bid to force the Japanese into surrender. The United States detonated two nuclear weapons over the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki on August  and , , respectively, with the consent of the United Kingdom. The two bombings killed between , and , people and remain the only uses of nuclear weapons in armed conflict.Tom received a medal for working in the zones but rarely talked about the more distressing experiences. “He would just say that the whole city had been wiped out. He - and no-one  - had ever seen anthing like it,” says Sandra. “You can only imagine the kind of things he saw.”In later years, Sandra remembers her father’s breathing problems.“My dad was a chronic asthmatic and I remember, after he died, a woman came to see me. They were trying to seethere was any link about ex-servicemen with chest problems and whether it was related to working in areas,that were contaminated after the bomb.“My dad had his normal medals then years later he got the Southeast Asia Medal and I believe he was was the only member in Ireland to hold it“As a wee girl about , I can remember people in the house, were discussing what they would like to inherit.“I wanted my dad’s medals. He was very proud of me taking an interest so he made it his job looking to see any medals he should have had. So he always used to phone me saying I’ve got you another medal - he actually got another  medals,which were commemorative only.”Sandra looked set to follow in her father’s footsteps but her initial attempt ended in failure!“ I asked at  for my dad to sign my papers to join WRAF, but he refused, only for me to join QARANC  years later.” Sandra’s memories of her father also revolve around musicianship.“I asked him one day what would you like to be remembered for and he said his love of music. “He played the trumpet all his le and was in the Silver Band with his brothers Joe and James and their cousins the Woodcocks.“He had a little dance band in the early s ,I remember them playing in the green hut down Harryville Park.”Footnote: Japan surrendered to the Allies on August , six days after the Soviet Unions declaration of war and the bombing of Nagasaki. The Japanese government signed the instrument of surrender on September  in Tokyo Bay, which effectively ended World War II.

It would be a stretch to say all of the administrative staff, all of the lecturers and all of the ious other employees are actively fighting against unionism, he wrote on Challenges NI, an online  for young voices in Northern Ireland.However, when unionists state that Queen#s University is a cold house for them, we are trying to discuss the Students# Union, its leadership and the general attitude of certain students around campus. These issues haven#t been addressed.I have sat on the Students# Council and I am constantly left in a state of bemusement at the attitudes. Mr Bell noted how the current Students# Union President, Grian Ni Dhaimhin, had posted on social media in the past expressing her apparent support for militant republicanism.He also claimed two other full-time officers of the Students# Union executive regularly show support for socialist republican activist group #Lasair Dhearg# via social media.Irish nationalist student councillors consistently put forward motions which are nothing but an insult to the unionist community on campus, he said.The latest example being a motion which attempts to ban the British military and PSNI from appearing on campus, a blatant insult to any student, regardless of political views, who intends to join the armed services or police upon graduating.There are #student bars# where unionists, and in particular Protestants, refuse to enter as they have a genuine fear of being the victim of sectarian abuse.In June members of Lasair Dhearg #renamed# Queen#s as #Mairead Farrell University Belfast# in a stunt to remember a former student who was shot dead in Gibraltar in  while engaged in IRA activity. Two other incidents that Queen#s Ogra Sinn Fein were engaged in have gone unpunished by the Students# Union, he added. During Freshers Fair , the Ogra Sinn Fein stand displayed a #Brits Out# sign. And Sinn Fein posters are consistently displayed on lampposts. Strictly speaking, these posters shouldn#t be erected outside election time and constitute littering because they do not have planning permission. These posters represent an attempt to mark territory.There are fewer ways to create a more unwelcoming atmosphere for unionists.Queen#s University as an institution might not be a cold house for unionism now but the Students# Union and attitudes on campus are certainly sending us head-on into an ice age.Queen#s University has been contacted for comment.

When someone dials  their call is initially answered by the Public Emergency Call Service operated by BT. The operator then attempts to connect the call to the Northern Ireland Ambulance Service#sEmergency Ambulance Control.However, in some circumstances calls are routed to the Scottish Ambulance Service as part of a #buddy# arrangement.These include where calls to the emergency control room exceeds its normal call handling capacity, or where an unplanned disruption to  call handling services occurs, through technical or other failures. NIAS said the #buddy# arrangement ensures an appropriate route for  calls to be redirected.It said arrangements in place as standard across all UK ambulance services to ensure business continuityHowever, the number of calls being answered in Scotland has risen sharply.In the last five months of ,  calls were sent to Scottish operators.But by  this had risen to , rising further to  last year. Last September alone  calls were answered in Scotland.The figures were released to this newspaper after a Freedom of Information request.Mr Givan, who has raised the issue with Health Minister Robin Swann, said the reasons for so many calls being sent outside Northern Ireland must be identied.He said: These findings suggest a deeply worrying trend in the number of emergency calls from members of the public in need of medical assistance in Northern Ireland being rerouted to the Scottish Ambulance Service. In ,  such cases took place compared to  the previous year, and only  in the last six months of . This demonstrates a stark and steady increase in contact lost between households and iniduals in need of help locally and NIAS Emergency Ambulance Control. Rerouting these calls naturally increases the risk of delay and disruption in coordination of services.Whilst we recognise the need for effective #buddy# arrangements with services where in the UK to ensure interrupted service in unforeseen situations, this should not be normal course day and daily. Reports of technical faults leading to calls being answered in Scotland extend as far back as  and the root causes need to be identied and rectied.In recent weeks concerns have been raised over ambulance cover in the Newry, south Down and south Armagh regions.The Ambulance Service estimates it needs  additional staff to meet targets.Mr Givan added: It is also vital that an evidence-based approach is adopted to staffing in the NIAS and ambulance control in particular in order to ensure appropriate capacity to meet service demand across Northern Ireland. Covid- has already placed our dedicated ambulance crews and staff under additional operational pressure and they deserve to have every resource available to ensure they can carry out their roles in the most effective way.It is imperative that the Minister of Health moves to address these concerns as a matter of urgency.NIAS said: All UK services have buddying arrangements in place with neighbouring ambulances services. This is considered best practice.NIAS has a #buddy system# with the Scottish Ambulance Service. This ensures continuity of service in the event of #call surges# or interruption to the telephony network.

However, it#s still very early days.Exemptions to the new regulations do exist -for staff, children under  and anyone with an illness or impairment.And, bizarrely, you don#t have to wear one in a bank, gym, solicitor#s office or cinema.The Department of Health said it would be an offence to ignore the regulations without a reasonable excuse, adding that the fine may be a fixed penalty notice of £, reduced to £paid within  days.

Retail NI, meanwhile, has insisted it is not for shop owners or staff to enforce the rules.Professor Heneghan, who is director of the University of Oxford#s Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine, said the implementation of the new regulations has been a triumph of opinion and policy over evidence - one made on observational data, and not on randomised, controlled trials.The Department of Healthhas insisted, however, that it considered a wide range of evidence in making its recommendation for masks to be made mandatory, including two Royal Society reports.Read More Medic behind BBC coronavirus #conspiracy# complaint says: we must stay vigilant Professor Heneghan said: Northern Ireland should be honest with the population when it deems to put a whole policy together and say that we#re going to do this, and be clear: there is very poor quality evidence to inform what we#re going to do next, but we#re going to do it anyhow.The GP insisted the policy has been driven on the basis of decision-makers selecting evidence to suit their opinions.There#s a long history of people trying to use observational study to confer treatment effects. And that#s what people have done, he said.But there#s a real problem with when you do that approach, because you can cherry pick the evidence to suit your argument.So for instance, people use observational data that in countries with masks, infection rates are low. However, when you come to higher quality evidence, randomised, control trials, you see that#s not the case.The question is:you keep introducing interventions like this, people are not questioning do they work, and not questioning how will we evaluatethey work.This is a triumph of opinion and policy over evidence. And the biggest factor is, how can you inform the public of the benefits and the harms of these interventions Read More Suppliers hit hard by pause in Northern Ireland gigs sector Professor Heneghan said not enough focus has been given to the potential counterbalance - or equipoise - to public health intervention policies such as masks.He said: The other thing people don#t understand is that interventions are likely to increase benefit as well as increase harms. People seem to perceive there are no harms with any interventions, which is wrong.It is not clear to me that cloth masks are beneficial or harmful, but it is clear that we don#t use them in healthcare settings because they have been shown to increase the rates of infection compared to surgical masks. By all means wear a mask, butyou#re imposing it on society, then politicians should really ask questions.It#s unacceptable for people to say: #Here#s a review on poor quality evidence that we#re going to use to confer a policy#.Addressing how it is presented to the public, the Oxford expert added: Anything that has #might#, #could# or #may# shows you that you have a problem.If people want to wear masks, then that#s completely up to them. My job is to reduce the uncertainty about whether it#s beneficial or harmful. If you wear it, unfortunately there#s no evidence that I can help you with that#s going to benefit you with high quality studies.In mid-July, Prof Heneghan spotted major discrepancies in how Public Health England recorded coronavirus deaths that led Health Secretary Matt Hancock to order an urgent review.A health spokesperson said: The department has considered a wide range of scientic evidence from a number of sources when developing recommendations around the use of face coverings and new evidence emerges all the time.Questions have also been raised about the huge disparity in cross-border penalties.The £ fine here is far below the Republic, where anyone caught flouting the rule can face a fine of up €, or up to six months# imprisonment.

People will have loved ones that have been sick or passed away, so for them to hear it dismissed on the evening news like that isn#t nice for them to hear.So it was insensitive but the important thing is that they acknowledged the error.As with all healthcare workers in Northern Ireland, working to protect vulnerable patients from the pandemic has become part of Dr O#Neill#s daily le in recent months.I work in acute medicine so would often be the first port of call after people are admitted from AE, he said.I#m also in rheumatology so I have had issues there as lots of patients will be on steroids and immunosuppressive medication.They will have had a tricky time over the last few months with shielding. So it#s fair to say I#ve been thinkinga lot in the last few months.He said yesterday was a big day with face coverings becoming mandatory in shops so it will be interesting to see how well people adapt to that.A BBC spokesperson said last week: The inclusion of this clip was an error of judgment and it was removed from later bulletins and from the BBC Newsline Facebook page.The BBC is a  for engagement and debate, but ideas which fall outside the scientic mainstream should be scrutinised and challenged, which did not happen in this instance.In recent weeks a number of high profile figures, including Formula  champion Lewis Hamilton, have been criticised for appearing to support Covid- conspiracy theories.Mr Hamilton backtracked after sharing a post on Instagram about Bill Gates, with the post suggesting the billionaire lied about vaccine safety or claims vaccines would be used to microchip people. The sports star has since apologised and said that he hadn#t read the post properly, and was not against the use of any potential vaccine.

His building of a lasting and sustainable peace in Ireland is why he shall be immortalised in history. John could be compared with the greats of Irish Nationalism like O’Connell and Parnell, but the truth of the matter is that John was in a league of his own. googletag.cmd.push  As part of the post-conflict generation, we have John to thank for ensuring that we were able to grow up in a society without violence in our streets, we have John to thank for the fact we can walk any street in Derry with no fear, we have John to thank for guaranteeing that peace would prevail and that the gun would no longer have a place in Irish politics. I find it hard to imagine how Ireland would look today without the influence of John Hume. John’s gt to people all across Ireland and people my age was ironic for such a beloved peacemaker, he taught us how to fight. He taught us how to fight against injustice, how to fight for equality, he taught us how to fight for freedom, how to fight for love, peace and how to fight for a better Ireland which we all can share. He fought with non-violence, he was a pacist, even when confronted with threats, bombs, bullets, and death all around, his morals never shted an inch. John taught us that living for your moral convictions was more righteous than using violent means to achieve your aims. googletag.cmd.push John Hume serves as an example to our post-conflict generation of what we can achieve when we put aside what ides us and instead celebrate what makes us equal. To young people he has shown that we can, in his words, “see an Ireland of partnership where we wage war on want and poverty, where we reach out to the marginalised and dispossessed, where we build together a future that can be as great as our dreams allow.” John’s influence is everywhere throughout the great nation he called home, whether it was through his work in founding the Credit Union movement in Derry and becoming the youngest ever President of the Irish League of Credit Unions, as chair of the University for Derry Committee, his involvement as a civil rights movement leader, his work with the Derry Citizens’ Action Committee, the founding of the SDLP, his positions as MP, MEP and MLA, his role in the ceasefire talks, his work in America or his participation in delivering the Sunningdale Agreement, the Anglo-Irish Agreement or the Good Friday Agreement, John Hume’s le’s work is an indelible inspiration to everyone who calls Ireland home. For me, personally, John Hume is an inspiration, he was a true political titan. I have been asked a number of times since John’s passing why I think everyday people are taking John’s death so personally, here’s why, I feel that John is inextricably linked to everyone in the North, his successes guaranteed that our lives and the lives of our children and grandchildren could be brighter. I think one of the most important lessons we must remember is that John Hume’s work is not finished. We still have to dismantle sectarianism within our society, we still have to work with all shades of the political spectrum, regardless of how much we disagree, in the pursuit of what is best for the people of Ireland. We still must protect civil rights and peace all across the globe from being corroded. We must work together to make a New Ireland and a Shared Ireland, where all people are equal. That is the Ireland John lived for and we must live for too, not only Derry but all of Ireland Mourns John Hume. Go raibh maith agat John, you were truly Ireland’s Greatest.   --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The facility would link up with the new Magee medical school to train future doctors. The Derry News has learned that plans for a ‘capital build’ project at the Derry hospital are at an ‘early stage’ but have been costed. The development comes shortly after the news emerged on Friday that Ulster University’s Graduate Entry Medical Schoolis now recruiting students for September  intake. The Western Trust has and will be the main partner to the medical school. Professor Louise Dubras, who will lead the course, appeared at a Western Trust board meeting to update members on the GEMS on August . googletag.cmd.push Speaking at the meeting, Mr Alan Moore, Director of Strategic Capital Development, offered a ‘hearty congratulations’ to Prof. Dubras. He made reference to on-site teaching facilities at Altnagelvin Hospital which were included in the business case. In response, Prof. Dubras said: “We costed in to our business case the requirement for a capital build at Altnagelvin Hospital to determine the amount of money that would be required for that. “What our expectation is, is that we wish to work with the Trust and Queen’s University Belfastto have a building which serves everybody and I think it’s really important that this is not two universities, two buildings and duplication of everything. googletag.cmd.push “We’re not big enough to do that and it doesn’t provide good education, the only way that this will work well as we move forward is to have a provision which covers all undergraduate education and that enables post-grad activity to take place there. “That’s really important for students to see and work with foundation year doctors and doctors at other stages of their training so that what you have as a Trust is a culture of education and growing educational excellence in the area – and a single place, which is the hub, is where it needs to happen.” TENACITY Addressing the meeting on behalf of the Trust, Dr Catherine McDonnell expressed her admiration for Prof. Dubras’ ‘patience and tenacity’ over the past two years for ‘sticking with the project’ to deliver a medical school in the North West. She said it is ‘extremely important’ to the hospital in terms of stabilising the medical workforce and creating local jobs. To clear up some ‘confusion’ there may be about the nature of the medical school Prof. Dubras pointed out that it’s not a post-graduate medical school for people who are qualied as doctors and doing a master’s degree. She explained that this school will accept students who will be trained as doctors and their degree could have been in any subject as long as they achieved a :. It will be situated within the faculty of Le and Health Sciences. “The medical school is about supporting local young people and improving the economic potential of the region and tackling long-term social deprivation.” Work is ongoing to refurbish buildings at the Magee campus in readiness for students next year. Prof. Dubras said staff recruitment is an interesting area and people have already expressed an interest in coming to Derry to work. Chairman of the Western Trust board, Sam Pollock, said he believes the medical school will help attract staff to address the ongoing issue of agency costs. Director of Performance and Service Improvement, Mrs Teresa Molloy, said there has been extensive interest from partner organisations such as Fermanagh and Omagh Council about the long-term benefits it could bring. EARLY STAGE In , the Department of Health commissioned a Review of Medical School Places which recommended that Northern Ireland needs  more medical students a year to meet the increasing demand for doctors. At last weeks meeting Prof. Dubras pointed out how the medical school will start off with  students and discussions are continuing with The Executive Office to increase that to . Currently, approximately % of medical graduates in Northern Ireland tend to stay and live within  miles of Queen’s University Belfast after graduation, according to the GMC. The new School of Medicine at Magee will address departmental recommendations by providing access to medical education in the North West, positioning theDerryCity region as an attractive place to study and work. Students will benefit from access to clinical placements across the full range of general practice, medical and surgical specialities with primary care-based experience from week one. This will enable students to develop knowledge and appreciation of the interconnectivity between primary, secondary, social and community-based healthcare. A spokesperson for Ulster University confirmed: “Ulster University continues to engage with local partners including the Western Health and Social Care Trust on medical education. “Discussions around joint additional training sites are at a very early stage and no plans have yet been agreed.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The new centre will be moved a short distance to Anderson House at Altnagelvin. Derry was the first city to set-up a COVID centre back on March  at the out-of-hours Western Urgent Care building. The other Covid centre in the Western Trust area opened at South West Acute Hospital on March . The Trust continues to maintain a state of readiness for admissions of patients with suspected Covid- and a further surge. Speaking at the Western Trust’s monthly board meeting, Dr Anne Kilgallen, Chief Executive, said: “Both centres continue to operate, preparing for a potential second surge. googletag.cmd.push “The Altnagelvin centre will move to Anderson and South West centre will reduce its footprint to free up space in the outpatient department. “Movements are allowing us to recommence our outpatient services.” Antibody testing has been offered in the Trust area as of July , she told the Western Trust board. These tests are used to detect antibodies to the COVID- virus to seeyou have previously had the virus. The test works by taking a blood sample and testing for the presence of antibodies to seeyou have developed an immune response to the virus. A total of  tests were carried out and only  ed as positive, which Dr Kilgallen described as an ‘interesting find’. googletag.cmd.push A Covid swab testing service available to staff, patients pre-operatively and staff in the independent sector continues to operate at C-TRIC at Altnagelvin Hospital and Lackaboy in Enniskillen. However, those services are also relocating in August as part of reset plans. The latest NISRA statistics show that  people have died of Covid- in Derry City and Strabane. In the council area there have been  confirmed coronavirus cases –  in the last  days. In response to the Coronavirus pandemic a network of new Primary CareCovid- centres were then rapidly established to manage the growth of Coronavirus cases in the community. They were seen as an essential part of the fight against this virus.  To ensure vital GP services can be maintained, it is believed to be absolutely critical that those who show symptoms are separated from the patients with nonCovid- related conditions.  These centres are not testing facilities and are only for patients who are very unwell, are suspected of havingCovid- and require medical attention.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The start of the summer. A time of hope. A time of new beginnings. To celebrate my th birthday, my friends and I had travelled to Belfast on a minibus on a school-night in the middle of A Levels for that momentous YES concert. We were thrilled to get to see Ash and Bono at the Waterfront. We were extra ebullient at the sight of John Hume taking to the stage. The unlikely trio of David Trimble, John and Bono were applauded with yells of “Yesss!”. googletag.cmd.push  The burning pride deep inside on that night could have set the world alight. To the friends I had yet to meet, some of whom were at that concert, I would always be Proud Mary from Derry. I had come of age just in time to vote in the referendum three days later. Not all of us would have that privilege. My sister, Deirdre, who was singing and shouting her heart out for the entire excursion, was  months shy of voting age. In fact she would never get to vote as she was killed in a car accident we were involved in  months later. googletag.cmd.push I had meticulously studied the Good Friday Agreement text during the referendum campaign. As excited as I was to be on my way to Loch an Iuacuteir for Cuacutersa na Casca that Good Friday, my inner political nerd was sorry to be missing all the TV and radio coverage. No mobile phones or social media in those days. Just two days before the signing of the Agreement, I was at Stormont with a delegation of Derry Girls lobbying the British Government for a new school. I was on The Thornhill Talks Team with Mrs Boyle, Miss Hamilton and Head Girl, and my lelong friend, Emmylou. The eyes of the world were on these negotiations and the hand of history was on our shoulders. John Hume took time out to facilitate the meeting withMinister of Education, Tony Worthington MP. John was the architect of the unfolding momentous peace accord, but he was focussed on bread and butter constituency issues. He knew the importance of education in creating opportunities and building inclusive and peaceful communities. I was engaged in current affairs and local politics from a young age. I was fascinated by the work of my godfather, Uncle Mark. His job as John Hume’s parliamentary aide brought him to ious countries. He gted me with great stories and good lessons over the years. I proudly flaunted a “Hume for Europe” Tshirt in . I read newspapers. I listened intently to the kitchen wireless and followed the TV debates. Always rooting for John and rehearsing the Humespeak: You can’t eat a flag. Spill sweat, not blood. Respect ersity. An accident of birth. Dference is the essence of humanity. This language is now common parlance. John brought others on to his page and round to his way of thinking and speaking. It is impossible to consider John’s achievements without recognising the influence of his we and key adviser, Pat. On completion of my A Levels, I had the pleasure of working in the Bayview Terrace constituency office in the run up to the first Assembly elections. I learned so much about public service, not least in witnessing the compassion and care shown by Pat to every person. The office was buzzing. Phone calls were coming in from journalists, humanitarians and politicians from all over the world. I could hear John speaking in French on the phone one minute, then dealing with a constituent on a housing issue the next minute. Pat had time and warmth for everyone. Amidst the flurry, Pat still found time for banter and indulged my frivolous chats about nights out. I still regard Pat as a mentor and hero. I can only try and imagine the extent of sacrices made by Pat and her family over the years. After that short stint in the office, I spent three months working in Seagate , before starting my chapter at Queen’s and all the adventures that came with that and after that. The Omagh atrocity that summer was a stark reminder of the fragility of the hard-earned peace. John Hume was a political giant, a living legend and an international statesman. Above all, he was a Derry champion. He was a man of global thinking and local action. First-hand experience of poverty in his community motivated his relentless quest for social justice, and his role in founding the credit union movement was instrumental in giving opportunities to people and families. His civic leadership in the community was as impressive as his political leadership on the world stage. John Hume was a man of vision. Steadfast in his ambitions. Resolute in pursuit of solution. Willing to work with anyone. Determined not to be distracted by the viliers. He kept his shoulder to the wheel and his eyes on the prize. Not any of the acclaimed world prizes he won . Ultimately the prize for John was the prize for everyone: peace and the prospect of a brighter future. Those coming of age today face immense challenges as we emerge from a global health pandemic and enter a world recession. Climate emergency is real. In this part of the world we face the added challenges of Brexit uncertainty. Today’s generation need an injection of the hope that my generation were given  years ago. We still have much work to do. The “isolation of the West” remains a pertinent issue. The fight for a proper university presence in the city continues. “I sometimes wish it was that summer again…..” We should always maintain a little bit of that summer, even in the middle of the longest winters. The spirit of partnership and reconciliation underpinning the Good Friday Agreement and defining Hume’s pathway must be restored. And we shall overcome.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Entering the school foyer you’re struck that John Hume sits alongside illustrious company in what must have been a golden age of thinkers and creators. A bust made in the Derry man’s honour rests between two gentlemen who excelled in their own fields in Seamus Heaney and Brian Friel.  Each of these men attended the former Bishop Street school around the same time and went on to become giants in their respective disciplines. googletag.cmd.push John Hume’s own journey at the college began in  . “He told his mother he was going to the College and she said, ‘no you’re not, we can’t afford that’, but he passed his Eleven Plus and got in,” current principal Finbar Madden said. Hume was part of the first generation to avail of opportunities through the introduction of the Eleven Plus. It allowed more young people to continue their post-primary education which may go some way to explaining why men like Hume, Friel and Heaney grasped the opportunity with both hands. There was obviously ‘huge talent and ability’, Mr Madden said, as Hume left the school with a scholarship to study at university. googletag.cmd.push He had ambitions of joining the priesthood at the leading Catholic Seminary in Ireland, St Patrick’s College, Maynooth. Hume didn’t complete his clerical studies but instead opted to serve his community in another way. He graduated from the National University of Ireland in  with a bachelor’s degree in French and history and went on to receive a master’s degree. Returning to Derry, Hume would became a teacher at St. Columb’s. Mr Madden said that career lasted from -. At the time, the history curriculum was limited in schools and Hume taught the subject in a broader sense, keen to instil his vision of Ireland’s place in Europe. As he departed, transitioning into a career in politics, some of the key developments in the civil rights movement were starting to unfold. That, however, wasn’t the end of his journey with the school and his legacy endures. The colleges former pupils association present an annual award - the Alumnus Illustrissimus Award - to a past-pupil who has achieved something of major signicance or has made a considerable contribution in his own field. In , the Most Reverend Dr Edward Daly received the inaugural award and the following year John Hume would be recognised for his contribution to politics and peace in Northern Ireland. Mr Madden said: “The school is able to boast of many exceptional students who went out and made their mark locally, nationally and internationally. “The award recognises achievement whatever the field may be sport, science politics, religion and so on.” A proud College boy, Hume maintained connections over the years and wouldfor prize giving ceremonies. “He presented a facsimile of his Nobel prize to the school,” Mr Madden pointed out next to the assembly hall, “and our politics A-level prize is the John Hume prize in government and politics.” “And for as long as he could, he would come every year to prize-giving, he usually turned up unannounced but we always expected him to come, until unfortunately he wasn’t able to. “He had a very, very clear sense of his connectedness with this school and he never lost that right throughout his le. “In a way that many others weren’t able to do, by his connectedness here, by his presence, he was making it clear that St. Columb’s College meant a huge amount to him. “He recognised what the college had helped him to become.” The school’s principal believes that pupils have looked up to Hume over the years and used him as a source of inspiration in their own studies. Mr Madden concluded: “I think Colum Eastwood said it last night, John Hume was Ireland’s Martin Luther King and we recognise that Martin Luther King had a dream and did all he could to achieve it. “I think John Hume did exactly the same thing here.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The club have never tasted adult championship success. With the manner of victory over Glenullin on Sunday afternoon, it would suggest that consistency will be what Eamon Gibson will be looking from his squad during this condensed season. It leaves John Heaneys side with some soul-searching ahead of their clash with Limavady this weekend. From the way Ben McCarron careered through the Glenullin defence in the opening seconds, until the final whistle, they never looked like being reeled in. If anything, they shouldve won by more. If they are to stand up and be counted when the serious heat comes on, they will need a more ruthless streak in front of goal. The pleasing thing for them, they appear to have the raw materials. googletag.cmd.push They will have to take somewhat of a reality check. Glenullin didnt offer the threat many expected and showed signs of the form that found them in relegation trouble last year. It was a big ask for Michael Oacuteg McKeown in his first game in goals to replace the injured Pearse McNicholl and when they failed to secure possession at midfield, it was a long hour for him. Steelstowns runners through the middle hurt them and with Ben McCarron playing as a third midfielder, their mobile attack thrived in the space. Dermot OKane, one the best dead ball kickers in the county, was off colour and Eoin Bradleys relaxed  metre free coming off the post summed up a day they will want to forget. googletag.cmd.push Stephen Cleary played in the reserve game, but was forced off injured and  minutes into the senior game Eoghan Bradleys ankle injury saw him replaced. On came Rory Maguire who had while he had a terric game, he will be disappointed not to have bagged three further goals. Cahir McMonagle will be another option in attack, but its hard to imagine him getting the room he was afforded yesterday when the real action comes to town. Glenullin put Conor Rafferty onto Neil Forester in what seemed like a curtaining job, while Feargal Close pushed back on to Gareth Logue. It was Logie who dictated the game and even when Gerard OKane was sent out to mark him, the Steelstown mans movement caused Glenullin trouble. Steelstown were three points ahead when the first goal chance presented itself, but it fell to Glenullin. Dermot OKane picked out Paul Rafferty in front of goal but the low pile-driver was instinctively turned onto the bar by goalkeeper Marty Dunne. Seconds later Jacob Duffy had the ball over the bar at the other end. Brothers Dermot and Gerard OKane kicked two terric point, but it did little to stem Steelstowns incessant running game. Whoever is going to stop them, cant afford to drop off. They will need a half-forward line that will occupy them and top the overlap. When the first goal came, it was a majestic diagonal ball from full-back Shane OConnor who found Logue in space and his unstoppable shot went to the bottom corner of McKeowns net. Ryan Devine floated over a fine score from distance before Jacob Duffy made the second goal, with the strong-running Maguire blasting to the net. Steelstown missed three point chances before Maguire was blown up for over carrying when through on goal, almost ashe was caught in two minds to flick to the final support runner. Glenullin brought on three substitutes at the break. Brian Mullan was pulled out from goal with Eoin Bradley now stationed at full-forward. Early in the second-half he won a free but somehow spurned it from close range. He missed a chance in front of goal and the attacking unit didnt have the movement that would have tested Steelstown. At times Brian Mullan, who kept trying to push Glenullin forward, tried to float balls forward. The dference being was that the same space wasnt there that Gareth Logue made for the city men. The half took seven minutes to produce a first score. The move began with Dunnes monstrous kick over midfield, Rory Maguire was again involved and when the ball came from a Mark Foley, he was brilliantly denied by Eunan OKanes ing block, before Foley drilled over the . Then came a moment Gibson and his assistant Raymond Tracey wont be too happy with. Mark Foley had the ball at his feet in front of goal, with time to engineer a chance. He opted to lazily soccer the ball to Jacob Duffy who missed without working goalkeeper McKeown. On another day, this lack of urgency could be crucial. Ben McCarron and Darren McDaid, from opposite wings, floated over two sweet scores. And still the goal chances kept flooding in. After a neat move, McCarron and Jason McAleer created another opening but Maguires thundering shot hit the bar before spinning over. Maguire also brought out a fine save from goalkeeper McKeown who brilliant clawed the rebound clear, as the Steelstown attacks kept pouring forward. The chances Steelstown were mounting and missing had no bearing on the result. At the other end a fisted Eoin Bradley effort dropped into Dunnes arms and Conor Rafferty fired over when a goal was on, but it was always going to be Steelstowns day.

The fact he was man of the match in a dominant team tells enough about his performance. The finish for his goal combined power and accuracy to the bottom cover. With Ben McCarron playing further out, it was Logues running that made th Steelstown attack tick. MOMENT OF THE GAMEDUNNE SAVE – There were many scores in the game, but Marty Dunnes save was something . Dermot OKanes ball came in from the wing and Paul Rafferty just pulled on it along the ground and when the shot zipped off the turf, Dunne somehow got enough on the ball to prevent a goal that wouldve levelled the game in the thminute.

The test centre was set up at the Judges Road home of City of Derry Rugby Club in April.

Initially testing was restricted to health and social care workers, it then accepted key workers and their families who had symptoms and more recently any member of the public with symptoms. googletag.cmd.push These tests can be booked via the Public Health Agency website. Many medical and disease control experts have said that testing and contact tracing is key to tackling the spread of COVID-. The Department has developed a COVID- ‘Test, Trace and Protect’ Strategy which sets out the public health approach to minimising COVID- transmission in the community in Northern Ireland. The key elements of the strategy are testing all people with symptoms of COVID-, contact tracing, providing information and advice on self-isolation, and support to enable people to self-isolate. It says for ‘Test, Trace and Protect’ to work, each citizen in Northern Ireland has a very important role to play. googletag.cmd.push “We must all prepare for the possibility of having to self-isolate and prepare to be tested in order to protect ourselves, our families and our communities. “Symptomatic members of the public are therefore encouraged to get tested early - this will be crucial in controlling the spread of the virus,” a spokesperson added.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Jim McReynolds, the popular former owner of McReynold’s Bar, died peacefully last week at his home in Dungiven. Mourners at his funeral heard how Jim had given his time generously to his parish, community and family le. “Jim was a man of faith and trusted in God all his le,” Fr Seamus Kelly told the congregation. “He was very involved in the le of this parish, taking up the collection, doing his time working with St Vincent de Paul, helping and supporting people. googletag.cmd.push “Growing up he was an excellent footballer and represented Dungiven with distinction, gaining a place on the Derry minor team in . “He sponsored many groups and clubs down the years, and club members often said that Jim was the saviour of the hurling club on many occasions. “Even when they hadn’t the money, he would have bought hurls and kits where required until they could raise the funds.” Jim was dedicated to the bar, running what Fr Kelly described as a ‘tight ship’, and he helped cement the bar’s place as a community hub in the town. “He ran a tight ship in his pub. He did not make sales or money his god, but often refused to serve customers he thought were too young or who had already had enough to drink,” he said. googletag.cmd.push “McReynold’s Bar has been famous, not only in Dungiven, as it was the only chief landmark for weary and thirsty travellers from all over the world, and it remains as popular today. “Just last year I had a friend or two visiting and the person wanted a pint, so I said I’d take them down to the best pub in town, McReynold’s Bar, and we had a few pints there. “He had a ready ear for customers’ problems, which were always treated confidentially, and he helped countless numbers of people in a iety of ways over the years. “I’m also told Jim enjoyed cooking and often provided the family meal. The children wouldfrom school, and Rose from teaching, to find a dinner waiting for them. “It had been cooked by Jim while he dodged in and out between the bar and the house, keeping the customers happy as well.” Fr Kelly also spoke of how Jim’s love and commitment to his family, in particular his we Rose, shone through in all that he did. “He met and fell in love with a wonderful Drumsurn girl, Rose Boyle, who was a teacher in her local school.” he said.  “Once they met, Rose and Jim had eyes only for each other and naturally they got married in Drumsurn chapel  years ago. “He loved the cottage in Donegal and was in his element entertaining family and friends when he got off there for a break. I’ve no doubt it holds great memories for all the family. “I enjoyed my visits to Jim and Rose when we were able to visit the sick, Fr Joseph and myself always got a great welcome. “Jim was most generous and appreciated having Holy Communion brought to him when he could no longer go to Mass. “He and Rose always sat side-by-side and I could sense the closeness in their relationship together. I know all the family will miss Jim, but especially his dear we, Rose.” Jim is survived by Rose and his children Finvola, Siobhan, Fanchea, Bernard, Bronagh and Ciara. He was the much-loved grandfather of James, Claire, Anne, Michael, Chris, Katy, Patrick, Cathal, Domnaill, Conal, Niall, Ciaran, Oliver, Liam, Ellen-Rose and great grandfather of Darragh. Jim was pre-deceased by his siblings Frances, Mary, Jean, Patsy, Kathleen and Tony.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Lisa McGee was doing her A-Levels at Thornhill College when the Good Friday Agreement was signed in , and grew up knowing about Mr Humes work for the peace process. He was just there all the time, she recalled. There wasnt a time that you didnt know about him. There was never any debate about it, he was a good man. At a time where everything was debated about and talked about nobody ever questioned that. Not that you would ever have needed to, or have wanted to, question what he was doing. googletag.cmd.push Ms McGee said the news of Mr Humes death on Monday morning came as a shock, despite knowing that he had been ill for some time. He was a hero who walked among us, she said. I got really upset I was surprised at how emotional I felt. We were just so used to having him. It was phenomenal what he did, the influence he had and the amazing vision of what our future should be. Ms McGee believes hundreds of people owe their le to Mr Hume, due to his role in the cessation of violence. He was an incredible person and he was sent here for a reason, she said. googletag.cmd.push I was just thinking yesterday of all the people that may not be herehe hadnt been able to do what he did and built the peace process. When you think of everything he did and he never gave up- thank God. Ms McGee doesnt knowJohn Hume ever watched Derry Girls, but she hopes he would have approved. I dont knowhe ever saw it, but he and Pat knew I was a big fan, she said. I hope they thought it was alright. He was always in the background in the news, so he was present in the show. And Erin chats about him a lot in the Derry Girls book that I did recently. There would be no Derry Girls without John Hume because I wouldnt have had the opportunities that I had,” she added. The Derry writer that she wants her two young children to learn about John Hume as they grow up. There was an amazing image of him on the front of thetoday [Tuesday] and I want to get that framed for the house because its important that they know about him, she said. This was always going to be a very sad time because it was always going to be about looking back over the past and that was a very painful time in our history. It has been a sad thing for me that towards the end of his le he couldnt remember everything he achieved. Thats why we have to remember for him.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

He noticed that for special occasions people in the city rush out to buy a personalised cake from Doherty’s Bakery and thought why not also give them a special memento they can hold on to forever. Christopher Ferry is a Derry man with over  years’ experience in the design industry. He has won ious awards in that time for graphic design and social media management through his work with local businesses. Being on furlough at the moment and confined to his home during lockdown, he felt there was no time like the present to kickstart his own business, aptly named Ferry Clever. googletag.cmd.push It allows people to personalise cards or buy those with famous Derry faces for every occasion. A host of Maiden City icons appear on cards such as John Hume, Nadine Coyle, Micky Doherty , Pat Ramsey and places such as Free Derry Corner, the City Walls and, of course, The Ice Wharf.  Most of them are accompanied by local sayings, for example the common phrase ‘I love you to the moon and back’ is given a local spin to read, ‘I love you to the Bog and back’, with a sketch of the Bogside as the backdrop. It is not just cards but personalised images that can be framed, with a Liverpool-themed design currently proving popular after they were crowned Premier League champions. googletag.cmd.push Families can customise an image of them standing outside the Shankly Gates where it says ‘You’ll Never Walk Alone’. The business has been built at home but Christopher’s ambition is to eventually open a shop in the city centre where the tagline will be ‘make it personal’. Working as a DJ he has established relationships with numerous bars and businesses in the town. “Years and years ago they seen me doing the designs for my own posters, this was back when social media was starting to explode, and they asked meI fancied doing posters for them. “I’d do everything from menus printed in their premises, posters, social media campaigns, to online videos – the lot. “But now I want to go full pelt at it and open my own business.” Recently he was in the town looking for a Father’s Day card and couldn’t find any he liked.  He said: “I thought it would be greatyou could just go on to some place and they could make the card for you. “So I thought, you know what, I’m going to try this as well.” He started off selling on the website Etsy and sales have been rising, ‘people are just buying the cards flat to the mat at the minute’, he added. As someone who is social media savvy, he has been keeping an eye on trends and designing cards accordingly. During lockdown the charity work of local celebrity Micky Doherty was well publicised which is why his image was selected to grace one of the cards.  The ultimate ambition for Christopher is to be the ‘go-to person’ whenever a special occasion comes up. “In Derry, and all over the world, it’s always going to be someone’s birthday, it’s always going to be Christmas, it’s always going to be Father’s Day so I just want them thinking of me for a card.” Micky Doherty said he loved the cards. “Im totally honoured,” he said. “Like someone wants a birthday card with my face on it, he laughed.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

However, because of the coronavirus restrictions, an audience of only  people will be allowed into each performance. The auditorium at the Playhouse usually has room for  people. The producers of the new play, which has been written by Damian Gorman, want to fill the empty seats with items in memory of people who have passed away, either as a result of the Troubles or in other circumstances. googletag.cmd.push Mr Gorman said an empty chair was a very powerful symbol of loss and grief. “Somebody defined grief to me as love which has nowhere to go. Rather than having all these empty chairs that would be housing absence, we would be housing something of signicance,” he said. Kieran Grfiths, Producer Director of thePlayhouse, said they believed it was a fitting memorial for people who have passed away. “Like a low-laying fog, grief has sat amongst us all this year,” he said. “It’s grey, feels impossible to lt and kicking it sees it rise around us. “Our plan is to honour that grief and to fight through with resilience and creativity to simply try and make something move.” googletag.cmd.push As well as being performed live in front of a small audience, the play will also be broadcast live on the internet.

Chief Executive Paul Clancy has said the Northern Ireland Executive’s decision to make the wearing of face masks mandatory in shops is positive news because it protects both shoppers and staff. The decision also gives more certainty to businesses about the steps that need to be taken to keep people, including staff, safe. In a survey carried out with the Chamber’s members last week, % of  respondents supported the mandatory wearing of face masks in shops by the public. googletag.cmd.push Londonderry Chamber Chief Executive Paul Clancy said: “We are glad to see some certainty on this issue. A vast majority of our own members in the North West are supportive of the mandatory wearing of face masks in shops because they recognise that it protects the health and safety of their own staff, as well as customers. “The reality is that we will all have to make some changes to how we live, work, shop and socialise andthe wearing of face coverings is mandatory, it will help promote more of a cultural change in the acceptability of wearing face coverings. googletag.cmd.push “Shops in the city have put in place new measures and changes which will protect their customers and staff. Many retailers have invested a great deal of time and money to make people feel safe and secure and it is important that customers support the new guidelines. “This has been an enormous time of change, but we must all play our part to protect public health, keep the spread of coronavirus to a minimum and avoid a second wave which will be catastrophic for many businesses. “I hope that people will embrace this change and support local businesses as they try to navigate this new landscape. I would also urge members of the public to be mindful of shop staff and treat them with patience and respect. “The number one priority of retailers is the welfare and safety of their customers and staff and have taken these measures to protect everyone. By shopping local and staying local, we can support small businesses who have been impacted by the lockdown.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

It has been developed as part of the UK Government’s Vaccine Taskforce, in partnership with the National Institute for Health Research , NHS Digital, and the Northern Ireland, Scottish and Welsh Governments. Dr Janice Bailie, Assistant Director, RD Division, Public Health Agency, said: “Health researchers are currently working to find a vaccine for COVID-, but without the help of members of the general public willing to participate in vaccine trials, this work will not be able to succeed. googletag.cmd.push “The NHS COVID- vaccine registry allows people to register their interest and be potentially contacted with an offer to participate in clinical studies. “You can sign up to give permission for researchers to contact you about taking part in COVID- vaccine studies.

This will help us to carry out studies and find a vaccine faster.” The registry is available to anyone aged  or over, living in the UK.

The -year-old enjoyed a successful loan spell during the - season, scoring twice in  appearances in all competitions. Holden, who has also had loan spells at Barrow and Rochdale, played in a iety of positions during his first stint with the Saddlers but particularly impressed in an advanced role in midfield.

Parking restrictions will also be in place around the working areas.Ni Water says the investment is part of a programme of work to improve the existing sewers in Downpatrick, which will enhance the local sewerage infrastructure and reduce the risk of out of sewer flooding.It has confirmed that the essential work will involve repairing existing sewers and will mainly be undertaken using underground trenchless techniques, which will signicantly reduce the duration and disruption of the programme.But NI Water is warning that it will be necessary to undertake lsquoopen-digrsquo repairs at some locations due to the condition of the existing sewers.The organisation says that this particular aspect of the work is expected to last just one or two days with contractors also working in the evening, with every effort being made to minimise disruption.ldquoAppropriate traffic management and signage will be in place as the work progresses, said a NI Water spokeswoman.ldquoThe majority of the works will be undertaken during normal working hours.

to a genuinely great political leader, he said.ldquoA few years ago during a visit with the late Maurice Hayes at his home in Downpatrick a chat about developing GAA facilities was taken on a brilliant rambling tangent re John Hume.Maurice knew him well, and opened a door to the man Irsquod only known through my studies at that point. It was laden with humour and humility ndash but also plenty of lessons for us all today.South Down SDLP MLA Colin McGrath spoke of the respect he had for Mr Humersquos commitment to ldquopeace and peaceful non-violent dialogue.He said: ldquoIn all his days, no matter how often he was attacked, John never once turned to violence and lived those very ideals of peaceful nonviolent resistance. He showed us that it was possible. He showed us that peace was achievable. We believed him, because of how radically he believed in those ideals and lived them.Mr McGrath said that through his work, Mr Hume offered ldquoyoung and old alike a vision of a future in which the gun would be removed from Irish politics, no matter how hard terrorists would and continue to resist this.Council chairperson Laura Devlin, praised Mr Hume as ldquoa man of peace and a ldquotrue hero who left a ldquolasting legacy as one of the highest profile politicians on the island of Ireland who was highly respected by all communities.Addressing the councilrsquos full virtual monthly meeting on Monday, she asked: ldquoHow do you put into words a fitting tribute to the contribution this man has made to the landscape of Ireland ldquoHow do you put into words a fitting tribute to this man who stood beside his community through Northern Irelandrsquos most terrying and dark days and walked proudly beside them as we ushered in together the days of peace Cllr Devlin added that from his example, she entered politics to ldquorepresent the needs of the community and added: ldquoIn all of his years, in all his roles, whether as an MLA, an MP, an MEP, a teacher, a family man, a friendhelliphis people came first.Respect was shown to Mr Hume and condolences to his family came from right across the political ide in the council chamber.Councillor Billy Walker, on behalf of the DUP council group, paid his respects to Mr Humersquos family and to the wider SDLP group.He said the death was a ldquosad loss to politics and paid tribute to Mr Humersquos determination to peace-making and ldquoremoving the gun out of politics in Northern Ireland, even sometimes when his own party did not support him during the Hume-Adams talks.He added: ldquoI also had the greatest admiration and respect of how the three then MEPs, John Hume, Ian Paisley and John Taylor, despite their political dferences, worked together to bring millions of European money into Northern Ireland for the benefit of us all.Alliance councillor Andrew McMurray said: ldquoIf it wasnrsquot without the hard work and sacrice of people like John Hume, we wouldnrsquot live in the Northern Ireland we do today.ldquoHis enormous contribution to the peace process, the end of violence and the determination to deliver a society built on peace and equality for everyone which be his lasting legacy along with a le well-lived.ldquoAs a young man growing up it was very obvious to me that John Hume was not only a man who stood for things but stood against things.Councillor Pete Byrne, leader of the SDLP council group, thanked his council colleagues for their kind words and said that the level of international tributes being made about Mr Hume reflected the ldquohigh level of esteem he was held in.ldquoItrsquos very hard to overstate the importance of John Hume to this island, he said. ldquoThrough the most dficult times, John fought for justice, equality and peace.ldquoHe taught me to have respect for dference and ersity and I think thatrsquos a message thatrsquos really important today.ldquoI want to thank John for delivering the institutions that we have today, they may not be perfect, but it brought peace to our streets and I want to thank John for leaving the blueprint for us all to build upon.SDLP councillor Dermot Curran called his former party leader as being ldquoa man of the people, for the people in his tribute.He said: ldquoAlong with the late Eddie McGrady, we worked with John a lot over the years, particularly when he was an MEP in Europe over fishing interests.ldquoI always remember he would tell me that he never sought to be a leader, only to help people. That stuck with me and it was something that I carried with me in my work.ldquoHis unstinting work for peace and what he did for us all cannot be understated.Due to Covid- restrictions, the Book of Condolence is now available online at https:www.newrymournedown.org chairpersons-book-of-condolences until Monday, August .All messages in the online book will be recorded by Newry, Mourne and Down Council and sent directly to Mr Humersquos family..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/5th August 2020 Saintfield.jpg","title":"Saintfield Horse Show success  ","story":"THIS yearrsquos Saintfield Horse Show on Saturday at Eugene Milliganrsquos ldquomagnicent venue in Castlewellan was hailed as one of the best shows and attracted a large number of entries mdash despite the impact of the coronavirus lockdown.Competitors came from all over the island and were delighted with the huge, flat rings and the well laid out ground.Show director Joan Cunningham said: ldquoThere was sun, fun and something for everyone who attended.

Most of Europe was basking in a heatwav and race morning arrived with temperatures already at  degrees.The race statistics were scary with , metres of climbing to be covered in only .km race distance. The lsquowallrsquo to the finish line had a maximum gradient of an eye-watering %..In the early stages Hanna found himself in the leading group of five with the cream of the Italian mountain racing scene.Included in the quality field were lsquovertical kilometrersquo specialist Henry Aymonod, Davide Magnini, one of the best uphill and sky runners in the world, former European mountain racing champion Martin Dematteis and Frenchman Sylvain Cachard.At around half distance Aymonod put in a surge and Hanna tried to follow with Dematteis being ped from the group.On to the upper slopes and Hanna was at the back of the group of three in fourth place. Then with less than m nearly vertical metres to go, he surged past Cachard to move into thirrd place and crossed the line in  minutes and  seconds. The winner, Aymonod, was home in : with Magnini second in :. Hannarsquos training regime, which included running upwards of  miles a week near his home on the Slieve Croob, gave him the strength to tackle back-to-back races.So after the lung-bursting steepness of Saturday, Sunday morning at :am brought the challenge of the Fletta Trail over close to half-marathon distance with climbing and descending back to the starting point in the village of Malonno.Francesco Puppi, the local Italian favourite and second in the World Long Distance Championships in Patagonia last November and world champion in , was in the race, fresh after not racing on Saturday.Seasoned Italian international Cesare Maestri was also in the field and he too had not raced the day before.As the race set off, these two were joined at the front by Francersquos Sylvain Cachard. Hanna settled into the next bunch, finding his climbing legs quickly and reached the summit in fourth place over half a minute clear of Martin Dematteis.One of the best climbers in the field, Hanna continues to hone his descending skills too and he held on for a long time on the descent in fourth before being caught by Dematteis.However, he achieved a brilliant fth place finish, taking the scalp of the Aymonod, the winner the day before, and many other top runners..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/5th August 2020 United.jpg","title":"United front in drive to restore Downe services  ","story":"HEALTH campaigners have welcomed the new united front in the campaign to restore key services to the Downe Hospital.Politicians, trade unions and the Down Community Health Committee worked alongside each other in lobbying the South Eastern Trust to restore emergency services at the Downpatrick hospital which is scheduled to happen on October .In a throwback to previous campaigns, all of the districtrsquos political parties and trade unions are now working alongside hospital campaigners to secure the future of the Downe and to argue for a range of new services.Campaigners say while they will be keeping a watching brief to ensure that the hospitalrsquos AE reopens in October as planned, they are also conscious of the ongoing province-wide review of urgent and emergency care.The review mdash commissioned by the Department of Health ndash aims to establish a new regional care model for Northern Ireland with any future proposals subject to public consultation.At a socially distanced meeting of the community health group in Killough last week, campaigners said that future proposals for the Downe arising out of the review could be crucial and potentially be the launchpad for a major new battleground.Confirmation of theof emergency services in October comes after it was revealed that over the past five years there has been a % increase in AE attendances at hospitals across Northern Ireland.Signicantly, Department of Health figures reveal that the biggest increase mdash .% mdash was at the Downe, with the number of patients increasing from , to ,.Health campaigners say the figure represents another ldquostrong, persuasive reason why they must continue to fight for a local emergency department which is valued and needed.They are delighted with the plannedof AE services, suggesting that with the fastest growing emergency department in Northern Ireland, there is a ldquostrong, logical statistical argument for not only retaining the service, but enhancing it.Health committee chairman Eamonn McGrady,revealed that analysis of increased attendances at emergency departments shows that the growth area is not Belfast, but at hospitals in the Southern , Northern , Westernand South Easternhealth trusts.He added: ldquoWe know we are not home until the Downersquos emergency department is reopened in October and and we will all be keeping a watching brief.Mrs Anne Trainor said she was ldquomore prepared than ever to work harder for the Downe as she will never be able to repay the debt of gratitude that she owes the hospital and its excellent staff for helping her ill husband.She also described a recent meeting with senior officials from the South Eastern Trust to discuss theof emergency services to the Downpatrick hospital as ldquorobust and revealed she was left perplexed when health minister Robin Swann said health officials would ldquoexplore the feasibility of reopening the department.ldquoThis particular service has been part of the Downe Hospital for years. Its need has been proven. There was no need to explore the feasibility of anything, she said.Mrs Trainor said the outcome of the meeting with health officials was that politicians, the community and trade unions stood together in demanding theof AE provision.She added: ldquoThis very much reminded me of the early days of the hospital campaign where everyone was saying the same thing. We won the case for the Downe but, from day one, administrators started to strip services from it.ldquoOver recent days what has given me the greatest heart has been the reaction of the politicians, the community and trade unions on the Downe Hospital issue.Mrs Trainor said she hopes that the unity will continue, insisting that when it comes to hospital services, the people of Downe are asking for nothing more than parity with those in other areas.ldquoThere has been substantial underfunding in this district for many years and we need parity with everyone  alongside rural proofing as, for those in authority, the centralisation of services is still very much alive. Their attitude is that everything stops in Belfast, she continued.ldquoBut everything does not have to be centralised in the city. The Downe is a beautul hospital but is being totally underused, yet it is one of the most modern of its kind. There is room to expand to increase service provision and we also want more consultants and staff alongside increased investment for student nurses.Mrs Trainor added: ldquoThere is total unity across the community on these issues and a strong defence of the Downe Hospital.ldquoThe hospital is the single biggest issue in our district. There is strength in our unity and togetherness.

In the obituaries for John Hume, after his death last week, many writers focussed on his belief in an ‘agreed Ireland’ that included all the ‘traditions’ on this island.  \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues. Please try again later.Submitting...From a unionist perspective, the problem with this philosophy was that it treated unionism as a culture or identity within one Irish ‘nation’, rather than a rational, defensible political allegiance to the United Kingdom that only makes sense in a British context.Justiably, Hume’s outlook attracted criticism, but people from a unionist background have not always done much to dispel his perception. Recently, in the News Letter, Jeffrey Dudgeon ‘The endgame for unionists still has a long way to run,’ July  and Alex Kane Unionism needs a strategy, July  exchanged ideas about the future of unionism . While they both had dferent perspectives, I think they would agree that, particularly recently, the sense of crisis and negativity among unionists has deepened. Partly, this is because nationalist attacks on Northern Ireland’s place in the UK have become more virulent, but ultimately it is not up to nationalists to pull unionists out of their tailspin of negativity.Then, there is the dficulty of making preserving the status quo seem exciting. It is no accident that parties try to market themselves as a ‘vote for change’, even when they are linked firmly to the establishment. It is human nature to be dissatisfied with what we have got. I certainly would not suggest that unionists should stop worrying about the things they oppose. The proposed Irish Sea border, corruption of the legacy process, assaults on the Belfast Agreement’s three strands, the campaign to change citizenship law here— they are all important and insidious. It is not enough to look the other way. At some level, though, we have got to start telling a more positive story about what we want, rather than always talking about what we’re against.For that reason, it might be a useful exercise for unionists to think seriously about what unionism consists of in its most basic sense. What are the principles that nearly all unionists could sign up to  And,you were starting a unionist party from scratch, what would be its most fundamental aims  A ‘mission statement’you like that kind of jargon.Rather than leave the question hanging, I have had a think about the objectives that are most important to me. Quite deliberately, they are big, vague statements of principle, butyou cannot work out the essentials, then you are never going to master the details.By my thinking, the purpose of unionist parties in Northern Ireland is : • . to strengthen the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. And to maintain and consolidate Northern Ireland’s place in the UK. • . To ensure that Northern Ireland plays as full a role as possible in the social, political and economic le of thenation. • . To encourage positive relationships with our neighbours across the island of Ireland. And to make Northern Ireland a happy and prosperous home for people of all backgrounds.I know many of you would have things to add, or you might dispute the order and the emphasis, but I hope that most unionists agree broadly that these things are important. The critical point is that our leaders could do with thinking more carefully about what it is they want, then they can test their policies and strategies against how likely they are to achieve those aims. It is important too, to keep things clear and understandable. I know from experience that, when you get politically minded people in a room, it is easy to end up with a long complicated text that’s full of platitudes and buzzwords. If you cannot explain what you want clearly and simply, voters are not going to bother decoding a lot of jargon.Perhaps the statements above look too obvious, or like they go without saying. But,that is the case, why do so many people misrepresent unionism or get the basics wrong If there’s a proper effort to consistently think things through from first principles, then it will sharpen up unionists’ ideas about which issues are important, when we should be unbending and when we should show flexibility. If unionism wants to reach new people, then it needs to tell them a coherent story about what it wants and what it stands for.Alex Kane: ‘ Unionism needs a strategy because this is the endgame,’ July Jeff Dudgeon: ‘The endgame for unionists to which Alex Kane refers still has a long way to run,’ July ——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityAs reported in the Penarth Times on Thursday, the town councilsaid the results show ldquowidespread backing for changes.The survey, which attracted  responses, showed  per cent of people thought there should be more outdoor space for pedestrians and businesses.Seventy-five per cent thought parking arrangements needed to change, and  per cent said the town needs to ldquoprepare for the future.Some traders, who oppose the changes ndash specically a one-way traffic system around the town and making Windsor Road and Lower Glebe Street a traffic free zone, have said the questions in the survey were too generalised and misleading.As a result of the survey, Penarth Town Council have proposed the following changes to the original ideas:Windsor Road from Arcot Street to the roundabout as a ldquoshared space for delivery vehicles and buses, with a mph speed limit.Lower Glebe Street as a ldquoshared space for delivery vehicles and disabled bays. Other vehicles should not use Lower Glebe Street as a through road.Bus stops will remain as they are. There were concerns over the impact of a bus stop on Hickman Road for traders, due to air pollution, noise pollution and congestion.A two-way system to remain on Stanwell Road from the library to the traffic lights, to allow easy access to the bus stop on Rectory Road and to prevent congestion and ldquorat running through Hickman Road and Arcot Street. A two-way system to also remain from Windsor Road to Railway Terrace.The number of parking bays has also changed. There will now be  extra bays proposed, with  of them on Plassey Street.The leader of the town council, Cllr Rhiannon Birch, explained the findings and what happens next.ldquoEven before Covid-, town centres across the country were facing issues, including the need to modernise infrastructure, and the impact of online shopping, she said. ldquoThe current pandemic has added to the scale of the challenge.ldquoThe consultation shows that a clear majority recognise the need for a degree of change in the town centre, both for it to survive in the present and to thrive in future.ldquoThe results call for the establishment of a greater degree of safe space and proposals which increase a degree of pedestrianisation whilst also increasing parking spaces.ldquoThe results show substantial agreement on these aims. Reflecting this widespread and clear response, Penarth Town Council calls on our partners in the Vale of Glamorgan Council to embrace the results and recommendations.ldquoSpecically, Penarth Town Council believes that creating a safer environment through the closure of Windsor Road to traffic for part of the day, between Arcot Street and the roundabout, including the Lower Glebe Street, would be the best way to ensure that people can feel confident about shopping safely. It would allow safe use of the space in front of shops, bars, cafes and restaurants.ldquoIt also lessens the need for one-way systems on pavements for pedestrians, which are perplexing for many and hard to implement. These proposals can be achieved in a way which also increases the amount of parking spaces available.The results will now be put to the Vales Planning Committee for consultation.For more information, visit https:www.penarthtowncouncil.gov.uk news survey-results Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Officials state that the road will be open to traffic in the evenings during the week and all day on Saturday and Sunday.”He added, “It is also great to see work commencing in Laurelvale and Mullavilly with an investment of close to £,. A closure scheme in a similar manner will see the road closed from Monday  August to Friday  September between the hours of .am and .pm and access maintained for residents throughout the works phase and the roads will be open outside of construction hours.”He added, “When both sets of works are combined this represents a signicant investment locally in the constituency. The roads in question will certainly benefit from this work and in both instances the surfaces have been slowly deteriorating over time.”“Whilst there will be iniably disruption to traffic flow during the works, it will be a worthwhile scheme to ensure that the road surfaces in both locations are maintained to the standards expected and I thank Transport NI for this investment.”William Irwin MLAMr Berry said roads in the Mullavilly Road area of Laurelvale had been in a ‘dreadful state’ for a long time.He said: “I have lobbied Infrastructure NI for few years now and kept in close contact to ensure that the main street and a section of road from the bus shelter and footpaths be resurfaced. That section of road has been in dreadful state for a long time and the water gathered along the road, so drainage is key. There is also a need to look again at the current ramps as they are in over  years now and need redesigned. Obviously there is going to be traffic disruption over the next number of weeks but long term these road improvements will be great long term for the Village.”A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

Kiro.“Kiro has given us such respite. He is such a great puppy. He loves walking and is very happy. We couldn’t understand it when we heard clicking sounds on his hips,” said Christopher.He said when they visited the owner of the pups, they saw the puppy’s mother and were assured by the woman they had bought Kiro from that both were in good health. “They all looked to be in good health,” said Christopher.He explained that they took him to the vet for his first injections. “The vet stretched his hips and said everything was Ok,” said Christopher.Kiro“We became concerned as he was starting to ‘bunny hop’ when he was running andwe picked him up he would yelp,” he said.They took Kiro back to the same veterinary surgery for the second set of injections. Christopher said they were told that everything was good.But two weeks ago they noticed his hips were ‘clicking’.This time they went to a vets in Lurgan who said they could feel Kiro’s hips were ‘pretty bad’.“He has Canine Juvenile Hip Dysplasia and it is pretty bad,” said Christopher.The -year-old who isn’t working and is a full time carer for his mother and father, said they had taken out pet insurance but sadly it was not enough cover for this particular condition.He explained that it is a genetic condition and rectying it with a double hip replacement is going to cost around £k. Already they have managed to raise £,.“To give you an idea of how bad his case is, our vet explained that the worst case scenario would be a score of , where malamutes usually sit at around a .. Kiro’s hip scores are a .. This means he will require two hip replacements pretty much as soon as possible.“We understand it’s a dficult time to be asking for donations, and this is a last resort for us. “Our aim is to raise enough funds to get Kiro a double total hip replacement which would give him a new lease of le. “However,we aren’t able to raise enough funds for this, we will be using the money to give Kiro a double partial hip replacement which will help to signicantly reduce his pain. “Our vet also explained to us that by the time he is two years old, his condition will have worsened, therefore it is important we are able to give him the care he needs as soon as possible.”If you would like to help check out the Go Fund Me page here https:www.gofundme f kiros-hip-replacements utm_sourcecustomerutm_mediumcopy_linkutm_campaignp_cf+share-flow-fbclidIwARpDXrMFqgiBCOaISkLOKBos_YVaGicl_YbRFBEIpWJRHJOMYLrkA message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.
