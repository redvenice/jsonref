These include flood, fire, or even when a murder prevents the site from opening.Business owners have filed claims to Hiscox and other commercial insurers in recent days, only to be told their policies don’t cover the pandemic.Last week, the Financial Conduct Authority told insurers to halt idend payments to allow them to pay claims. It had already told insurers it expects them to treat customers fairly.A group of brokers and loss adjusters havejoined forces and will ask a barrister to examine the policies, with a view to taking legal action.The Hiscox Action Group said the firm’s policies clearly state they will pay up where the interruption to the business was “due to restrictions imposed by a public authority following an occurrence of a notifiable human disease”.Other insurers, including Eaton Gate, have similar terms and expected to face similar legal action in the coming months, the group said.Alan Dexter, who runs four restaurants in Glasgow, including Barsa Tapas, said two of his premises have business interruption cover provided by Hiscox but his claims were last week denied. He has been forced to put his 140 staff on furlough because of the crisis.Dexter said: “Our broker pointed out that the cover states we can claim in the event of a notifiable disease, and, to my untrained eye, the policy appears to cover the exact circumstance I and many other business owners find themselves in. But after taking several days, Hiscox last week came back and said it would not be paying our claim. The company markets itself in its publicity material as the insurer that always pays out, but that has not been my experience.”Roger Topping, who runs TopMark Adjusters, a Glasgow-based firm of loss adjusters and one of those behind the legal challenge, has called on the insurers to pay or for the government to step in.Topping said: “We have heard ministers tell insurers to pay these claims but, to my knowledge, not a single insurer has broken ranks and paid a claim. This is not just a Hiscox issue, several other companies including Eaton Gate, an insurer backed by Royal Sun Alliance, are in a similar position. It seems that the massive losses involved have caused the insurance industry to start searching for reasons not to pay.”He called for the government and insurers to find a solution before “a multitude of legal actions against insurers begin, and massive sums of money are wasted on legal fees. We need something along the lines adopted previously for claims following riots, flooding, or what we saw in Northern Ireland at the height of the Troubles.”Hiscox said: “We understand that these are incredibly difficult times for businesses affected by Covid-19. At Hiscox we strive to pay claims that are covered by the policies fairly and quickly.“However, general business interruption policies across the industry, including Hiscox’s, were not designed to cover these extraordinary circumstances. Like terrorism and flood, which have government-backed insurance schemes, pandemics like coronavirus are simply too large and too systemic for private insurers to cover,” it added.Last month, the Association of British Insurers told parliament’s business committee that few companies would be protected for their losses by their insurance policies."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8560469c2bea04fed8080954b002278a1fc6c6ac/2_0_10663_6400/master/10663.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e54abe9aa2bd313a5a14c6238a3fad9e","title":"easter is a time to connect so even in isolation lets cherish the ties that bind","story":"During the lockdown, we’ve discovered that what truly matters is empathy and kindness and collaborationYesterday, I had a conversation with the delivery driver, who I must have seen many times before but have never really talked to. We told each other to keep safe I said I was grateful for all he was doing and he said “bless you” and blew me a kiss. I talked, at a distance, with the postman. I went to the supermarket and in the snaking, spaced queue, I chatted to the person in front, the person behind and the one to my side and it was like a rueful little party. I talked through the glass to the woman at the checkout and she told me how she was feeling about her new duties and how she was tired out.I talked across the hedge to my 85-year-old neighbour when I delivered his milk and vegetables and he gave me a little plant in a pot that he’d grown as a thank you. I rang a friend to tell her I loved her. I smiled at the stranger on the other side of the road and she waved at me, because it felt like we were suddenly friends, made so by going through the same experience together, the one everyone is going through, kept apart by the virus and yet drawn together by it.I can’t see my daughter, who’s a doctor and working all hours. I can’t see my mother, in her late 80s and frail and doughty, who I want to put my arms around. But in this radically rearranged world of ours, I am suddenly seeing people who were always there but I have been blind to and I am belatedly learning to value them as they should always have been valued. In these days of fear and loss, everybody is dependent on the kindness of strangers.At Easter, families expect to come together, friends to gather, congregations to kneel in collective prayer. But the music has stopped and here we are, each of us suspended in our particular place, as if time had also stopped, the giddy momentum of life halted.Some are with people they love some with people they need to escape but cannot others are quite alone. Some are privileged enough to have a garden and open spaces others are pinned in tiny rooms. Some are suffering unimaginable hardships and losses. All of us are living in a profoundly changed world, where we can no longer go where we choose, see who we want, hug who we will, feel safe, think of the body as a source of desire and comfort and connection.Humans need connection - we are social animals and exist in a network of reciprocal relationships. Solitary confinement is a form of torture that can swiftly drive people mad: locked into the cell of the self, the world does not reach them and they cannot reach out into the world. Words need to be heard, pain recognised, joy shared. Loneliness is hazardous.These past extraordinary weeks have shown how much we yearn for connection and also how ingenious, funny, imaginative, heartbreakingly generous and kind people can be in maintaining it in spite of imposed isolation. Skype and FaceTime and Houseparty and Zoom (whoever had heard of Zoom in February? Not me) competitions and online quizzes, board games, long-distance drinks and dinners, room crawls, online lessons, energetic workouts and yoga sessions, stitched-together concerts with each musician in their own room and yet fused by the music they produce, blogs and vlogs and old-fashioned phone calls, emails and handwritten letters, invitations to imitate a work of art, share a recipe, learn a poem…More than this, I have heard over and over how people say they are talking to each other now – talking as they never have before, revealing themselves. It is as if a skin has been peeled away sometimes painfully, we have come face to face with our own vulnerability and precariousness. A boy dies in hospital without his family and is buried without them relatives look through windows at their loved ones in residential homes people say goodbye to the gravely ill by Skype.We can no longer pretend to ourselves we are self-sufficient, autonomous, invincible and in control. More helpless, more exposed, more reliant on the generosity of others and aware of our own mortality, we can speak things we previously kept hidden. We can ask ourselves what really matters, in this world of ours that we all hold in common.Loneliness is a grief, sometimes a kind of despair. It is possible that during these coronavirus days, the profoundly lonely in our society have felt less so. People are talking to them now neighbours they have never previously met are knocking on their door and offering to help or are asking for their help. A mighty collective experience draws everyone together and the brief, crisis-driven experience of isolation may have given us more empathetic understanding of what it is to be truly alone and on the margins of society.These days will come to an end. We will be able to travel the country, swim in the sea, sit in each other’s rooms, lean over tables in restaurants and pubs, dance, hug each other at last with bodies that are no longer contagious. But we mustn’t go back to the world that we were living in before or unlearn the hard-won lessons of collaboration, kindness, empathy and human vulnerability. We mustn’t stop seeing and valuing the delivery driver, the hospital cleaner, the residential worker, the woman at the checkout, the neighbour over the fence, the stranger on the other side of the road, the person in need, the old and the frail and the forgotten, those hidden in life’s shadows.When this is over, there will still be the isolated and lonely, who for a few months may have been included in a shared purpose and collective experience. Easter, for those with faith and those without, is a festival of life and death. It’s about redemption and it asks what it means to be human. In the midst of fear and helplessness and loss, because of fear and helplessness and loss, we can begin to change. We can do it better. No going back.• Nicci Gerrard is an Observer journalist and the author of What Dementia Teaches Us About Love"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/62d495cb237944e2ea046a3677222edbbeef5e4b/148_162_3147_1889/master/3147.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8c29bc326c5ea87f1e7a3cd0ea3bc27c","title":"inequality pandemic lockdown","story":"Historically, disease outbreaks have happened at a time of social inequality and discordA lot has been written about how this pandemic is exacerbating social inequalities. But what if it’s because our societies are so unequal that this pandemic happened?There is a school of thought that, historically, pandemics have been more likely to occur at times of social inequality and discord. As the poor get poorer, the thinking goes, their baseline health suffers, making them more prone to infection. At the same time they are forced to move more, in search of work, and to gravitate to cities. The rich, meanwhile, have more to spend on luxuries, including products that hail from far-flung places. The world becomes more tightly connected through trade, and germs, people and luxury goods travel together along trade routes that connect cities. On paper, it looks like a perfect storm.What about in reality? Historian Peter Turchin has described a strong statistical association between global connectedness, social crises and pandemics throughout history. An example is the second century CE, when the Roman and Chinese empires were at the peak of their wealth and power the poor in both places were very poor, and the ancient silk routes were enjoying a heyday. Starting in 165CE, the Antonine plagues struck Rome within a decade plague was devastating China too, and both empires then went into decline.The plague of Justinian in the 6th century and the Black Death in the 14th century emerged in similar circumstances, and Turchin sees the same forces at work again today: globalisation, leading to the emergence of new human pathogens, combined with widening inequality. “And now it looks like our Age of Discord got its own pandemic,” he wrote in a blog last week.Pandemics don’t always trigger social unrest, but they can do, by throwing into relief the very inequalities that caused them. That’s because they hit the poor hardest – those in low-paid or unstable employment, who live in crowded accommodation, have underlying health issues, and for whom healthcare is less affordable or less accessible. This was true in the past and remains so today. During the 2009 flu pandemic the death rate was three times higher in the poorest fifth of England’s population than in the richest. Covid-19 is showing no signs of departing from the pattern, which, because of the way the socioeconomic dice fall, also has a racial dimension.But there is something brand new about this pandemic, which has never been seen before in the history of humanity – and that is our unprecedented global experiment in lockdown. These lockdown measures are designed to slow the spread of the disease, relieve the burden on health systems and ultimately save lives – and it looks as if they may be doing that. But they may also be exacerbating social inequalities themselves.We won’t have a full picture of their impact until the pandemic is over, but there have been anecdotal reports that point to this, and some more systematic analyses are emerging. Preliminary findings from a survey of 1,200 Norwegians, published last week, indicate that people with lower levels of education and income are more likely to be temporarily laid off. They can apply for a government furlough scheme, similar to the one in the UK, but they are also more likely to see their income fall and to worry that their unemployment might become permanent.The Norwegian study found no correlation between poverty and self-reported sickness from Covid-19, but it did find that poorer, less well-educated people were less likely to comply with social distancing guidelines. It’s hard to tell why, says demographer Svenn-Erik Mamelund of Oslo politan University, who was involved in the survey, but he has theories.People in lower socioeconomic groups may feel more pressure to go out to work, Mamelund says. They may also have lower levels of health literacy, less trust in officialdom, and even language problems if they are of non-Norwegian origin. He fears that these lower levels of compliance with public health measures might spill into higher levels of sickness and death later on, as they are exposed to the disease.Whether these measures are justified by the threat Covid-19 poses to human life is impossible to say, but those who imposed them knew there would be a high price to pay. Last year Mamelund sat on a committee that advised the World Health Organization on non-pharmaceutical interventions in case of a pandemic. The committee’s job was to assess the costs and benefits of measures for slowing disease spread – everything from hand-washing to border closure – based on the available evidence. They came up with a list of recommendations that excluded lockdown, even in the worst-case scenario. “We never suggested lockdown because we knew it would be so harmful socially and economically for all countries,” he says. “And I never thought the rest of the world would follow China’s lead.”Norway has a small population – 5.4 million people – and a well-funded welfare state. There have been no protests there, so far, but the social impact of lockdown has been more visible elsewhere. In India there have been reports of deaths among unemployed migrant workers returning home in search of food many countries, including the US, have seen workers taking industrial action, and anger has been expressed in rural communities over wealthy city-dwellers retreating to their second homes for the duration.Governments should keep an eye on these developments, in weighing up when and how to lift the lockdown, because even if it’s difficult to argue today that the cure is worse than the disease, the cure might provoke an entirely different malaise – and history teaches us that no society is immune to that.That’s the symptomatic treatment. In the long term, of course, they – and we – should address the dreadful inequality in our societies, which this pandemic is picking apart with a lethal scalpel.• Laura Spinney is a science journalist, novelist and author.

Drew McIntyre is a WWE Superstar. Hundreds of millions of people know this, but many others do not. This is the nature of World Wrestling Entertainment Superstardom – and Drew McIntyre is cheerfully resigned to it. He looks heavy, physically, as though it would take six or seven men – normal men – or eight or nine little weaklings like me, to lift him. Drew McIntyre could lift himself up, though, because he has the raw power of an industrial digger. He’s lounging on a sofa in front of me, pre-lockdown, a steak dinner lingering just behind him. And though he is unfailingly polite – thoughtful and sincere with just a crispy little burnt crust of humour round the edges – he does give off the energy, palpably, that he could toss the sofa he’s sitting on up in the air like a baseball and headbutt it through the adjacent wall. He is at once capable of tenderly nuzzling a small puppy and kicking someone’s head through a pub urinal – and that’s what makes him such a captivating superstar. He is hard and soft. He is meat and iron. There’s a lot going on with him.Earlier this year, McIntyre became the first Briton to win WWE’s Royal Rumble, a wrestling centrepiece event where dozens of the organisation’s storylines converge in a 30-man brawl from which a sole winner emerges. Meanwhile millions of wrestling fans all over the world stay at home watching late into the night, elbow-dropping their furniture in jubilation. Last week, in an empty arena, but viewed by an inflated audience self-isolating at home, he won his title-decider against American wrestling royalty Brock Lesnar in what is the sport’s answer to the Superbowl – WrestleMania 36 – becoming the first Brit ever to do so.So: Drew McIntyre is at the absolute top of his game. Drew McIntyre is making history right now. Drew McIntyre is a megastar. Drew McIntyre is a superstar. But it almost didn’t happen at all.We should first briefly confront the reality of wrestling. If you are 10 years old, please don’t read this bit… Yes, it is scripted. And many of the feuds aren’t real (a surprisingly high number of them, however, are). But saying wrestling is inauthentic for not being based on actual frenzied violence is like blasting ballet dancers for not being swans. It zooms out too pragmatically from the centre of the entertainment itself, ignores the high art of pirouetting elbow-first on to someone’s head without killing them in front of an 80,000-strong crowd who you’ve made fall so in love with you that they are deliriously chanting your name. Wrestling, at it’s best, is a Shakespearean good-versus-bad story told through audacious acts of physical violence and microphone shit-talking. And it’s big business. Big, big, astonishingly big, business.Some facts: according to the Forbes list, WrestleMania is the sixth most valuable sports brand in the world, ahead of the Winter Olympics and the Champions League (the Champions League!). You might not watch it, but heaps of other people do. WWE programming streams to more than 800m households worldwide every year, in 180 countries and in 28 different languages. The MattelWWE action figure collaboration is frequently within Mattel’s top-two most sold toys. The various WWE imprints have a combined billion-plus followers on social media. If you still don’t get how big it all is, imagine every football fan on Earth glued to the exact same soap opera.McIntyre – whose real name is Drew Galloway, which is important to note, because occasionally Galloway answers and occasionally McIntyre does – was 21 when he signed to WWE. (He is now 34.) He was the first Scotsman ever to do so and for a while everything seemed to be going smoothly. He’d become a wrestling nut at 10, and by 15 was pestering his mother to let him train full time by 17, he’d broken into Scottish independent wrestling and was making his way as a professional. When he was 23, the WWE boss Vince McMahon walked into a packed centre of an arena in Oklahoma and announced that the then semi-unknown McIntyre – baby-faced, smooth-chested, ponytailed and boxed into a big-man suit, looking for all the world like a wedding saxophonist rather than someone who could bench-press a tank – was his “Chosen One”, a future world champion in the making. And then… he wasn’t.For the duration of his 20s, WWE didn’t know what to do with McIntyre. After an impressive start, he began to struggle for airtime, and then drifted down the ranks. He had all the raw ingredients. At 6ft 5in, he was an athletic marvel, capable of extraordinary acts of in-ring physicality. But wrestling isn’t just about how high you can kick and how convincingly you can take a steel chair to the face. Wrestling is an industry shaped by scriptwriters, tradition and – crucially – the whims of the crowd – and McIntyre managed to slip the notice of all three. By the age of 29 he was partying too much and standing out too little. In 2014, he was finally released from his WWE contract.McIntyre had started small because he’d had to – 17 years ago, there was barely a British scene to wrestle in. In the summer between sixth form and university, he worked with independent wrestling tours that played the Butlin’s circuit. Travelling five or six days a week, playing nightly to crowds of up to 2,000, he learned the basics by jumping in at the deep end. “It taught me how to play for large audiences who weren’t wrestling fans,” he says now. “You had to learn your audience and how to make them cheer for you as the good guy, or boo you as the bad guy – and then give them a good show. Some would obviously think, ‘Oh, wrestling, I don’t like wrestling.’ But by the end of the night, I knew they’d be on their feet.”“But how do you do that?” I ask, and McIntyre goes to a wistful, distant place.“I’m trying to think how to verbalise it… it comes kind of naturally, now. I guess it’s just telling the simplest story you can tell. And the great thing about wrestling, it’s a blank canvas. You’re out there, you’re live – you’re doing your own stunts – and through the match, hopefully you can tell a simple good guybad guy story for everyone to understand. Hopefully, the bad guy will get on the crowd and give them something to work with: get them all riled up so they go, ‘man I want someone to punch their face off’. That’s where the good guy comes in. And then you get to play the part of the audience member, punching their face off on their behalf.” You sense that the basics of those early wrestling days – goodies, baddies and Butlin’s – are still in place, now, in the multimillion dollar events McIntyre heads up, the storylines more polished, maybe, the muscles more oiled, but the primal structure underpinning it the same. He is the force for good, Brock Lesnar is the force of evil, and someone is going to punch someone’s face off, and we’re all going to go nuts.He leans forward, still in the zone.“And once you get the crowd, you know, into it like that, then there’s nothing more fun than playing with their emotions. When the bad guy is beating the good guy, and they’re like” – he drops his voice in mock fury – “‘God I just want this guy to get up and punch him,’ and when he finally does get a punch in the face, and everybody explodes? That’s the best feeling in the world. And that’s the art to it, I guess.” You may think wrestling is a billion-dollar industry built on muscles, but you’re wrong. It’s built on emotions, too.After WWE let him go, McIntyre stared into the mirror and figured out what he wanted. His first move was to throw himself back into the independent circuit as hard as he possibly could. (His second move was to grow a gnarly beard.) In that period, it seems as if McIntyre took every non-WWE match on the planet: he won titles under the Insane Championship Wrestling and Evolve brands, as well as domestic belts in Australia, Scotland and Denmark. “When I was fired I told myself: ‘This is on you.’ The only person I had to blame was myself. I said: ‘This was the dream you wanted. You’re gonna have to prove to everybody you are who they thought you were in the beginning.’ And from that moment on, I was in the gym, working as hard as I could. I was travelling as much as I could. Anybody who would have me, I would wrestle for them. Any interview I could do to practise getting better at situations like this, I would do, just to build myself up in every possible area.”“I know I like to pretend I was confident the whole time and that things were going to work out, but I was very scared, realistically, that things weren’t. And yeah, I just put on a ‘fake it ‘til you make it’ face, I kept a confident face on. But behind closed doors – and we’ve been talking a lot about this recently, my wife and I – she’s been reminding me how I was feeling during that period. I was gone from the company and I was worried and I was anxious and I was angry and... all these different emotions. In my mind, I’m good at blocking out negative memories. In my mind I believed I was right back on the horse and I succeeded instantly, which is not exactly true. And I think the big turning point for everything was breaking my neck one time.”A cursory read of McIntyre’s story – working hard and getting what he wanted so young, busting the flush, learning the hard way, microwaving a Tupperware of eggs for breakfast because he broke his own neck, getting told to do things then furiously doing them – is, simply, he was a man in his 20s, once. He was young and he was cocky and he needed to be taught that a little humility and a lot of facial hair could transform him completely. I start to ask if, had he had the opportunities he’s fought for now in his early career, he would have made the most of them, and for the first time in our conversation he interrupts me. “I would not have been able to pull them off,” he says. “Maybe physically – in the ring, OK – but I wouldn’t have been able to handle myself.” In a world of manufactured storylines, McIntyre’s genuine life arc is one of the more compelling. Like wrestling, his life is just a simple story studded with exquisite acts of violence. And kicking Brock Lesnar’s face off in an arena last week is just another dose of destiny along the way.WrestleMania 36 is now on the WWE Network"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/626c3e6fccdf4aeee16d455b678bd3df3ea116bf/0_17_2835_1703/master/2835.jpg?width=645\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=69ca34aae1c9bf39b287ccf11e71e894 1290w","title":"universities brace for huge losses as foreign students drop out","story":"Call for a government bailout worth billions to help sector survive the crisisSome universities are already expecting to lose more than £100m as foreign students cancel their studies, with warnings that the impact of coronavirus will be “like a tsunami hitting the sector”.Universities are already lining up online courses for the start of the next year, but academics are concerned about the impact on first-year students new to university life. Many institutions have recently borrowed heavily to pay for attractive new faculties, often designed to attract overseas students. It comes against a backdrop of declining numbers of university-age students in the UK and the previous uncertainty around Brexit.Andrew Connors, head of higher education at Lloyds Banking Group, said the crisis has felt “less like a perfect storm and more like a tsunami hitting the sector”. Banks have not had urgent requests from universities, as big financial hits are expected later in the year. However, he said that “while the immediate impact we are seeing in the sector is slower, the overall impact of Covid-19 is potentially deeper and longer”.He adds that he expects banks to offer UK universities loans where needed, given their significance in the economy. He warns, however: “I worked through the financial crisis of 200708 and it does not compare in my experience to what we are witnessing now – this crisis has touched everybody in some shape or form and many previously viable businesses are now in a fight for survival.”The Office for Students, the independent regulator of higher education, has already streamlined its rules in the wake of the crisis, calling for universities to sound the alarm if they fear they’ll run short of cash within 30 days.Universities UK, the industry body, has proposed a series of measures to the government to double research funding and offer emergency loans to troubled institutions, as well as placing a cap on the number of undergraduates many institutions can recruit in 2020-21.Nick Hillman, Hepi’s director, warned that universities only had limited options to cut their costs. “There are things they can do to mitigate the impact, such as doing all they can to ensure international students keep coming, pausing the development of their estates, doing less research, looking at their staffing and persuading home final-year students to stay on for postgraduate study. But some were in financial difficulties even before the current crisis.“If international student numbers are down a lot, we have a big problem. The ones with lots of international students could still potentially fill their places with home students (who pay lower fees) but that just leaves a problem lower down the tree.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1890c73fc558f3195e6b13ed62fb16534af9dffc/0_0_3500_2333/master/3500.jpg?width=700\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=4425c3715182855ebdc0a7315a57650b 1400w","title":"forget sourdough how to make 10 of the worlds easiest breads","story":"Keen to bake for your family or housemates, but put off by previous attempts? Here are delicious options – including some that don’t require yeast, and one that doesn’t even need an ovenIn times of great uncertainty, knowing how to make your own bread and thereby feed your family, is palpably reassuring. The very act of kneading dough is calming, like Play-Doh for adults. So, of course, newbie bakers are all over social media, obsessing about “bubbling mothers” (AKA sourdough starters).Look a little closer, though, and they’re not very happy. “We are all baking bread and some of us are not so good at it,” tweeted one journalist, dejectedly. That’s because sourdough is high-maintenance baking. People write memoirs about mastering the technique. By contrast, watching Noji Gaylard making South African steamed bread (see below) is like hugging a baby. Three minutes and 30 seconds of pure calm. His recipe, alongside the others included in our 10 basic breads, is easy enough for even the most inexperienced baker.But first a note about yeast. As Adrian Chiles has noted, it appears to have been stockpiled right off all the shelves. So, if you do have any, set aside a portion of whatever leavened dough you make to leaven the next (variously called old dough and pâte fermentée you’ll find plenty of instructions for this online). And, if you don’t, you could try making your own yeast. Lisa Bedford, the self-styled Survival Mom, has written a really thorough how-to. I appreciate that making your own yeast somewhat negates the premise of this piece, but you’ve got to admit it’s awesome that you can.Also, reserve any pasta or potato cooking water for your bread baking. As Nigella tweeted: “It will help the bread’s texture and rise.”At its simplest, a flatbread is flour and water mixed into a dough, rolled into balls, rested, flattened and griddled. Dan Lepard tweeted the basic ratio: 500g of any wheat flour (white, wholemeal, self-raising, plain) to 300g cold water. Add some form of oil to the mix, and you get everything from chapatis and rotis (Meera Sodha fills hers with coconut, raisins and almonds) to tortillas and lavash. Jamie Oliver switches things up a bit, using yoghurt, self-raising flour and a little baking powder, and cooks with griddle pan over a high heat. Elsewhere, his coconut flatbreads are made with just coconut milk and self-raising flour and fried in butter.AKA batter bread, this is the base recipe used in such things as apple bread, banana bread and the French savoury cake studded with everything from bacon and olives. You mix dry ingredients (flour, baking powder, salt) with wet ingredients (milkbuttermilkyoghurt, oil and eggs) and flavour it any way you like. Kristin “Baker Bettie” Hoffmann gives you every option thinkable: sweet, savoury, gluten-free, dairy-free, vegan and without baking powder (she separates the eggs, and whips the whites to get the rise needed). Texture-wise, this is more on the muffincake side of things, so if that’s not what you’re after, read on.The original no-kneader, and as Chiles put it last week, a gift to the yeastless. The rise comes from bicarb, so that ingredient is a must, but flour-wise it’s flexible: wholemeal, oatmeal, rolled oats, plain, self-raising, rye or whatever mixture you can manage. Liquid-wise, milk, yoghurt, buttermilk, Nigella’s pasta water: they’ll all work, too. You’ll want a dollop of salt and sweetness (honey, soft brown sugar) Chiles flavours his with treacle and Marmite, and nothing has ever endeared a columnist to me more. And there’s nothing to say you can’t jazz it up further: Oliver puts dark chocolate and hazelnuts in his.The New York Times calls this the world’s easiest yeasted loaf a step-up from the already groundbreaking easy method devised by Jim Lahey (if you’re a budding bread person, I recommend his books). You mix plain flour with yeast, salt and lukewarm water into a loose dough, cover and let rise for two to five hours. Then you shape it and bake it. The crustiness comes from having a broiling panful of water – or a few ice cubes – in the bottom of the oven to steam the loaf while it cooks.Putting yeast in a wheaten flatbread essentially means it can puff up while baking, to create those soft pockets so perfect for picnics. Yotam Ottolenghi puts sugar in his dough and seven spices in his chicken filling, and, well, what more could you want? Although it is technically possible to make them completely lean, Felicity Cloake doesn’t recommend it: the fat contributes to flavour and shelf-life.A Jamaican speciality, this is a plain-flour yeasted dough, enriched with butter and sugar. It takes a short knead (you want the dough nice and elastic) and a 45-minute rest. You then roll it out flat with a rolling pin and – to give it that moist, dense crumb – roll it right back up again into a tight log, tucking the ends in (DaJen Eat’s Jen and her grandmother Cynthia will show you how). Then, after a short rest, it is baked golden brown in a loaf pan.The one loaf you don’t need an oven for. This South African beauty involves mixing a very sticky batter of plain flour, salt, sugar, yeast (no oil) and lukewarm water in a bowl with a wooden spoon. (Gaylard’s demo is quite possibly the most mesmerising cooking video I’ve ever come across. It’s now my lockdown backdrop.) Cover with a lid to let it rest, then beat it once more and let it rest again. Pour into a buttered bowl and place in a large pot for which you have a lid, with enough boiling water to come halfway up the side of your bowl, adding water when necessary to keep the steam going. It is cooked when, as with a cake, a knife stuck into the centre comes out clean.This takes a couple more ingredients (maple syrup and rolled oats) and an overnight rest (eight hours or more), but it makes, as Food52 notes, darn good toast. Much like in soda bread, the oats impart a welcome bite. As with the no-knead crusty loaf, you’ll need an oven-safe heavy-based pot with a lid to achieve consistent, high heat and a good seal so the moisture doesn’t escape.Nigel Slater once said that he thought focaccia was the bread to attempt first, before any trad white loaf. “A batch rarely fails.” Now most recipes will ask for strong white bread flour andor 00 flour (used for making pasta). But Marcella Hazan makes hers with plain flour, and she’s not someone to mess with. You’ll need a good amount of olive oil (River Cottage uses 150ml), some flaky salt and something like a baking stone – a heavy cookie sheet will do.Surprisingly easy to make at home, as Jennifer Garner demos in episode 15 of her aptly named Pretend Cooking show. Sure, there is the extra step of poaching before you bake, but you can use plain flour and honey for the dough (or strong bread flour and malt syrup, if you want to be fancy). Food52’s Kenzi Wilbur says the hardest part is waiting an excruciating 30 minutes once you have removed them from the oven. But I’ve never known anyone able to resist freshly baked anything, so why would you even attempt to do that here? Butter at the ready …"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/58449a2dc83ded86aa0115305ada73bc943998de/0_2594_5340_3202/master/5340..jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=10738cbb0736ad79146b80aca27e63d9","title":"nigel slater recipes sweet potato spinach butter griddled leeks mash","story":"Griddled leeks, mash and baked sweet potatoes, generously anointed with butter, are perfect for changeable spring daysThe blue-sky days of early spring are currently sandwiched between chilly mornings and even colder evenings. As dinner time approaches, my idea of tossing together a light spring salad all too often turns into the need for a baked potato the size of a rock, butter running down its crisp, salt-crusted skin.Over the years, sweet potatoes, their orange flesh glowing like a beacon, have begun to replace the trusty Maris Pipers as baked potato of choice. Curvaceous and thin-skinned, their soft interior cooks to a buttery fluff that is infinitely sweeter than a Maris Piper or King Edward. You either like the sugar hit or you don’t. You can tame the sweetness with chilli and coriander or lime. Cheese works if it is white, sharp and salty, like feta or Ticklemore. Golden, fat-rich varieties much less so.Earlier in the week I made a green butter for a baked sweet potato with spinach leaves and a seasoning of red chillies, salt and lime. This verdant butter would work with a floury white tattie, too, though I would swap the seasonings for a smidgeon of grated nutmeg and a handful of sautéed button mushrooms instead.I also made mash this week, a reassuringly soft and velvety batch with a stirring of crème fraîche and plenty of black pepper. We ate it with leeks that we cooked on the griddle until their outside leaves sent up smoke signals. Desperate as I am for full-on spring cooking, these few last weeks of cold evenings do have their perks.Sweet potatoes sometimes split their thin skins as they bake, the sugary flesh leaking out and cooking to a crisp on the oven floor. I find lining the baking sheet with foil saves tiresome washing up. Serves 4sweet potatoes 4spinach leaves 100gbutter 125g, at cool room temperaturespring onions 3coriander leaves 10gred chillies 1, large, mildlime 1Set the oven at 200Cgas mark 6. Bake the sweet potatoes on a baking sheet for about 45-60 minutes, depending on their size, until they are tender. Wash the spinach leaves, discarding any very thick stalks. Pile the still-wet spinach leaves into a deep pan, add 100ml of water, then place over a moderate heat and cover tightly with a lid. Bring the water to the boil, shaking the pan from time to time, then lift the lid and turn the spinach over, cover and steam for a minute more.When the leaves are bright and relaxed, drain in a colander, then squeeze out as much water as possible. (I find rinsing the spinach briefly under cold water helps cool it enough to handle.) Chop the leaves roughly and set aside in a small bowl.Cream the butter until light and fluffy. Slice the spring onions into wafer thin rounds and add to the butter. Coarsely chop the coriander and the chilli, then add to the butter. Squeeze in the juice of the lime, add the chopped spinach and a generous pinch of salt, then combine everything together. You can keep this in the fridge until you need it.When the potatoes are soft and fluffy inside, split them open and spoon in the spinach butter, letting it melt into the hot potato.By steaming the leeks prior to grilling you get the best of both worlds, a leek that is juicy and sweet with a deliciously toasted, buttery exterior.

Steam them if you prefer.Trim the leeks, discarding the root end and any dark green leaves. The trimmings are a worthy addition to the stock pot. Cut each leek in half then wash thoroughly in cold running water, letting the water penetrate right down in between the layers as much as possible. If they are very muddy, I suggest leaving them to soak in cold water for a while.Bring 200ml of water to the boil in a large, deepish pan, add the leeks and the butter and let them cook for about 9-10 minutes, until they are tender to the point of a knife. Lift out the leeks and drain on kitchen paper.For the butter, put the peas and pumpkin seeds in a food processor and pulse briefly to coarse crumbs.Warm a griddle pan, then lower the leeks on to the hot griddle. They will brown quickly because of the butter with which they were cooked. Turn them as necessary until evenly toasted, then remove from the heat.Drain the potatoes, add the butter, and mash them thoroughly with a potato masher or fork. Stir in the crème fraîche and a light grinding of black pepper, then beat until fluffy with a wooden spoon.Melt the 40g piece of butter in a shallow pan, add the peas, pumpkin seeds and the sunflower seeds and cover cook over a moderate heat for 3-4 minutes.Pile the potato on a warm serving dish, place the griddled leeks on top then spoon over the peas, seeds and their butter, scatter with mint leaves and serve.

Whenever I speak to my counterparts the conversations return to the same topic: the fact that in our professional lives we can take some positives.While players have to stay physically fit during the shutdown, in our job the emphasis centres just as much on staying mentally fresh. That is why many of us are using this time to take stock, reset, step away from the constant pressure of having to win on a Saturday or a Tuesday and keep a perspective on the important things in life.That is not always easy when you have been immersed in this job for, in my case, two decades, and for many of my colleagues far longer. So we are being taught some valuable lessons, because in football we are sometimes cocooned from real-life situations. You appreciate the need to care for each other and learn to connect with yourself in ways that are rarely possible.With the intensity of competition taking a back seat you find yourself thinking more like a coach: considering what the game is about and how you can get the best out of a team. The release of pressure means you can focus on your methods, on what works and what does not and see things that might not have caught your eye during a typical cycle of games.You discover, too, that as a society and as iniduals we are much more resilient than we think. Football is about resilience and self-discipline but the present situation is too. This can be a lonely time for many people, managers included. You have to find a way of creating a schedule for the day, sticking to it and staying focused on your work despite the uncertainty and terrible news that surrounds us. Nobody wished for a test like this but you learn interesting things about your capacity to adapt.While my players stay on top of their physical and nutritional plans, monitored daily by our staff, there is a lot to keep me busy. A typical day’s work is spent in three ways. First is in-depth analysis of a season where our team, Birmingham City, are 16th in the Championship. It has been fruitful: there are many things we can improve but also a lot of aspects in which we’ve been better than I thought at the time. I certainly feel I’m getting to know the team more deeply.The second is watching our nine remaining opponents for whenever football restarts to make sure our preparation is as sharp as possible. And the third involves close contact with our scouting department, working on our options to improve the squad next season. I’m writing this column after spending a morning completing my fourth assessment of a player who may interest us when the transfer market is up and running. We can get to know our targets very, very well in a period like this.The relationship with players changes a little bit now. Usually we might be out on the training pitch, speaking about tactics and football as well as personal matters. Now our communication is more inidual. I speak to them all to make sure they feel on track, motivated and happy within themselves. Some need that kind of conversation more than others but we have been positively surprised by their reaction. They all seem driven to keep busy and stay fit. In the circumstances I think our squad is in a good place both physically and mentally.It is particularly tough for the younger guys, especially if they are living on their own. We have a multinational squad, and some players have spent a season away from home for the first time. I can empathise to an extent. My wife and two children, aged one and three, travelled back to Spain in mid-March and the plan was that I would join them during the international break. But on the very same day Igualada, our home town, was locked down and the rest of the country followed. It is not easy to handle but we are always in contact and the most important thing is that everybody is safe.I feel proud of how the club has handled things. Our owners are Chinese and have been updating us ever since Covid-19 first arose in their country. The chairman has been in the UK since December so he helped us prepare well in advance. China has dealt with several things like this before and the owners’ perspective was that it would be better equipped to respond than many in the western world.You could see how the global markets were reacting and it was clear we would soon be caught up in something bigger than anything we had lived through before. We knew something very tough was coming and we were able to ready the players for it before the shutdown. The next time a virus like this breaks out somewhere, nobody in the world will joke about it: everyone will be prepared properly.I don’t think a single team can say the break has favoured them at this point. Once you deviate from the routine of playing, things change. In the remaining games we’ll see some different performances from sides whose fortunes might have contrasted before such a long hiatus. We can’t wait to return when it is safe – hopefully as wiser professionals and as better people, too.Pep Clotet is the manager of Birmingham City"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/132c3dd3160f9d97d3eb7c62904990379c79e3fd/0_254_2272_1363/master/2272.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=462a5937f350c9b4af676b5633827830","title":"peter bonetti a life in pictures","story":"Peter ‘The Cat’ Bonetti, former Chelsea and England goalkeeper, has died aged 78"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0700d277bd83affd91d60c6b1e12500477ca113e/0_173_2048_1229/master/2048.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=08d3cfc0a31f82a57e01f8e378415077","title":"its a very worrying time sri lankas recovery interrupted by coronavirus","story":"As the anniversary of the bombs that shook the country looms, survivors working to build harmony face multiple challengesA year on from the Easter bombs that killed more than 250 people, Sri Lanka is now under pandemic lockdown and facing rising pressure.President Gotabaya Rajapaksa, whose decision to include iniduals accused of atrocities during the country’s 25-year civil war among his political appointments has been a source of international opprobrium, is now under fire over the country’s repressive, militarised response to Covid-19.With tensions increasing, and parliament and courts suspended, a civil society that had been working hard to rebuild trust and harmony from the ground up is struggling.It was 21 April 2019 when three large bombs targeting Christians and tourists were triggered.Hasaru Jayakody was at mass in Negombo, where 115 people would die, including his mother Priyanthi whom he describes as “the best person I ever met”. Badly injured, he spent his 17th birthday in hospital.A statue of Jesus, spattered with blood, has been preserved in a clear box as a poignant reminder for the people of Negombo, who over the past year have been working to come through the trauma together.The physical environment has been rebuilt. The parish priest, Father Manjula, has supported efforts to repair trust by reminding his congregation that their God tells them to forgive. Jayakody initially found he needed to keep talking about what had happened. It was from his mother’s example, he says, that he learned how to forgive. Jayakody now teaches younger children at Sunday school and hopes to become an engineer in honour of his mother.But the wider environment is challenging. In the immediate aftermath, some Muslim businesses were boycotted by Sinhala or Buddhist customers – until leaders came together through local inter-religious committees, reinforcing messages of harmony and emphasising the right of all to live and work in Negombo.When refugees faced physical attacks after the bombings, human rights activists like Ruki Fernando stepped in to protect them.“In the context of large numbers of dead, injured and the magnitude of the tragedy, refugees didn’t receive much attention and support from the government, media, religious leaders and overall, Sri Lankan society. But some politicians and government officials were sympathetic and mindful of their duties,” he says, remembering how the Negombo police station sheltered a large number of refugees at the height of unrest, despite being overstretched.Harassment of Muslims had happened before, but the problem increased after the attacks. As some landlords and hosts were pressured to evict them, human rights groups worked with communities to support those at risk, opening their doors and providing food and medicine.Now with the current fears and restrictions, Fernando is worried about vulnerable communities such as refugees, prisoners, the poor and minorities.“We are seeing both racism and authoritarianism raising their ugly heads in the middle of the fight against Covid,” he says.Bhavani Fonseka, senior researcher at Colombo’s Centre for Alternative Policies thinktank, is also concerned.“What we’ve seen is extremely worrying. For nearly a decade in the run-up to last Easter Sunday we didn’t have to worry about security issues at such a scale but, since the bombings, we’ve seen a continuation of the securitisation,” she says.While conceding that this month’s parliamentary elections had to be postponed due to the outbreak, she is worried that there is no check on executive power.“It’s a very, very worrying time in Sri Lanka,” says Fonseka.“This has not happened overnight … but if we continue to postpone parliamentary elections then there are worrying signs over whether we are heading towards autocratic rule. “When we mark one year on from the Easter Sunday attacks, in this current uncertainty, has there really been healing and reckoning of what happened?”Jehan Perera, executive director of the National Peace Council, runs awareness programmes, educating communities about the origins of the civil war, how to build peace, and the issues involved in transitional justice. Perera acknowledges the support of senior international religious figures to help bring the communities to dialogue.In the immediate aftermath, there were claims that Sri Lanka’s Muslims knew the bombing was planned and had let others down by not warning them.Perera believes in the power of people of different faiths meeting face to face. It’s harder to sustain distorted beliefs when a community is gracious towards you, he says.“When they see each other as iniduals, there’s a lot of goodwill,” says Perera. “It’s when people put ideas into their heads in the abstract, then it’s easy to build anger”Over the years he has seen unfounded accusations that a Muslim surgeon secretly sterilised Sinhalese women, and now claims that certain groups are responsible for the spread of Covid-19. Burial practices of different faiths during the outbreak are controversial.For Perera, the coronavirus outbreak is a call for unity, not more ision. “Covid is infecting anyone without any discrimination,” he says. “We must not think on these isive lines but face the problem together.“Unless we are all secure, none of us will be secure, and that is the message that Covid is bringing us one year after the Easter bombings.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/23dfc06e1814930c6e609fa0bef03922598bdc5b/0_126_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e489234bb1281f6984f9c68d1cb85886","title":"paraguay coronavirus hungry social inequalities","story":"Early, aggressive measures seem to be controlling the disease but the pandemic has laid bare the country’s social inequalitiesWhen Covid-19 arrived in South America, Paraguay was one of the first countries to take measures to contain the virus, closing schools and banning public gatherings after just the second confirmed case on 11 March.The nationwide lockdown seems to be controlling the spread of the disease, but it has created another problem: large numbers of Paraguayans are going hungry in their own homes.Paraguay has reported some of the lowest infection rates in South America – currently 129 confirmed cases and six deaths.But the government of President Mario Abdo Benítez has been heavily criticised for failing to support people left without income during the total quarantine – which is now coming to the end of the third week and is set to continue until 19 April.Sixty-five per cent of Paraguay’s workers earn their living in the informal economy and have no access to benefits during the coronavirus crisis.And while the government has been authorised to secure loans of $1.6bn to face the crisis, only a small part of a promised scheme of emergency payments of about $76 and food packs have reached those left in need. A further payment scheme is yet to be implemented.Valentina Osuna, a craftswoman and mother of four from the indigenous Qom village of Rosarino, said she was no longer able to sell her work.“There’s no support, there’s nothing from the state. My children are hungry.”Abdo Benítez has apologised for the situation and called for patience. But when he briefly boarded a public bus last week to greet passengers, he was heckled with demands for the promised support payments.The scale of the crisis has been shown by the recent launch of AyudaPy – an open-source, non-governmental website allowing users to request and offer help. Thousands of messages are being posted daily by people describing dire circumstances and requesting basic items like milk, bread and medicine.Óscar Pereira, member of a residents’ organisation in the deprived Tacumbú neighbourhood of Asunción, the capital, said: “The mutual solidarity on display is outstanding poor people are helping other poor people. We’re all helping and giving what we can: we’re cooking communally so that we can get food to people.”As it has across Latin America, the coronavirus crisis has laid bare social inequalities and the poor state of public infrastructure. Amid widespread outrage, the government has promised a reform of a state that is underfunded and plagued by corruption and highly skewed tax policies.However, for Alicia Amarilla, national coordinator of the Organisation of Rural and Indigenous Women, not even promises of reform can guarantee greater dignity for Paraguay’s many poor families.“We’re going to see many more difficult situations come from this crisis – we’re in a country with far too much inequality. We know that the government won’t take privileges away from those that have them. The people who are most in need are the ones who will continue suffering”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6b49a2dfb99cd9c07a80e63c5d1a6b4ee9d40a69/0_448_6720_4032/master/6720..jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3d75460a9cf125fa6a7001cbb9498cc7","title":"its the perfect time to stop our unconscious bias going viral","story":"In times like this it’s essential we become aware of the ways in which we are biased – so it doesn’t become prejudiceWhen behavioural scientist Dr Pragya Agarwal moved from Delhi to York more than 20 years ago, her first priority was to blend in. As a single parent, a woman of colour and an academic, she worked hard to “water down” the things that made her different from those around her. Yet the more she tried to fit in, the more Agarwal began to ask herself why humans appear programmed to create “in groups” and distrust those on the outside.“Unconscious bias has become a buzzword in recent years,” explains Agarwal. “We are all biased and, though some biases can be harmless, many aren’t.” These are the issues she unravels in her book Sway: Unravelling Unconscious Bias, and she confronts some uncomfortable truths along the way.Agarwal argues that humans aren’t naturally rational creatures, and with our brains constantly bombarded with information, we rely on cognitive short cuts: patterns of learned thinking based on what has worked for us in the past, the messages we receive from others and our evolutionary programming. “Cognitive short cuts evolved to help us survive,” she says. “The problem is that we still have these responses and they don’t work well in the modern world.”In our tribal past, the consequences of wrongly assuming that an outsider was peaceful or free from disease could be so damaging that being overcautious became a human evolutionary strategy. The result is the tendency to generalise: speedily assigning those around us to groups based on race, academic status, social class or gender and ignoring details that contradict our existing beliefs. Once we’ve placed a person in a box, Agarwal suggests we are more inclined to choose the dehumanising and dangerous approach of treating them according to the stereotypes we associate with that box rather than as an inidual. It’s an experience the author has had herself.“About 18 months ago my daughter wasn’t well,” she says. “I could feel something was terribly wrong, but medical staff thought I was over-reacting.” After creating a “scene” and insisting her child was admitted to hospital, the toddler went into septic shock.With research showing that women are less likely to be taken seriously by health professionals and that people from minority ethnic communities face prejudice within healthcare systems, Agarwal believes the dismissive way she was treated was unconscious bias in action. In Sway she gives wide-ranging examples of other groups who face negative consequences of bias, from professional Asian footballers who struggle to be taken seriously to female musicians who are less likely to gain orchestral positions if their gender is known.Agarwal’s motivation is personal as well as academic. As the eldest of three sisters growing up in India, she was very aware of gender bias. “Before my youngest sister was born, everybody hoped the baby would be a boy. A third daughter was seen as a huge burden and the hospital staff were disappointed for my parents and were shocked when my father celebrated her birth anyway.”Despite or because of this inequality, Agarwal grew up conscious of women’s rights. Her upbringing wasn’t entirely conventional: her parents never prepared their daughters for marriage and they didn’t learn to cook or do domestic chores. “They let us spread our wings in a world that was not designed for women.” Nevertheless her parents worried about Agarwal’s outspoken behaviour in public as a young girl, concerned she might “be attacked or raped” because of the way she would speak up for others – even to adult men.Though she describes them as feeling “conflicted” about whether to insist their daughters conformed to some social norms, Agarwal’s parents invested heavily in the siblings’ financial independence and insisted each pursue professional career paths to ensure they never needed to rely on a man for money.Now a parent to her own three daughters, Agarwal has become determined to go further and help create a fairer world for her children. “We can go some way to controlling explicit prejudice,” she explains, pointing to laws against hate crime and speech and a growing awareness of explicit racism, sexism and homophobia. Yet it’s the subtle and subversive ways that bias creeps into society that worry Agarwal the most.“Digital voice assistants are often narrated by women,” she says. This flows from and then reinforces stereotypes around the subservient role of women. Facial recognition software is, studies have shown, inherently racist and as technology learns from ongoing interactions, bias is reinforced in a feedback loop. “We can’t see technology as a panacea,” she insists. “There is a systemic and structural problem. The data being used is biased and a lack of ersity in teams means that technology hasn’t considered all our erse parameters.”Bias also plays out in times when we feel more afraid, threatened and stressed, she observes. Even if we don’t believe a stereotype, she says, we can still internalise it. When these stereotypes are spread in words and images they become contagious and reinforced by the wider subconscious as biases. “It is an extraordinary time,” she reflects. “The idea of an ‘in group’ and an ‘out group’ has always existed, but it is being heightened by the way it is used politically, with advertising and political campaigns relying on our desire to belong to a group and our fear of anything outside it.” She points out that with the world locked down, our echo chambers are likely to be more influential than ever.Agarwal is not entirely pessimistic, but she is realistic. “In times of crisis our biases are strengthened,” she insists, pointing to how quickly President Trump labelled Covid-19 a “Chinese virus”. She sets out how the “horn effect” (a type of cognitive bias that taints our entire view of a person or community based on one negative aspect) allowed this comment to spread with the vigour of the virus itself, prompting direct acts of racism against Asian communities.At least, she argues, we are finally in a place to have an honest conversation about bias. “The walls we have been putting up recently are not conducive to a harmonious society and though, through history, liberal views have always come under threat, that doesn’t mean people aren’t listening.” Agarwal feels certain that the challenge we are now facing will shine a light on the inequalities in our societies and she hopes that a small silver lining of this international emergency will be its role as a catalyst for long-term change. “If we protect the most marginalised people in society right now, it could have positive consequences for the entire population. Learning that lesson today could alter the way we tackle injustice.”In the meantime, Agarwal encourages us to consider our own privilege acknowledge and actively notice our own biases, particularly if we are parents or role models for young people. “Nobody wants to think that they are biased, but we all are and once we start acknowledging that we can do something about it.” She suggests that we take stock of whether our friends look, sound and are from the same background as us and that we “step outside our comfort zones and connect with others who aren’t like us.”Though bias is often unconscious, she believes we all need to proactively educate ourselves. “Just saying that something is unconscious doesn’t absolve us of responsibility. We must think about why we have these learned behaviours and where the messages come from,” she says. And in this usually frenetic world she encourages us to take time to activate the rational side of our brains when making important decisions, as snap judgments tend to rely on our implicit biases.She cites one study that shows how when nurses were asked to imagine how much pain a patient was in, they overcame bias and prescribed adequate pain relief. Developing empathy for others is, she says, the main way we are going to counteract these biases. “By placing ourselves in another context we shift our viewpoint. We can’t do this without putting ourselves in someone else’s shoes.” Surely there has never been a better time to do so.Sway: Unravelling Unconscious Bias by Pragya Agarwal (Bloomsbury Sigma, £16.99) is available for £14.27 at bookshop"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bb92342fc595833721fa0cf9962cd6c9a59b29d5/0_460_4848_2909/master/4848..jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cd66474509a5cc0ccb2d1b3184b83da2","title":"when the party starts a home to lift the spirits","story":"Festivities are on hold at this double-fronted home. But zingy colours, playful details and a bubbling hot tub mean it’s still a house of funTheir friends will tell you that Paul Price and Fletcher Cowan know how to throw a good party. In summer it’s not unusual to find at least 100 guests spilling out, brimming margaritas in hand, from the kitchen of their north London home into the garden with its bubbling hot tub. Those previral bashes are, of course, on hold for now. But even without the revellers, here’s an interior to lift the spirits. The tutti-frutti carpets, lagoon-blue cocktail bar and walls bustling with modern art add up to a home that’s sociable – and comfortable.Price and Cowan are quick to credit the interior designer Peter Mikic with the exuberant effect. They all met, inevitably, at a dinner party. Before founding his business 10 years ago, Mikic used to run a fashion label. Price is the CEO of a luxury fashion brand and Cowan, who presents a fashion show on US channel E!, studied fashion at Central Saint Martins. So the three share a taste for art, colour and unpredictable juxtapositions.“I don’t do matchy-matchy, I prefer things to be on the more interesting side,” says Mikic, an Australian who has lived in the UK for more than 20 years. “Paul and Fletcher have more parties than anyone I know. This house reflects that. It’s them down to a T.”In a part of London better known for slender townhouses, the 1870s property is a rarity. Wide and double-fronted, it has a host of unusual features: ornate plasterwork motifs on the walls downstairs and dashing Moorish-style arches upstairs where there are three bedrooms and a walk-in wardrobe.“I was the first person to see it when it went on the market six years ago,” says Price, an American with strong opinions on how things should look. “I walked in, saw the wonderful, original staircase and made an offer on the spot. It just spoke to me.”Mikic’s brief was to transform the three-storey interior, which is believed to have operated as a print factory during the Second World War. This may have been when the first two floors were subided into a warren of small rooms with disproportionately wide hallways. One of the first things Mikic did was to reorganise the space by opening up the main reception rooms. “The idea was to create relaxed and comfortable spaces for entertaining and living,” he says. Original details were also restored. Layers of paint were scraped off the staircase to reveal the ebonised handrail, and the parquet floors were sanded back to their golden 19th-century colour.“The house now has distinct zones the reception rooms are for living and entertaining, the lower ground floor for cooking, eating, and working,” says Mikic, who added a gym as well as a library for Cowan in the lower-ground floor.For this sociable couple, a new dining room was a priority. The kitchen has a convivial island for cooking and chatting: “Paul loves to cook and I love to eat: that’s us in a nutshell,” says Cowan.To bring light to the lower-ground floor, Mikic also installed floor-to-ceiling metal-framed windows that  the back wall. “Before that there was only a small door and two small windows overlooking the garden,” says Price. “Now you feel a real sense of connection between the outside and inside.” By contrast, the upstairs bedrooms, with their layers of muted colours and understated furnishings, were designed as a peaceful retreat.Apart from a few artworks by friends, such as LA artist Jonas Wood or the photographer Alex Prager, most of the furniture and objects were bought for the house. Parisian flea markets or Alfies antique market in northwest London are their stamping grounds for mid-century design. “A mix, not too 1960s or 1970s, but a bit of every era,” insists Price.In the sitting room, the multicoloured sideboard inlaid with Murano glass is a 1980s prototype by Italian fashion designer Emanuel Ungaro. It was the catalyst for the rug – as colourful as a pointillist painting – which Mikic designed, picking up the icing-sugar colours in the bespoke sofas. The pair of 60s armchairs, with their original fabrics intact, were found online at 1stdibs. The pink walls are one of Mikic’s custom-made colours: “I usually hate pink, too sugary or Barbie,” says Price. “But this won me over.”From here, you step into the new bar where the aquarium-blue walls are made of polished plaster and the countertop was carved from lava stone. Nearby, the glossy grand piano is a mechanical one that plays itself. The music is the “only issue in our relationship”, says Price, “I’m fond of a show tune, which Fletcher can’t stand.” But they agree on the classics: “Barbra Streisand, Elton John, Queen, Madonna… Hey, there’s a theme here.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4a81442f070bf91c062afdf88f7eb3cb64b367b2/0_2_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3b4dd43f9667e9a42dd8ac519b9e3031","title":"release julian assange says woman who had two children with him while in embassy","story":"Stella Moris, who had two sons with WikiLeaks founder while he was in Ecuadorian embassy, says he is in danger from coronavirus while in prisonThe partner of WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange has revealed that she had two children with him while he was living inside the Ecuadorian embassy in London.Stella Moris, 37, a South African-born lawyer, issued a plea for the father of her two young sons, Gabriel, three, and Max, one, to be released from prison and said there were genuine fears for Assange’s health.Assange was forcibly dragged out of the embassy and arrested in April last year, after Ecuador revoked his political asylum and invited politan police officers inside their Knightsbridge premises. He had been living at the embassy for nearly seven years.Assange has since been held in Belmarsh prison in London, where he is serving a 50-week jail term for violating his bail conditions. He is awaiting an extradition hearing on 18 May on behalf of the US, where he is wanted for questioning over the activities of WikiLeaks and likely facing espionage charges.In a statement to the courts supporting an application for bail, Moris revealed that she met Assange in 2011 when she was a legal researcher and looking into ways to halt Assange’s extradition.“Over time Julian and I developed a strong intellectual and emotional bond. He became my best friend and I became his,” she wrote.In 2015, Moris and Assange began a relationship despite the “extraordinary circumstances”, she said, and became engaged in 2017.She said she had gone to great lengths to protect the couple’s children from the climate that surrounds Assange, adding that she was making the statement now because their lives were “on the brink” and she feared Assange could die.According to Moris, Assange is in isolation for 23 hours a day and all visits have stopped.“My close relationship with Julian has been the opposite of how he is viewed – of reserve, respect for each other and attempts to shield each other from some of the nightmares that have surrounded our lives together,” Moris said.In an interview with the Mail on Sunday, Moris said Assange had watched the births of both children in London hospitals via live video link and met Gabriel after he was smuggled into the embassy.She further revealed that both boys had visited their father in prison, and that the couple were planning to marry, whether Assange is released or not.Friends and supporters of Assange, among them celebrities including Pamela Anderson, have said he has been in poor health for many months and have expressed growing concern for his wellbeing since the coronavirus outbreak.HMP Belmarsh has repeatedly come under scrutiny in recent years, lastly after a remand prisoner was found dead in his cell in January, triggering an investigation by the prisons and probation ombudsman.The man was the third prisoner to have died in Belmarsh within the past year. Another inmate was found dead there in November.A judge at Westminster magistrates court rejected the request for an adjournment of Assange’s extradition hearing in May until September over what his legal team said were “insuperable” difficulties preparing his case because of the Covid-19 pandemic."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/91b7bfba69dcb1a2845837dcd79db986dc768672/0_1050_8272_4963/master/8272..jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f32cff6b26d06b16eeb558d886cf3fdd","title":"tiffany its awesome to see my music liberate middle aged women","story":"At 16, I Think We’re Alone Now made her a star of 80s pop. Now, after legal battles, style shifts and celebrity TV, she may finally have found herselfIn 1987, when Tiffany was a hugely famous pop singer, journalists always used to ask her the same question: “Where do you see yourself in 10 years’ time?”“And I wouldn’t know what to say,” says Tiffany. “I mean, 10 years before that I was six…”Tiffany Darwish is now 48. If we hadn’t been introduced, I don’t know that I would have recognised her. When we meet pre-lockdown, though her hair is still red, it’s sleeker. Her eyes are still a sparky dark brown. She’s a gorgeous American rock chick: perfect teeth and skin, jangling bracelets and rings, black ripped jeans, studded boots, sleeveless fur-lined gilet. She fits in with her surroundings – a band rehearsal studio – though we are not in LA, but Brighton. Tiffany’s current co-writer, Mark Alberici, is British, and she and her band are working up a couple of songs before their trip to Wales in a couple of days, to record her 11th album at Rockfield Studios in Monmouth.Though she’s had a few years falling in and out of music, Tiffany is now determined when it comes to her career. “I’d go away and then I’d think: ‘You know what? This is not good enough. I love music and I want to do this, and I’d be happy playing rock festivals, you know, the shit spots when everyone’s parking the car.’”Winning over audiences is what Tiffany does. In 1987, when she was 16, she became known for touring the shopping malls of 16 cities in the US, belting out her song I Think We’re Alone Now over its high-energy backing track smiling and dancing and flipping her hair as other teenagers gawped at her, in that love-you-hate-you teenage way.In this instant-access age, such a door-to-door sales technique seems laughable, but it worked: I Think We’re Alone Now was a massive, bona fide hit. It went to No 1 in the US and the UK as well as other countries, and catapulted Tiffany to fame. The accompanying album, Tiffany, went quadruple-platinum in the US, and her next, Hold an Old Friend’s Hand, which came out the following year, went platinum, making her the youngest ever person to go to No 1 in the States with their first two LPs. With such all-conquering, never-repeated success at such a young age, it’s tempting to see her life as downhill from then, but that would not be correct. Tiffany is more than her early past. “I’ve done what I thought would make me grow and make me happy,” she says. “If I could go back, I would try to be more pro-Tiff, believe in myself.”When we talk about this, Tiffany is philosophical. “George is a New York guy,” she says, “and he’s old Motown: if you’re not adding to the situation, please take a seat in the hallway.” Plus, her life before meeting Tobin had not been easy. Her mum and dad split up when she was 14 months old, and when her mother found another partner, things didn’t get much smoother: her mum was an alcoholic, her stepfather very strict. Tiffany, as the oldest child, was often more responsible than the adults around her. Still, her stepdad pushed Tiffany, recognising her talent and wangling her first paid gig. “Yeah, I remember it,” she says. “I was nine years old, awkward on a stage full of adults, who sometimes were fully pissed, and were playing the wrong chords. And I had to find my way – and it’s live – in front of an audience. So I quickly learned how to work a crowd. By the age of 12, I was getting that down.”So, she doesn’t regret trying to legally break away from her immediate family, but she does regret the public nature of the case. Her lawyers were expensive and persistent. “It was in their favour to keep the mudslinging going,” she says. “They weren’t doing anything wrong, but they were getting all this information, things that I definitely didn’t want out there. Times that my parents had fought outside the house in the yard, and the neighbour witnessed, and then all that is in court.” A few months after the case, just before her 18th birthday, she bought her own house: Chuck Norris’s old property in the Lemon Heights neighbourhood of Tustin, California. (Norris and Tiffany became friends and he took her to Thai boxing tournaments.)Tiffany thinks that her family background made her mature for her age, and her interviews back then reveal her as polite but quizzical, centred. Not a a, and not as eager to be liked as, say, Kylie. She still retains a so-it-goes attitude. “Real life always gets in the way,” she says, though now her real-life problems aren’t court cases but the lack of hot water in her Airbnb: “I had to boil the kettle to wash my hair!” she wails.Tiffany has had an enduring connection with the UK. Her second marriage was to an Englishman, and they lived for a while in Cannock, near Birmingham, before moving to Nashville. And over the past couple of years, she’s spent quite some time in, of all places, Basingstoke. Her friend Tina, who’s American, lives there. They met when Tiffany was 14. “She’s made a room for me in her home with a nice bath, my little Zen cave. I’ve been going back and forth now for, gosh, two years.”Tiffany’s music these days is rock and country. She has a lovely, throaty voice, with range and warmth, made for songs about being on the road and leaving her troubles behind. It’s taken a while for her to recognise this, though, and her singing career has been remarkably varied. Her 10 albums flip from genre to genre: pop, rock, country, even Eurodance (2005’s Dust Off and Dance).Her fifth album, 2000’s The Color of Me, was widely admired, but her then label failed to capitalise on its critical success, and she confesses that she didn’t always know how best to progress. So over the years, she’s tried any number of side hustles. She had her son Elijah, now a 27-year-old structural engineer, when she was 21, and deliberately took a step back from music in order to bring him up. She opened a clothes shop in Nashville, did a bit of acting, and spent several years on the celebrity TV circuit, appearing on everything from Celebrity Wife Swap, Celebrity Cook-Off, Celebrity Fit Club and Hulk Hogan’s Celebrity Championship Wrestling.In 2018, she took part in the Aussie version of I’m A Celebrity… Get Me Out of Here and while out in the jungle had a sort of epiphany. She hadn’t felt as though she fitted in – she didn’t really know who anyone else was on the show – and was voted out first. “But from my bunk I could see the stars and the moon,” she says, “and I used to look up every night. It was like my rehab. I really had to melt myself down. I knew that was my time, before I was going on this journey, before the Pieces of Me tour.”Her last album, 2018’s Pieces of Me, moved her into a life both new and old. She was separating from her husband, learning to write songs that she liked, getting back into music. She toured the album hard, and found a connection with “my old mall fans: the women that are raising children on their own, or had some hard knocks, or going back into the workforce, or sitting home and going: ‘I’ve just totally lost myself. I don’t know where I am.’ My music is speaking to them, and they’re coming to shows, and it’s great. It’s awesome to see my music liberate them a little bit.”Her mall fans have grown up, as has she. Today, what Tiffany is about is the determination and self-expression of the middle-aged woman. “We put ourselves last,” she says. “But I’m like, ‘No.’ I’m tired of pleasing people all the time. It hurt me in the long run, really. I don’t want us to grow old. I don’t want us to give up on ourselves. Yes, be the best mom or, sister, wife, whatever you’re doing, but not at the expensive of not knowing yourself. You’ve got to live your life. It’s supposed to be a full life.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9c777352066532587167f87c9edcc3f8904d9f25/0_0_4500_3000/master/4500.jpg?width=1010\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=359a34e9a75c0c6232ed6e245f11f3fe 2020w","title":"the undiscovered worlds that led adventurer steve backshall home","story":"Recently back from a year of seeking unmapped wonders from Greenland to Oman, the explorer is relishing life under lockdownFor most people, being stuck in lockdown with 11-week-old twins and a 21-month-old toddler would be torture. But the explorer Steve Backshall is used to living in tough and challenging environments around the world. “I’ve spent so much of my life away in a field, sleeping in a tent, that to have this amount of time with the family at home is actually a real privilege. It’s something I don’t get very much.”Perhaps unsurprisingly, it takes more than a few dirty nappies to disconcert a man who is used to defecating in strange places. “Every single day, scooting off into the jungle to find a place to have a poo could be either the highlight of the day – or the worst possible moment.”Best known as presenter of the BBC series Deadly 60, Backshall and his television crew recently spent an entire year taking part in 10 expeditions to unexplored places around the world. His book about these experiences, Expedition: Adventures into Undiscovered Worlds, is out in paperback on Thursday. It offers locked-down readers a chance to experience the untouched rivers, jungles, deserts, waterfalls and caves that Backshall explored for the very first time in history.In Suriname, for example, he spent about six weeks on jungle rivers that “don’t exist”. At least, not on paper. “They don’t even occur on the very finest maps of the area we were travelling through. We were writing the maps as we went.”It is to those waterways he goes now, in his mind’s eye, when he wants to remember one of the most amazing sights he ever saw. “We heard this thundering ahead of us in the forest and we came around the corner to a waterfall that was nearly 100 metres high – it’s the second-biggest waterfall in the country, and totally unknown. None of the local people or villagers had any idea it existed. We were the first people to map it, the first people to record its existence.”He decided to name it after their Surinamese colleague, Isla. “We called it the Isla Falls. It pours down through the forest in a series of cataracts, and is really broad and wide as well as high.”On one of the highest promontories of the waterfall, he found fresh jaguar droppings. “It was clear that, probably as early as the day before, a jaguar had come out and sat at the top of the waterfall where we were standing, looking down at the view. Which was pretty amazing.” There were otters, harpy eagles and tapirs wanderingaround the valley, too. “Clearly, they had never seen human beings before. It was just absolutely dazzling.”A Bafta-winning adventurer and wildlife presenter, Backshall had been planning some of the expeditions for more than 20 years. “Expeditions have been my life ever since I was in my late teens. I’ve been putting together this little black book of expeditions that were really special and, hand on heart, had not been done before.”They included kayaking along the largest fjord in the world – in Greenland, the first ascents of desert mountains and descents of desert canyons in Oman, and cave ing in Mexico through passageways that had never been explored. By linking up with several television channels, he got enough funding to put together a tiny team of experts and do them all in a single year. “It was the hardest year I’ve ever had. Apart from anything else, during that same year, I built a house, nearly went bankrupt and had my first baby. So, all round, a pretty big year.”He almost drowned while making the first-ever descent of a whitewater river in Bhutan in the Himalayas. “It was so dramatic. This river tumbles down and, over several miles of vertical descent, thrashes its way down through these incredible remote canyons.” He would plummet down a rapid “hoping to goodness” there wouldn’t be something hideous halfway down. One day, there was. “I basically plunged off the face of the earth into this recirculating wave, a drop of a small waterfall, and the bottom of it caught me and just dragged me back in again.”He was in a plastic kayak about 2.5 metres long and, despite pulling the release cord, was held under the water for nearly five minutes. “Bear in mind the water is glacial meltwater, very close to freezing point. I was, without question, drowning. There was nothing I could do to save myself. I was out of energy, out of ideas. It was absolutely terrifying.” Miraculously, a member of his crew managed to battle upstream against the rapids, get a rope to him and drag him out. “She saved my life.”He drank half a bottle of scotch that night, hoping the whole project would just “go away” and dreading the thought of getting back into his kayak the next morning. “I remember calling home to Helen, my wife, and she talked for about 15 minutes about missing her junction on the motorway. And I just couldn’t tell her. I couldn’t bring myself to tell her I’d come within a minute of drowning that day.” Their baby was just three months old at the time. “It was full on. It was really intense.”But he forced himself to carry on. “I knew that if I didn’t get back in that kayak the whole expedition would be over.”He perceives his desire to explore the world as a fundamentally human trait. “It’s one of the things that sets us apart as a species: our desire to understand, to push back new frontiers. There is an assumption that all of that was done years ago, that there is no more old-fashioned exploration to be done. But there is: you just need to look a lot harder nowadays.”In the desert and the jungle, he felt a deep connection to the explorers of the past, imagining them in their pith helmets, looking for gold and other riches. “But in other places, not really. For example, cave ing: that’s very much a modern realm of exploration. You’re using modern tech as a way of finding your way into places that people haven’t been to before.”The desert expeditions in Oman were, he says, the most extraordinary. “There are still desert canyons there where nobody has ever set foot. To be able to head down into one and know that our feet were the first to step on that rock was pretty amazing.”It made him feel his own existence was just one small aspect of something bigger. “On desert nights – where the stars just seem to be so close that you could reach up and pluck them, and the silence is so quiet that it’s loud – you have an incredible connection to the natural world.”Another highlight came when, during ascents of desert rock faces, he managed to record shots of the critically endangered Arabian leopard that was using the same trails. “There are only a handful of them left. It gave me this incredible sense of privilege, that I was walking in the footsteps of something so rare.”Overall, the year gave him a sense of quite how many natural wonders there are in the world to treasure and protect. “I think it’s incredibly important that people realise there are still parts of the planet we haven’t managed to ruin yet. It’s our job to make sure they stay beautiful and pristine.”But most importantly of all, it made him appreciate how wonderful it is to be at home in the house in Buckinghamshirefrom which he presents live homeschooling lessons about wildlife every Wednesday at 9.30am on his YouTube channel, SteveBackshallOfficial. “I realised how important family is to me. I’ve spent so much of my life trying to get to these wild, far-flung places. But actually what I came away feeling, more than anything, was just a real sense of how much it meant to me to be a dad, and how much I was missing not being at home with them.”And that, he says apologetically, is all he has time for. “I’m going to have to wrap this up now. I’ve got three babies screaming in the background.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/87068d00865f6919e2393366bbfc82817f3fa1b9/0_44_4500_2700/master/4500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=529adda4112b3faeaa89f77a9888c9f6","title":"british horse racing makes tentative plans to return behind closed doors","story":"Racing should discover by the end of the week whether a resumption of meetings behind closed doors from 1 May is still considered feasible by the sport’s administrators, with the British Horseracing Authority expected to complete a review of the state of its plans within the next few days.Australia, Japan and Hong Kong have continued to stage race meetings behind closed doors in recent weeks despite the developing coronavirus crisis, and Japan staged the first Classic of the new Flat season in the northern hemisphere on Sunday when Daring Tact stormed home from a long way off the pace to win the Oka Sho, the country’s equivalent of the 1,000 Guineas.The sport’s ruling body in Germany, meanwhile, said on Friday that it intends to resume a limited racing programme behind closed doors from 1 May. There has been no racing in Britain since 17 March, when the BHA abandoned a brief attempt to maintain a schedule behind closed doors and suspended all racing until 30 April. That came after the government withdrew emergency service support for non-essential activities and then banned public gatherings of more than two people.The continuing suspension is thought to be costing the sport at least £6m a month in terms of revenue from off-course betting alone, while several major Festival meetings have already been either cancelled or postponed. Almost all jockeys are freelancers and have been unable to work for three weeks, while all jump racing has been cancelled until at least 1 July.The BHA has since been planning towards a possible resumption of some racing on 1 May and is understood to have identified several tracks, including Newcastle and Lingfield, which could stage regular meetings running for several days at a time. Jockeys and other staff could be accommodated in on-site hotels to comply with quarantine restrictions and reduce unnecessary travel. Newmarket, which has two courses and several thousand horses stabled nearby, is also thought to be high on the list for an early resumption.While much has been done to prepare for a quick return to racing whenever possible, the BHA’s review of the current situation will also consider the likelihood of any easing of the lockdown measures which were introduced on 23 March. The government has warned that the lockdown is likely to be extended, and a three- or four-week extension would rule out a return to any racing until at least mid-May.Chester’s big May Festival meeting, which was due to open on 5 May, has already been cancelled as the track’s city-centre location with viewing possible from outside the course would make it impossible to race behind closed doors while guaranteeing that it would not attract a crowd.Both the Guineas meeting at Newmarket on the first weekend in May and the Derby meeting at Epsom in early June have been postponed, in the hope that it will be possible to test the three-year-old generation later in the year. Ascot, though, has said its prestigious Royal meeting, one of the most valuable and significant fixtures of the year for the racing, breeding and betting industries will take place behind closed doors from 16 June if the restrictions in place at the time allow it to proceed."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/65a0ad179227b19c7326ddf31c68a23e7aafb851/0_0_2310_1385/master/2310.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0123a90b17532e490e9025ce3587bfc4","title":"my favourite game liverpool v milan 2005 champions league final","story":"As a photographer for the , I had to choose which end to sit down at. I didn’t get it right first time For the first time since the 1985 Heysel disaster, Liverpool were in the European Cup final and around 30,000 of their fans found their way to the outskirts of Istanbul. Milan were a daunting prospect, boasting top international pedigree in every position. Liverpool had finished a poor fifth in the league in Rafael Benítez’s first season. The team he selected that day looked weak in many places. It seemed a one-sided contest.Well before kick-off, deep under the main stand, I chose my spot for the game. It is a well-rehearsed routine for all photographers at major games. When your name is called out you walk forwards to a map of the pitch and choose your seat. I plumped for behind the goal at the Liverpool end, where the red hordes were gathering. It’s assumed that both sides play towards their own supporters in the second half. I fancied Milan to blast Liverpool away in the first half.I was right, apart from one major problem – the captain who won the toss decided to swap the teams around. Suddenly I had Liverpool attacking my end first and within a minute my pre-match prediction came true, with Paolo Maldini volleying Milan ahead. I forlornly watched the goal and celebration from afar, cursing my luck. Things then went from bad to worse. Hernán Crespo scored two more in the 39th and 44th minutes. As the whistle blew for half-time, I was in despair. Three goals, in the biggest match of the year, and I had virtually nothing.I began to review my tactics for the second half. Did I stay put and hope that Milan keep turning on the style or did I blag a spot up the other end to witness an improbable Liverpool comeback? Then an amazing thing happened behind me. A spine-tingling rendition of You’ll Never Walk Alone rose up and filled the ground. Red scarves held high above heads. I decided to move, trying my luck down the other end and found an empty seat on the side of the pitch level with the penalty spot.Benítez tweaked his tactics and began the second half with a 3-1-4-1-1 formation. In the 54th minute Steven Gerrard scored with a looping header. Two minutes later Vladimir Smicer smacked in another. In the 60th minute the most unlikely of all comebacks was complete as Gerrard was fouled in the box and Xabi Alonso scored on the rebound after his penalty was saved. I was thanking my lucky stars that I had moved.The game then calmed before heading into extra-time. With three minutes to go Jerzy Dudek made a stupendous point-blank double save from Andriy Shevchenko. We were heading to penalties.Fortune then went my way again as the coin toss decided the spot kicks were to be taken at the Milan end. Somehow I had ended up in the perfect place. Dudek tried to distract the Milan players by copying Bruce Grobbelaar’s famous spaghetti-legs routine. It paid off. Serginho skied Milan’s first kick over the bar, then Dudek saved Andrea Pirlo’s attempt.Liverpool were 3-2 up when Shevchenko came to take Milan’s final penalty knowing he had to score to keep the game going. It’s at times like this I wish I had a couple of heads with an extra pair of eyes. Do I look at the keeper, the penalty-taker or team-mates in the centre circle? I decided on the latter. Dudek saved and the Liverpool players erupted. Cue pandemonium.From then on my priority was to get a good position for the presentation. I managed to squirm into the best spot, front and centre. While he waited for the cup to be handed over, Steven Gerrard walked over to the huge pot and planted a kiss. Perfect! Then, as the red ticker-tape exploded above, he finally got his hands on the cup and raised it to the sky. Never before or since have I experienced such a night – one that started as a total disaster but ended up a triumph."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c23f239c069388b42a699ac749abdf86e09457c1/0_36_3500_2102/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c9bea2ea992416b5d22eeb86858834e0","title":"pat cummins ben stokes ashes headlingley cricket","story":"The Australian fast bowler recalls the difficult team meeting after Stokes’ match-winning effort in the third Ashes Test at HeadingleyThe mere mention of Ben Stokes’s name makes Pat Cummins shudder. “Oh do we have to talk about him?” he says with a laugh.The world’s No 1 fast bowler can afford a grin now, with the Ashes in Australia’s possession and Cummins named as one of the five Wisden Cricketers of the Year for his menacing performances in the series in England last summer.In the aftermath of the 2019 Headingley Test, however – when he was the bowler off whom Stokes bludgeoned the winning runs in his miraculous 135 not out to haul England to the most extraordinary victory – he and the Australians were bereft. “We felt like we’d literally had the Ashes stolen out of our hands,” he says.Cummins is isolating from Covid-19 on his rural property south of Sydney, with his fiancée Becky. On the other side of the world this weekend, England cricket fans have been reliving the drama of Stokes’s innings courtesy of both the BBC and Sky Sports replaying the match as live.The memories are still painful for Cummins – although not as agonising as on the night of the defeat when he received a text from the head coach, Justin Langer, saying he wanted them all to sit down the next morning and watch their implosion on replay.“The feeling around the group was: ‘What’s he doing? He’s got this one way off,’” Cummins recalled. “I remember getting the message and I thought: ‘C’mon, we’ve all gone through this, just give us a day off.’ Everyone had played it over in their head a hundred times that night. I just remember thinking it’s better if we sleep on it, have a good day off, forget about it, and come together once we’ve all mellowed down a little bit.”The team, in T-shirts and baseball caps, gathered around a dark table in the boardroom of the Leeds Marriott hotel. Cummins sat towards the back, just in front of Nathan Lyon. “It was literally 15 hours after the last ball, so emotions were still high. That was the context of the meeting, everyone was still hurting.”As the 10th-wicket partnership between Stokes and Jack Leach was played out, Langer interjected to question tactics. He openly chided the captain, Tim Paine, for allowing Stokes to keep the strike when they needed to be attacking Leach. Paine said later that he found it hard to confront making mistakes. If Cummins, as vice-captain, felt any awkwardness on Paine’s behalf, he doesn’t admit it.“That’s the culture we try to breed into the team,” he says. “If you feel something, say it. And that’s the good thing about Painey and JL. They don’t mind going toe to toe if they have to.”The match is captured in a documentary that follows the team throughout the Ashes. Even though Australia went on to retain the urn at Old Trafford, the footage makes for grim viewing as far as Cummins is concerned.That might be the feeling now, but it is unlikely Cummins would have settled in to watch another replay had he been visiting the UK this weekend."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/801a921eec49f8dd97ae0deacb389a23a556fc44/0_89_3360_2015/master/3360.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=80131fe9d624ee9e2ac5d8eeaa27488c","title":"stirling moss great racing driver formula one ayrton senna","story":"The first British megastar driver, who set the model for those who followed, was a true sportsman and always great companyI still like to remember Stirling Moss considering the nature of his craft. “Speed is tranquillity,” he said, and that summed up his approach. His passion was the art of driving and it absolutely made him one of the greats. He drove using his instincts and while the facts may say he never won a world championship, in terms of the legendary names in the sport he is up there with the best, with Jim Clark and Juan Manuel Fangio, with Jackie Stewart and Lewis Hamilton.Moreover Stirling will also always be remembered as a true sportsman. He had very strong views on what was right and wrong in terms of how you conduct yourself both on and off the track. In that way he was a throwback to an era when the ideas of being generous in defeat, chivalrous and wanting to win fair and square were commonplace.I came to know him through my career, although I have no memory of the very first time we met, when Stirling came to my christening. My dad, Graham Hill, managed to persuade him to come and he was there with Bruce McLaren, Taffy von Tripps, Tony Brooks and the whole gang.We share the same birthday, and after I became an F1 driver our paths would often cross. As part of the British Racing Drivers’ Club he was very, very supportive of the work we were doing there. To say someone is a living legend is an overused phrase, but he really was. He could regale us with tales of racing in the good old, bad old days when it was absolutely lethal.During my career, I was very much aware of his weighty comments, his opinions of my own performance. A name like Stirling even commenting on what you are doing is nearly always good, unless of course he didn’t think I had been very impressive. Being Stirling, he was not afraid to give his opinion. He was very forthright, informed by his career and very pithy, but never unnecessarily negative and always a lovely guy, really great company.As time went on I got to know him even better through the Goodwood Festival of Speed, the British Grand Prix, the BRDC and even Sports Personality of the Year. I was once given the job of looking after Stirling, getting him up and down the stairs at Sports Personality and he was still as feisty as ever, even when he was a bit wobbly on his pins.After his accident at Goodwood in 1962, when he found he could no longer drive on instinct, Stirling was honest in calling it a day. That epitomised his attitude to racing. He would rather not have driven than to lack that sense of being at one with the car and being out there on the very edge.In that way he was very like Ayrton Senna and a lot of the greats. A seat-of-the-pants driver, attuned to his senses who managed to deal with the fear, to intellectually put it to one side. But he was also smart enough to realise that once that magic had gone he shouldn’t be doing it any more.During his time on the track he of course became a darling of the British public, through his performances as a driver, and as a winner. He gave Britain what they wanted, he symbolised hope for the future in a dashing personality. He went on to burnish that image of a British sporting gent, and even after he retired he was very good at giving people the racing driver that they wanted. Stirling always delivered the legend.There is great sadness at his death, but a quote of Stirling’s I enjoy from a book written about him back in 1963 still touches me today: “I took a very great deal out of motor racing but I put a lot back too, I do feel that I gave it all but my life.”Stirling was at heart a motor racing aficionado, a lover of the sport and a lover of driving.• Damon Hill is a former British driver that competed in Formula One from 1992-99, winning the drivers’ championship in 1996."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/25ea4f07b569b8957838d20b081de428b84fbf12/0_346_6920_4152/master/6920.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7ec61b403f5a62df28fc13099100f93a","title":"verona van de leur gymnast no food anything survive interview","story":"Dutchwoman was among Europe’s best gymnasts in 2002 but she became penniless and homeless after a bitter dispute with her family and coaches When Verona van de Leur thinks back to the days at the turn of the century when she was one of the best gymnasts in the world, every syllable in her voice is laced with pride.She emerged in 2001 as the leader of an unlikely Dutch gymnastics boom in a sport dominated by post-Soviet giants. At the 2002 European championships she won five medals before snatching a silver on floor at the world championships she was named Dutch sportswoman of the year. As the Netherlands wondered what the future held for its new sporting star, nobody could have imagined it would see her homeless, then in jail, before she picked up the pieces of her life in the pornography industry.Pride was an alien sensation to Van de Leur when she was competing. In her new autobiography, Simply Verona, she claims her parents put success over her wellbeing, pressuring her to succeed for their own gain. When she failed to finish on the podium, her mother would refuse to pick her up from the airport, forcing her to take long train rides home in tears.In the gym, she alleges the training techniques of her coach, Frank Louter, were physically and mentally abusive. While gymnasts were forced to practise too many routines with too many injuries, she says, staff members rummaged through their bags and shamed them for the snacks they hid in lieu of proper meals.“It’s like in the circus with the animals,” she says of the coaching methods in a phone interview. “It’s doing it the hard way. That’s how you learn. You see the documentaries on the internet with crying kids? That’s how it went with us too. If you want to be flexible, it’s hurting. That’s with weight training, that’s with conditioning, that’s with the tricks. Sometimes you break something, sometimes not and you’re lucky.”Van de Leur was not lucky. By 2003, aged 17, her body was crumbling and her mind was vacant. Burnt out a year after her biggest successes, she found herself thinking about suicide. “I felt as if I was in a black hole,” she says. “Maybe the best thing was to quit but there was no option to quit. I tried it a few times but nobody let me.”It would take another five years before Van de Leur found the nerve to relieve herself from that suffocating environment. What she did not expect on her retirement in 2008 was that parting from the sport would lead to a permanent familial rupture.After she began to explore the world beyond the confines of her gym with her boyfriend, Robbie, she returned home one day to find the locks had been changed and she was no longer allowed to enter the building. She later investigated her prior earnings and learned her father had spent her money on his own personal leisure. She eventually won two lawsuits against him, the judge forcing him to pay back a total of €62,000 (around £55,000).Van de Leur and her boyfriend were homeless for two years, sleeping in a car every night. Survival meant long afternoons collecting a few cents on the beach, eating complimentary food in supermarkets. Sometimes they would shoplift. Before helping with youth camps at gyms, she would douse herself in sample supermarket perfume. Although there was a romantic aspect to Van de Leur’s life in those days, finally free with her partner against the world, it was always tempered by the cold reality.“When you have no food and have to shoplift, it’s crossing a line, crossing your own borders that you never thought you would do,” she says. “But to survive, you would do anything that you need.”Their time in the wilderness and out of view ended abruptly. Van de Leur was wandering around a park one day in 2010 when she noticed a man and woman having an affair. She took photos of the pair and then confronted the woman, eventually demanding €2,000. “I was really in the lowest state you can think of,” she says. “On the street with really nothing and when this happened, she asked me if I wanted money. I said, quick-thinking: ‘Yes.’ Because I needed it.”One night a few weeks later she was arrested by a large group of police. Initially detained for 72 days, Van de Leur was charged with blackmail and then also possession of child pornography after photos were allegedly found on a folder in her laptop. The latter charge fell apart in court after her lawyer argued several people had access to her computer.The damage was done. A day before her trial, the press published details of the case and she watched every organisation she had links to sever ties, her life crumbling again before her eyes. “Within 24 hours everything was cancelled,” she said. “Then you have to start over. But it’s hard to actually start over if society doesn’t accept you.”In 2011 as she was figuring out the rest of her life, she was offered a contract to do webcam pornography videos. Van de Leur says she probably would not have agreed had her financial and professional earnings not been so damaged by the court case.After her step into the adult entertainment world, she decided to create her own company and website, participating in adult films while hiring other models for pornographic movies. In a torrid industry, she resolved to film only with her boyfriend, to choose every bit of work for herself and to pull the plug whenever she felt uncomfortable. Her job required her also to chat daily with fans.“It’s hard to explain because sometimes you don’t know their face, their name, and for others you know everything. You know their wife’s name, their children, where they work, where they live. Depending on how much the fan wants to share.”As a gymnast her life was entirely dictated by the whims of the surrounding adults but she saw this as an opportunity to make money and be autonomous through the company she founded and the people she interacted with.At the end of 2019, she stepped away from the adult film business. Now 34, her gaze has shifted, altered by the Me Too movement colliding with the Larry Nassar case and bringing to light the working conditions of gymnasts.In the UK and Ireland, Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123 or email jo@samaritans.org or jo@samaritans.ie.

Here are your first round matchups:The short answer is that H-O-R-S-E is a turn-based skill contest where players battle to show off their ability to make specific shots.Could you go into more detail?I was worried you would ask this. It’s a tad bit convoluted to explain, although it’s rather easy to follow once the game is in progress. For the purpose of this tournament, players will be facing each other one-on-one. The first player (decided by a coin flip, in this particular instance) literally calls the shot: they specify a particular shot that they will attempt. Should they make it, the other player has to make the same shot. If that player fails, they get a letter starting with H (followed by O and then an R and then a… well I think you get the picture). Then it’s that player’s turn to challenge the other. A player is eliminated on the fifth shot they fail to pull off.So the goal for each player is NOT to spell H-O-R-S-E?Correct. Reverse “Wheel of Fortune” rules.Why a horse? Why not a chicken?It turns out that the origin of “H-O-R-S-E” is a nearly impossible thing to google. (I did find some interesting things about evolution, so it’s not a total wash.) Maybe it was just the optimal number of letters, as there’s a shorter version called P-I-G.Wait, doesn’t this means that there’s no time limit here?Yes, although this is scheduled to be a two-hour event, how long we’re actually here depends on how good the players are at making shots. (Spoilers: they are very, very good.) If this does last a long time, it’s probably a good thing. The more competitive tonight’s tournament is, the more entertaining it will likely be. Plus, hey, there hasn’t been basketball in a month, so in my book the longer this goes, the better.As you’ve probably heard, pretty much the entire U.S. has been shut down for the last month. In fact, the NBA deserves at least parital credit in helping the country realize just how serious the coronavirus pandemic was about to become. After Rudy Gobert tested positive for COVID-19, Adam Silver made the quick decision to immediately shut down the league indefinitely. It was a bold move, and the other sports leagues followed suit.Here we are a month later and a healthy percentage of the country is under quarantine. Ironically, we’ve never needed the distraction of live sports more. There are only so many episodes of “Tiger King” to binge, after all. Thankfully, ESPN and the NBA managed to figure out a way to put together a vaguely sports-related competition without, you know, putting huge groups of people at risk. While team basketball, even in an empty arena, is a no-go, H-O-R-S-E is turn based. This means, players can compete with each other without violating social distancing guidelines.ESPN, which has been desperate for content over the last few weeks for obvious reasons, plans to make the most out of this tournament. Today is merely the first round and we won’t crown a winner until the remaining two rounds play out on Thursday.The good thing about social distancing is that it doesn’t affect your ability to communicate with us. We’ll be taking your questions and commentary throughout tonight’s competition. Just shoot an email to Hunter.Felt.Freelance@the or tweet @HunterFelt and we’ll include your thoughts in the liveblog.

Sex life gone from G-spot to pee spot? The London Clinic’s Jane Simpson explains what we can do to tackle incontinence – including kegel exercises that you can do wherever you are As a continence nurse specialist, I’ve seen firsthand how overwhelming and upsetting incontinence can be. Patients visit me when things have gone too far – their behaviours change and they’re suddenly avoiding activities such as playing tennis, having sex or even going to the cinema because they’re worried about having to race to the toilet. When you start avoiding things you enjoy, it’s time to take action.Of course, leakage can be troubling at any moment, but during sex it’s particularly distressing (it tends to happen during an orgasm or because of the physical pressure). But the good news is, it doesn’t mean the end of your sex life. In fact, patients always say they wish they’d sought treatment sooner. Even if you don’t experience leakage, sexual sensation and satisfaction can be improved, too – and who wouldn’t want that? As well as increasing blood supply to the vagina and penis, pelvic floor muscle training (or “kegels”, as they’re also known), can improve muscle tone and maintain nerve activity, meaning better sex.When it comes to treatment for accidental leakage, it depends on the type of incontinence people are dealing with. “Stress incontinence” is when we suffer leakage while doing things such as sneezing, coughing or laughing, and it’s common for women to experience this after having a baby, when the pelvic floor is weakest. Leaking during sports or sex falls under this category, due to weakened pelvic floor muscles. The other common type is an overactive bladder, or “urge incontinence”, which feels like you have to urinate suddenly and often.Pelvic floor exercises can help in both instances, but it’s really important to make sure you’re doing them properly – speak to a women’s health physiotherapist or a continence specialist if unsure. They’re simple – just squeeze, lift and hold the anus and vagina, count to five and repeat five times. Improvement is fast – you’ll notice a change in six weeks if you do them regularly. There’s also a brilliant app called MyPFF, which reminds you to do your exercises.If an overactive bladder is the problem, lifestyle changes are key – symptoms can be worsened by too much caffeine, alcohol, fizzy drinks, spicy foods and stress, for example. Certain medications can also play a part, as well as conditions such as constipation, urinary tract infections and vaginal atrophy. Bladder retraining is great – when you have an urge to pee, you teach yourself to hang on, which slowly expands your bladder capacity. It might also be worth avoiding high-impact sports until your pelvic floor is stronger, since too much exercise can make things worse. Medication and surgery could be considered with a specialist, too.I definitely sense a change coming in the way we discuss women’s health issues and incontinence, and it’s great the conversation is becoming more open. There shouldn’t be any shame or stigma around it any more – this sort of condition affects so many of us. I hope people realise improvement is possible and that once the issue is tackled, it really can be life-changing. Recently, a woman visited me in my clinic and said that just having a treatment plan in place has made her feel better. It really is the very least we deserve.As incontinence affects one in three women over 35, we should all be having more open conversations about this everyday condition that impacts women of all ages.

It implies it’s a time of things “winding down”, “ending”, “drying up”.Well, most things. Because often, along with menopause, comes bladder weakness. And for many women that means that things get decidedly less dry.Unlike when a girl starts her period, which in many cultures is celebrated, and in the UK is now respected with a government campaign to provide sanitary products in schools, when a woman’s periods begin to end, it’s seen as a change towards old age, towards a body that’s “done”. And even for those going through menopause, it has often felt pretty taboo to talk about the daily problems – especially bladder weakness.“Don’t make me laugh, I’ll wet myself!” might seem like an age-old joke, but it’s one that’s true for menopausal women. And when it comes to our sex lives, it’s no laughing matter. There’s fear and shame and women shut down, choosing not to be intimate for fear of leaking urine during a passionate moment.After all, when do you slip “I’d love to have an early night but I’m worried I’ll wet the bed!” into the conversation, whether you’re with a long-term partner or someone new?The good news is this conversation is being reclaimed by women in the spotlight, who are starting to talk about the final menopause taboo of bladder weakness. Well, we talk so much about starting our periods – why would we not talk about stopping them, and how this affects your love life?It seems there has been a realisation that no matter whether you grace the red carpet and TV screens or you’re on the school run with grandchildren or off to the office, menopause will happen to every woman. Take Gwyneth Paltrow, for example, who released a video for her wellbeing site Goop, saying: “I think menopause gets a really bad rap, and needs a bit of rebranding.” Her video Madame Ovary spoke about mood swings and sweats, while British actress Emma Thompson has joked how hot sweats mean she’s not cold on the red carpet.OK, so the conversation is shifting – just like we can now see a tampon string in a TV ad (thanks to Sport England’s This Girl Can campaign), women are no longer sitting quietly while they deal with the side effects of menopause. But there is one subject that still has to work hard to find its way into our vocabulary – bladder weakness.We can talk hot flushes, night sweats, mood swings – all with increasing honesty. But then there’s Nadia Sawalha, who struggled with incontinence in silence. The usually outspoken TV presenter kept quiet about bladder weakness until she was forced to speak about it after having an accident on national TV.Why is it the one part of menopause women can’t talk about? Well, leaking during the day is one thing – the embarrassment of needing to find some alternative underwear, for example – but when it comes to sex, it’s a different matter altogether. Women who have bladder weakness and might have an accident during sex are likely to close off to their partner, so worried they’ll spoil the intimacy that they don’t have sex and even make up excuses, or “blame” menopause. Intimacy is not synonymous with leakage.After all, when you’re not sure whether you might lose control of your bladder, being intimate isn’t always top of the list. Talk about mixed messages! Women are encouraged to embrace their ageing, to love who they are and how they look – to go grey with glamour and grace, or to wear a bikini with pride. Just don’t mention the bladder weakness, right?!As periods end and change, we have to adjust. The problem is, the world doesn’t seem to adjust with us. And women are left in a strange quagmire of going through something so natural and even primal in silence and, often, shame.And with two-thirds of women over 40 affected with bladder weakness, and many revealing it has affected their mental health, it’s time we became more open and honest about how bladder weakness affects us.Meg Matthews, who has been campaigning about the menopause and runs megsmenopause, says: “Bladder weakness, also called bladder incontinence, is a very common consequence of menopause. It’s not easy to talk about this topic, and, because women don’t always feel confident talking about it, they can feel alone. We need to understand that having bladder weakness is OK. This is the message we need to spread.”But just like when we’re younger, confidence can come back when we use the right products. Once a girl knows she can use a tampon or pad, she’s less worried about her period affecting her day-to-day life. And for women with bladder issues, it’s about a pad that can help you forget there’s even a problem. Then you’ll feel freer to have those more difficult intimacy conversations that you’ve been putting off – and perhaps that early night …As incontinence affects one in three women over 35, we should all be having more open conversations about this everyday condition that impacts women of all ages.

The repetitive structures of contemporary composers like Philip Glass and Steve Reich make sense to a techno-head, but pure classical has remained frustratingly out of my grasp.This year is the 250th anniversary of Beethoven’s birth, andcelebrations – all now sadly on hold –were planned around the world. As I I’ve got plenty of free time during lockdown, I decide to give Ludwig another shot, starting with his Symphony No 5 in C minor, possibly the most famous piece of classical music ever written – but my eyes glaze over after the dramatic da-da-da-DAH intro.Luckily, the internet offers plenty of help. The online Khan Academy has a video series on this very symphony, with a wildly enthusiastic conductor telling how when this music debuted it sounded innovative, even daring. The bombast of Beethoven would have been as thrilling as a Marvel fight scene to 19th-century Vienna. But even imagining this I still can’t find the piece “mind-shattering”.Another lesson breaks it down musically, highlighting a moment where the strings drop away to leave a single, plaintive oboe, before erupting back into action. It reminds me of how electronic dance music uses the dynamics of gentle breakdowns and explosive drops for maximum drama. So Beethoven had killer drops, too?The pandemic has sent the world’s orchestras into hibernation. I find a touching virtual performance of Beethoven’s Ode to Joy by the Rotterdam Philharmonic, each player contributing from self-isolation. Hearing those strings soar, apart but together, I feel a genuine tingle.I’m ready for the real thing. There are many options for virtual Beethoven concerts, including performances from Oxford and Berlin. I choose the Philadelphia Orchestra, who filmed themselves performing to an empty auditorium when their 12 March show was cancelled.The lessons have made a difference. I can identify instruments and follow melodies, so feel more engaged. But I still get distracted. Beethoven, the Khan Academy teacher said, needs your unided attention. So I put everything else aside, stand up, and Beethoven’s emotional volatility suddenly surges through me. I do it the way I first fell in love with techno — checking nobody’s there to see, I dance."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/15e84e8f3ecdff6b637be4e3e5c5cd75e49e6678/0_3035_3660_2197/master/3660.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=87fd9966290f5b57a8ea1459d1115821","title":"the stakes were really high bringing sally rooney normal people to tv","story":"Paul Mescal and Daisy Edgar-Jones play Connell and Marianne in the BBCHulu adaptation of the phenomenal bestseller. They discuss sex scenes and millennial traitsby  Claire Armitstead and  Johanna Thomas-CorrThough fans will hope and trust that a TV adaptation of Sally Rooney’s Normal People would not shy from the novel’s sexual intimacies, it keeps us waiting a while – it is not until the second episode that undercover teenage lovers Connell and Marianne get under the covers for the first time. For a few seconds, it all seems to be going comically wrong, as her arms and her ponytail flail above her head, trapped in her pull-off bra. But then her face emerges, shiny with trust and desire, and the fireworks begin. “I love that scene,” says Daisy Edgar-Jones. “It’s so awkward. For me, it is the most representative love scene I’ve ever seen. Connell is so kind and giving and safe with her that it’s a very healthy depiction of what first-time sex can look like.”This might make it sound a bit PG, but as her co-star Paul Mescal quickly chips in: “It’s not clinical. It’s loving and romantic and sexy because you see two minds coming together.” To describe the adaptation as hotly anticipated is an understatement. Rooney herself has co-scripted six of the episodes in collaboration with award-winning playwright and story editor on series two of HBO’s Succession Alice Birch, who recalls “hoovering up” the novel in a jetlagged blur and immediately emailing her agent to say she was desperate to adapt it. “I felt very emotional about those two people. I don’t often have this feeling. In our industry, we can be quite quick to enjoy a book and then immediately think about how to hack it to bits for the screen.”Birch is in good company. Practically as soon as Rooney hit the literary world with her debut novel Conversations With Friends in 2017, she became a calling card for anyone who aspired to be seen as culturally attuned. Her novels were Instagrammed alongside chai lattes atop piles of on-trend books. She was name-dropped on Twitter by actors Lena Dunham and Sarah Jessica Parker, was featured in Florence + the Machine’s fan book club, and was ranked high in books of the year charts by British Vogue and O, The Oprah Magazine. But she was also recognised as a writer’s writer. “It is a long time since I cared so much about two characters on a page,” wrote author Anne Enright in the , when Normal People was published a year later.Novelist and playwright Sebastian Barry, who took over from Enright as laureate for Irish fiction, says: “There is a uniqueness in Sally Rooney, not only in her absolutely crystal clear style, but also in her universal success. It is difficult to identify a comparable moment in Irish writing, both in its breadth and its immediacy, unless you can go back to the impact that the novel, and more particularly the film, of Roddy Doyle’s The Commitments had in the early 1990s. There are other equally radiant careers, more conventionally spread over decades, like Anne Enright’s, or Colm Tóibín’s, but the suddenness of Sally Rooney, the almost abrupt arrival, reminds me more of a figure like Martin McDonagh in the theatre. There is a time before Sally Rooney and a time after.”The sales figures are huge for a literary novel, with Normal People running through seven editions, selling nearly 500,000 copies in the UK and 76,000 in Ireland, according to industry analysts Nielsen Bookscan. Translation rights have been sold into 41 languages. No pressure, then, on Edgar-Jones and Mescal, who are well aware that they are playing two of the most coveted TV roles in the world for their peers right now.Marianne and Connell are a couple striving to find each other through a fog of class, social status and their own failures to communicate. Connell’s mother cleans Marianne’s house. At their secondary school in Sligo, he is a popular sporting hero, while she is the scratchy school swot. Their attraction is as much intellectual as it is sexual, as they learn when they rediscover each other at university in Dublin, by which time their status has reversed: in this rarefied new ambience, she is the cool beauty, while he is the bristly outsider.The series marks the screen debut of Mescal, the 24-year-old son of a garda and a schoolteacher from County Kildare, who made his first professional appearance as an earlier charismatic outsider, Jay Gatsby, at Dublin’s Gate theatre. He was appearing at another Dublin theatre, the Abbey, when he heard Normal People was being cast. “It’s one of those parts that you know quickly will be big. I was around a lot of Irish actors at the time and we all felt we were Connell, in a sense,” he says.Edgar-Jones, a 21-year-old Londoner whose mother is from Northern Ireland, is a relative TV veteran, who made her debut at 17 in the revival of the vintage comedy Cold Feet. She overheard a friend auditioning for the part at her kitchen table. “And I thought: ‘Hmm, that sounds good.’ Then I got the book and I just fell in love with it. The stakes were really high because I thought: ‘Oh my God, I love this more than I’ve loved anything. I really want this part.’”For all that they seem a natural on-screen match, the casting process was as technical in its way as a stud farm vetting, involving “chemistry reads” both together and separately to find out whether the onscreen magnetism worked. Mescal was first to be cast, emerging from a big pool of actors over several rounds of auditions. Edgar-Jones got down to the last five on the strength of a “self-tape” that she had hurriedly recorded in a lunch break from another show. They have clearly become good friends. “When Daisy walked into the room for the chemistry read, I immediately thought: ‘That’s who I imagined Marianne to look like,” says Mescal.“I saw Paul and thought: ‘I know everything about you!’ Which is stupid, because he’s not Connell,” adds Edgar-Jones.The fact that this instant recognition was the product of such a painstaking selection process seems entirely in keeping with the Rooney project: for all that her novels have been hailed as an emanation of the zeitgeist, they are also steeped in classic protocols. “Normal People has the engine of a 19th-century novel,” wrote Enright. “There is an encompassing sense of authority in the voice that makes it more terrible when the characters’ lives start to slip away from them… Rooney is completely in control.” There’s a streak of DH Lawrence in the interraction of hunky sports jock Connell and poor little rich girl Marianne, just as there’s a daub of Doris Lessing’s The Golden Notebook in their determination to find their own political and erotic space (though true to Rooney’s adversarial intelligence as a former debating champion, it’s Connell who precociously name-drops the novel, rather than Marianne).The drama unfolds over four years – sweeping the lovers from school through university to the brink of their adult lives. One might have expected it to be adapted into a lush feature film, but instead it arrives in 12 half-hour TV episodes. The Oscar-nominated Irish film-maker Lenny Abrahamson, who co-directs the series, continues the story. “It used to be that only sitcoms were half an hour and if you wanted to tell a dramatic story, it had to be an hour. But we really liked the idea of short episodes, because it allows you to be single-focused,” he explains, citing that first climactic sex scene: “You couldn’t have had that density of focus over an hour.”“When I hear the phrase ‘sex scene’, I think about a dialogue scene,” Rooney told one interviewer. “What do these characters want to say to each other? I won’t just write a scene where two characters say words to each other randomly. Similarly, sex scenes have to actually play some dramatic role.”  columnist and author Fintan O’Toole picks up her point, saying: “Actually she reminds me of Chekhov in the acute, subtle and nonjudgmental way she calibrates human desires and foibles and self-delusions. She’s not solipsistic – big things are going on underneath the intimacies: social class, money, gender, power. I think she’s hit a nerve right now because we’re in a moment when there’s a heightened awareness that desire and sex cannot be extricated from all of these things. She’s creating love stories for a post-romantic age.”But the representation of those love stories is inevitably different in a novel, which deals in words, and on film, where articulacy lies in the manipulation of the human body. “The sex was a big challenge and we took it really seriously from the beginning,” says Abrahamson. “What we would aim to show, but also literally how we would do the sex in a way that was positive, safe and healthy for everyone involved both in front of and behind the camera.”Not least of the challenges was the issue of asymmetry – of both gender and status – which has cast such a shadow over the media world in the era of #MeToo. The theatre, film and TV director Hettie Macdonald is responsible for six of the episodes. “I wanted to make it a more gender-balanced crew right from the start,” says Abrahamson. “It’s often the case that crews are very male-dominated, especially in the camera department, and I’m beginning to see that there’s less and less reason for that.”“But here’s the biggest thing for me,”he adds. “I’m in my 50s and as far as the young actors are concerned, I’m successful. My worry would be – because I’m squeamish about ever doing anything uncomfortable for them – that they would feel under pressure to do what I wanted, and my fear of that would stop me from asking.”The breakthrough was the decision to hire the services of “intimacy co-ordinator” Ita O’Brien. “I was anxious to start with because I thought the most subtle and important moments would be between me and the actors,” admits Abrahamson. “But what’s brilliant is that she would come in and talk to the whole crew and production about simple things like not using euphemisms, about getting explicit consent every time you’re about to do something and finding a language to talk about lovemaking, and the shapes and moods of it, that is empowering for the people involved.”“She’s the go-to,” agrees Mescal. “She’s brilliant,” says Edgar-Jones. “The sex scenes were a joy to us because it was her job to worry about how it would work and we just turned up, did the choreography and carried on. We just had to think about the emotional beats.”For Edgar-Jones, this sensitivity extends importantly to the use of nudity. “What I’m really happy with is that there’s an equal representation of both our bodies. Paul is equally exposed. When we’re in a scene and topless, it’s different for Paul than it is for me, so that it’s nice that there are shots where we are both fully nude! It means that there’s more of a balance, gender-wise.” One of the puzzling features of the intense identification of readers with Connell and Marianne is that they inhabit a pretty rarefied cultural niche, with its own intellectual and political snobberies. They discuss critical theory and The Communist Manifesto and despise fellow students who don’t put in the reading. At school, Marianne turns her loneliness into an arrogant aloofness which is part of her appeal to Connell, making more popular girls seem dull and samey. Rooney herself has said she had expected the novels only to appeal to “people who share my ideology or have a similarly jaundiced view of social systems.”Mescal, like Connell in the film, was an academically bright Gaelic football star, who decided to veer off in an unexpected direction – in his case by taking himself off to the Lir Academy, a drama school attached to Trinity College Dublin. “That stepping out can make you feel quite naked for a while. I had no prior conception of what drama school, or a life in acting, was going to look like,” he says. The university social scene is treated with a particular disdain by Rooney as a place of privileged poseurs. “I was off-campus on the Conservatoire side of training, but when you venture on campus and you go to house parties, you definitely feel that degree of performance that we see at those house parties in the book. The social class performance… Sally really captures that,” says Mescal.But in one respect the characters are quite separate from their generation. “It is funny because this has been called a millennial novel but they don’t meet over a dating app,” points out Edgar-Jones. “They meet in real life and they have real conversations. They don’t do that much texting, they talk. That’s healthy and exciting and important to show that it does still happen. We’re not all chatting over Facebook Messenger, we do still have intimate, face-to-face relationships.”Rooney herself has said she’s more involved with social media than Connell and Marianne, though she abandoned her pugnacious Twitter account in 2019 with a parting line that would do Marianne proud: “just for clarity, I continue to agree with all your good opinions and disagree with your bad ones (of which I’m sad to say there are many)”.Mescal admits: “My experience of myself and my peers is that Connell and Marianne are in the minority. I do think intimacy and intimate relationships are more difficult in general because of social media and dating apps. I find that slightly depressing and scary because you’re constantly aware of presenting yourself, and then your human contact with people becomes very different. I think Connell and Marianne are exemplary examples of not doing that. We shouldn’t forget that sometimes the best place to meet somebody is at a bar rather than over a phone.”Which brings us to the question of anxiety, to which both lovers are prone. “I do feel like anxiety is more prevalent among young people,” admits Edgar-Jones. “I feel more pressure to be living a life according to what I’m exposed to, what I see on social media – a perfect, positive life. I sometimes feel stressed when I see all my friends hanging out, for example if I’m self-employed and at home with nothing to do. But in a positive way, I’m really grateful to social media and what it’s done to exposing us to different ways of life and different views, allowing us to have bigger dialogues.”Mescal adds: “I think there’s a greater financial pressure on people our age. There’s a likelihood that we will be renting for the vast majority, if not all, of our life. That’s just a shift in society that does lend itself a kind of… what’s it called? A durability. As millennials, we have built up a durability to just take what comes and make the best of it. We’ve known no different in that sense.”The interview is taking place in London, where both actors are now based, just as social distancing is coming into force. How do they think their generation are going to cope? “I think we are well-equipped – as well as one can be – to deal with something like coronavirus because we are constantly used to adapting and compensating and compromising,” says Mescal. “If anything positive has come out of it for me, looking at everyone back home in Ireland, there’s the opportunity for a strong sense of global community and reflecting on everything that’s difficult together. That’s quite uplifting, because we can become quite isolated and alienated and disenfranchised within our own communities.”One thing that is going to bring many people together is the 12 episodes of Normal People, though such is the devotion to Rooney’s characters that appraisal is likely to devolve to the level of: “Why does Marianne have a fringe?” The actors agree. “We’re not going to fit everybody’s idea of them. The only thing that we do have control over is emotionally interrogating them as you would any other character. But we do love Connell and Marianne.”The full series of Normal People is available on BBC Three from 26 April.

She directed the original stage production of Fleabag, script-edited the TV version and is currently the National Theatre’s playwright in residence. Jones has written and created new HBO series Run, DryWrite’s first TV production, which debuts this week on Sky, starring Domhnall Gleeson and Merritt Wever.How did the idea for Run come about?Me and Phoebe had a joke years ago where we’d whisper “Run!” to each other in any situation we wanted to get out of. A relationship, a social engagement, the wrong job, wrong decision… The idea being that we’d take each other’s hands, make a dash for it and keep going. It was a comforting feeling that there was always someone who’d run away with us. We never did it, never just ran off and left people hanging – except once at a festival, but that’s another story! Mostly it was just a funny idea. Years later, it morphed into this TV show.The series opens with a long-separated couple texting “Run!” to each other. Did you ever unwisely text your exes?I used to. I’d also stalk them on social media and obsess about the tiniest things. Are they wearing that jumper I bought them? Bastard!Merritt Wever’s character, Ruby, is a suburban housewife who leaves her life behind. Why?I wanted to explore the idea of a woman at the end of her tether. Yes, she’s middle-class, and in many ways she has nothing to complain about, but Ruby feels like she’s not seen, even by herself. She’s an intelligent woman with loads of potential, but she’s ignored herself and given up so much. This is the only way Ruby can think of to change her life and she does it in a split-second. It’s an extreme solution to what’s perhaps a common problem.Domhnall Gleeson’s character, Billy, is a motivational speaker. Did you research those?I did, people like Tony Robbins, and you get sucked in by them. They’re so powerful in the way they use language. We didn’t want Billy to be an arsehole, callously using people for profit. He’s one of the better ones, who genuinely wants to help people, but he does come to the conclusion that he doesn’t have any right to be telling people how to live.Run’s writer, producers, director are all women. Was that important to you?Absolutely. It’s not at the expense of men at all, but that’s just who we naturally look to and gravitate towards. There are so many talented women out there, you don’t even have to think about positive discrimination.Was Phoebe Waller-Bridge always going to pop up in a cameo role?Oh yeah, she always wanted a part. It’s a surprise who she plays, I think.How does it feel, looking back now, at the cultural impact Fleabag made?It felt like a tipping point for feminism at that time. There was no real voice or leadership where feminism was concerned. In fact, lots of our friends were distancing themselves from the notions of feminism that we’d grown up with. The messages that young girls were getting through porn were confusing. Where were we supposed to look for inspiration? There wasn’t clarity where feminism was concerned, but now there really is. The world has changed so quickly and we’re proud to have been a part of that.Was last summer’s West End run a nice way to close the chapter?Sadly I was in Canada making Run, so I didn’t see any of it. But before I left, I did get to march around to Wyndham’s theatre with Phoebe and I watched her do some bits from the very back of the auditorium, just to check she could reach it. Of course she was nailing it, so I knew it was going to work.What’s your writing routine?It’s bad for my back, but I write on my bed. Pile a load of cushions up, then try to write. I’ll despair for the first half-hour, then get beyond that phase and start writing.What makes you happy when you’re not working?I have a podcast called Guilt \u0026amp Shame, which is about being completely honest. I splurge a lot of personal stuff on that, so I’m hoping my mum doesn’t listen to it.How are you coping in coronavirus lockdown?I’m just in my bedroom. This is where I live now. Sitting on my bed all day, so it could be worse. I’ve gone semi-feral.Are you expecting an influx of texts from your friends saying “Run”?I would love that! It’s the perfect time for it now, of course. I could run to my bedroom wall and back.• Run starts on Wednesday 15 April at 9pm on Sky Comedy and Now TV"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c5d6af1061d11c592d34a585a90771ae55dff44a/298_0_2080_1248/master/2080.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bccaa72ac2f0cccf877bba801d27f438","title":"democratic primary joe biden bernie sanders 2020","story":"The coronavirus pandemic effectively ended the race but a historically erse field had faced off before narrowing to two white men in their 70sThe Democratic odyssey to choose a nominee delivered one final surprise this week: a predictable ending.Joe Biden, the frontrunner for the entire campaign season minus a rocky four-week interlude, is the last Democrat standing after Bernie Sanders suspended his presidential bid on Wednesday.But the result belies what was, by objective measure, no ordinary quest for power. Epic in scale and rich in plot, the Democratic primary was at turns wild, chaotic and downright Shakespearean – all before the arrival of a once-in-a-century plague.Even in a Before Coronavirus world where politicians kissed babies and shook voters’ hands, the 2020 race included a historic impeachment inquiry, an unprecedented election night meltdown and a Hail Mary comeback.If 2016 was the year American politics fell through the looking-glass, 2020 is an improbable romp through wonderland.The Democratic primary race effectively ended where the presidential election will almost certainly be won: Wisconsin. But, thanks to the ongoing pandemic, it was a messy, borderline dystopian experiment affair.Wisconsin forged ahead with its election in defiance of grave warnings from public health officials and more than a dozen other states that chose to postpone their primary over fears for voters’ health.So on Tuesday, thousands of voters waited in hours-long lines to cast ballots wearing protective face masks while poll workers relied on hand sanitizer and, in some cases, makeshift hazmat suits.Dressed like a surgeon in a blue gown, gloves and a mask, the Wisconsin assembly speaker, Robin Vos, a Republican who opposed all efforts to stop in-person voting from taking place, swelled with pride at the scenes of Wisconsin residents fulfilling their civic duty in the midst of a deadly outbreak.“You are incredibly safe to go out,” he assured constituents with a confidence belied by his ensemble.Joe Biden finished fourth in Iowa, fifth in New Hampshire and a distant second in Nevada. With the weight of presidential history against him, the left-for-dead former vice-president looked to South Carolina for salvation.His fortunes began to change with an endorsement from Congressman Jim Clyburn, the most powerful Democrat in South Carolina and one of only a few political figures in America with the power to move votes with a single blessing.It was a blowout of epic proportions. He won every county in the state. Exit polls suggested that he won with white voters and black voters voters with a college degree and voters without one moderate voters and very liberal voters. Over the course of a remarkable 72 hours, Biden’s centrist rivals folded and aligned behind him in a dramatic show of force. He swept to victory on Super Tuesday – going from loser to winner in less than a week.In the end, South Carolina was far more than Biden’s firewall. It was a rocket-fulled jet pack that propelled his string of March victories and set in motion a political revival that longtime political observers swore they had never seen before.Mike Bloomberg, the former mayor of New York, spent nearly a billion dollars – that’s billion with a B – on a three-month presidential bid that triggered widespread fears – and plenty of criticism – that he might effectively buy the nomination.Bloomberg, the 16th wealthiest man in the world, spent lavishly across the US, hiring thousands of staff and flooding the airwaves and internet with endless adverts. His approach was unorthodox: skip the early states and run up the score on Super Tuesday.After rising steadily in the polls, Bloomberg won a place on the debate stage – where Senator Elizabeth Warren so thoroughly savaged his character and his record that she later claimed credit for drawing figurative billionaire tears – and earned a swath of negative publicity for his policies on minority rights as mayor and treatment of women as a media mogul.When the results rolled in on Super Tuesday, Bloomberg’s gargantuan effort yielded the grand prize of American Samoa. The US territory boasts a delegate haul of six, which he split four to two with the Hawaii congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard. Bloomberg promptly dropped out and endorsed Biden.But the saga of his failed experiment continues. Former campaign staffers are now suing Bloomberg for fraud, alleging that he tricked them and thousands of other employees laid off last month into accepting jobs on the promise that they would be paid until the general election in November. Now many are without an income – and health insurance – as they weather the coronavirus pandemic.At the lowest point of Bernie Sanders’ second bid for the White House, he suffered a heart attack. The political prognosis was grim: his campaign would never recover.Yet the “political establishment” – and the manifold other interests he rails against – had once again underestimated the Vermont democratic socialist.In a matter of weeks, the perennial underdog charted an extraordinary rebound. Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez endorsed him. The left rallied. His poll numbers climbed. Suddenly, days before the Iowa caucuses, national Democrats were in full panic mode: Sanders was a runaway train that must be stopped.Sanders won the popular vote in Iowa and then picked off New Hampshire. Then, in Nevada, his political revolution finally arrived. He won across the board, dominating with Latinos and first-time caucus-goers. For a brief moment, before South Carolina changed everything, Sanders appeared unstoppable, his ascent to the nomination inevitable. There are few political events in American politics as highly anticipated as the Iowa caucuses.Presidential candidates spend untold resources and time in this state, endowed with outsized powers to set the course of national politics. But this year, the state would not be remembered for choosing the winner of the first presidential nominating contest.Instead it was the site of a disastrous results reporting meltdown.Caucus day arrived and residents gathered at churches, schools and gymnasiums for this quadrennial display of democracy in action. Hours passed without any results. Rumors began to circulate that an app designed to record and relay the tallies of this byzantine process had malfunctioned. By then, the reporting hotline was overwhelmed with callers. As night turned to day, it was clear the caucuses had gone farcically wrong.The party did not officially certify the results until nearly a month after Iowans cacused. The Associated Press ultimately decided not to declare a winner.The screw-up was later attributed to a combination of technical difficulties and human error. But the state may never recover – with speculation that it may lose its first-in-the-nation voting spot. After rounds of recounting and re-canvassing, riddled by inaccuracies and inconsistencies, the former South Bend mayor Pete Buttigieg was declared the delegate winner while Sanders won the popular vote.On the evening of the caucuses, with no data to betray them, a procession of candidates trotted on stage to declare some version of victory before jetting off to New Hampshire with every intention of never looking back.“Iowa,” Buttigieg declared, “you have shocked the nation.”Democrats have never had so many options for president. At its peak, the Democratic squad was large enough to field both sides of an entire soccer game, with subs.There were six women two black senators an Asian American entrepreneur promising everyone $1,000 a month a Latino former housing secretary a gay small-town mayor who rose from obscurity to political stardom a Hindu anti-war congresswoman two billionaires and a self-help guru who vowed to “harness love” to defeat Trump.But through it all two white men in their 70s – a former vice-president and the runner-up in the last Democratic primary – led the field for much of the race.And, of course, through all those ups and downs, the end result of that enormous field was the one that national polls had predicted from the start: Joe Biden won."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f6210c84570dad6d58545e17a10238604b05a9c4/0_233_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3aa2eafc4b5a0e5cdadcce1c22625a6f","title":"us weather tornado louisiana texas mississippi storms","story":"Twister destroyed buildings in Monroe, Louisiana, while local media said at least two tornadoes touched down in central TexasA tornado strike destroyed homes and left a trail of devastation across parts of Louisiana on Sunday, as forecasters warned that a powerful Easter storm could affect more than a dozen states and millions of people before the early hours of Monday.The storm provided a dilemma for public safety officials trying to find the balance between wanting people to stay in lockdown for the coronavirus pandemic and wanting them to leave their homes for shelter if conditions worsened.The American Meteorological Society (AMS), however, was unequivocal in its advice.“Do not let the virus prevent you from seeking shelter in a tornado,” it said in a statement.Community shelters, the AMS said, should be a last resort.The Louisiana twister touched down in the city of Monroe at lunchtime, where officials posted to Twitter images of damage from a number of locations.

In all, up to 20 states could see some effects, weather experts warned“Stay safe and weather alert – it is a dangerous day in Mississippi,” Tate Reeves, the Mississippi governor, said in a series of tweets.“Please take today’s severe storms very seriously. Please take precautions to keep your family safe. We are working and watching closely. Stay safe.”Meteorologists said up to 95 million people could be affected by the massive storm through Sunday night and into Monday, with hailstones the size of tennis balls possible in places.“The severe weather threat currently over Mississippi will shift east into Alabama later this afternoon,” the NWS storm prediction centre said in a bulletin issued at 2.45pm ET.The storm, it said, was “likely to strengthen further as it moves into Alabama”, bringing more tornadoes, winds up to 70mph and heavy rains leading to flooding.In a live broadcast on Facebook on Sunday afternoon, the NWS office in Jackson, Mississippi, told residents in some areas to seek immediate shelter as it confirmed a tornado on the ground in the state. It was not immediately clear if that touchdown had caused any damage."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3640c2cb134a1236e456d2136a5a5d0d0621148e/0_240_6454_3873/master/6454.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=acb89a2f7e1d245d6387b18cdca32183","title":"tech giants struggle stem infodemic false coronavirus claims","story":"Critics say efforts are too little, too late as research reveals vast majority of false claims appear onlineClick over to Google, type in “coronavirus”, and press enter.The results you see will bear little resemblance to any other search.There are no ads, no product recommendations, and no links to websites that have figured out how to win the search engine optimisation game. Government, NGO and mainstream media sources dominate.Algorithms and user-generated content are out gatekeepers and fact checking are in.Silicon Valley has responded to the “infodemic” with aggressive intervention and an embrace of official sources and traditional media outlets.Across the social web – on Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, Reddit, Instagram and Pinterest – search results related to Covid-19 are similarly predetermined.Instagram delivers a pop-up urging US users to go to the website for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) – or UK users to the NHS – rather than look at the memes and pictures tagged with #coronavirus.On Facebook, a dedicated “Information Center” includes a mix of curated information and official medical advice. On Pinterest, the only infographics and memes to be found on topics such as “Covid-19” or “hydroxychloroquine” are those made by internationally recognised health organisations, such as the WHO.It is a stark contrast to how social media platforms have dealt with misinformation in the past.US-based platforms, shaped by Silicon Valley’s libertarian ethos and protected by the first amendment, have long been reluctant to take a proactive editorial role or censor speech that could be considered political.They have had to be pushed, prodded, cajoled, protested, and shamed into addressing hate speech, anti-vaxx propaganda and the harassment of victims of mass shootings.On coronavirus, they have competed to be responsible and reliable sources of information. Yet still misinformation continues to adapt and spread, largely on social media.A conspiracy theory falsely linking 5G to the coronavirus pandemic has led to real-world consequences, including threats and harassment against telecom engineers and petrol bomb attacks on telephone poles.Carl Bergstrom, a University of Washington professor of biology who also studies and has written a book about misinformation, says the efforts of the social media companies are too little, too late.“They’ve built this whole ecosystem that is all about engagement, allows viral spread, and hasn’t ever put any currency on accuracy,” he said. “Now all of a sudden we have a serious global crisis, and they want to put some Band-Aids on it. It’s better than not acting, but praising them for doing it is like praising Philip Morris for putting filters on cigarettes.”Some of the more radical steps taken by tech companies include Twitter’s new policy to remove misinformation that contradicts official public health advice, such as tweets encouraging people not to follow physical distancing guidelines, and WhatsApp’s strict new limits on message forwarding.The platforms feel they can be much more aggressive on coronavirus misinformation than they have been on political misinformation, said Claire Wardle of the non-profit organisation First Draft.“There are no two sides with coronavirus, so they don’t have people on the other side saying: ‘We want this,’ the way you do with anti-vaxxers or political misinformation,” said Wardle. “They are freer to act.”It is also relatively simple and straightforward for the platforms to select trusted sources of authoritative information – the WHO, NHS, CDC, etc – without appearing politically biased.Wardle faulted the tech companies for not being better prepared for the crisis, however. Facebook has long ignored the conspiracy communities that organise using Facebook groups, such as anti-vaxxers, followers of QAnon, and people who believe 5G is harmful. Coronavirus misinformation is rampant in those communities.And while the scientific nature of the crisis may lessen some of the external political pressures over how to moderate speech, it also brings with it a slew of challenges. The coronavirus is brand new, and the scientific understanding of it changes daily.Bergstrom described this conundrum as an “uncertainty vacuum”. “Any reasonable authority will not give you a straight answer” to certain questions about the pandemic, “not because they’re trying to mislead you, but because they don’t know yet,” he said. Another complicating factor is that normally trustworthy sources are not providing reliable information.“We’ve seen the US government, particularly the White House, becoming a significant purveyor of misinformation around the virus,” Bergstrom said.Facebook and Twitter have removed posts by prominent and powerful people over coronavirus misinformation, including the Brazilian president, Jair Bolsonaro, but the real test of their resolve will be whether they ever take action against misinformation by Trump.“We planned for years for this pandemic, but we never realised that we would be fighting a war on two fronts,” said Bergstrom. “One against the pandemic, and one against all the disinformation and hate and fear that is being amped up and enflamed by political opportunists.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c173c0510ec2550b2604076cf13a132d9f12a97a/0_423_1270_762/master/1270.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=436a6aacf1da4d50073eb439fa83d8ed","title":"after coronavirus the penny has dropped that wellbeing isnt individual but social","story":"Our attitudes and rituals are undergoing a transformation during the Covid-19 crisis. Can we hope that a lasting good will come of it?Hannah Arendt once wrote that in times of deep crisis “we have a right to expect illumination”. It seems callous to suggest that this tenebrous pandemic is letting the light in, and daft to offer immediate consolations amid so much grief. But there is a sense that, with the world having ground to a halt, our fantasies are finally taking flight.Much of what we have always been told was impossible is actually happening: the homeless are (in some places) being housed in hotels while prisoners are (in others) being released. Kids are told not to go to school and to forget exams. Massive government spending is ensuring that people are guaranteed an income even if they can’t work. Private hospitals in Spain are being nationalised. A hospital has been built in London under a fortnight. In Portugal, tens of thousands of migrants and asylum seekers have been “regularised” and given full rights. It’s not quite a revolution, but it’s an epic conceptual awakening.In some ways it’s like a blissed-out stoner’s dream of what the world might be. The “Pianura Padana”, the flat plain of the Po valley, usually has some of the worst air pollution in the world. The air is now perfumed by spring. You can see the mountains. Two weeks ago we were singing Rino Gaetano’s The Sky Is Evermore Blue from our balconies.Realists have, rightly, tempered the utopian excitement and warned of a bleak future. Outbreaks of localised barbarism and criminality are predictable when people feel impoverished, paranoid and vulnerable. Already, in Italy, we’ve had instances of toughs refusing to pay in supermarkets. Democratic politicians have had a taste of almost dictatorial power over the people, and it will be hard to roll back rule by emergency decrees. Countries like Hungary might be slipping away from the democratic fraternity. Public health will be an excuse to ramp up state surveillance and, when we need to jump-start the economy, environmental protections may well be ripped up. The counter-revolution, those seers say, is just around the corner.The penny has also dropped that wellbeing isn’t inidual but social. We are not actually independent at all, but dependent. We can make each other sick and we can try to make each other well. We’ve understood that a healthy community (as Wendell Berry wrote in his essay Health Is Membership) isn’t merely human, but also “its soil, its water, its air”.It has been fascinating to see the speed at which other attitudes have changed. The indignation expressed towards people not respecting social distancing (from those who would never normally describe themselves as moralists) has been understandably shrill: here too we’ve suddenly realised that the wellbeing of the group is endangered by indifferent iniduals, and that community – for which we’ve yearned for so long – means originally simply a pooling of duties.The lockdown has made everything local. The world has got much larger and we’re rediscovering corner shops and neighbours, the wisdom of proximity and closeness. The great Italian communalist Lanza del Vasto once urged: “Find the shortest, simplest way between the earth, the hands, and the mouth.” That shortening of the supply chain has rehumanised us slightly. We’re bartering with strangers on our street and sales of yeast and flour have increased exponentially as we rediscover the consolations of baking.I have a high-powered lawyer friend who has described the joy of just darning socks and knitting. It sounds folksy, I know, but the kitchen table is the centre of our lives once more. We’re rediscovering that frugality and resourcefulness are creative, if not always comfortable. Last week I was cutting the communal grass of our palazzo – the only place our kids can play outside – with a borrowed billhook, which is a bit like cutting hair with a fork.That centring has been mental as well as physical. It’s a truism of modern life that we struggle to be settled or present. Because we can be anywhere, we actually end up being nowhere. We suffer, as the sociologist Zygmunt Bauman once wrote, an “electronically assured out-of-placeness”. We’re notoriously fidgety and lacking attention. We just keep clicking and tapping. When I was running our community, one of the hardest things for those in early recovery was just to sit still. We used to have Quaker-like silences twice a day, and to begin with, many just couldn’t cope with the sudden stillness.It seems to me as if we’re all in a similar situation right now. We’ve come to an emergency stop, and it’s painful not just because we’re separated from others, but because we can no longer separate from ourselves. Until now we’ve kept frenetically busy to keep from reflection, but now that we’re still, demons, voices and shame can quickly surface. I know friends who are suffering panic attacks, even something close to psychosis. Many are alone and far from the solace of any fellowship.The poet and psychologist Hala Alyan wrote a beautiful essay in Emergence magazine last week, in which she suggested that this pandemic is “serving as a flashlight – illuminating people’s unsteadiest, half-finished parts. It’s showing us where our work remains. People talk about their ex-boyfriends, their long-resolved eating disorders, their childhood secrets…”It may be that this medical emergency will offer the space and time for us to focus, for once, on our interior worlds. Because any speculation about the future is redundant unless there is spiritual, as well as medical, healing. Johnny Sertin, founder of a soul-centred consultancy called Becoming, said last week: “We need another way, another world, but it’s impossible if we cannot do that from a place of being at home with who we are.”As we’re all pondering self-preservation, it’s inevitable that we’re wondering what has been eating us up all this time. Many of the friends I’ve talked to in recent weeks have expressed relief that there’s an enforced detox from shopping. Many seem to have realised the true nature of consumerism, which is that we’re not only consumers but also being consumed by it. Choice is so limitless that we never make up our minds. All the energy, movement and money to buy stuff and experiences leaves us feeling empty and remorseful. I personally know that every time we drive to the out-of-town shopping mall, built (allegedly) on the proceeds of organised crime, with speakers in the car park blasting the very worst pop music, to buy cheap clobber for the kids – it rips my spirit.As long ago as 1955, Victor Lebow suggested that we seek “spiritual satisfaction” in consumption. Acquisition pretends to fill an existential void but only deepens it. We’re constantly engaging in a psychic gorging and purging that leaves us weak and guilty. It’s only during this slow-down that I realise how similar we are to Leonia, the imaginary society described by Italo Calvino in Invisible Cities: “expelling, discarding, cleansing a recurrent impurity. Street cleaners are welcomed like angels”.It seems even more important now, because almost the last distraction now left to us is the internet. All our social rituals – in pubs, clubs, schools, religious gatherings – are currently mediated by screens. There’s still idealism in our digital connections, as evidenced by the open-source community’s collaboration on the design or production of medical equipment. But our online habits are being constantly monetised. Writing about surveillance capitalism last week, Simona Guerra, an associate professor of politics at the University of Leicester, said that, just like manual labour of old, “human activities themselves are sold and bought”.It’s as if the sacred “market” has, like a hated dictator, finally been toppled. Instead of our society having a market, we’re realising that the market had our society. Jonathan Rowson, the philosopher and director of the Perspectiva research institute, wrote recently that “the state”, instead of “socialising and humanising the economy”, had allowed “markets to gradually economise and dehumanise society”. Even the Financial Times has been advocating Keynesian, collectivist financial packages. We’re rehabilitating those heretics who have long lamented neo-liberalism’s corrosive effects. The great social theorist Steven Lukes is blunt: “market fundamentalism”, he told me, has created “devastation and unbridled inequalities”.Globalisation has been a large part of the market’s supremacy. The idealistic telling of globalisation was that it was an equitable trading free-for-all which could enrich the poor. The reality, though, has been incessant outsourcing so that our consumables remain as cheap as chips. We’ve come to expect all produce, at all times, in all seasons. Globalisation has been a race to the bottom, which has created semi-slavery at the harsh end of very long supply chains. It has eradicated businesses and jobs close to home and shred local networks of trust and kinship. Like the globe-trotting money, we’ve become frenetically mobile and rootless.But the most naked truth of this crisis is that we can no longer remain in denial about finitude, not just our own as we see mortality close up, but also our planet’s. The Quaker economist Kenneth E Boulding once (allegedly) said: “Anyone who believes in infinite growth on a finite planet is either mad or an economist.” It’s so obvious it’s been ignored for decades. But if this Covid crisis is a dress rehearsal for the climate one, we have seen some of the costs and consequences. “The case for post-growth economics,” Rowson says, “just became stronger. We need economies that make sense of 8 billion or so human beings living together in a planetary system as a whole, not the extraction of profit to achieve abstract aggregate targets like GDP.”It’s long been one of the truisms of modern life that we suffer mythic deprivation. We tell stories, but are never enveloped in one. There has been no belonging and thus no community, no heroes and no quests. Suddenly we have all the above. But it’s not entirely like a film where the heroes would be the medics dying to save us (125 in Italyat the time of writing) and the quest would be the global race to find a vaccine. They’re just a part of this story. Heroism for the rest of us is much subtler and quieter: it’s about restraint and retreat, solitude and stillness. And our quest is perhaps even harder: to discern the common good and look for enlightenment in this darkness.Tobias Jones is the author of A Place of Refuge"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e7200859fb487792e1336e456cb1a1b0c126614c/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=2703eda6c4eb79ac8c11ea9b07ca2183","title":"coronavirus statistics what can we trust and what should we ignore","story":"The flurry of figures, graphs and projections surrounding the pandemic is confusing. Two experts guide us through the mazeThe past few weeks has seen an unstoppable epidemic … of statistics. The flood threatens to overwhelm us all, but what do all these numbers mean? Here are eight statistics you may see, with some warnings about how much we might trust them.1 The number of new cases each day This can be a very poor reflection of the number of people who have actually been infected, as it depends crucially on the testing regime – up to 9 April, 1.3 million tests had been carried out in Germany, versus 317,000 in the UK.2 The number of new deaths each day The range of sources is bewildering. The daily announcements should be treated with caution as they only include deaths in hospital of those who have tested positive for coronavirus, and there is generally a delay in reporting deaths of a few days or even longer. For example, while on 27 March the government announced that 926 Covid-19 deaths had so far taken place in English hospitals, NHS England now reports that the true figure was 1,649. The gold standard is the number of death certificates collated by the Office for National Statistics: it report at least 1,568 mentions of Covid-19 for all deaths up to 27 March, but this will increase as registrations come in.3 The total number of deaths Graphs of accumulating deaths are shown at the daily government press conference, but they are a hopeless tool for spotting trends: we need daily counts to see whether we have reached a plateau (which will not be a “peak”). But the daily counts are volatile, and so need some smoothing to bring out the underlying trends: World in Data uses a three-day moving average.4 Numbers recorded on a logarithmic scale This will have a vertical axis labelled 1, 10, 100, 1,000. These are useful for comparing trends, but useless for getting an impression of the magnitude of the problem.5 Predictions from models Computer models come in two types. The first tries to model the epidemic itself, by making simplified assumptions about the mechanism by which a virus spreads through a community. Key quantities, such as how many people an average case will infect, are highly uncertain at the start of an epidemic but are refined as more data is gathered. Such models have formed the basis for predicting the consequences of policy decisions in the UK.The second type of model is purely empirical, fitting curves to the observed data, and making strong assumptions about the shape of the curve to extrapolate into the future. These projections need to be viewed with extreme caution since they can be extremely sensitive to a few data points. On 9 April, US organisation IHME predicted an eventual 66,000 UK Covid-19 deaths but this had dropped to 37,000 three days later – it is difficult to take such modelling seriously. Model predictions should always acknowledge uncertainty, although this is rarely reported by the media.6 “Excess deaths” The number of extra deaths that will be recorded in this period, due either to Covid-19 or the lockdown, is hotly contested. Lives will be lost because of the illness, reduced medical care for everyone, domestic violence and the effects of unemployment and poverty and lives will be saved through fewer accidents and, particularly, improved air quality. A (disputed) fraction of those dying would have died anyway in the coming year, a phenomenon known as mortality displacement or even “harvesting”. But the overall effect is hard to predict, and confident claims should be treated with scepticism.7 The lethal risks of being infected These vary dramatically with age and frailty, just as “normal” risks do. In fact the current estimates for the general public (rather than healthcare workers) seem remarkably similar to the risks we face anyway each year – but all packed into a few weeks.8 The “accuracy” of an antibody test Even apparently accurate antibody tests can lead to many false assurances of immunity. But a less accurate test may be fine if we are testing a representative sample to estimate the proportion of a population who have immunity.Finally, it’s tempting to link a country’s statistics to the measures they have taken to control the virus: for example, has Sweden’s more relaxed policy been as effective as lockdown? But countries differ in so many ways: basic demographics, compliance and social networks, testing capacity and policy, health service characteristics and so on. Former prime minister Carl Bildt has joked that Swedes “have a genetic disposition to social distancing anyway”.Sylvia Richardson, director, MRC Biostatistics Unit, president elect of the Royal Statistical Society David Spiegelhalter, chairman, Winton Centre for Risk and Evidence Communication"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/04094165692e202f98163bbb41947efa89cbe046/0_0_2000_1200/master/2000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4c7d78322c524e8b3481232a5567b105","title":"documents contradict uk government stance on covid 19 herd immunity","story":"List of possible interventions included simulating impact of allowing majority to be infectedThe inclusion of “targeted herd immunity” as a possible UK government response to the Covid-19 pandemic – in a list of possible interventions considered for analysis by a contractor – appears to contradict strong denials by the health secretary 10 days earlier that it was any part of government policy.Matt Hancock gave that response on 14 March after two senior government officials had said publicly that achieving “herd immunity” was a key aim, prompting widespread alarm among medical experts that the British government was planning to allow the majority of the population to become infected.However, a proposed computer simulation of the impact of “targeted herd immunity” was contained in a planning document, used by NHSX and a technology contractor to map out the data response to the pandemic, around 23 March.While it does not appear the herd immunity simulation took place, its inclusion in a list of possible interventions raises questions about the government’s stance on the policy.It is caused by a member of the coronavirus family that has never been encountered before. Like other coronaviruses, it has come from animals. The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared it a pandemic.About one in six people, the WHO says, become seriously ill. The elderly and people with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, or chronic respiratory conditions, are at a greater risk of serious illness from Covid-19.In the UK, the National health Service (NHS) has identified the specific symptoms to look for as experiencing either:As this is viral pneumonia, antibiotics are of no use. The antiviral drugs we have against flu will not work, and there is currently no vaccine. Recovery depends on the strength of the immune system.Medical advice varies around the world - with many countries imposing travel bans and lockdowns to try and prevent the spread of the virus. In many place people are being told to stay at home rather than visit a doctor of hospital in person. Check with your local authorities.In the UK, NHS advice is that anyone with symptoms should stay at home for at least 7 days. If you live with other people, they should stay at home for at least 14 days, to avoid spreading the infection outside the home.China’s national health commission confirmed human-to-human transmission in January. As of 6 April, more than 1.25m people have been infected in more than 180 countries, according to the Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering.There have been over 69,500 deaths globally. Just over 3,200 of those deaths have occurred in mainland China. Italy has been worst affected, with over 15,800 fatalities, and there have been over 12,600 deaths in Spain. The US now has more confirmed cases than any other country - more than 335,000. Many of those who have died had underlying health conditions, which the coronavirus complicated.More than 264,000 people are recorded as having recovered from the coronavirus.Dr William Hanage, a professor of the evolution and epidemiology of infectious disease at Harvard, wrote in the  that such a policy would result in large numbers of people dying and the NHS being overwhelmed. He reflected the general bafflement among many experts, because “herd immunity” is typically achieved via widespread vaccination against a disease.There is no vaccine for Covid-19, and “herd immunity” without a vaccine assumes that the vast majority of people who recover from the coronavirus will then be immune, which has not yet been conclusively established.Hancock set out the government’s position in an article for the Sunday  on 14 March, explicitly denying that it was aiming for herd immunity. “We have a plan, based on the expertise of world-leading scientists. Herd immunity is not a part of it. That is a scientific concept, not a goal or a strategy.”Asked about the “herd immunity” concept on Andrew Marr’s BBC political programme the following day, Hancock emphasised: “Herd immunity is not our policy, it’s not our goal.”Yet still, by around 23 March, a planning document used by NHSX, the health service’s digital planning department, and Faculty, a British artificial intelligence company contracted to aid the response to the Covid-19 outbreak, included “targeted herd immunity” as one of several government “interventions” whose impact upon the spread of the disease could be examined via computer simulations.In a list headed “scenariosinterventions” that could be modelled, the document includes “intervention analyses” of policies such as social distancing and schools closures, which the government introduced incrementally from 16 March. Below those the document lists: “Targeted herd immunity (only isolate most vulnerable parts of population).”Later in the document, a list of interventions that “require no new simulation dynamics” of the computer modellers comprises social distancing, school closures, “targeted herd immunity (only isolate most vulnerable parts of population)”, household quarantine and “area quarantine”.Lawyers for Faculty suggested the proposed herd immunity simulation was the result of entirely internal, preliminary discussion and never took place. In a statement, Faculty said it was “enormously proud” of the work it was doing for NHSX, saying its “visualisations and forecasts” would allow decision-makers to make faster and more informed decisions. “This work is saving lives.”The first revelation that the government might be looking to create “herd immunity” came on 11 March from Dr David Halpern, the chief executive of the governmental behavioural insights team, known as the “nudge unit”. No physical distancing measures were in place at that time all schools, workplaces, pubs, restaurants and social events were still open and going ahead, and the government’s only advice was that people with Covid-19 symptoms should self-isolate for a week.Some medical experts maintain that, in the absence of widespread testing of people and tracing those they may have infected, this remains the government’s policy: to contemplate most of the population ultimately becoming infected, and eventually achieve herd immunity.The DHSC did not respond to a question about why “targeted herd immunity” was listed on an NHSX document as a specific intervention to be modelled for its impact on the Covid-19 pandemic.The Scott Trust, the ultimate owner of the , is the sole investor in GMG Ventures, which is a minority shareholder in Faculty."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/97a5ffd00a08088d5ac86f30ce0fd0126e9d1adb/20_98_3921_2353/master/3921.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e82202a9f70e296e87ae0e5e98675ce9","title":"dont stand so close to me hundreds flock to londons green lungs","story":"As the capital’s Victoria Park reopens its gates after two weeks, the rules on exercise and social distancing remain blurredAs temperatures nudged into the 20s yesterday on a brilliant morning in east London, one of Victoria Park’s management team admitted she and her colleagues had “been doing rain dances” in the vain hope of poor weather.Saturday was the first day for two weeks the so-called People’s Park had been open to the public, following police complaints of people gathering large groups in defiance of coronavirus restrictions. The decision by Tower Hamlets Council to close the park was greeted with frustration and incomprehension by many locals.“Closing this place just put more pressure on all the other parks in the area,” said Joe Thompson, a keen skateboarder and the father of a toddler.“All they did was push everyone on to the canal path, which is really narrow, making it far worse,” said Lizzie Kempton.They were among hundreds of people – families, lovers, strollers and runners – streaming into the 213 acres of parkland and taking advantage of the kind of summer-like day that must give Matt Hancock nightmares. The park benches were all taped off, like mini crime scenes, with signs warning people not to use them. Sitting on the grass, the habit that had originally caused the closure, was also forbidden.“We’re asking people sitting down to move on because technically they could be taking up space where people could be circulating,” said the management team member, who did not wish to give her name.But hardly anyone was circulating on the grass, where huge vistas of spotless green were untouched by human foot or bottom. Instead people were sticking to the crowded paths as they tried, and often failed, to maintain the specified social distance.Avoidance of other people has become the daily danse macabre of modern life, because it’s no longer just a matter of good manners but also, conceivably, life and death. Where personal space was once a subjective concept, it now comes with a clearly defined two-metre radius.“Everyone is adhering to it,” said Shahed Gulam, out strolling with his partner and their two children, but as he said those words a runner trotted by barely a metre away.There does seem to be some ambiguity or difference of interpretation about when this exclusion zone should be observed. Victoria Park has banned cyclists to try to lessen space disputes, yet alongside the nearby canal, cyclists, runners and walkers are vying for priority on the busy towpath.“There’s a bit of a blurred line with exercise and knowing how you’re supposed to implement it,” said Jonathan King, a construction project manager, who uses the park to walk and run. “ I don’t think you really know if you can slip past someone for a second or two. But to be honest, there’s no other way of doing it, otherwise people wouldn’t be moving.”“I kind of get a little aggravated at people jogging past me,” said Thompson, who was fed up with runners infringing the two-metre rule. “If you’re jogging anyway, jog round me, don’t jog at me! These guys are really puffing out, which is just as bad as a cough or a sneeze in my mind.”Nonetheless, he had resisted the temptation to confront these invaders of his personal space. “Best to lead by example and avoid other people rather than shouting and telling them what they’re doing wrong,” he said. “No one likes to hear that.”Despite the various government strictures in force, there remain large areas of uncertainty on the streets and in the parks, where a new etiquette is being shaped to contend with this strange and still new terrain of the lockdown. At its heart is a paradoxical and utterly novel idea of public solidarity: in order to unite as a community we must remain apart as iniduals.Social media accounts are filled with fulminating descriptions of the points at which that strained contract breaks down. And it can be hard to see the best intentions in others when your primary concern is that they should stay away from you.“Most people have been absolutely lovely this morning,” said the park manager. “It was later in the afternoon that we were getting groups. That’s why we’re closing at four.”Paris closed all its parks entirely three weeks ago. And last week it banned daytime jogging in an effort to slow the spread of the virus. So far in London, where the Covid-19 death rate continues to climb, the issue has not been about people moving too fast, but those who stop still.Running may have its critics, but it’s an exercise. Sunbathing, alas, is not – even if done in splendid isolation. Yet for all their fears of the draconian measures that might come, no one in Victoria Park was comfortable with the idea of telling others what to do. London prides itself on its tolerance, the ability of many different people to live side by side with minimal conflict.As Robert Copsey, a music journalist who shares a flat with King, put it: “The thing about social distancing in London is that we’re all so close together all the time anyway.”London’s parks are commonly referred to as its lungs, and now the city is under siege from a respiratory illness. Whether it can continue to keep open these vital green spaces will come down to how carefully their users can stay apart. The signs were mostly promising on Saturday morning, but a lot of park keepers will be relieved that the temperature is due to drop tomorrow."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f2ee93eeb9a26a91ab48ec63d4077f8c7eae18d1/0_209_4134_2481/master/4134.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=379c2113b7b43908b97312b40f7c8e25","title":"easter passover ramadan festivals test the faithfuls resolve over lockdown","story":"Anglican vicars are not the only spiritual guides fighting curbs imposed on worship, with many flouting their government’s rules as more people seek solace in religionMembers of the Church of England are not noted for their resistance to authority. But during Holy Week, the most significant time in the Christian calendar, its leaders have faced mounting objections to its edict that all churches must close - even to their own clergy.Some prominent Anglicans have taken to social media and blogs this Easter to argue that churches must remain open, and that to lock their doors is to risk people’s spiritual health. Even Sarah Mullally, the bishop of London – a former nurse, and number three in the C of E’s hierarchy – suggested in a letter to parishes that vicars could live-stream services from their church buildings… before correcting herself on Twitter.Justin Welby, the archbishop of Canterbury, was forced to restate the reasons for church closures in a Facebook video last week. In a tone of rebuke, he said the church must “set an example”.All this was just a minor example of people of faith insisting on their right to worship in traditional ways in the face of near-global paralysis. Some of the most extreme have claimed they have ine protection, that the virus is God’s punishment for the sins of the world, or that it is a sign of the end of days.Perhaps the first example of religious organisations elevating their right to worship above the right of others to health came in mid-February in the South Korean city of Daegu. More than 1,000 members of the Shincheonji Church of Jesus prayed shoulder to shoulder in a windowless basement. In the congregation was a 61-year-old woman with a sore throat and a fever.Three days later, she became Patient 31, the 31st person in South Korea to test positive for Covid-19. By 1 March, some 2,200 cases – then about three in five of South Korea’s total – were traced back to the church.In the following weeks, as wave after wave of countries announced restrictive measures, evidence grew of resistance among some religious groups and organisations. In Bangladesh, at least 10,000 – some estimate 30,000 – Muslims gathered for a mass prayer session in the town of Raipur on 18 March. A religious leader in the town told people that, following the prayers, they would now be “free from the coronavirus”.A couple of weeks earlier, 16,000 people attended a four-day Islamic conference at the Sri Petaling mosque near the Maylasian capital, Kuala Lumpur. About 1,500 were from other countries, including China and South Korea. More than 400 coronavirus patients in Malaysia were later linked to the conference – and other cases in Brunei, Singapore, Cambodia and Thailand were traced back to the mosque meeting.Friday prayers became a point of tension in Pakistan and Bangladesh, across the Middle East. The religious obligation for Muslim men to go to the mosque for noon prayers on Friday ran up against lockdown restrictions, despite the reassurance of imams and Islamic scholars that these were exceptional circumstances.In Israel, the UK and the US, ultra-Orthodox Jewish communities celebrated Purim on 9 and 10 March. People gathered in large numbersbut within days, rabbis and communal leaders were advising synagogues and yeshivas (religious schools) to close. After the Israeli government’s lockdown regulations were flouted, the entire city of Bnei Brak was barricaded, with 1,000 police officers blocking the movement of its ultra-Orthodox residents. And In New York, police broke up three ultra-Orthodox funerals last weekend.In the US, churches in Florida, Ohio, Kentucky and Louisiana have continued to hold services, with some states offering limited exemptions from restrictions for faith organisations. Rodney Howard-Browne, a pastor in Tampa was arrested after his megachurch hosted acts of worship attended by hundreds of people. Amid these tensions, faith leaders in the UK say they have been taken aback by the numbers of people tuning into online worship and prayer – far more than turn up in person. Virtual services are “meeting a deep spiritual need”, said Helen-Ann Hartley, the bishop of Ripon. “People are asking big questions about Covid-19 – why now, why us, what does this mean for my life?”This month, as the world’s major religions celebrate significant festivals – Easter, Passover, Ramadan and Vaisakhi – in isolation, the test of faith is set to intensify."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1fbd1be7636cc82125518472fbcd27e7e177373b/261_2_1659_995/master/1659.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8b410b29280413b96afd735a80fef159","title":"five months on what scientists now know about the coronavirus","story":"Medical researchers have been studying everything we know about Covid-19. What have they learned – and is it enough to halt the pandemic? Coronaviruses have been causing problems for humanity for a long time. Several versions are known to trigger common colds and more recently two types have set off outbreaks of deadly illnesses: severe acute respiratory syndrome (Sars) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (Mers).But their impact has been mild compared with the global havoc unleashed by the coronavirus that is causing the Covid-19 pandemic. In only a few months it has triggered lockdowns in dozens of nations and claimed more than 100,000 lives. And the disease continues to spread.That is an extraordinary achievement for a spiky ball of genetic material coated in fatty chemicals called lipids, and which measures 80 billionths of a metre in diameter. Humanity has been brought low by a very humble assailant.On the other hand, our knowledge about the Sars-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19, is also remarkable. This was an organism unknown to science five months ago. Today it is the subject of study on an unprecedented scale. Vaccines projects proliferate, antiviral drug trials have been launched and new diagnostic tests are appearing. The questions are therefore straightforward: what have we learned over the past five months and how might that knowledge put an end to this pandemic?The Sars-CoV-2 virus almost certainly originated in bats, which have evolved fierce immune responses to viruses, researchers have discovered. These defences drive viruses to replicate faster so that they can get past bats’ immune defences. In turn, that transforms the bat into a reservoir of rapidly reproducing and highly transmissible viruses. Then when these bat viruses move into other mammals, creatures that lack a fast-response immune system, the viruses quickly spread into their new hosts. Most evidence suggests that Sars-CoV-2 started infecting humans via an intermediary species, such as pangolins.“This virus probably jumped from a bat into another animal, and that other animal was probably near a human, maybe in a market,” says virologist Professor Edward Holmes of Sydney University. “And so if that wildlife animal has a virus it’s picked up from a bat and we’re interacting with it, there’s a good chance that the virus will then spread to the person handling the animal. Then that person will go home and spread it to someone else and we have an outbreak.”As to the transmission of Sars-CoV-2, that occurs when droplets of water containing the virus are expelled by an infected person in a cough or sneeze.Virus-ridden particles are inhaled by others and come into contact with cells lining the throat and larynx. These cells have large numbers of receptors – known as Ace-2 receptors – on their surfaces. (Cell receptors play a key role in passing chemicals into cells and in triggering signals between cells.) “This virus has a surface protein that is primed to lock on that receptor and slip its RNA into the cell,” says virologist Professor Jonathan Ball of Nottingham University.Once inside, that RNA inserts itself into the cell’s own replication machinery and makes multiple copies of the virus. These burst out of the cell, and the infection spreads. Antibodies generated by the body’s immune system eventually target the virus and in most cases halt its progress.“A Covid-19 infection is generally mild, and that really is the secret of the virus’s success,” adds Ball. “Many people don’t even notice they have got an infection and so go around their work, homes and supermarkets infecting others.”By contrast, Sars – which is also caused by a coronavirus – makes patients much sicker and kills about one in 10 of those infected. In most cases, these patients are hospitalised and that stops them infecting others – by cutting the transmission chain. Milder Covid-19 avoids that issue.Occasionally, however, the virus can cause severe problems. This happens when it moves down the respiratory tract and infects the lungs, which are even richer in cells with Ace-2 receptors. Many of these cells are destroyed, and lungs become congested with bits of broken cell. In these cases, patients will require treatment in intensive care.Even worse, in some cases, a person’s immune system goes into overdrive, attracting cells to the lungs in order to attack the virus, resulting in inflammation. This process can run out of control, more immune cells pour in, and the inflammation gets worse. This is known as a cytokine storm. (In Greek, “cyto” means cell and “kino” means movement.) In some cases, this can kill the patient.Just why cytokine storms occur in some patients but not in the vast majority is unclear. One possibility is that some people have versions of Ace-2 receptors that are slightly more vulnerable to attacks from the coronavirus than are those of most people.Doctors examining patients recovering from a Covid-19 infection are finding fairly high levels of neutralising antibodies in their blood. These antibodies are made by the immune system, and they coat an invading virus at specific points, blocking its ability to break into cells.“It is clear that immune responses are being mounted against Covid-19 in infected people,” says virologist Mike Skinner of Imperial College London. “And the antibodies created by that response will provide protection against future infections – but we should note that it is unlikely this protection will be for life.”Instead, most virologists believe that immunity against Covid-19 will last only a year or two. “That is in line with other coronaviruses that infect humans,” says Skinner. “That means that even if most people do eventually become exposed to the virus, it is still likely to become endemic – which means we would see seasonal peaks of infection of this disease. We will have reached a steady state with regard to Covid-19.”The virus will be with us for some time, in short. But could it change its virulence? Some researchers have suggested that it could become less deadly. Others have argued that it could mutate to become more lethal. Skinner is doubtful. “We have got to consider this pandemic from the virus’s position,” he says. “It is spreading round the world very nicely. It is doing OK. Change brings it no benefit.”In the end, it will be the development and roll-out of an effective vaccine that will free us from the threat of Covid-19, Skinner says.On Friday, the journal Nature reported that 78 vaccine projects had been launched round the globe – with a further 37 in development. Among the projects that are under way is a vaccine programme that is now in phase-one trials at Oxford University, two others at US biotechnology corporations and three more at Chinese scientific groups. Many other vaccine developers say they plan to start human testing this year.This remarkable response raises hopes that a Covid-19 vaccine could be developed in a fairly short time. However, vaccines require large-scale safety and efficacy studies. Thousands of people would receive either the vaccine itself or a placebo to determine if the former were effective at preventing infection from the virus which they would have encountered naturally. That, inevitably, is a lengthy process.As a result, some scientists have proposed a way to speed up the process – by deliberately exposing volunteers to the virus to determine a vaccine’s efficacy. “This approach is not without risks but has the potential to expedite candidate vaccine testing by many months,” says Nir Eyal, a professor of bioethics at Rutgers University.Volunteers would have to be young and healthy, he stresses: “Their health would also be closely monitored, and they would have access to intensive care and any available medicines.” The result could be a vaccine that would save millions of lives by being ready for use in a much shorter time than one that went through standard phase three trials.But deliberately infecting people – in particular volunteers who would be given a placebo vaccine as part of the trial – is controversial. “This will have to be thought through very carefully,” says Professor Adam Finn of Bristol University. “Young people might jump at the opportunity to join such a trial but this is a virus that does kill the odd young person. We don’t know why yet. However, phase-three trials are still some way off, so we have time to consider the idea carefully.”• This article was amended on 12 April 2020.

The health secretary, Matt Hancock, warned last week that the government could stop people leaving their homes for exercise if too many iniduals flouted its rules on social distancing.Professor Stephen Reicher of St Andrews University, a specialist in crowd psychology, said: “Perhaps the government could start by asking the question: ‘How do we help people to comply?’ Rather than starting from a punitive perspective, you start from a facilitative perspective.“If you start from a presumption of goodwill towards people – how do we help? – then one obvious answer is by increasing the amount of space they can go to.”With the link between access to outdoor space and benefits to mental health well established, Dimitrios Tsivrikos, a behavioural psychologist at UCL, said that the mental health of the poorest, typically those living in overcrowded flats with no outdoor space, was most likely to be affected by the lockdown.In addition to requisitioning swaths of private land, Michie also urged the government to seize empty hotels and office blocks and convert them into safe spaces for victims of abuse and domestic violence."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/651ae6da72bd4645a6f494c3697ae94311ea26cd/0_192_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=69b8fbfff0c9adbdb8920a731485bcd3","title":"thousands lose last hope of having a baby as lockdown closes ivf clinics","story":"Women tell of ‘bereavement’ because they will be too old for fertility treatment when the coronavirus shutdown ends See all our coronavirus coverageThousands of couples may have missed their last chance of conceiving via IVF as fertility clinics shut their doors to patients on Wednesday. Some women who are only just young enough to be eligible for treatment will be too old in a few months’ time.The Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority (HFEA), which regulates Britain’s fertility industry, has ordered private and NHS clinics to stop treating patients who are in the middle of an IVF cycle by 15 April. All new treatments have already been banned, a decision which is likely to prevent the births of at least 20,000 desperately wanted babies if it remains in place for 12 months.Some couples say they have had scans and treatments cancelled hours or even minutes before they were due to take place, and many fear their chance of conceiving will have disappeared completely by the time the lockdown ends.“You can’t rewind your biological clock,” said Dr Catherine Hill, of the reproductive research charity Progress Educational Trust. “Time is of the essence when it comes to fertility treatment. For some people, this shutdown means they may never become parents. This was going to be their last chance and they’re not able to have it. That is deeply distressing and traumatising.”The latest figures from the HFEA show that more than 54,000 patients underwent 75,000 fertility treatments in 2017, resulting in 20,500 births. “If these numbers are similar for 2020 – and we expect them to have increased – this pandemic is silently affecting the lives of many more people than is immediately obvious,” said Gwenda Burns, chief executive of the charity Fertility Network UK.She said women in their late 30s and early 40s were feeling particularly anxious, fearing that clinicians may decide they are too old to continue their IVF treatment when the shutdown ends. NHS clinical commissioning groups do not generally allow women a second round of IVF after they hit 40, and stop offering any treatment at 42 private clinics typically refuse to treat women aged 45 or over.“It would be beneficial if the government could give assurances that patients will not be disadvantaged as a result of treatment being paused due to Covid-19,” said Burns.“For a lot of people, their hope of a family life has just been taken away,” said Christina Fraser, a relationship counsellor at Coupleworks. The infertile couples she is counselling are experiencing the same emotions people typically suffer when they are bereaved, she said. “For a lot of couples it’s a secret – they haven’t told people. So they’re grieving on their own. And they can’t even go round the corner to their mum for a hug.”Hearing others complain about how irritating it is to be around their children all day or joke about how there is going to be a baby boom in nine months’ time is often particularly painful for these couples, causing displaced resentment and triggering “dreadful rows” about insignificant grievances. “There’s nowhere for them to put all their anger and grief. And if people sit on those feelings and can’t express them, that can really lead to depression,” Fraser said.The Observer has been contacted by more than a dozen couples who were expecting to start treatment just as the shutdown began. One woman, whose husband can no longer produce sperm after undergoing chemotherapy for testicular cancer, will turn 39 next month and was recently told her egg reserves have begun to decline. She fears that, by the time the shutdown ends, she will be unable to conceive. “Essentially, the situation with Covid-19 is my worst nightmare becoming a reality,” she said.Rose (not her real name), 41, and her husband sold their home to pay for private IVF treatment after struggling to conceive for three years. She spent the first three weeks of March injecting herself with hormones every day, before being told, just 45 minutes before she was due to attend a scan, that her entire treatment was cancelled. “I broke down. I’m aware that every day, at my age, my eggs diminish,” she said.She has been having terrible mood swings ever since and getting into “huge arguments over very small things” with her husband. “We’ve even had discussions where we’ve told each other to go and find someone else, someone younger or more fertile.” Although she is seeking counselling for her feelings of despair and depression, he doesn’t want to. “It’s absolutely awful.”Worst of all, she said, is the lack of recognition that infertile couples are suffering as a result of Covid-19. “You haven’t even got anything to show for your grief, if that makes sense. You haven’t got a grave to sit by. You just have to internalise it or it will drive you insane.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d6729d22d27a4f5814b9b56dbd19d92f650fdb5b/0_192_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9225e0dc448b368a39746ea23f8c88a0","title":"uk government giving incorrect information on self isolation say gps","story":"Doctors say some patients received letters wrongly saying they are in high-risk groupPeople across the UK are being given incorrect information from the government about whether or not to isolate, with some wrongly instructed to remain indoors for 12 weeks, GPs have warned.Doctors fear out-of-date information is being used as they are getting an increasing number of calls from people who do not understand why they have received a text or letter saying they are in the most at risk group. At the same time, some of those who are in priority groups are complaining they have been given no information, they said.The list of who to contact, which would normally take weeks to do, was compiled in 48 hours, and given the huge undertaking errors are likely to have crept in.Last month, the government announced it would contact 1.5 million people by 29 March to tell them that they should be “shielding”, which means they are most at risk to the virus and should stay indoors for 12 weeks.Dr Francesca Silman, a London GP, said: “Unfortunately a number of people I know did not receive letters despite fitting in the shielding category, some only received letters in the past few days, and others have received letters even though they don’t actually need to shield.”She added: “It is all a bit of a mess. Part of the problem was I think originally NHS England thought the GPs could do some of the searches – but this is not at all an easy task and the guidance for GPs to go ahead was retracted … Meanwhile, I think the public are unaware of this issue and likely to be following the letters they have or haven’t received unless they have been proactive themselves and looked up the guidance.”Information provided to the  from a GP in Teesside, north-east England, with a practice of 8,000 patients, found that of the 10 patients who had been recipients of an organ transplant, only six had received the letters and four had been missed. A significant number of other patients on chemotherapy, immunosuppressants, with blood cancers and other severe underlying health conditions had also been missed, they reported.The shielded patient list is a specific subset of patients identified by the chief medical officer. To identify these patients NHS Digital took the groups identified and converted them into a set of clinical codes and searched for patients with these conditions in the routine and administrative data sets that they hold nationally. They also did a search for patients this week and added around 400,000 more the original list of 900,000 patients, using data automatically pulled from GP systems.NHS Digital relies on the quality of data entry by thousands of NHS staff, and so there may be some errors in the data. The list was put together in 48 hours. Specialist doctors and GPs can also add to it.The Royal College of GPs said if anyone thinks they should be shielded but has not been told, or identified when they do not meet the criteria, they should contact their family doctor or hospital specialist. People have also started to receive texts from the government saying that if they feel the message does not apply to them they can opt out of receiving texts.Dr Hugh Reeve, a GP in Cumbria, said he had been fielding requests from people who were confused as to what they should be doing after receiving messages. “As a GP I am now totally confused as to who is getting these messages – those who self-identified and were told to shield and contact their GP or those who were identified by national trawl.”Katie Newbury, 32, from London, received a message in error. She had her spleen removed eight years ago, which puts at her risk of bacterial infections. She said she believed she was on the high risk list but not the shielding list. However, despite this she got a text from the government telling her she should stay in for 12 weeks.“I got a text and it was disconcerting as I have been going out of the house. I have been avoiding shops but I have been going for walks – just the thought of not being able to leave my house for 12 weeks is worrying.”She said she called her GP to confirm whether the advice was accurate and they said she could still go out for walks. “It did make me worry as I was wondering if there was something more they had discovered about people without spleens than initially.”“The doctor said they would check the guidance while on the phone and said it was all right and I could still go outside the house. I saw other people on social media had similar issues.”The Royal College of GPs also said that the guidance for identifying which vulnerable patients become shielded is still unclear, and they are raising this issue with the governments and health leaders across the UK.Prof Martin Marshall, the chair of the Royal College of GPs, said: “There is still some uncertainty over the guidance for identifying which vulnerable patients become shielded, and we are raising this with the governments and health leaders across the UK.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3d3cfbda2a7a0fcb476054adbb4d9c2af05872ec/0_5_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c8e47c6f0eb4865ff1b3d69ff20dcaac","title":"how are you affected by coronavirus in the south west of the uk","story":"If you live in the south-west England or Wales, we’d like to find out about the impact of coronavirus on you and your community.

There have been over 1.3m confirmed cases, and over 75,000 deaths. Billions of people are confined to their homes and stock markets have plummeted. Here is how the crisis unfolded. Note: Data for the first 20 days is reconstructed from early WHO situation reports and the later progress of the disease. The case counts for the remaining days comes from the open source Johns Hopkins data repository.There are some tentative indications that “the curve is flattening” in Italy and Spain, as the number of new cases each day falls. But the UK and the US have so far seemed to be about two weeks behind Italy in the progress of the disease, so their worst days may well be yet to come. Similarly, although the Chinese city of Wuhan is gradually reopening after two months of lockdown, it is by no means clear when or how other countries will begin to return to normal. In the meantime, scientists are working on several fronts to develop treatments and possibly vaccines some of those trials may start to show results in the next month or so, but a viable vaccine could still be 18 months away.Data caveatsThe case counts come from data compiled by Johns Hopkins University, one of the most reliable sources. The figures reflect the available data at the time this article was first published. Occasionally there are differences in the case counts between the Johns Hopkins website dashboard and the open source data repository used here. For the first 20 days, the evolution of cases is reconstructed from early WHO situation reports and the later progress of the disease. But the data should be treated with caution throughout as countries take different approaches to testing, and scientists believe many people may have been infected with the disease without suffering symptoms."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4227197.1586693228!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"students have been ignored in decision to press ahead with the leaving cert","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tMany students feel as though they are being ignored and that their wellbeing is not being taken into account. Photograph: iStockMany adults can identify with their nightmarish memories of the Leaving Cert as it was run under normal circumstances. Can anyone imagine how stressful it is for tens of thousands of us who are set to be forced to sit exams under-prepared and under the current strenuous conditions?The Leaving Cert is, without a doubt, a stressful, challenging and demanding assessment. Six years of second level education culminate in one final set of exams exams which, for many, will determine their subsequent career path.Right now, many students feel as though they are being ignored and that their wellbeing is not being taken into account. Put simply, we feel we are on our own.CrucialCovid-19 has forced the population of Ireland to battle an unprecedented strife. Quarantine forced all schools to shut their doors since March 12th, requiring students to study from home and resulting in the loss of almost five weeks’ of schooling, so far, at this crucial point in our final semester.This adverse series of events has been detrimental in terms of students’ learning and ultimate results. Students are trying to complete coursework at home with, in some areas, minimal guidance from teachers.Online classes and assignments completed from home are incomparable to face-to-face lessons completed within a secure, positive environment conducive to learning. Many students do not have access to sufficient learning resources, while countless students are exposed to hazardous domestic environments and are unable to learn properly during this time.Many syllabi have not been finished and, now with inadequate access to learning resources and little opportunity to discuss curriculums and subjects with teachers and peers, students in said subjects will not meet the level of knowledge expected by the State Examinations Commission (SEC) and Department of Education in comparison to previous exam years.MinorityWith respect, Minister Joe McHugh’s announcement on Friday has not taken the voice of Leaving Cert students into account. The most recent survey conducted by the Irish Second Level Students’ Union concluded that, of the 46,000 students who participated in said survey, a mere 19 per cent opted for postponement of the exams as their first preference. This is clearly the minority opinion as 49 per cent of students opted for cancellation of the Leaving Cert 2020 as their first choice.The Change.org petition, “Covid-19 Change to The Leaving Cert 2020”, has already exceeded its \u0026nbspgoal of 15,000 signatures . The opinion held by many sixth year students across Ireland is obvious: we are in no position to sit a set of exams this coming August having been absent from a sufficient learning environment for four months. The wellbeing of students has not been fully taken into account by the department or the State Exams Commission.The Government has not considered the situation into which Leaving Cert. students have found themselves hurled, through no fault of our own. This is an extremely traumatic and distressing time for people all over the country many students’ families are experiencing unemployment, illness and bereavement. Unforeseen numbers of pupils will have experienced the loss of family and friends by the time the exams occur. It is impossible for anyone to concentrate on study and exams under such stressful conditions.The postponing of the Leaving Certificate 2020 will cause students to be locked indoors for the entirety of the summer a repeat of social isolation seeing students losing motivation which will undoubtedly negatively affect their performance and, in turn, their results.ExhaustingNo other sixth year group in the history of Ireland has been forced to withstand anything more than a nine-month academic school year\u0026nbsppostponing the exams until August will mean that this year\u0027s Leaving Cert\u0026nbspstudents will have worked tirelessly for 12 months straight.The addition of two to three months on top of the already exhausting school year is unjust and unethical - students have paced themselves in expectation of the school year ending in late June.\u0026nbspThus, extending the length of the school year is unsustainable and will be detrimental in regards to the results and ultimate wellbeing of students.The Leaving Cert is a marathon and students have trained and worked towards being in peak academic condition during the month of June the disruption of the school year has interrupted our studies and it is unreasonable to expect students to sit exams under conditions which no other Leaving Cert\u0026nbspyear group has had to face.The Minister’s decision impacts more than just the Leaving Cert 2020 students families now must cancel any summer plans, many losing money and their only opportunity for a well earned rest before the next academic year starts again.ReconsiderIt is time to reconsider the decision to press ahead with this year’s Leaving Cert. A system of anticipated results alongside entranceaptitudeChristmasmock tests, like interviews or exams for each course, would be of greater benefit and would avoid a scenario in which students are dissatisfied with results, thus unable to pursue their chosen career path.Some of the world’s greatest powers have halted end-of-school\u0026nbsp exams for their young adults: France, the UK, the Netherlands, Hong Kong, India, among others. The department and the SEC must put aside biases based on tradition and principle and prioritise the wellbeing of Ireland’s Leaving Cert\u0026nbspstudents.Currently, students are disconnected from school, teachers, friends. We worry that the Minister is disconnected from us.Josh Tighe is a sixth year student and Leaving Cert candidate"},{"url":null,"title":"confronting","story":"A news podcast from The  that covers Ireland\u0027s response to the Coronavirus outbreak.

Members of the public realise that gardaí have an important part to play in curbing the spread of the virus, said Garda Power, who was manning a checkpoint on the M8 near Cork city with his colleagues Dermot Carroll, Ray O’Brien, Terence McSweeney and Mick Bohane. They had set up a ersion in the M8 near the Glanmire turn-off, channelling all southbound traffic up the slip road where they were checking with motorists where they were travelling.“We’re here on the slip road because not only does it slow traffic down but if we have to turn someone back, we can send them on to the roundabout here, back across the bridge and down the slip road on to the northbound lane,” he says According to Garda Power, the vast majority of those they are encountering are local motorists heading out to do shopping or people with some other legitimate business such as delivering food to elderly cocooning relatives.Gardaí were encountering a lot of Dairygold milk tankers and Musgrave delivery lorries but they were also encountering people with more personal reasons such as people going for cancer treatment at Cork University Hospital.EncounterAmong the many people that gardaí encountered on Sunday was an air hostess heading for Cork Airport to work a flight to London and a reporter delivering and working on a story about face masks at a local community hospital.Also out on the road was Cian Twohig, who was driving from Dublin to Cork to help his elderly mother sort out a problem with rodents in her back garden as well as bringing her a supply of groceries as she obeys guidelines to cocoon.“I think the government is doing a good job – this is a different country now to a month ago and this is my third checkpoint I’ve encountered today but it makes sense to check on people and ensure they only make essential journeys.“People generally are complying with the guidelines – I’m been isolating and working from home in Dublin so these gardaí here are the first people I’ve spoken to in person for about three weeks but it’s all for the best.”Insp James Hallahan of the Cork City Garda Traffic Corps said officers on checkpoint duty on all the main arterial routes in and out of Cork found people were largely very compliant with government guidelines.“There is a very high compliance rate – it’s a graduated response and enforcement is only utilized as a last resort – we’ve had a few cases where we’ve turned people back but most people are complying with the guidelines.“We would probably encourage people to shop local a bit more and we have stopped cyclists and sent them back because they’ve gone outside their 2km limit and we’ve also inspected buses to ensure everyone’s journey is essential.“We would urge people if they have a letter from their employer, saying their work is essential, that they would have the letter ready on the seat beside them when people have to look for their letter, it is causing some delays.”Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our Morning Briefing and Lunchtime Latest newsletters"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4227309.1586707095!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"coronavirus garda%C3%AD send home bank holiday weekend sun seekers","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t Gardaí on patrol at Seapoint Park in  Dublin on Saturday.

I’ve had quite a few people say they’re just out for a spin – that doesn’t count as an essential journey.”CheckpointAt another checkpoint close to the East Pier in Dún Laoghaire, a garda said people were being “very compliant” when asked to turn around.“We’ve also been telling people that the Forty Foot is closed. There had been people getting through earlier in the day, but the council have since put up more secure barriers.”One garda on a bicycle, who was asking sunbathers to leave Sandycove Park, said he had earlier stopped a cyclist who had come all the way from Finglas.“Even if people are coming from Blackrock, I’m telling them they are beyond their 2km limit so they need to turn around and go home. I’ve also had to tell people you can’t drive here and then do your 2km exercise, the restriction is to within 2km of your front door,” he said.“Mostly I’m telling people here that they can’t be lounging around, or having picnics, but if it wasn’t for the sun today, this wouldn’t be happening at all.”Elsewhere, the Phoenix Park was quieter than it had been on previous weekends during the period of movement restrictions, despite the warm weather. This was largely down to gardaí and park rangers making a concerted effort to move people on.‘We get it’One senior garda managed to clear around 40 sunbathers, mostly couples, from the grass surrounding the Wellington Monument in less than 10 minutes.“We just sat down after doing a bit of exercise,” said one of a couple asked to move said, “but no, we get it, people are getting a bit too relaxed about it, so I understand why we were asked to get up, it has to be done.”A group of three women in their 20s, who share an apartment, had just realised they could not sunbath in the park together.“We thought it was ok because we all live together, and we’re not close to anyone else here,” one said.The garda clearing the park said he has had some people question why they could not lay down on the grass.“It takes most people about 20 minutes to walk 2km, so I’ve been telling people they really shouldn’t be out of their homes for more than 40 minutes, and they can’t just lie around here all day,” he said.“Most were fine, some asked why they couldn’t have a picnic, and why they should go home. The answer is, to save lives.”Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our Morning Briefing and Lunchtime Latest newsletters"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4227448.1586728915!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"irish aircraft leasing company raised 350 000 for ppe shipment","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tDublin-based aircraft leasing company Avolon has raised €350,000 in donations to fund a cargo shipment of personal protective equipment (PPE) in less than five days, the company has said.

Photograph: Government Press OfficeAFP via Getty Images.Taoiseach Leo Varadkar has said that Ireland will face some of its darkest days in the weeks ahead as a result of the coronavirus pandemic.In a video message posted on Twitter on Sunday, Mr Varadkar said the country is preparing to reach its Covid-19 peak later this month.“The number of hospitalisations and sadly the number of deaths continues to rise,” he said.“So we cannot lose focus. We cannot lessen our efforts. In fact, we need to redouble them for the next few weeks.“It’s more important than ever that we persevere. It’s possible that we haven’t seen the peak yet.“When it comes, perhaps later this month, we will experience some of our darkest days. So we need to maintain our discipline and resolve in the knowledge that better days are to come.”Highest daily totalThe Department of Health on Saturday evening said a further 33 people in the State had died as a result of Covid-19, bringing the total to 320, and that 553 new cases were confirmed, the highest total for a single day. A total of 8,928 cases have been diagnosed in the State. The Taoiseach on Friday announced that social and commercial restrictions, including on people’s movements, would remain in place until May 5th at least. Mr Varadkar said that on Easter Sunday “whether we have faith or not” people should remember the Easter message “of suffering and sacrifice followed by rebirth and renewal and, above all, a message of hope as winter turns to spring”.“When this emergency ends we will mourn the dead, comfort the bereaved and be together again,” he said.“We will re-awaken the sleeping giant that is our economy, our people will go back to work and our businesses will reopen, and taking what we’ve learned, we will build a better society at the end of this — a great society for a great people.”Time of hopeIn his Easter statement, Fianna Fáil leader Micheál Martin said it is a time “of hope, rebirth and resurrection” and a time “when we remember the sacrifice made by those who fought to establish our independence as a nation”. “This year, we remember particularly those who have lost their lives as a result of Covid-19. Our thoughts and prayers are with their families and loved ones in particular, as all of our deeply ingrained and hugely important rituals of grieving and comforting are put on hold.”Mr Martin paid tribute to the responses of communities to the crisis, adding: “We particularly salute those at the frontline -our healthcare workers andall those in essential services such as retail, food supplies \u0026amp manufacturing.“I particularly think of our young people studying for their state examinations and the uncertainty they currently face. It is a particularly stressful time for them.”Ordinary peopleIn her speech to an online Sinn Féin national Easter commemoration, party leader Mary Lou McDonald said: “Those who fought and died for Irish freedom were ordinary people who demonstrated extraordinary levels of bravery, selflessness and determination. “On the morning of the Easter Rising, many volunteers would have held their loved ones close, kissed their children and in a quieter moment, reflected on the enormity of the task ahead. This is the stuff of human heroism,” she said. “It is this heroism we call on again today. Every day, frontline workers ,and our healthcare workers in particular, leave the sanctuary of their homes knowing that they will face trauma, sorrow and pain.“Knowing that they face the possibility of a Coronavirus infection.

Photograph: Loic VenanceAFP via Getty ImagesUntil they were laid low by the coronavirus pandemic, few in Europe or the United States realised how much their countries depended on vital healthcare supplies from Asia. For decades, western countries outsourced surgical masks, ventilators, personal protective equipment and medicines to countries with low labour costs and loose environmental restrictions, mainly China. When disaster struck, western governments were forced to go to outrageous lengths to secure such supplies, often by shafting long-standing allies.In France, for example, the reserve of surgical face masks stood at 140 million, down from a billion a decade earlier. Healthcare professionals are supposed to change masks at least every four hours.During a visit to the main manufacturer of FFP2 surgical masks in France, the Canadian-owned Kolmi-Hopen factory near Anger, President Emmanuel Macron said officials had based decisions on “the certainty that high-quality masks produced on the other side of the world could be imported easily, so there was no reason to stock them massively”.SovereigntyFrance and Europe have learned their lesson, Macron insisted. “The day after will not resemble the days before. We must rebuild our national and European sovereignty.”“Nobody was ready, anywhere in the world,” says an adviser to Macron. In the short term, every country is maximising whatever national production capacity it can salvage, and scrambling to buy from China. Once the crisis passes, “the EU must protect strategic sectors, bring back certain industries, increase our capacity to manufacture and stock in the fields we neglected for decades, such as medicine”.About 80 per cent of the active substances in French medicine are manufactured abroad, mainly in China and India. “We will soon be short of essential medicines to treat Covid-19 patients in intensive care units,” directors of nine large European hospitals warned in Le Monde at the end of March.Three categories of medicine – hypnotic drugs, anaesthetics and tranquillisers – are essential for treating Covid-19, according to doctors interviewed by Radio France.Patients in intensive-care units often develop secondary infections in the lungs, for which they need antibiotics, Jean-Pierre Thierry of France Assos Santé said. “Usually, there are plenty of antibiotics, but there are practically no factories producing them outside China and India.”Ninety per cent of the world’s supply of penicillin, used in antibiotics, is produced in China. India, which is also suffering from the pandemic, has limited exports of 26 medicines and active substances.French doctors have substituted old reliables, such as Valium, for drugs that are in short supply. They are experimenting with lower doses, to conserve stocks. Some advocate using veterinary sedatives. Macron announced he had placed “massive orders” to swell reserves.About 7,000 Chinese factories now manufacture surgical masks, up from 4,000 before the pandemic. According to official figures, the People’s Republic quintupled mask production in February. The Chinese car manufacturer BYD set up the world’s largest mask assembly line and is producing 10 million daily, Le Monde reported. Chinese manufacturers of smartphones and protection pads for incontinence have also converted to mask production.French industry is also scrambling to adapt to the pandemic. Kolmi-Hopen, which Macron visited, increased its workforce by 50 per cent and is operating 247. By late April, it will have increased production from 3.3 million to 10 million masks weekly – still only a fraction of the billion masks that France has ordered from China.Air Liquide, the main French manufacturer of ventilators needed to treat Covid-19, is in the process of increasing production from 200 to 10,000 per month. Engineers from the Schneider Electric company, PSA and Valeo are converting production lines previously devoted to electrical equipment and the manufacture of cars to help make ventilators.Macron previously campaigned for European sovereignty in industries of the future, such as artificial intelligence and renewable energy. The pandemic has shifted the focus to traditional, basic industry.Jobless workers from the last factory that made oxygen bottles in Europe, at Clermont-Ferrand, are campaigning for it to reopen, because the bottles are needed for respirators. The factory was owned by the British group Luxfer. Former employees of an FFP2 surgical mask factory at Plaintel, in Brittany, also hope that the crisis could bring their jobs back. Their factory was purchased by the American group Honeywell in 2010. The Americans shut down the factory and sold its machines as scrap in 2018, when remaining production was outsourced to Tunisia.

Photograph: Oliver HosletReutersThe European Union released a draft of its hoped-for future relationship deal with Britain on Wednesday, setting out ambitions for a tight relationship on trade and security.The 440-page document crosses several of Britain’s red lines, spelling out the bloc’s ambitions for Britain to agree “uniform implementation” of state subsidy rules, with the European Court of Justice remaining the adjudicating authority.It also makes reference to the so-called “level playing field”, provisions to ensure fair competition by keeping rules aligned, which London has already rejected.“The Parties recognise that the establishment of conditions that ensure a level playing field between the Parties is necessary for trade and investment between the Union and the United Kingdom, ” the draft reads.The EU’s draft envisages reciprocal access to waters for fishing rights, with negotiations held each year by December 10th on fishing opportunities for the following year, another contentious point.The UK negotiating team said it had also sent a draft to the EU. This includes a free trade agreement with annexes, as well as agreements on aviation safety and air transport, and a civil nuclear agreement.“We are sharing ours in confidence as a negotiating document, as part of the ongoing negotiating process,” a government spokesman said.“Teams will now analyse each other’s texts and we expect further conversations between the teams next week.“We will keep under review which documents it is appropriate to publish during the course of negotiations and whether it is useful to make them availablle more widely.”Though Britain has left the EU it is is currently in a transition period, continuing to adhere to prior norms pending the agreement of a deal on the future relationship. If none can be agreed, it will automatically begin trading on World Trade Organisation terms from January 1st, 2021, with potentially severe effects on the Irish economy.The government of prime minister Boris Johnson has until July to request an extension to the transition period, but has insisted it will not do so even as the Coronavirus pandemic delayed talks this week.Both sides said they were examining options such as using video conferencing in place of face-to face talks.“The negotiations can still proceed given all of the logistical arrangements that have been put in place,” British foreign secretary Dominic Raab said on Tuesday.“We’re confident that we can get this done and, actually, I don’t think delaying Brexit negotiations would give anyone the certainty on either side of the Channel that they need.”Stay on top of the latest news with our Morning Briefing and Lunchtime Latest newsletters"},{"url":null,"title":"matt cartoons april 2020","story":"Sign up for our exclusive, subscriber-only Matt newsletter - and get an unseen Matt  each week. www.telegraphmatt-nlOrder The Best of Matt 2019 by visiting books.telegraph or call 0844 871 1514.  ​To order a fine art print, signed or unsigned of this, or any Matt cartoon, go to https:telegraph.newsprints or call 0191 603 0178Pupils held to ‘ransom’ by private school\u0026#39s demand of fees for grades Figuring out why UK death toll looks so high exposes ‘scaremongering’ numbersThe Nest, episode 4 review: another agonising cliffhanger for this absorbing thrillerPrince William praises \u0026#39best of British\u0026#39 community spirit in crisisBoris Johnson: \u0026#39For 48 hours things could have gone either way for me\u0026#39 Chancellor warns Cabinet of tipping point between coronavirus control and the economyHarry and Meghan turned down offer to name Australian bushfires plane after son ArchieBoris Johnson moves to Chequers to recover, as questions grow over who makes final lockdown decisionComment: At a time of crisis, there is nothing wrong with invoking the Blitz spiritOn duty with coronavirus lockdown police: sandcastles, swimming and sunbathers among the challenges for officersNHS begins trials of contact-tracing app with key workers with hopes it could help bring lockdown to endBritain could end up with largest coronavirus death toll in Europe, Government adviser says Government proposals for \u0026#39virtual\u0026#39 Parliament will allow MPs to grill ministers via video linkComment: The nation’s health is about more than fighting Covid-19Fears for cancer care as up to 2,000 referrals are missed every weekThese are the NHS workers who have died from coronavirusChurch of England moves valuables to Tower of London amid fears of lockdown lootingComment: This Easter like no other reminds us we are in this crisis together, and will overcome it togetherWorld of comedy pays tribute to Tim Brooke-Taylor who died of Covid-19 Andrea Bocelli, Music for Hope review: the Voice of Italy goes it alone to give comfort to millionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus diary postcard wuhanwhat really happened","story":"The guard at the station eyes my ticket: Beijing to Wuhan, the locked-down ground zero of the coronavirus pandemic.“You sure? No mistake?” he asks. “No mistake,” I say.My colleague and I disinfect our seats with a wad of wipes the minute we get on the five-hour high-speed train.I worry coming to Wuhan will change my “green” health code – a contagion risk profile, which determines the difference between going out to dinner or government quarantine. When I get there, traffic is sparse, though busier than I expected. I chat with people in a park, out for their first strolls after nearly three months indoors.I walk by Huanan seafood market (pictured below), where experts think the virus emerged, and find it sealed with sheets of corrugated metal, wrapped in police tape, and patrolled by officers. At the end of the day, I check my health code again: Still green. Whew.Exiting my room, I bid good morning to a hotel cleaner in a hazmat suit and head out.Cai Yao, 34, tells me his mother’s symptoms appearing in late January worsened quickly she only returned home two weeks ago.“For a whole week, she couldn’t eat. She coughed up blood, and her nose would bleed,” he said. “It really looked like she was on her deathbed.”Hospitals were full, so they drove daily across town for outpatient treatment, waiting 10 hours in line with many others. Mr Cai doesn’t know what shots were administered, but is grateful she recovered. Many families weren’t so fortunate. At the peak, there were 5,000 bodies waiting to be scorched into ash at one of Wuhan’s eight crematoriums, a worker tells me – a far cry from two dozen per day before the pandemic. His shifts began at 5:30am and ended after dark. Such accounts cast doubt over China’s reported death toll of about 3,300, especially as fatalities in Italy, Spain, France, the UK, US, and Iran exceed that figure. Virus deaths are so sensitive that at a cemetery – which grieving families haven’t been allowed to visit – a phalanx of uniformed officers and plainclothes minders surround me and my colleague. When I try to leave, they grab my bag, drag me backward, and snatch my phone.“What if you report about this incident?” one sneers, when I ask for it back. They accuse us of sneaking in and staying hours to take photos. Actually, we’d walked in the front gate, registered our details after a temperature check – as per usual in coronavirus China – and roamed for half an hour.After threatening (“can’t leave until the ‘investigation’ is over”) and berating us (“stupid imbeciles”) for about an hour, they let us go upon taking photos of our ID documents. Our driver says the police also harassed him and recorded his details.This is the same “welcome” treatment I’ve gotten investigating human rights violations in China – Xinjiang concentration camps, Muslim cleansing in Ningxia, the 30th anniversary of the Tiananmen Square massacre. Residents have told me they don’t think they’ll ever learn the truth of what happened. All this leads me to ponder what the authorities are trying to hide – even as China crows success. Freedom! Sort of. Lockdowns lift today in Wuhan. But things are far from normal.Transport links start coming back online, and major roads are unsealed. Cars started lining up at city limits before midnight.But quotas have been imposed – for instance, only 1,000 a day are allowed to enter Beijing from Wuhan. Even then, people need to be approved after showing a clean bill of health. Some housing compounds continue barring residents from going out, or limiting them to two hours a day. Barriers made of corrugated metal sheets have yet to all come down. Same with cement road blocks. I spy a man in a hazmat clamber over and sneak away!Disinfecting tents continue to dot the city. Getting in and out of my hotel still requires being sprayed with medical-grade alcohol: Traffic is much noisier today, though nobody seems fussed by a sign that life is resuming.Requirements to depart Wuhan apply to me, so I head to the city’s No. 7 hospital to get my throat swabbed for a nucleic acid test to determine whether I’ve been infected with the coronavirus. I don’t feel ill, though asymptomatic cases are now being discovered. Hopefully, I’m not one of them…At the hospital entrance, a thermal facial recognition camera takes my temperature. Amazingly, this works with a face mask. I don goggles and feel even more claustrophobic.Medical staff have protective suits, shoe covers, face shields one spritzes sanitiser over his latex gloves. It\u0027s haunting to be inside. So many people died here, staff say.Doors are sealed in the fever clinic, dozens of oxygen tanks sit outside, and an extra CT machine is in a trailer out front.Next step: Registering via a mobile app to be approved for return and quarantine confirmation by Beijing authorities. There\u0027s a long queue – at least 11,000 have already applied, and there’s a daily departure limit.I feel glad to pass an open wine shop. I stock up might be here a while. Tons of virus origin rumours floating around. Scientists are working on this, too, and have found genetically similar coronaviruses in bats and pangolins.A seafood vendor tells me she heard patient zero was a man in his seventies selling wild ducks at the now-closed Huanan market.Others deny any Huanan link, and tell me unspecified foreigners brought it during the World Military Games last October, held in Wuhan. Wu Jianming, 29, a glassworker says: “Bats are impossible – when I was a child, we often played with them.”By far the most prevalent theory is that the Americans brought the virus. One man says the severity of infections is evidence the virus emerged in the US.“It’s so bad there,” he said. “Do you think this is still the Wuhan flu?” The idea was seeded by a Chinese official, who suggested the US military brought the virus. Beijing has been busy reframing the narrative to ert public anger from government missteps over the outbreak, stoking nationalism by portraying China as the world leader in virus response and buying the world time.Some, including officials and politicians in the US and UK, see it differently – that a botched initial response exacerbated global spread.We bundle into a van with other foreign media for a government-arranged trip to Leishenshan Hospital, a temporary field hospital.Hospital officials say thousands have recovered, and only 15 patients remain. We’re shown an empty virus ward with sealed rooms waiting to be disinfected. Many medical staff have transferred out.“All data are reliable please rest assured,” they say, when asked whether China’s reported figures accurately represent the outbreak. Doubts persist over the numbers. Hospitals were immediately overwhelmed there were multiple revisions to confirming cases and those not tested – despite having what doctors strongly hinted was the virus – weren’t included in the death toll.With so many curbs still in place, it’s clear authorities remain concerned. Even as Wuhan has begun reporting zero deaths, the hospital won’t be dismantled until next year. I get my virus results back.

They would then get tested or self-isolate.But nearly half of French people would refuse to download the “StopCovid” app because of concerns about confidentiality and privacy, according to an opinion poll published on Sunday. The survey by IFOP, a leading polling firm, for the Jean-Jaurès Foundation think tank, suggests that 53 per cent of people would be hostile to a compulsory tracing system using mobile data.The government has indicated that the mobile app would not be compulsory, but the poll suggests that only 46 per cent of French people would agree to use it. Left-wing voters are most opposed to mobile phone tracking, but the number of Right-wing supporters who back the plan is only marginally higher.Cédric O, the digital minister, insisted that the data gathered would be confidential. “It would be a tool installed voluntarily that could be uninstalled at any time. The data would be anonymous and deleted after a certain time.”The government argues that contact tracing has proved effective in South Korea and Singapore in curbing the spread of the virus.Jacques Toubon, France’s ombudsman and a former justice minister, said the need to stem the spread of the virus must be balanced against any restriction of personal freedoms. “We live in a democracy under the rule of law, which confers a certain number of fundamental rights and I am responsible, along with the courts, for ensuring they are respected. Among them is the right to privacy.” Edouard Philippe, the prime minister, called for a parliamentary debate on digital contact tracing, acknowledging that “it raises many questions when there is a need for national unity to exit from the lockdown.” Anne Hidalgo, the mayor of Paris, has called for a loosening of restrictions to be accompanied by mass testing, with “immunisation certificates” issued to people who have recovered, while those infected could be placed in quarantine.  However, the government has indicated that it is not yet time to consider ending the lockdown. Emmanuel Macron, the president, is expected to announce its extension until at least May 15, possibly longer, in a televised address to the nation on Monday night.More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"julian assange fathered two children hiding ecuador embassy","story":"Julian Assange became a father to two sons while spending seven years in the Ecuadorian embassy, it has emerged.The WikiLeaks founder, who has been held in Belmarsh Prison since being dragged out of the embassy last year, was reportedly able to keep the births of Gabriel and Max secret from officials and diplomats.He had to watch his fiancee Stella Morris, 37, give birth over video link while he was seeking refuge at the embassy. The revelations emerged in court documents in the US, where he faces 17 charges under the Espionage Act and one of conspiracy to commit computer intrusion.  The couple first met in 2011 and got engaged in 2017. The two boys, Gabriel and Max, are now three and one respectively.Speaking to the Mail on Sunday, Ms Morris revealed Assange watched both children being born in London hospitals via live video link, and he was able to meet Gabriel after he was smuggled into the embassy.A friend carried him into the embassy, appearing to pass off the child as their own, she said. She said: “I love Julian deeply and I am looking forward to marrying him.“Over the past five years I have discovered that love makes the most intolerable circumstances seem bearable but this is different - I am now terrified I will not see him alive again.“Julian has been fiercely protective of me and has done his best to shield me from the nightmares of his life.“I have lived quietly and privately, raising Gabriel and Max on my own and longing for the day we could be together as a family.”  Assange, who is awaiting an extradition hearing on behalf of the United States, was also wanted in Sweden on rape charges, but these have since been dropped. The revolutions about the WikiLeaks founder came in a statement filed by Ms Morris to support an application for bail in the courts ahead of his hearing on May 18.At the time Gabriel was conceived, the WikiLeaks founder was believed to be under constant surveillance by American security services as well as Scotland Yard, who spent £13.2m on a round-the-clock policing operation. The 37-year-old claims American intelligence agencies tried to steal Gabriel\u0027s DNA from a nappy after becoming suspicious that Assange was his father. Ms Morris said that she made their relationship public because she feared that the 48-year-old’s life could be in serious risk if he remained in Belmarsh where one person has already died of coronavirus. She said: “Over time Julian and I developed a strong intellectual and emotional bond. He became my best friend and I became his.”But she stressed: “Julian\u0027s poor physical health puts him at serious risk, like many other vulnerable people, and I don\u0027t believe he will survive infection with coronavirus.“Mentally, I do not think he will survive further enforced isolation either. He is effectively in solitary confinement, in a cell for up for 23 and a half hours a day with no access to us, his family, or the psychiatric help he needs.”More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2020/04/10/TELEMMGLPICT000229343294_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfyf2A9a6I9YchsjMeADBa08.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"lockdown hoper not moper woke want live like amish","story":"As we reach the third week of lockdown, we’re reassessing what’s really important to usI’m writing in the third week of the lockdown, when we’re reassessing what’s really important to us and what can go out for the noble bin men when we emerge blinking in the sunshine of the other side. Knowing my own hyper-social tendencies when the weather becomes clement and the fact that my book Welcome To The Woke Trials should be completed by autumn, I should have seen incarceration as a scary blessing which would guarantee delivery. But I actually wondered for a couple of weeks whether I should write it at all – #allinthistogether and all that jazz.Luckily, the copious whining and ill-will from Wokers at a time when the Conservative government is acting like Robin Hood has given me renewed purpose.When most people are in denial, they’re in denial about Bad Things – as a coping mechanism – but the Woke are the only group who are permanently in denial about Good Things, such as the generosity of the government, for kicks. It must drive them nuts that we’re finally moving towards a sort of socialism – not a performative brag – in which ordinary people become everyday heroes. The Woke in this crisis remind me of those dogs you see in pubs sometimes, who aren’t really angry, but utter one bark every ten minutes just to keep their equipment running.The preferred leisure activity of the Woke is, of course, virtue-signalling – and don’t they have a brand new box of toys to chuck out of their prams now! Putting on a mask and gloves just to go out for a pint of almond milk they get to feel like bold frontline fighters, looking askance at those of us with the temerity to expose our noses and knuckles.Hearing of hoi polloi relaxing in public spaces they can tut smugly as they tend their herb gardens. On social media they can advocate for avocados as a sure way to wellness with the implication that if one is sensible enough to eat clean nothing so common as the coronavirus would dare invade one’s immaculate innards.The three strains of Covid-19 and where they originatedThe plague has highlighted the gap between many groups – those who do useful work are more likely to get it than the useless, ethnic minorities are more likely than white people, men than women, smokers than non-smokers. But I’d imagine that it will be spread equally between Modernists (my tribe) and Nostalgics – Hopers vs Mopers, as I think of them. We Hopers can’t wait to rush out and thrown our arms around our one and only world in all its corrupt glory once more the Mopers having got what they wanted – no cheap foreign travel, Mother Nature silencing the city – and are keen to stress that when we get out the other side we must not re-prioritise frivolous things over the simple life.That’s what they say, of course – what they do is entirely different. I wouldn’t despise virtue-signalling so much if it was just a prelude to actual virtue, but I’ve come to believe from extended observation that many practitioners simply use it as a smokescreen that enables them to be even more selfish than the rest of us. The “Woke Cloak” as it’s been called, which led to the amusing spectacle last year of the Extinction Rebellion spokesman who flounced out of an interview after it was pointed out to him that the many skiing trips he had posted on social media were hardly the “emergencies” that he wanted flying to be confined to.So in this time of contemplation, I’d like to speak up for foreign travel, incessant socialising and crazed pleasure-seeking. But for all you Nostalgics who’ve suddenly had the revelation that you wanted to live like an Amish all along, please do stick to your plan of staycations and home-cooking because, to be honest, you don’t bring a great deal in the way of wit and wisdom to the table and I think we’ll just about struggle along without you.And everyone who’s ever spoken or typed the words Big Pharma will hopefully go to the back of the queue when a vaccine is discovered (probably by the Israelis – none for you, boycotters!), stick to their crystals and leave the nasty newfangled vaccines to we shameless embracers of the modern world. And please, have the sensitivity to understand that for the millions of your fellow citizens whose lives were pretty damn simple already – eat, work, sleep, worry about money, repeat – what lies ahead is not a pastoral Walden Pond dream, but a living nightmare.The  values your comments but kindly requests all posts are on topic, constructive and respectful.

The uncomfortable truth is that, for a large proportion of the population, social-distancing isn’t much of an imposition at all, barring a few tiresome queues at the supermarket.Wealthy professionals in full-time employment, who haven’t yet noticed the economic calamity reeling towards us, can do their jobs from home with little disruption to their working lives, and with the added benefit of spending more time with their families. Some furloughed workers – particularly those who never much liked their jobs to begin with, and on salaries of £20-25,000 a year – are being paid to do nothing, albeit while taking a pay cut. They may even be saving on childcare costs.Public sector employees, meanwhile, are shielded from much of the economic impact I know of teachers on full pay who are being asked to work just a couple of days a month. The long-term impact on their careers of a period in semi-employment will be negligible. MPs have just received a pay rise.Obviously, I don’t wish to force these groups to share in full the sacrifices of the self-employed, the flat-dwellers, the newly-unemployed, and furloughed workers who have seen their incomes collapse because of the penny-pinching failures of the Government’s support package.The three strains of Covid-19 and where they originatedIncidentally, the devastation wrought by lockdown on all sorts of people is being overlooked: households that depend on one larger salary that has evaporated, or entrepreneurs who only recently set up shop. But it does perhaps provide part of the answer to why so many have surrendered their liberties so willingly – and have so little sympathy for those who find it tougher to abide stringently to the lockdown regulations.We are seeing an epidemic of snitching. Hotlines set up to allow members of the public to shop friends, colleagues, neighbours and strangers for breaking the rules have been inundated with calls. Social media is full of misleadingly shot photos of people sitting in parks or going into work on the Tube, accompanied by snide little comments about the “selfishness” of those who have dared go outside and attacks on companies that still expect their staff to come into the office.Where is the common-feeling and unity of purpose we are told is our national strength? If those who are enjoying a relatively comfortable lockdown are unable to “check their privilege”, then these restrictions will not be sustainable much beyond the end of the month. The police cannot be expected to enforce the rules more strictly.While some officers are no doubt enjoying the opportunity to boss around otherwise law-abiding people rather too much, most I have spoken to are anxious not to overstep the mark. They are mindful that, unless a consensus can be maintained behind the rules, then we can add civil disobedience and a collapse in faith in the rule of law to our list of woes.The  values your comments but kindly requests all posts are on topic, constructive and respectful.

Teachers must submit each pupil’s predicted grades to the relevant exam boards, which then go through a moderation process before being awarded formally to students later on this summer.Ofqual, the exams watchdog, has said that schools should not ask students to do any new pieces of work to base the predicted grade on. They said that in the interests of fairness, only previous tests and assignments should be used to inform their decision on the predicted grades they submit to exam boards.One mother told The  that her family had been financially ruined and now faces bankruptcy after their income dried up due to the coronavirus pandemic.Her daughter has been made offers to study at prestigious Russell Group universities which are contingent on her predicted grades. But when she contacted her daughter’s school to explain that they were not able to pay the summer term’s fees, she says that she was told without the final instalment of fees for the academic year they would not submit her predicted A-level grades to the exam boards.“There is no way we are in a position to pay fees for next term,” she said. “It seems very cruel to effectively blame the child. It is as though they are holding my daughter’s future to ransom.”Schools were told to shut their doors last month and send pupils home, with many offering online classes and digital learning resources.Private schools are now billing for the summer term, and many are bowing to parental pressure to reduce the fees since children will need to effectively be home schooled.Lord Lucas, a hereditary peer and owner of The Good Schools Guide, said that threatening to withhold predicted grades over this issue is “utterly inhuman” and “totally disgraceful”.“They owe a duty of care to the child,” he said. “You cannot under any circumstances hold a child to ransom in that way.”Neil Roskilly, chief executive of the Independent Schools Association, said he believes it is rare for a school to withhold grades in a dispute over fees.More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"scientists using coronavirus lockdown understand wildlife behaves","story":"As humans around the world have retreated inside, our animal neighbours have ventured further out of hiding. From cougars on the streets of Santiago, to deer in Nara, Japan and ducks crossing the road in Paris, animals that normally live in the shadows of our towns and cities have suddenly emerged into the light, looking for food or merely emboldened to roam. The situation provides a giant experiment in animal behaviour. But for zoologists and conservationists it poses a conundrum.How do you investigate the impact of a lockdown, when you are in lockdown?“I’m fascinated to know what’s going on in terms of how this sudden massive reduction in activity is seen by the animal population, from the roadways to the reduction in noise pollution,” says Graeme Shannon, a zoology lecturer at Bangor University, Wales, down the coast from the town of Llandudno, which was recently invaded by its now infamous mountain goats. “But if you were to plan an experiment like this, there would normally be months of design.”“We can certainly say there’s an impact on the ability of scientists to collect and analyse the data, because they’re not able to get to the field,” said Matt Larsen, the director of the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute in Panama.“It means a lot of these observations are strictly anecdotal.”He recently saw racoons frolicking on the surf near his home in broad daylight - a first on a beach that is normally full of human visitors. In lieu of getting out in the field, scientists across the world are relying on existing camera traps and infrastructure to monitor the changes. Remote monitoring capability has developed at a swift pace in recent years, with lightweight GPS collars enabling real-time tracking and camera tracking sensitive enough to pick up even the smallest mouse. But most of the technology still requires the same maintenance as your TV remote. “We’re quite excited to see if these cameras can keep running. But our challenge is that we can’t go out to change the batteries,” says Mr Shannon, of a project to monitor deer in North Wales. “We’d normally change them around the 60-70 day period. They’re currently on 80-90.”CCTV and road traffic cameras could provide another valuable source of data, especially within cities, but are limited by storage capacity which means footage is often erased after just a few days. Science does have one new helper - ordinary people stuck at home, staring out of their windows. “People can start keeping simple lists of what they see from their windows and that can form a depository of what animals we have in the city. I\u0027ve seen people taking videos of dolphins that have just started to appear off the coast of Mumbai,” says Anish Andheria, the president of India’s Wildlife Conservation Trust.“During the lockdown, even people that are not normally keen on birds, for instance, are suddenly taking notice.Relying on citizen science has its shortcomings.Most of the sightings are in areas that are already home to plenty of animals - merely unbeknownst to their human inhabitants, who are normally at work or otherwise distracted.“In India every other day we have reports of tigers and lions entering villages, even during normal time. Suddenly now we’re seeing these videos, but a lot of them are not even dated, so this data is questionable,” says Mr Andheria. And images and videos are not always that reliable. Several of the images that have gone viral - of swans and dolphins returning to Venice, or drunk elephants roaming through a Chinese village - have turned out to be false. Then there is the question of the scientific value of such a period of unnatural upheaval. “I think it’s more of a curiosity, I don’t think it’s going to yield great new scientific understanding,” says Mr Larsen.  “As soon as people start re-appearing in cities and towns the animals are going to retreat and this will have just been an unusual vacation for them,” says Mr Larsen. For animals that exist on the waste of urban life, this time will be more of a struggle than a holiday and could have some fatal consequences. “We have a lot of feral dogs here in Mumbai, so what is going to happen when we see them interacting with the wild animals that are going to come out more looking for food?” Mr Andheria says.“One impact could be increased disease transfer from animal to animal as they are forced into greater interaction with each other.” What might be overturned in this period are our assumptions about what can be considered “natural” behaviour for our urbanite wildlife, and what is imposed by the encroachment of humans. “I think the key thing we’ll see is the times of day animals might be using areas. Many urban species are suddenly using the daytime as they would the night,” Mr Shannon says.“If you really want to get dark about it, this is kind of a macabre vision of what would happen if humans disappeared,” says Mr Larsen.And though many of these animals are likely to slink back into the shadows when humans re-emerge, there could be a painful period of readjustment.One possibility is an uptick in traffic accidents, as roads unexpectedly fill up with traffic again. “On the more positive side hopefully some people by having this experience will maybe have a deeper appreciation for the values of our natural systems,” says Mr Larsen.More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2018/09/01/TELEMMGLPICT000171262693_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqeK8ehqBZJSTiVTgumtathbH8AD1LYTdJsoz8pklmEgw.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"students need sit proper exam not rely guesswork","story":"The exam compromise devised by the Department for Education manages to be both convoluted and unjustIt is not everyone who pines to hear more from politicians, but I should like to see more of that shy, elusive creature, Gavin Williamson, Education Secretary. A couple of weeks ago, Mr Williamson announced that Ofqual, the exam watchdog, would cancel GCSEs and A-levels and replace them with a combination of teacher guesses at pupils’ likely results, previous work, mock results and the school’s past performance. To complicate things further, teachers have to rank each pupil within each grade.This manages to be both convoluted and unjust. The GCSE candidate in my family sailed through his mocks on the basis that they didn’t really count. April Fool! For those candidates – that would have been me, once – who were banking on a last minute sprint to get to the finish, it’s a shock to find that the rules are changed retrospectively and guess what? Those mocks do count after all, not to mention homework. Hah!However, Mr Williamson did say that “some students will feel that they would have done better had they had the opportunity to prove themselves in an exam rather than relying on teacher judgements to calculate their grades … Students who do not feel their calculated grade reflects their ability should be afforded an opportunity to sit an exam.”Right. It is a reasonable surmise that schools could re-open by the end of May. In which case, it would be possible for exams to be scheduled for those who want them for the end of June – the school year ends mid-July. That would enable pupils who want a proper objective result, rather than guesswork by teachers (who have a rubbish record in predicting results), to sit an actual exam only a few weeks later than they planned. But these things need lots of notice. Time for Mr W to emerge from isolation and take a lead.Digital prayer is no substitute for the real thingHow was your virtual Easter religion then? I spent Holy Week hopping from one church site to the next – sometimes thwarted by links that didn’t work, buffering at the worst moments and microphones that worked for one celebrant but not another. The Farm Street Jesuits made heroic efforts but at one point the priest appeared to be simultaneously at the lectern and the altar. The Archbishop of Canterbury delivered a service from his kitchen, which was odd, since he and Mrs Welby could have had all of Lambeth Palace chapel in which to socially distance.What’s really sad is that laypeople couldn’t just sit quietly in a place of worship, because both Catholic bishops and the CofE have shut the churches and thus designated them as non-essential service. If my local church in Ireland can keep open, with umpteen precautions, why can’t the Established church here do the same?Fiona Shaw, of Killing Eve fame, says James Bond should be a man: “I don’t think equality means that everyone plays everything all the time”. Could she tell the BBC? Radio 4’s recent dramatisations of Jules Verne’s 20,000 Leagues under the Sea and The Mysterious Island inserted female protagonists into both, which weirdly unsettled the dynamic.The only useful thing I’ve done since lockdown has been to watch Alec Guinness as George Smiley in Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy and Smiley’s People. In some episodes there weren’t any females at all, but it didn’t matter. Those BBC series have never been surpassed.Should students be allowed to sit exams in order to confirm their grades?

In the face of a common enemy some of South Africa’s most violent gangs have put down their knives and are working together to help their rivals cope with the coronavirus crisis.The gangs, until recently at each other’s throats fighting for control of scarce resources in the poverty stricken suburbs of Cape Town, have begun to hand out food parcels to their former enemies.Organised by an investment banker turned church pastor, the initiative has seen the likes of convicted murderer Preston Jacobs, 35, distributing aid parcels in the deprived suburb of Mandenber, including to members of rival gangs.Mr Jacobs, leader of the long-established ‘Americans\u0027 gang, who was released in 2018 from a seven-year jail sentence for his part in the death of a man from a rival gang, now finds himself handing out food to members of gangs he used to hate. The 35-year-old, who also murdered his mother’s “drunk, violent lover” when he was just 14, says he has now found God, and is changing his life. “I have met so many people in my community and I feel they respect me. So we will love each other,” he said.“I made mistakes and I regret and I was punished and I will become a better man. This came with God, and I have learned about God from Pastor Andie.”Pastor Andie is former investment banker Andie Steele-Smith, 52, an Australian, who moved to South Africa with his family five years ago, is part of the Hillsong Church in Cape Town.He first became involved with gangs a year ago at a barbecue, where he persuaded some of them to help put fires out in shanty towns and then rebuild some of the shacks. But the 21 day lockdown ordered by the South African government to stem the spread of COVID-19 is the first time enemy gangs have worked together, Mr Steele-Smith said. Between them they are feeding about 30 000 people with donated food. Mr Steele-Smith said: “Gangsterism thrives on poverty. All of the gangs are at war with all of the gangs. They are natural enemies. So this… (handing out food packs together) is a bit of a miracle.“Such was the violence that during one weekend alone last year gangs operating among the shacks and poverty of the mixed race (coloured) suburbs known as the Cape Flats killed 14 people.Someone else handing out food to his former enemies is Sansieme Hassan, 31, one of the Clever Kids gang, who was also enrolled by Pastor Andie..Mr Hassan, who is married with two daughters, has long struggled to find work and wishes he could learn a trade.Taking a short break from the relief effort he said: “We never have enough money. So life is very difficult.

Just a couple of days later came a blast and the words that would shock and fascinate the world:\u0026nbspOK, Houston, we\u0027ve had a problem here.Nasa is marking the anniversary of the mission it refers to as a successful failure, which represents one of its most high-profile disasters and its most famous miracles. It is a part of space history that is celebrated even today, with the story of the mission continuing to captivate the world.It was 11 April\u0026nbspthat marked the day the astronauts blasted off on their way to the Moon, and 13 April that an oxygen tank explosion started the mission to save the astronauts from being stuck in space.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesOn 17 April, nearly exactly six days after the mission began, the astronauts fell back through the Earth\u0027s atmsosphere and arrived safely back on Earth. It was an unlikely end to an unlucky mission.While it is now remembered as one of the most important moments in Nasa\u0027s history, the mission began in relative obscurity for a trip to the Moon. Apollo 11 had already managed to get to the lunar surface, and so what just a couple of years before was regarded as a near-impossibility was by that time relatively unexciting.Astronauts on screen from The Right Stuff to Apollo 13 and GravityBut hours later, television stations around the world were giving rolling updates on the mission\u0027s status, following closely as the astronauts and Nasa engineers back on Earth tried to save them from disaster.As well as being a relatively unwatched mission, the first couple of days of the journey were almost tediously straightforward. After two days of flight, one of the Nasa staff in mission control joked the astronauts that the spacecraft was in such good shape that they were bored to tears.Problems began on Apollo 13 when the astronauts were nearing the Moon and heard a bang and felt a shudder through their spacecraft. During what should have been a routine stir, one of the oxygen tanks on the spacecraft had burst and exploded.(After the mission was over, the explosion was traced back to overheating while the spacecraft was being tested on the ground, but there was no way to know that at the time.)The explosion also knocked out the fuel cells that should have been powering the spacecraft, and sent voltage in its circuits plunging. Engineers watching the mission from Mission Control saw the pressure in the damaged oxygen tank drop instantly.OK, Houston, we\u0027ve had a problem here, said\u0026nbspJack\u0026nbspSwigert, the command module pilot who had actually joined the mission as a last-minute substitute for a colleague who had become sick just before the mission took off.Houston, we\u0027ve had a problem, said Jim Lovell, the commander of Apollo 13.Almost immediately, it became clear that the astronauts would not be landing on the Moon, as planned. But that was a relatively unimportant challenge compared with the more pressing job of staying alive.In many ways, the explosion happened at the best possible time, and the astronauts would later say they considered themselves lucky. If it had happened earlier, they would have run out of power later, and the blast could have happened in lunar orbit or on the surface of the Moon.Created with Sketch.Nasa\u0027s groundbreaking decade of space exploration: In pictures Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Mystic Mountain, a pillar of gas and dust standing at three-light-years tall, bursting with jets of gas flom fledgling stars buried within, was captured by Nasa\u0027s Hubble Space Telelscope in February 2010The first ever selfie taken on an alien planet, captured by Nasa\u0027s Curiosity Rover in the early days of its mission to explore Mars in 2012Death of a star: This image from Nasa\u0027s Chandra X-ray telescope shows the supernova of Tycho, a star in our Milky Way galaxyArrokoth, the most distant object ever explored, pictured here on 1 January 2019 by a camera on Nasa\u0027s New Horizons spaceraft at a distance of 4.1 billion miles from EarthAn image of the Large Magellanic Cloud galaxy seen in infrared light by the Herschel Space Observatory in January 2012.

It would require them to slingshot around the Moon – coming frustratingly close to the surface they were supposed to land on – and then whip back around and float back home to Earth.In the meantime, mission control got to work putting together a rescue plan while the astronauts on board attempted to put out of their mind just how likely it was they would now die in space, something they say they never discussed.Flight controllers told the astronauts to shut down their command module and climb into Aquarius. That module was supposed to be the box that took the astronauts down to the lunar surface – but was refashioned into a lifeboat in an attempt to conserve power.Because it was never meant for so many people for so long, the lander was low on space. It was also filled with carbon dioxide, as the astronauts breathed inside their new, tiny spacecraft.One of the most famous breakthroughs came as engineers tried to find a way to fix that problem, by using the air purifiers from the now abandoned capsule in the lander. The two were the wrong shape to fit together – they were literally trying to fit a square canister into a round hole – but engineers back on Earth came up with a way of using various pieces of spacecraft to push the two together.Even once that was fixed, conditions inside the lander were miserable, without the energy for heating or other improvements to their conditions. They were stuck inside of a frigid box that was never meant to hold them, stuck\u0026nbspfor days with little to do but wait and see if the various last-minute solutions to their desperate situation would actually work.(The astronauts have said they didn\u0027t argue during this time, despite the miserable conditions, and didn\u0027t talk about the possibility of getting stuck floating in space and waiting to die either Lovell wrote in his autobiography that they were too busy struggling for survival. He also denied that they had poison pills hidden away in case of becoming lost.)Eventually they arrived back near home for what is traditionally one of the most perilous parts of the journey: dropping back through Earth\u0027s atmosphere to come home. They had enough power to switch on the command module and wait as they went through the gruelling, hot ordeal of slamming back down to Earth.As they did, the communications blackout that comes from the extreme conditions of the Earth\u0027s atmosphere lingered for much longer than usual, leaving flight controllers in the dark as to whether the three astronauts and their hacked-together spacecraft had survived.But eventually they appeared in the air, the spacecraft being cradled by three parachutes as it fell through the sky and down to Earth. They were picked up and all three completed a journey whose legacy – one of inventiveness and luck that became mission control\u0027s greatest achievement – is still celebrated by Nasa today.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Searches for “fruit picker” and “farm worker” rose 330 per cent and 107 per cent respectively.The site has seen an 83 per cent jump in job applications for agricultural work over the past month.Steve Warnham of Totaljobs said he had noticed “a trend of workers who have been temporarily displaced due to Covid-19 who are now looking for roles they can take on in other sectors to keep Britain moving.”Other jobs designated as key by the government, including healthcare and logistics, have also seen a surge in interest.Mark Bridgeman, president of the Country Land and Business Association,\u0026nbspsaid it was “wonderful news” that tens of thousands of people had come forward but warned that many more were needed.“We all know this is a deeply concerning period and we are all determined to do all we can to help the country through it.

About half of applicants were seeking work after losing their livelihoods due to Covid-19, Concordia said.When can we really expect coronavirus to end?Everything you need to know on supermarket delivery slotsThe dirty truth about washing your handsWhich countries around the world has coronavirus spread to?Listen to the latest episode of The Independent Coronavirus PodcastThe latest round of jobs will start from the beginning of May when the UK’s soft fruit season begins with harvests of strawberries, raspberries and other summer fruits.Recruitment website Totaljobs has reported a record 50,000 searches for farm jobs last week. Searches for “fruit picker” and “farm worker” rose 330 per cent and 107 per cent respectively.The site has seen an 83 per cent jump in job applications for agricultural work over the past month.Steve Warnham of Totaljobs said he had noticed “a trend of workers who have been temporarily displaced due to Covid-19 who are now looking for roles they can take on in other sectors to keep Britain moving.”Other jobs designated as key by the government, including healthcare and logistics, have also seen a surge in interest.Mark Bridgeman, president of the Country Land and Business Association,\u0026nbspsaid it was “wonderful news” that tens of thousands of people had come forward but warned that many more were needed.“We all know this is a deeply concerning period and we are all determined to do all we can to help the country through it. In order to do so, we must recognise that farmers’\u0026nbspsupply of labour is in jeopardy,” he said.“A shortage of 80,000 workers is something we have never seen before. This is why we are calling for a ‘land army’ of workers to support farmers in feeding the country.”The campaign comes in the midst of one of the sharpest rises in unemployment on record, with more than 1 million new universal credit claims registered over the past three weeks despite government efforts to keep people in jobs by paying wages.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

I mean, you couldn’t talk to him without getting yelled at. He’d run people off in 20 minutes just by the absurdly crass things that would come out of his mouth.On whether he thinks Exotic should be freed: “No. Not no, but f*** no. Twenty-two years doing federal time – that guy’s gonna die in there. Good riddance.”Is Tiger King just a celebration of abuse?Tiger King’s Joe Exotic says he’s ‘done with Carole Baskin saga’7 Netflix documentaries to watch if you liked Tiger KingJeff and Lauren Lowe, zoo owners“We’re getting reports that he’s trying to get to a computer so he can respond to his fans. You know, this is the notoriety and fame that Joe always wanted. It’s pretty ironic that now he’s stuck in a cage and can’t even enjoy it. He’s where he belongs and i would probably just tell him ‘Gotcha’.”“He was always belittling\u0026nbspsomebody He just got to where it was all about\u0026nbspthe cameras and he’d fire somebody just ‘cause he needed to fire somebody.\u0026nbspThe man’s done a lot of stupid s***. I mean there towards the end, he got to where he’s blowing everything up. “Hell, he blew up my golf cart and my damn cabin. Knocked the windshield out of my golf cart. Blew a hole in my cabin. Blew the window out.”On whether he’s contacted Exotic since the series was released: “I have refrained from contacting that man because he don’t know when to shut up, and he’ll just keep talking.”“I’ve seen Joe\u0026nbspgive the jacket off his back to people and I think that wasn’t highlighted enough.\u0026nbspJoe did a lot of messed up stuff – that’s a fact and that’s shown, and now the entire world knows it. But he did a lot of good things too. I think justice was served,\u0026nbspbut I still don’t\u0026nbspwant to see that man die in prison.”About the effect Travis Maldonado’s death had on Exotic: “What Joe did is he spoke to a shaman. I felt like it worsened his condition. I’m all for holistic approaches but sometimes you need real legitimate counselling and medicine and he wasn’t getting it.”Created with Sketch.Hidden gems: The best Netflix originals you might have missed Show all 20Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.120 Money Heist (TV series, one season, 2017–)Known as La Casa de Papel (House of Paper) in its native Spanish, Money Heist is Netflix’s most streamed non-English language show. The bank heist is a tired dramatic trope these days, but don’t let that, or the show’s bland English-language title, put you off – creator Álex Pina has made something special. The heist here, led by a mysterious man known only as The Professor, involves breaking into the Royal Mint of Spain and printing off €2.4 billion. There are even more twists in the show’s 15 episodes than there are hostages. 220 American Vandal (TV series, two seasons, 2017–2018)Part satire of true crime documentaries such as Making a Murderer, part carefully observed portrayal of teenage life, American Vandal was criminally underappreciated during its two season run. It’s been cancelled now, but that doesn’t mean you can’t catch up with it, and then write Netflix a strongly worded email.320 One Day at a Time (TV series, two seasons, 2017–)In stark contrast to the off-beat, low-key comedy that currently rules TV – the kind that provokes a wry smirk rather than a hearty laugh – One Day at a Time is a big, bright sitcom filmed in front of an interminably enthusiastic studio audience. You wouldn’t have thought that the story of a Cuban-American army veteran  nurse  single mother – who suffers from PTSD and depression – would fit into this format, but it does so beautifully, tackling issues of sexuality, racism and sexism in the process.  Based on writer  director Tamara Jenkins’s own fertility struggles, Private Life stars Kathryn Hahn and Paul Giamatti (both giving brilliant performances) as a spiky, loving middle-aged couple desperate to have a baby. They even rope their enthusiastic but irresponsible niece Sadie (Kayli Carter) into the mix, much to the horror of Sadie’s mother (Molly Shannon, turning a potentially repellent character into one worthy of empathy). It’s subtle, restrained and beautifully realised.520 Big Mouth (TV series, two seasons, 2017–)Crude, rude, and rife with surprise emissions and bodily functions, animated sitcom Big Mouth is also a sensitive, nuanced deep e into the various horrors of teenagehood. When 12-year-old Andrew Glouberman (John Mulaney) is visited by the hormone monster (Nick Kroll, who voices many of the show’s best characters), he finds his life irreversibly – and seemingly disastrously – changed. Unlike many other puberty-centred comedies, Big Mouth makes as much time for its confused female protagonists as its male ones Maya Rudolph is a delight as the female hormone monster, and look out for Kristen Wiig’s wonderful turn as a talking vagina.  620 Easy (TV series, two seasons, 2016–)Joe Swanberg’s style of defiantly undramatic mumblecore isn’t for everyone, but if you enjoyed his earlier films, Drinking Buddies and Happy Christmas, you’ll find plenty to admire in this anthology comedy-drama series. Big-name stars such as Orlando Bloom and Aubrey Plaza crop up, but Jane Adams – who you might remember from Todd Solondz’s chronically depressing 1998 film Happiness – is the show’s heart, and Marc Maron is its jaded soul.Community’s Gillian Jacobs is brilliant as the prickly, magnetic recovering addict Mickey, who forms an unlikely – and arguably deeply unwise – relationship with her nerdy neighbour Gus (Paul Rust). Despite Gus’s pathological need to be the nice guy, we’re never quite sure who or what we’re rooting for – which is what makes Love such complex, compelling viewing.  In 2016, comedian Patton Oswalt’s wife, the true crime writer Michelle McNamara, died suddenly in her sleep. That subject matter doesn’t exactly scream “stand-up special”, but out of his devastating loss, Oswalt managed to craft something funny and profound. Over the course of an hour, he processes his grief onstage, managing to find humour in the struggle to raise his grieving six-year-old daughter alone.920 Santa Clarita Diet (TV series, two seasons, 2017–)Granted, this horror-comedy – which stars Drew Barrymore as a neurotic real estate agent who suddenly develops a taste for human flesh – is really silly, and really, really disgusting. But it’s also strangely charming, and funny. Timothy Olyphant is excellent as Sheila’s frazzled husband Joel, and the pair’s idiosyncratic but respectful relationship with their smart teenage daughter Abby (Liv Hewson) isn’t quite like anything else on TV right now.1020 Dark Tourist (TV series, one season, 2018–)New Zealand journalist David Farrier is an unlikely TV presenter in the same way that Louis Theroux is – in just about every scenario in which he finds himself, he’s a little bit awkward. But as with Theroux, Farrier’s weakness is actually his strength, allowing him to endear himself to the many unusual people he meets on his journey through the world’s most questionable tourist destinations. Farrier’s stops include the site of the Fukushima nuclear disaster, the road where JFK was assassinated, and the Milwaukee suburbs where serial killer Jeffrey Dahmer murdered his victims.1120 Sacred Games (TV series, one season, 2018–)Based on Vikram Chandra’s epic 2006 novel, Netflix’s first Indian original series is a slowly unfolding gem. The first season of Sacred Games – which follows a troubled police officer (Saif Ali Khan) who has 25 days to save his city thanks to a tip-off from a presumed dead gangster – only covered one quarter of Chandra’s 1,000-page novel. As the show itself declared when it announced the forthcoming second season, “the worst is yet to come”.When the trailer for Dumplin’ first landed, it seemed all the ingredients were in place for a film that was at worst tone-deaf, and at best vaguely patronising. Thank heavens, then, that the trailer did Dumplin’ such a disservice. Starring Danielle Macdonald (who broke out in the excellent 2017 film Patti Cake$) as Willowdean, a self-described “fat girl” who enters a local pageant to annoy her former beauty queen mother (Jennifer Aniston), Dumplin’ is as funny, warm and sensitive as its protagonist – and with a killer Dolly Parton-laden soundtrack to boot.1320 Dark (TV series, one season, 2017–)This sci-fi thriller – which features disappearing children, a mysterious local power plant, and scenes set in the Eighties – has, for obvious reasons, drawn comparisons to Stranger Things. But Dark is even more beguiling and (true to its name) less family-friendly than Stranger Things.1420 The Death and Life of Marsha P Johnson (Film, 2017)Though it’s been somewhat tarnished by claims that director David France appropriated the work and research of trans film-maker Reina Gossett, this documentary is nonetheless a loving, respectful tribute to gay rights activist Marsha P Johnson. One of the key figures in the Stonewall uprising (though her involvement was almost entirely eradicated in 2015’s critically hated Stonewall), Johnson modelled for Andy Warhol, performed onstage with drag group Hot Peaches, helped found the Gay Liberation Front, and then died under suspicious circumstances in 1992.1520 On My Block (TV series, one season, 2018–)This coming-of-age series might not have found as many eyeballs as it deserved last year, but those it did find were glued to the screen. In fact, it was the most-binged show of 2018 – meaning that it had the highest watch-time-per-viewing session of any Netflix original. Created by Awkward’s Lauren Iungerich, On My Block follows a group of Los Angeles teens as they navigate both the drama of high school and the danger of inner-city life.Two beleaguered assistants (Zoey Deutch and Glen Powell) conspire to get their over-demanding bosses (Taye Diggs and Lucy Liu) together in order to get their lives back in this winning romantic comedy. Set It Up is responsible not only for coining the term “over-dicking” (it’s much more innocent than it sounds), but for rejuvenating a tired genre.Martin Freeman stars as the father struggling to protect his young daughter from a zombie epidemic spreading across Australia. So far, so overdone. But this drama thriller, directed by Ben Howling and Yolanda Ramke and based on their 2013 short of the same name, throws a handful of unpredictable ners in the works.    1920 Godless (TV series, one season, 2017–)With shades of John Ford\u0027s The Searchers, this languorous western was critically acclaimed but swiftly forgotten after it landed on Netflix in 2016. Set in 1884, it\u0027s about Frank Griffin (Jeff Daniels) and his notoriously ruthless gang of outlaws’ pursuit of their injured former ally Roy Goode (Jack O’Connell), who is hiding out in a small town populated solely by women after a mining accident killed off all its men. A gun-toting Michelle Dockery, clearly relishing the change of scenery after years of Downton Abbey, and a taciturn Jack O’Connell, are on brilliant form.2020 Atypical (TV series, two seasons, 2017–)This coming-of-age series about a teenage boy with autism was sweet and well-intentioned from the start, but its first season was criticised for a handful of inaccuracies, and for its lack of autistic actors. Rather than drowning in a sea of defensiveness – as too many shows tend to do – it listened, and brought in autistic actors and writers for its excellent second season.120 Money Heist (TV series, one season, 2017–)Known as La Casa de Papel (House of Paper) in its native Spanish, Money Heist is Netflix’s most streamed non-English language show. The bank heist is a tired dramatic trope these days, but don’t let that, or the show’s bland English-language title, put you off – creator Álex Pina has made something special.

News about his time working with the eccentric tiger trader.He claims that one day a woman came to Exotic’s GW reserve in Oklahoma with a horse that she wanted him to look after.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesHe says that Exotic – after telling Kirkham to roll his camera – reassured the woman he would give the horse a nice life.However, the moment she left, Kirkham alleges that Exotic “walked up, pulled a gun out of his holster and shot the horse dead in the trailer”.Is Tiger King just a celebration of abuse?Carole Baskin says she’s receiving death threats because of Tiger King7 Netflix documentaries to watch if you liked Tiger KingHe stated: “He\u0026nbspthen cut it up with a chainsaw and fed it to the tigers that day.”Kirkham\u0026nbspalso shared the\u0026nbspstory in the new Netflix special, which is titled\u0026nbspTiger King and I. In it, he calls Exotic “unbelievably cruel”.Exotic is currently serving 22 years in prison for hiring someone to kill his rival, the animal rights activist Carole Baskin, as well as for killing tigers to make more room in his nature reserve.In the Netflix special, Kirkham claims that Exotic jokingly said he would make him rich if he killed Baskin for him, and said he still suffers nightmares about the time he spent working alongside him.Find a full transcript of all the things the documentary’s stars say about Exotic in the aftershow here.Created with Sketch.29 most underrated TV shows to watch Show all 31Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.131 Ben and KateOne of the short-lived comedies that, in hindsight, had one of the most A-list creative teams imaginable, Ben \u0026amp Kate is worth seeking out. Starring a pre-Fifty Shades Dakota Johnson, Oscar-winning screenwriter Nat Faxon and ludicrously funny British comic Lucy Punch and featuring Lorene Scafaria (Hustlers) on its writing staff, Ben \u0026amp Kate revolved around two adult siblings living under one roof. From a simple sitcom premise it evolved into a rich, human and wonderfully silly ensemble comedy. That it was cancelled after 16 episodes, despite the talent at work, must have left Fox Television kicking themselves. AWIf you’re on the hunt for a quick and easy watch with impressive credentials, might we suggest the Jason Reitman-directed Casual? The sitcom, following a newly-single mother living with her brother and daughter, might not be the most transgressive, but it retains the laughs and charm throughout the entirety of its four seasons. JSA cruelly curtailed comedy from Mindy Kaling, Champions lifted the sprightly silliness of her work on The Office and her own series, The Mindy Project, while boosting the heart. Anders Holm, Andy Favreau and Josie Totah were the unlikely trio thrown together in an uneasy living situation, sparking inevitable comedy. It took a played-out premise and revitalised it, and truly should have lasted longer than it did. AWIt was a brave move for Lisa Kudrow to make this meta gem her first starring TV role after the end of Friends. The mockumentary follows a washed-up sitcom star, Valerie Cherish, as she desperately tries to regain relevance with a new TV show. It is excruciatingly awkward – so much so that it makes Ricky Gervais’ The Office feel like a comfortable watch – but it’s full of pathos and profundity, too. It was cancelled after just one season, but a growing cult status led to a second, equally brilliant, outing a decade later. ​APDishing out Nordic noir-style grit with Lost-sized cliffhangers, Dark is a Rubik’s cube of mystery masterfully combining two genres – the case of a missing child and time travel. Netflix rolled the dice with this high-concept drama that will be concluded with a third and final season. JSTim Robinson’s bizarre sketch show I Think You Should Leave was a big hit for Netflix last year his short-lived sitcom, in which and Veep’s Sam Richardson played two incompetent advertising salesman, deserved just as much praise. It’s a blast. LCBefore everyone else caught on, Laura Dern was almost exclusively beloved in the post-Jurassic Park, pre-Big Little Lies age for her work on HBO’s Enlightened. She gives one of television’s all-time great performances as a troubled businesswoman in the aftermath of a breakdown. Having emerged from a health retreat convinced she has been healed, she is determined to be morally good and ultimately save the world, but must contend with her own self-loathing and disappointments beforehand. From tragicomedy genius Mike White, Enlightened is rage-inducing and brilliant but ultimately incredibly hopeful. It combined all of the painful monotony and crushing blows of life in a succinct two-season run, and little has reached its melancholy wonder since. AWEric Andre is the undisputed champion of nihilistic comedy. The Eric Andre Show is the perfect platform for his brand of absurd chaos to flourish. Playing both victim and perpetrator of violent skits, bizarre monologues and disastrous interviews (with celebrities and suspect lookalikes), he created a show like no other. JCWho would’ve thought a sitcom about depression could be this fun? Well, fun might be a stretch, although this tragicomedy is often disturbingly funny. Opening with a failed suicide attempt, the show gets darker and more amusing as it goes on. Starring Julian Barratt and Olivia Colman, Flowers is a refreshingly original work. JCThe first season of this Starz original series is daring TV, telling the story of an attorney in training (Riley Keough) who moonlights as a high-end sex worker. Asking tough questions about desire, sexuality and power, The Girlfriend Experience is smutty in the best, most unsettling ways. LCOK, watching a series set in a hospital might not be what you’re desiring right now, but Green Wing could be the medicine you’re after. Beloved when it first aired in 2004, the zany sitcom has unfairly dropped off the radar in recent years. There’s nothing quite like it thanks to madcap creations played by Michelle Gomez, Mark Heap and Pippa Haywood. JS1231 Halt and Catch FireDespite not yet having the A-list status she deserves, Mackenzie Davis is one of the finest actors of her generation. Her role as a spiky coding genius in Halt and Catch Fire, alongside an equally stellar cast of oddballs, is proof of that. This wonderful drama is ostensibly about the 1980s computer revolution – though in actuality, it is about so much more than that. – ​APAdapted from a webseries by Ben Sinclair and Katja Blichfeld, High Maintenance is a vibrant anthology series focusing on the clients of an eccentric New Yorker weed dealer. The writing, acting, music and direction are all first-rate, and it’s also one of the most racially, sexually and culturally erse shows on TV. LC1431 Last Tango in HalifaxAll hail Sally Wainwright. Nobody makes TV with more warmth, wit and insight than the Yorkshire director, who’s also responsible for the fantastic Happy Valley. Anne Reid and Derek Jacobi play Celia and Alan, a couple reunited in their seventies after 60 years apart – but this is an ensemble piece through and through. As Celia’s formidable daughter Caroline, a headteacher coming to terms with the fact she’s a lesbian, Sarah Lancashire gives one of the finest performances of recent years. And Nicola Walker shines, too, as her shirty, sheep-farming stepsister Gillian. If you think Last Tango in Halifax is only for older viewers, you’re robbing yourself of a lot of joy.​ APA low-key triumph set within San Francisco’s gay community, Looking was likely felled by its lack of spectacle. This was a show with little soapiness or glamour, its dramatic stakes admirably ordinary. It felt wonderfully human, though, with Jonathan Groff revelatory in the leading role and strong support from the likes of Russell Tovey and Raul Castillo. AWLovesick has a lot going for it, namely the indelible plot, which sees Dylan (Johnny Fynn) forced to contact all of his previous sexual partners after being diagnosed with chlamydia (hence the series’ original title: Scrotal Recall). The way creator Tom Edge plays with linearity means what would ordinarily be just another sitcom becomes the source of the kind of analysis usually reserved for complex dramas. JSThe OA was very much a series that danced to its own tune – a high-concept series that blended the cerebral with the magical in a way that we can only assume made David Lynch smile. Be warned: Netflix swung the axe on this show far earlier than deserved. JSA short-lived fantasy series from Glen Morgan and James Wong – X-Files alumni who would go on to create the Final Destination franchise – The Others is the greatest show you’ve never heard of. Revolving around a group of amateur psychics, it was shown in a late-night timeslot on Channel 5 two decades ago, and was enjoyably high concept from the off. Episodes involved Jack the Ripper, haunted wallpaper and ghosts on airplanes, each hour possessing that chilly, made-in-Canada and perpetually autumnal spookiness. AWThis quirky comedy had a simple set-up, following four workers and their boss during the day-to-day of working in a phone shop. Our protagonist Christopher negotiates the boisterous behaviour of colleagues Ashley and Jerwayne, the awkwardness of co-worker Janine, and placates a particularly challenging boss. All while trying to sell some phones. JCOne read of Rectify‘s premise will lure you in: Daniel Holden (Aden Young), imprisoned as a teenager for the rape and murder of a young girl, spends 19 years on death row before fresh DNA evidence throws the verdict into question. His release and ensuing assimilation back into society, however, won’t be easy many of the townsfolk are convinced he’s guilty. Ray McKinnon’s little-seen drama is one of television’s best kept secrets. JSAn updated version of the 1977 series, which proved a watershed moment in American television, the new Roots retains the shock and brutality of its predecessor. Telling the tale of Kunta Kinte, a tribesman from The Gambia who is sold as a slave in America, Roots tells the history of millions, framed in the story of a family tree. Unflinching, horrendously graphic, and a deeply affecting portrayal of human suffering, the updated Roots is an essential watch. JCThis critically lionised cop drama remains largely unknown, most likely because all of its seven seasons ran on then-little-known cable channel FX. Taking inspiration of real-life Rampart scandal of the 1990s, The Shield follows a four-man Strike Team who take advantage of the war on drugs to get rich. ALThis taboo-smashing comedy follows aspiring journalist Annie as she rallies against nasty bosses, non-committal boyfriends and fat-shaming trolls. You might come for the laughs, but some of the more emotional storylines will leave you in tears. ALA pulsating, captivating detective series, now in its third iteration. The premise is simple enough: what makes seemingly ordinary people commit terrible crimes? The answer, however, is always complicated. A slow burner, twisting and turning as each season progresses, The Sinner consistently delivers engrossingly gripping finales. The performances of Bill Pullman, playing a troubled detective, and Jessica Biel, a woman charged with murder in the first series, are particular highlights. JCThis Norwegian teen drama series – think Skins, with fewer drugs and better acting – is phenomenally successful in some corners of the internet. It was set at exactly the same time, to the minute, as it aired, and fans could see each character\u0027s social media accounts update as the plot developed. It wasn\u0027t just a gimmick, though – even if you didn\u0027t follow along with all the tertiary Tumblr drama, this show offered a smart and unflinching look at the messy lives of contemporary teens.​ AP2631 Top of the LakeThis Jane Campion drama is an eerie, dark crime story about missing women. It requires patience, but the moody thriller is worth the wait. Elisabeth Moss is mesmerising as an entirely dysfunctional, but ruthless detective and the finale is one of the most explosive in TV history. ALThe slow pace of this fiercely humanistic series about post-Katrina New Orleans has become something of a running joke among TV writers – inspiring gently disparaging jokes in 30 Rock and BoJack Horseman. They’re wrong: David Simon’s music-infused drama is a brilliant work of art and a worthy follow-up to The Wire. LCDevastated that BoJack Horseman‘s finished? Hitch your wagon to Undone, the new series from its creator Raphael Bob-Waksberg. Just like BoJack, Undone refuses to shy away from the tough questions, this time following a girl named Alma (voiced by Rosa Salazar) who gains the ability to manipulate time after a near-fatal car crash. JSForget Broadchurch – this crime drama not only delivered a breathtaking first season, but capitalised on its success with not one, but two worthy follow-ups. It follows two detectives – played by Nicola Walker and Sanjeev Bhaskar – as they solve murder cases in London. It’s about time Walker got Olivia Colman-levels of recognition. JSFor fans of immersive, deeply informative documentaries, Stephen Ives’ The West is a must-see. Ken Burns is executive producer, but the 1996 PBS documentary has enjoyed far less attention than any of his own directing work. Peter Coyote narrates an edifying history of the American West, featuring the tragic plight of the Native American people, the battles with conquistadors and then Mexicans, the effort to connect the two coasts, and stories from civil war. The West paints a vivid picture of a land steeped in natural beauty and violent upheaval. It’s the definitive story of the American West. JC3131 What We Do in the ShadowsThe TV spin-off of Taika Waititi’s similarly underrated film of the same name uses the same set and mockumentary-style shooting. Jemaine Clement (a star of the film) adapts it for the small screen and writes (alongside Waititi) a deadpan script layered with genius pop culture references, regularly ridiculing tropes of the vampire-horror genre. Three typical vampires and a daywalker energy-vampire share a house in Staten Island. A documentary crew follows them in their doomed attempts to adapt to 21st-century American life. JC131 Ben and KateOne of the short-lived comedies that, in hindsight, had one of the most A-list creative teams imaginable, Ben \u0026amp Kate is worth seeking out.

It’s great many of them will be able to do\u0026nbspsome of the things we normally associate with Easter, like enjoying chocolate, and our volunteers loved being able to add these to our deliveries.”The Felix Project has been ferrying over 20 tonnes of food each day to three of the huge community hubs established by London borough councils over the past two weeks – more than double the 10 tonnes a day it was supplying in normal times.In a bid to make the city-wide operation as efficient as possible, the charity has also forged an alliance with the two other big food surplus charities – FareShare and City Harvest – to create the London Food Alliance.“The food industry has really stepped up to help us – there’s been a brilliant response,” said CEO Mark\u0026nbspCurtin. “There’s still a huge amount of food coming from all our suppliers. And we’re doing everything we can to get that increased volume out where it’s needed.”The meal-kit company HelloFresh provides a regular supply of its surplus fruit and vegetables to the charity – and donated £25,000 to help the charity scale up its operations.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Neither they, nor children, appear especially susceptible to the virus. Babies, indeed, seem to be among the most resilient. So confident are doctors of this that their advice to new mothers who contract the illness is to keep breastfeeding should they wish.Nonetheless, the coronavirus’s arrival in the UK in January has led to huge disruption for those expecting – including instructions to undertake extreme self-isolation, the cancellation of an estimated half of face-to-face midwife appointments, and heavy restrictions being placed on now-stretched maternity wards.A spike in calls to the National Childcare Trust helpline suggests anxiety is skyrocketing among parents-to-be – itself a danger to the pregnancy – while there are also fears that forcing new mothers into a lockdown that precludes help from friends and family will lead to a dangerous rise in postnatal depression.Tragically, at least one woman, a patient at Whittington Hospital, in north London, is known to have died giving birth while suffering with the infection.Just as worryingly, perhaps, the NCT is concerned that the reduction of in-person appointments with healthcare professionals ahead of the birth will mean fewer chances to identify complications early and, as such, fewer opportunities to intervene. Neither charities or support groups officially want to go on the record to say it but, among healthcare professionals on the ground – themselves working in at-risk roles – there is some worry that social distancing could lead to a rise in still births and miscarriages.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailAs it happens, Zohra and partner Steve Waining, 38, did just that.After they were told a midwife appointment was to be arranged as a phone call, the couple pushed, successfully, to keep it as a face-to-face meeting because there had been earlier questions about the bump’s growth.“We were confident enough to do that,” Steve says. “In the end, everything was okay but, for another couple, maybe they wouldn’t have insisted and something could have been missed.”The pair say they have so far managed to navigate the fast-changing landscape. Because both are supply teachers, they have been able to self-isolate together after schools were closed. Because the pregnancy started well before the lockdown, they have largely managed to buy what they needed for the new arrival before shops shut and deliveries became so difficult to get.Nonetheless, they still find themselves facing huge unknowns, not least after the birth in late April.“There’s no breastfeeding sessions or support groups now,” says Zohra. “My mum was going to come and stay with us but now she won’t be able to – my sisters either. It’s pretty rubbish she won’t get to see her grandchild for months possibly. And it’s my first time with this little thing, so I’m feeling a bit like, ‘Oh my god, am I going to look after you right?’”But, then, she says, women have been doing this since forever: “So I’m telling myself everything will be perfect, it’s not the first few months we would have wanted but we just have to cope.”Marie Louise, another first-time-mum-to-be – and herself a midwife in Essex – feels the same.The 28-year-old, who is due in August, says that she has done two major things during the progression of her own pregnancy: limited her daily news intake and built what she calls a “digital tribe”.How worried should pregnant women be about coronavirus?The news limitations, first, are to combat the stress of life lived in a pandemic.“This is not how any of us would have envisaged this period of our lives,” she says. “But being stressed about something that can’t be controlled doesn’t help.”Such anxieties left unmanaged, she points out, could have an adverse effect on the pregnancy itself.“So, I would say to other expectant mums to keep yourself up to date with the clinical advice and how you can keep you and your baby safe,” she says. “But don’t get obsessed with the news. Focus on what you can do to stay healthy.”The digital tribe, she says, is a makeshift way of surrounding herself with support, albeit remote.“Just because my friends and family can’t visit to help out, doesn’t mean that they can’t be there for me with encouragement,” says Marie, whose book on pregnancy, The Modern Midwife’s Guide to Pregnancy, Birth and Beyond, was published last month. “Make sure parents are set up with webcams, perhaps, or have a WhatsApp group of strong friends – whatever works for you.”This is key NCT and NHS advice too, as it goes. An estimated one in four women suffer postnatal depression, a figure widely expected to rise in the lockdown as those support networks – physically, at least – are removed. Trying to reduce the impact of this isolation is key – whether that be through connecting with specialist charities, practising mind exercises or using other online tools.For Marie, herself, the hardest thing so far was having to go for the 20-week scan without partner Andy Good, a 30-year-old black cab driver, because of limitations on visitors to hospitals.“He was gutted,” she recalls. “He wanted to be there, of course, but we appreciate these are extraordinary times.”It would have been hard to be there alone, she admits, should there have been bad news. “Women will find themselves in that situation,” she says. “And it will be very difficult.”Being alone is something that concerns Steph Bowers. More specifically being alone in labour.Most hospitals have already introduced rules allowing only one person can be present at the birth.But for Steph, a teacher, the nightmare scenario would be partner Ian Bryan, who works in finance, showing symptoms of Covid-19, having to go into self-isolation and not being there at the big moment.“There’s no reason that should happen to us more than anyone else,” the 33-year-old says. “In fact, because he’s able to work from home, we ‘re pretty fortunate. But it’s just something that plays on my mind, what if I have to deliver in a room full of strangers all wearing masks?”It is unlikely to happen, Ian reassures her. “I’d be devastated if it did, though,” the 31-year-old adds.The couple, from Sale, Greater Manchester, say the pregnancy has been unlike anything they could have imagined.“When it first started emerging, I remember being upset there might not be a baby shower, silly stuff like that,” says Steph. “But pretty quickly the idea of worrying about that just seemed ridiculous. The priority just became staying fit and healthy. In that way, the lockdown was good. It added certainty to what was happening.”They had planned on using these last few weeks of pregnancy on spending quality time together – meals out, day trips, that sort of stuff – before the new born came. “Well, we’re spending time together,” says Steph. “It’s just it’s in the house.”The baby, due at the end of May, will potentially land around the same time restrictions are lifted. “But I’m still not sure I’ll want too many people cuddling my baby,” says Steph. “I can’t help it, it will put me on edge.”It is a point all three couples make. For them, perhaps like the rest of us, the end of the lockdown will not mean an end to their worries nor a resumption of normal life.Still, back with Zohra and Steve, they are keen to end all this on a positive.“The advantage of having a baby in a pandemic,” says Steve, “is it will make number two seem like a piece of cake.”Yes, says Zohra. “And number three and four.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

The pandemic has hit at cruel time for businesses who rely on themFor the first time in 800 years, the cathedral in Britain’s tiniest city will be empty this Easter Sunday.Several thousand visitors would have been expected to pour into St Davids Cathedral this weekend. Instead, the bishop of St Davids has invited them to pause at 10.30am on Sunday as she presides at the Easter Eucharist – from her kitchen.Because of coronavirus, several dozen of the small businesses in this seaside city in Pembrokeshire, west Wales, will also be losing out on visitors.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesEaster, and the warmer weather it tends to bring, signals the awakening of the tourist season for hotspots across Britain.St Davids starts to see long lines form at beachside ice cream vans. Surfers hit the breaks on Whitesands Bay, tourists rent kayaks and coasteering guides, and\u0026nbspthen fill up on pasties called oggies before heading back to caravans and campsites.Tracking the coronavirus outbreak around the world in maps and chartsWhen can we really expect coronavirus to end?Everything you need to know on supermarket delivery slotsThe dirty truth about washing your handsListen to the latest episode of The Independent Coronavirus PodcastInstead, businesses have either sent staff home on furlough, reinvented themselves… or packed up.St Davids Cross Hotel, which has 16 rooms costing up to £145 a night, had been fully booked this weekend and most of next week. More than 100 guests have cancelled.“With the weather we’ve got down in Pembrokeshire at the moment, it’s been absolutely glorious for the last week and it’s going to be very nice next week,” says Alex Perkins, the hotel’s manager. “I suppose now we just hope that we’ll make it up in the summer or the winter.”Initially, the three-star hotel tried to adapt to the pandemic with takeaway food, and even put on a delivery Sunday roast service for Mother’s Day. But as time went on, the owners decided to completely shut and furlough the staff to reduce chances of transmitting the virus. “We’d rather people do stay at home than travel down to us,” Alex adds.Down the road, The Meadow cafe has made a slightly more unusual operational swerve. Co-owner Nick Michell has set up a health and fitness training service, offering one-to-one training through an app\u0026nbspand remote coaching.The 47-year-old says: “I was a personal trainer beforehand and I was intending to incorporate some of my services into what we do at the cafe, with a wellbeing offering.” Now that the cafe has closed, the fitness plans have been jolted into fruition.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

We would be extremely busy – Easter’s always a very busy time down here anyway because it’s the first of the big holidays after winter.”The farmhouse-style\u0026nbspcafe will benefit from the business rate relief, and the owners will take up the government’s offer to pay 80 per cent of the salary for the 10 furloughed staff. In the summer, another 10 workers are usually hired – a marker of the boom of the local economy in the tourist season. But the virus could wipe\u0026nbspout work for locals. St Davids has a population of around 1,600 but the city’s visitors reach into the hundreds of thousands throughout the year.As for business loans that are being made available by the Welsh government, Nick, who has an 18-month-old daughter, is not keen. “Loans are loans and you’ve got to pay them back,” he says. “With any new business, you invest significantly at the start. So we have already invested quite a lot anyway. We’re reluctant to refinance, to continue reinvesting with the unknown that is the future.”Unknown really is the word – the three-week lockdown marker is about to arrive, with no sign of an end yet in sight. And if we’re slowly eased out of paralysis, cafes, hotels and restaurants fear\u0026nbspmeasures will still restrict customers.The pandemic has hit at a cruel time. “We rely on from now until September to get probably 75 per cent of our income for the year,” Nick adds. His wife Emma, a yoga instructor, may soon be joining him in setting up remote classes.Back at the cathedral, Dean Sarah Rowland Jones still has high spirits. “We’ve got a community WhatsApp group, there’s stuff on Facebook, there’s a lot of people ringing each other up,” she says. “People are being particularly assiduous in looking out for one another. The rest of the year, the resident community is small. So in that sense, it’s quite easy to know who’s who and to watch out for everybody.”The locals who make up the congregation are also still able to join in by watching the cathedral’s YouTube videos, she adds.And at a time of uncertainty, at least they can be fairly sure that next year’s\u0026nbspEaster Sunday service won’t\u0026nbspbe held in the bishop’s\u0026nbspkitchen.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Some 1.5 million people reported not eating for a whole day during the first three weeks of\u0026nbsplockdown, according to a\u0026nbspYouGov\u0026nbsppoll for The Food Foundation.The Independent’s Help The Hungry campaign has been supporting\u0026nbspwork going on across the country to ensure that everyone has enough to eat during the outbreak and is backed by figures such as London mayor\u0026nbspSadiq Khan, Labour MP\u0026nbspJess Phillips\u0026nbspand TV cook\u0026nbspNigella Lawson.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesWhile several food banks have told us they have been forced to close their doors, many of them are attempting to switch gears and move into the home delivery of emergency food packages.Bassetlaw Food Bank in Nottinghamshire was forced to “temporarily suspend” normal\u0026nbspoperations at the beginning of April, after it lost more than two-thirds of its mainly older volunteers who are having to self-isolate or follow NHS shielding guidance.How to support our campaignAdministrator Mark\u0026nbspBagguley\u0026nbspis part of a skeleton team now working with\u0026nbspBassetlaw\u0026nbspCouncil Voluntary Service (BCVS) to make sure the most vulnerable people in the area get food parcels dropped at their door.“You just have to find a different way of doing things,” he said. “We’re trying to work others as best we can. It’s very difficult to say whether the local need is being met, now that everything has been thrown on its head. You just have to help as many people as you can.”Despite food donations left in supermarket collection points “dwindling significantly”, Mr Bagguley is making sure the produce gets taken to the BCVS’s central hub, where drivers deliver to people struggling with job losses, cuts in income or difficultly getting outside for health reasons.The Welcome Centre, an independent food bank in Huddersfield, has lost 50 per cent of its volunteers since the\u0026nbsplockdown\u0026nbspbegan. Yet demand for help has roughly doubled in the past few weeks.\u0026nbspKirklees\u0026nbspCouncil has sent two members of full-time staff to help the charity carry on by making home deliveries across the West Yorkshire town.“We normally help about 300 people in a month,” said Emma Greenough, one of The Welcome Centre’s managers. “It’s likely we’re helping around 600 people at the moment – although it’s guesswork at the moment because things are changing so fast.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

If the government could suspend the five-week wait for universal credit, it would be a big help to people.”Both the Trussell Trust, Britain’s largest network of food banks, and the Independent Food Aid\u0026nbspNetwork (IFAN) are calling on the Department for Work and Pension to end the five week-wait on new claimants receiving their first universal credit payment.Ms\u0026nbspGoodwin said some of the independent food banks that closed a few weeks ago have already been able to re-emerge in a different form. “At the beginning of the coronavirus outbreak at least 12 of our member organisations closed. Since then, three of them have reopened because they have been able to adapt and put new processes in place.”The DENS Food Bank in Hemel Hempstead, part of the Trussell Trust network, is relying on extra help so it can continue to operate. Demand for food parcels has gone up 75 per cent in the past few weeks, at a time the food bank is struggling with a drop in volunteers. It has forged an alliance\u0026nbspwith another local charity called the South Hill Centre, allowing volunteer drivers to make home deliveries to people asking for help.“A lot of people have seen their income drop and they don’t have savings to cover them,” said Wendy Lewington, DENS Food Bank’s CEO. “For the self-employed, the government help that might be there in a couple of months isn’t there immediately so they’re struggling to afford the basics.”Both the Welcome Centre and DENS Decorum Food Bank are looking for financial donations and non-perishable items such as UHT milk, soups, tinned meat and fish – proving harder for many food banks to buy in bulk at the supermarkets.Despite the difficulties faced by small, local food banks, some of the larger food surplus charities – rescuing\u0026nbspunwanted or short-dated stock from restaurants, retailers and\u0026nbspmanufacturers\u0026nbsp– are stepping up to fill\u0026nbspsome of the gaps.The Independent’s Help The Hungry campaign is supporting the work of our key partner The Felix Project – which has teamed with two other large organisations\u0026nbspin London to forge the London Food Alliance.The London Food Alliance is now coordinating with all 32 London boroughs to make sure the new, council-run community hubs are well-stocked with supplies, and also providing meals for\u0026nbspNHS staff.The Independent\u0026nbspis also encouraging readers to help groups that are trying to feed the hungry across the country – find out how you can help\u0026nbsphere.

We have teamed up with The Felix Project – a start-up charity we helped launch in 2016 – to deliver produce to community hubs in London boroughs.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe Independent is also asking food charities across Britain to contact helpthehungry@ to tell us about your project and help build a directory of ways that our readers can help the hungry in their area – through money, volunteering and food donations. Food banks, which were already struggling to meet the need for emergency food parcels, have seen a huge surge in demand in recent weeks, while at the same time coping with dwindling donations, supermarket rationing systems, and a loss of many volunteers to self-isolation – yet none of the government’s rescue money goes to them.British households have stored more than £1bn worth of goods in their homes in response to the pandemic, creating shortages for food banks as shoppers ignore assurances that supply chains are robust.How to support our campaignJess Phillips, the Labour MP who recently ran for party leader, has backed our campaign, saying: “Nobody should be in the position of not being able to get enough food. In my constituency, London and in places all around the UK the coronavirus pandemic is placing extra stress on a system that was already straining.“We should all do what we can to help food and other essentials get to those that need it. That is why I’m backing the Help the Hungry campaign – please give if you are able.”Pastor Obi Onyeabor, the manager at Barking Foodbank, part of The Trussell Trust’s national network, said his pool of around 50 volunteers has been reduced by a dozen or so people currently self-isolating at home. Yet he and his team have kept their two church hall food banks open, and are now making home deliveries on Tuesdays and Thursdays to make sure the most vulnerable get supplies.“We have been scrambling for the past couple of weeks, doing all that we can – but we’re appealing for more people to come and help,” he said. “Out of fear people have been buying for themselves and their families, but I’ve seen some real generosity too.“I hope that if we can get past the panic buying stage, more people will want to give money, food or some of their time too.”No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailIn London, charities like The Felix Project donate 10 tons of food – or 22,000 meals – to the needy every day. But funding has dropped since the outbreak of Covid-19, limiting their capacity to carry out vital work at a time when it is more important than ever. As part of the London Food Alliance, along with FareShare and City Harvest, The Felix Project will coordinate deliveries in London boroughs in order to distribute surplus food to the elderly, poor and vulnerable. The charities will deliver food to the hubs, where local volunteers will package up parcels and arrange “last-mile” deliveries to the homes of the vulnerable.Sadiq Khan, the mayor of London, has backed our campaign to help in the capital in partnership with our sister title the Evening Standard. He said: “In a city as prosperous as London, everyone should have enough food to feed themselves and their families – but unfortunately the coronavirus outbreak means some Londoners are facing even greater difficulties. It’s commendable these organisations are joining forces to help ensure surplus food isn’t wasted and instead reaches those who need it most. I urge Londoners to support this crucial initiative.”Mark Curtin, CEO of The Felix Project, said: “Our role is to pick up large volumes of nutritious surplus food from the commercial sector and deliver it to community hubs to ensure there is enough food for vulnerable people for as long as this health crisis ensues. We will be working all hours doing our bit – and it would be wonderful if your readers can get behind us so we can do this job for London.”Emma Revie, chief executive of The Trussell Trust, which supports 1,200 food banks, appealed for help from the public to get vital food to people who cannot afford the basics, and to boost volunteer numbers in areas where they are needed.“Our main priority as coronavirus unfolds is ensuring the safety of everyone who comes to a food bank – whether it’s someone needing help, someone volunteering their time, or someone making a donation,” said Ms Revie. “Until we are confident that adequate government protection against poverty is in place, food banks provide an essential community service to people unable to afford food. But this should not fall to food banks.“Our benefits system could be the life raft people need now. That’s why it’s more important than ever that we end the five-week wait for universal credit. While incredible food bank volunteers continue to help people unable to afford the basics, we would ask our government to take this essential step and end the five-week wait now. It’s five weeks too long.”Sabine Goodwin, coordinator of the Independent Food Aid Network UK, which oversees 834 independent food banks, said the charitable services were “struggling to stay above water” in the current climate and accused the government of so far “failing to act” to prevent an ever-increasing number of people falling into poverty.“Food bank use was rising before the coronavirus outbreak and the impact of job losses can only make matters far worse. But this catastrophe in the making is avoidable,” she said. “We’re calling for an income-based solution to this crisis which would mean that the Herculean efforts by volunteers across the country wouldn’t be needed.“FareShare, the UK’s biggest food redistribution charity, is also calling for more volunteers to help with packing and making van deliveries. The organisation takes food from the food manufacturers that can’t be sold in shops, either because of packaging errors or overproduction, and gets it out to food banks, hospices, homeless hostels and other charities.Commercial director Alyson Walsh estimates around 1,200 people have got in touch over the past week. “We have quite a lot of older volunteers who have had to stay at home, but we are now seeing a wave of interest in new people willing to fill in.”Ms Walsh added: “We know we have the capacity to do more – we have the warehouse\u0026nbspspace and the chillers. But the government needs to help the food industry do more in terms of all the bagging and boxing and delivery of food that needs to be done.”Help the hungry\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Thank you.How to support our campaign“But I have to report that I have been out delivering food with Felix today and they are seeing unprecedented demand from people who cannot afford or access food.“I went to two homeless charities, The Marylebone Project and Rhythms of Life, where our deliveries are preventing deep distress. I accompanied one of 22 Felix vans that set off across the capital, filled to the brim, to ferry over 20 tons of nutritious food to three of the giant community hubs established in Barnet, Islington and Haringey, and to more than 75 charities and schools.“That’s more than double the 10 tons a day Felix were supplying in normal times.”Mr Lebedev added: “Within days, this picture is set to change dramatically yet again. Felix say\u0026nbspthey expect another 11 community hubs in another 11 boroughs to open their doors to hungry Londoners – and with it, Felix’s output will need to double again.“That is why we at The Independent\u0026nbspare committing our resources to raise another million pounds to prevent food insecurity to people already anxious about their health and that of loved ones. That is why we say: £1m raised, £1m to go. Let’s finish the job and keep vulnerable Londoners healthy and fed.”The deliveries are part of our food appeal’s support for the charities in the London Homeless Collective, the umbrella organisation of London homeless charities that The Independent\u0026nbspis working with through our Homeless Fund. Felix is delivering to other homeless organisations, as well as The Marylebone Project, including Centrepoint.Des Scott, CEO of the Church Army, which runs The Marylebone Project and provides 112 beds to homeless women under the Edgware flyover, said: “Being able to get fresh vegetables is one of the key things we can do to keep these women healthy.”No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Liberal Democrats were down a point on 10 per cent with Greens on 6 and the Brexit Party on 2.Labour voters showed strong approval of Sir Keir’s leadership, with 49 per cent satisfied, against just 7 per cent who were not. But he also enjoyed a positive satisfaction rating among Tory and Lib Dem voters.The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Some 22 per cent of non-voters voiced satisfaction at\u0026nbspSir Keir’s\u0026nbspleadership, against 9 per cent who were dissatisfied.Strongest support for the new Labour leader was found in his native London (33 per cent satisfied against 11 per cent dissatisfied) and the West Midlands (39-11). But he appeared to have made less of a breakthrough in the northeast, where the margin of satisfaction was just 21-14, and Scotland (26-7).He enjoyed his strongest approval among the 18- to 24-year-old age group (36 per cent satisfied, 11 per cent dissatisfied).

Some people will even tell you that the locusts are more destructive than the coronavirus. There are even some who don’t believe that the virus will reach here.”Some farmers in Mr Abokat’s village near the Kenyan border bang metal pans, whistle or throw stones to try to drive the locusts away. But mostly they watch in frustration, largely barred by a coronavirus lockdown from gathering outside their homes.A failed garden of cassava, a local staple, means hunger. Such worries in the village of some 600 people are reflected across a large part of East Africa, including Kenya, Ethiopia and South Sudan. The locust swarms also have been sighted in Djibouti, Eritrea, Tanzania and Congo.The UN\u0026nbspFood and Agriculture Organisation\u0026nbsp(FAO) has called the locust outbreak, caused in part by climate change, “an unprecedented threat” to food security and livelihoods. Its officials have called this new wave some 20 times the size of the first.Army of 100,000 ducks deployed to combat locust infestationLocust swarms cross into hunger-hit South Sudan‘Catastrophe’: Biggest locust swarm in decades triggers dire warning“The current situation in East Africa remains extremely alarming as ... an increasing number of new swarms are forming in Kenya, southern Ethiopia and Somalia,” a new FAO assessment said.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailFavourable breeding conditions through May mean there likely will be another new round of swarms in late June and July, coinciding with the start of the harvest season, the agency said.The UN\u0026nbsphas raised its aid appeal from $76m (£61m) to $153m, saying immediate action is needed before more rainfall fuels further growth in locust numbers. So far the FAO has collected $111m\u0026nbspin cash or pledges.The locusts are “invading the Eastern Africa region in exceptionally large swarms like never seen before”,\u0026nbspthe Nairobi-based Climate Prediction and Application Centre said.The new swarms include “young adults”,\u0026nbspvoracious bugs “that eat more than the adult ones”,\u0026nbspsaid Kenneth Mwangi, a satellite information analyst at the centre.Mr Mwangi and other officials in Kenya cited difficulties in fighting the infestation as coronavirus-related travel restrictions slow cross-border travel and delay the delivery of pesticides.The verification work of field officers has been curtailed, making it harder for the centre to update regional prediction models, Mr Mwangi said.In rural Laikipia county, among the worst affected in Kenya, some are calling attention to the threat to commercial farms.“I think, unfortunately, because of other things going on around the world, people are forgetting about the problem with the locusts. But it’s a very, very real problem,” farmer George Dodds told the FAO.Aerial spraying is the only effective way to control the locust outbreak. After the locusts crossed into Uganda for the first time since the 1960s, soldiers resorted to using hand-held spray pumps because of difficulties in obtaining the needed aircraft.Uganda’s agriculture minister said authorities are unable to import enough pesticides from Japan, citing disruptions to international cargo shipments.The government is yet to meet an additional budget of over $4m requested for locust control, the minister said.The sum is substantial in a country where the president has been fundraising from wealthy people to help respond to the virus and its economic disruption. Health workers are threatening to strike over lack of protective gear.In Ethiopia, where some 6 million people live in areas affected by the locust outbreak, the infestation if unchecked “will cause large-scale crop, pasture and forest-cover loss, worsening food and feed insecurity”,\u0026nbspthe FAO says.Bands of immature locusts are forming in areas that include the country’s breadbasket, the Rift Valley region, it said.Ethiopia’s agriculture minister has said efforts are under way to deploy six helicopters against the infestation that could last until late August.But ministry spokesman Moges Hailu spoke of an ominous sign: the locust swarms are now appearing in locations where they had not been previously sighted.Additional reporting by APShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

The former New York mayor skipped the first caucus in Iowa and instead campaigned in California on 3 FebruaryHe added: “The worst crime he committed, in the eyes of the establishment, is not the policy he’s proposing it’s the fact that he was able to inspire popular movements, which had already been developing — Occupy, Black Lives Matter, many others — and turn them into an activist movement, which doesn’t just show up every couple years to push a leader and then go home, but applies constant pressure, constant activism and so on.”Many commentators have pointed out that because of Mr Sanders’s success and the way he especially inspired young voters – he won the primaries in Iowa, New Hampshire and Nevada – visually every Democratic candidate was obliged to have their own policies on topics such as climate change, greater accessibly to healthcare, and criminal justice reform.As it, Mr Sanders has said his name will remain on the ballot in the primaries remaining and he will continue to collect and accrue. He said this was a deliberate tactic to try and put pressure on the committee that agrees the party’s official policy platform this summer.Mr Chomsky said if Donald Trump\u0026nbspwere elected it would be an “indescribable disaster”.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

In a statement directed at those who had so vigorously supported the veteran democratic socialist, he also said: “I see you, I hear you.”On Thursday, in what was seen as another nod to the progressives he need to win over, he unveiled two new proposals he said would help ease the “economic burden on working people”.These were a proposed lowering of the age eligibility for Medicare from 65 to 60 and eliminating student debt for some lower-income families.“In our nation’s 244 years, we have never weathered a crisis that we did not emerge from stronger,” Mr Biden wrote. “This one will be no different.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Senior US congressmen began to threaten trade reprisals, and there have been renewed demands that Beijing pays reparations for the fatal delay in warning the outside world of the coming crisis.The calls for China to face financial penalties have been echoed by some politicians in other countries including Britain and Australia. There has been widespread condemnation of what is seen as Chinese subterfuge, which allowed the pandemic to spread so wide, so virulently. The latest criticism came from the Commons Foreign Affairs Committee, which accused Beijing of “manipulation and disinformation”.Wet markets are where traders sell fresh produce, fruit and vegetables, but also wild and domestic animals, dead and alive: there have been regular complaints of some of them operating in unsanitary conditions. Dry markets sell non-perishable goods, including packaged food.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe Independent is calling for global action to create tighter restrictions surrounding the trade in wild animals, to help prevent reduce the risk of zoonotic diseases such as coronavirus.The Stop the Wildlife Trade campaign asks that governments work together to impose stricter controls on the trade, sale and consumption of wild animals.The accusation now is not just that China is culpable for the current pandemic but that it is the incubator for another devastating contagion in the future. The great risk comes from its wet markets – the one in Wuhan is believed to be the source of Covid-19 and also its huge and highly lucrative trade in wildlife. Official Chinese figures for wildlife trade and consumption shows that it was worth more than $74bn\u0026nbspand has provided work for 14 million over the past decade.Tracking the coronavirus outbreak around the world in maps and chartsWhen can we really expect coronavirus to end?Everything you need to know on supermarket delivery slotsThe dirty truth about washing your handsListen to the latest episode of The Independent Coronavirus PodcastIn Washington senator Lindsey Graham has launched a campaign in congress to get China to close wet markets once and for all. The Australian prime minister, Scott Morrison, has urged the United Nations and World Health Organisation to ensure that Beijing does not reopen them. The United Nations’ bioersity chief, Elizabeth Maruma Mrema, has said that she would support a global ban on wildlife markets, and there is also support for the measure from senior conservationists within China.Writing for The Independent on Friday, Ms Mrema said: “Global wildlife trade and live animal markets, where live fish, meat and wild animals are sold, are important risk factors for zoonotic disease spillover. Accordingly, measures taken by countries to reduce the number of live animals in food markets can significantly reduce the risk of disease outbreaks. Stricter controls on the sale and consumption of wild species, and implementation of the International Health Regulations, must also be scaled up globally.”Senator Graham asked: “What can China do to help the world? Shut those markets down. The source of this virus is the Chinese wet markets. They are absolutely disgusting, selling exotic animals that transmit viruses from animals to human beings. About the last three or four pandemics have come from the Chinese wet markets.”It is indeed the case that some of the most lethal viruses that have spread beyond borders have come from contact between wild animals and humans.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The H5N1 bird flu in 1997 came from Chinese geese, leaving around 460 dead. The Sars epidemic of 2002-2003 is thought to have come from bats or civet cats and killed around 780 people. The H7N9 Bird Flu in 2013 came from poultry at live bird markets with 610 dead. And now there is Covid-19, with more than 103,000\u0026nbspdeaths so far and rising daily.Senator Graham said he started his drive against wet markets after talking to Dr Anthony Fauci, America’s most senior expert on coronavirus, who had told him “it was a crazy decision which puts the whole world at risk”.There is an element of irony in this. Dr Fauci now needs security protection following threats from hardline Trump supporters who have been angered by him contradicting the president, who had initially claimed the virus was a “Democrat hoax”. Dr Fauci was denounced as a traitor and a supporter of Hillary Clinton.But on China and coronavirus at least, Dr Fauci and the Republicans are on the same hymn sheet. “It boggles my mind how, when we have so many diseases that emanate out of that unusual human-animal interface, that we just don’t shut it down. I don’t know what else has to happen to get us to appreciate that,”\u0026nbsphe told Fox News.In Melbourne, Premier Morrison bluntly stated “wet markets were a very real and significant problem wherever they exist. This virus started in China and went round the world, that’s how it started, we all know that.“These wet markets are a real problem and this is something the UN and World Health Organisation should do something about… We can clearly see the risks to the health and wellbeing of the rest of the world as a result of these types of places and facilities.”This week, more than 200 animal and wildlife charities from around the world wrote to the WHO, urging the body to demand Beijing close down all live animal markets, immediately, to prevent the spread of further pandemics.We all need to transform our relationship with the natural worldJinfeng Zhou, secretary general of the China Bioersity Conservation and Green Development Foundation, said that a universal closure of wildlife markets was justified. Speaking to , he said: “I agree there should be global ban on wet markets, which will help a lot on wildlife conservation and protection of ourselves from improper contact with wildlife. More than 70 per cent of human diseases are from wildlife and many species are endangered by eating them.”There have also been calls in the UK for Chinese wet markets to be shut.Such calls, however, were not evident two years ago, when Theresa May visited Wuhan, in the drive for post-Brexit trade with China. The then prime minister also went to Beijing and Shanghai on the trip. But the South China Morning Post noted: “Wuhan’s inclusion on Ms May’s itinerary seems surprising. The city rarely has been a destination for foreign visitors.”Wuhan was rapidly becoming an important technological hub. But there were also concerns about its wet market, where exotic wild and domestic animals, dead and alive, were being sold in packed conditions.There is no record of Ms May, or the Trade Secretary accompanying her, Liam Fox, a medical doctor, raising the issue of the wet market, despite UK National Security Strategy warning of a pandemic as a “tier one priority risk” and the knowledge that the Sars epidemic came from bats and civet cats.Last month, as coronavirus spread, Beijing banned the trade and consumption of non-aquatic wild animals. The authorities subsequently announced that 20,000 farms raising animals including peacocks, porcupines and ostriches have been shut down. Last week Shenzhen became the first Chinese city to ban the sale and consumption of dog and cat meat. And on Wednesday, central authorities declared that dogs are companions – and not for consumption. Around 10 million dogs and four million cats are currently killed in the country every year.The digestive juice from the animals, ursodeoxycholic acid, has long been used in traditional Chinese medicine, “tan re qing”, to dissolve gallstones and treat liver disease. There is no evidence that it is effective against Covid-19, for which there is no known cure, but some drug combinations have been found to alleviate symptoms.The ways of extracting the bile range from inserting rubber or metal tubes through a bear’s abdomen to cutting a permanent hole in the bear so it can be put on a “free-drip” system. The process is extremely distressing and painful for the bears. Animals Asia Foundation, an animal welfare group which rescues bears in the continent, recorded that the bears are often sick and their bile is contaminated with blood, pus and urine.Brian Daly, a spokesperson for the Foundation, said “We really shouldn’t be relying on wildlife products like bear bile as the solution to combat a deadly virus that appears to have originated from wildlife.”A spokesperson for Shanghai Pharmaceuticals company, China’s largest bear bile manufacturer, said the product came from “government-authorised animal breeding programmes... and they come from third generation of bred bears” rather than wild ones.The laws in China also allows the farming of bats and pangolins – two of the animals suspected of transmitting Covid-19. \u0026nbspScales of the pangolin – an endangered mammal also known as a scaly anteater – are used tin traditional medicine and are being sold in some areas as antidotes for the virus.Three of the bat species – Pipistrellus abramus, Murina leucogaster and Rhinolophus ferrumequinum – are found in Hubei province, which includes Wuhan. The third of these, the greater horseshoe bat, is sold commercially for its faeces and body parts. The faeces treatment, ming sha, or “night brightness sand”, is believed to cure certain eye problems while parts of the bat’s body are drunk with wine or taken as powders and thought to act as a “detox”\u0026nbsptreatment.Created with Sketch.Before and after photos show impact of coronavirus around the world Show all 20Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.1020 Gateway of India, Mumbai1320 Church of the Nativity, Bethlehem1020 Gateway of India, Mumbai1320 Church of the Nativity, BethlehemThe animals used for medicine are meant to be bred under licence, but the system is open to widespread abuse with many being sold in wet markets. Shen Wangping, from the China Bioersity Conservation and Green Development Foundation (CBCGDF) which monitors wildlife poaching and trading in Hunan province, told the Los Angeles Times that state officials were often culpable in the illicit trade.Jinfeng Zhou the conservationist, speaking to , asked: “Why were civet cats still encouraged to be eaten after the Sars outbreak? It’s because hunters, operators, practitioners needed that. How can they achieve that? They urged the government to support them under the pretext of economic development.”Jane Goodall calls for global ban on wildlife tradeThere are accusations of conflict of interest in the body, which is supposed to be dedicated to the protection of animals. Three of the 14 board vice-chairs of the China Wildlife Conservation Association are also executives of traditional Chinese medicine companies.One of them is with a company that specialises in medicine made out of deer musk, cow gallstone, snake bile and herbal root. Another is the managing director of one of the world’s biggest Chinese medicine companies, famous for its tiger bone wine. The third is one whose company focuses on treatments made from seahorse and pangolin scales.The trade in wildlife as food in markets took off during the post-Mao reforms of the economy. In the 1970s, with the country facing widespread food shortages, including starvation in some areas, huge collective farms were dismantled and land redistributed to households under the orders of the new leader Deng Xiaoping.Smallhold farmers known as “specialised” or zhuanyehu because they focused on cash crops or livestock such as chickens, ducks or pigs began to spring up quickly in many parts of the country.But then came the “second great leap forward” in the 1990s, when the government decided on a drive for economies of scale in agriculture. Well capitalised production conglomerates, “dragonheads”, often with ruling Communist Party connections, built supply chains with slaughterhouses and production facilities.Some smallholders, seeing their income cut, gravitated to wild animals and local breeds, which got a relatively high return in wet markets. The move gained more ground when a number of diseases swept through livestock, adding to the burden of poorer farmers.The result was more animals, wild and domestic, packed into the markets and worsening of sanitary conditions. With rats, bats, civet cats, pangolins and other wild animals becoming staples of rural farming, a law was passed to protect “the lawful rights of those engaged in the development or utilisation of wildlife resources.”Wildlife is also brought into China from abroad for consumption. In the last 10 years Chinese customs authorities have recorded around 400 wildlife trafficking cases. Conservationists insist that the real figures are far higher.Steve Glaister, founder of Freeland, a Thailand-based anti-trafficking organisation, wanted to stress that “Wuhan is a major wake-up call. The way to prevent further outbreaks is to stop the trade. Most wildlife is trafficked by gangsters. This is not a regulated trade, so no wonder there are infections and viruses spreading. HIV, Sars and bird flu came from animals and now this too. These markets are ticking time bombs.” HIV is believed to have originated in\u0026nbspnon-human primates.Others warn, however, that an outright ban would only drive the trade in wildlife underground, making it difficult to detect. Professor Dirk Pfeiffer, of the City University of Hong Kong, points out that demand will remain. “The people who are providing them, whether farmed wild animals or animals from the wild, that’s an important source of income for them,” he said, speaking to\u0026nbspthe BBC. “Pushing it underground, that’s not the solution.”Richard Thomas, of the wildlife trade monitoring network TRAFFIC, has also warned of the danger of forcing the trade into a black market and held that the emphasis should be on addressing conditions that allowed Covid-19 and other diseases to emerge.China defends WHO and calls Taiwan ‘venomous’ in row over racist abuse“There’s a dilemma here. If you ban trade, you risk pushing it underground, where those dangerous conditions are likely to be prevalent – and realistically it’s just a matter of time before the next zoonotic disease risk emerges,” he said, speaking to Al Jazeera. “If you manage legal trade properly, the risk of disease emergence should be mitigated, but it needs to be thoroughly monitored and regulated.”But there is no guarantee that thorough monitoring and regulation would ever take place and, under the circumstances, Robert Emerson, a strategic consultant, maintains “a black market is probably better than a grey market. At least in the black market people know the goods are illegal and should know there are risks involved. But in the grey market there could be confusion and people believing something is safe when it’s not.”There is another problem now surrounding pandemics, largely between China and the US and some other countries – trust deficit and a burgeoning confrontation. “The talk of China paying reparations shows how far things have gone,” said Mr Emerson. “And when you have the Chinese government even denying that the coronavirus started there and saying it started in Europe or America, there is a disbelief in a lot of things they say. That is going to be a problem not just in the matter of food security and diseases, but other matters as well.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

The sign that adorned the entrance of the market, a landmark of Wuhan city, has also been removed.As residents prepare for a return to work this week, business owners at the market will have nowhere to go. “Since all businesses need to apply for permission from the government before they restart operation, it will be impossible for these businesses to gain the government’s approval,” said Michael, who used to own a fruit stand a few blocks away from the Huanan Seafood Market and refused to give his real name.Wildlife trade was once a lucrative and thriving industry in China, but the suspicion that the current coronavirus pandemic started in\u0026nbspexotic animals smuggled into the country has forced the government to crack down on the decades-old trade.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesLast month, Beijing rolled out a strict ban on the breeding and consumption of wild animals, as it tried to prevent another outbreak from happening. This was a general guidance issued from the central government, with the power to enforce the law ultimately lying with provincial or municipal officials.Several other provinces have followed suit, and the southern industrial hub Shenzhen announced a ban on the sale and consumption of dog and cat meat on Thursday, becoming the first Chinese city to do so.When can we really expect coronavirus to end?Everything you need to know on supermarket delivery slotsThe dirty truth about washing your handsWhich countries around the world has coronavirus spread to?Listen to the latest episode of The Independent Coronavirus PodcastIn Wuhan, local officials have been increasingly strict in their crackdown on businesses engaged in wildlife trade or breeding. On 3 March, local authorities in Wuhan carried out a comprehensive disinfection campaign across the entire Huanan Seafood Market.However, recent reports suggest that despite the regional governments\u0027\u0026nbspefforts to put an end to wildlife trade, illicit commercial activities are still happening at public markets in certain parts of China. Earlier this week, the Mail on Sunday reported that thousands of customers flooded an indoor market in the southwestern city of Guilin in China, as living dogs and cats were crammed into cages while dead bats and scorpions were on display.Andrew Huang, a Chinese culinary expert, says one of the reasons why it’s hard for the Chinese government to completely end the consumption and trading of wildlife in China is because such behaviours have become part of decades-olds tradition in the country.“Different parts of China have their specific traditions of consuming wildlife for different purposes,” Mr Huang explains. “In the northeastern part of China, bears and deers are a big part of the local delicacies while in southwestern China, bats and pangolins are often used in traditional Chinese medicine. The steady demand for such wildlife has nurtured a lucrative supply chain, including some businesses that focus on breeding specific types of wild animals.”Mr Huang thinks that the current crackdown on wildlife trade and consumption might temporarily prevent relevant practices from happening in public markets, but it will be hard to completely eliminate it from the Chinese culture.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Even if the government has banned wildlife trade and consumption, the tradition won’t be so easily wiped out.”‘No need to close the entire market’In Wuhan, while the plan to shut down the Huanan Seafood Market is underway, local residents have different opinions about how to handle the market where the coronavirus pandemic began.“Honestly, wildlife trade isn’t the main commercial activity at the Hunan Seafood Market, as most of the sellers still focus on selling different kinds of seafood,” says Ms Xu, who was a frequent shopper at the market until it was shut down.Since the market is right next to one of the major train stations in the city, she says, it has become the regional hub for selling fruits and seafood, as well as wildlife. Due to the large number of visitors coming from different parts of Hubei province, it also became the ideal breeding ground for the coronavirus.“I think even if the government wants to ban wildlife trade, they don’t have to shut down the entire seafood market,” Ms Xu says. “This will have a huge impact on local restaurants and businesses that have long relied on the market for their seafood supplies.”Ms Xu says that instead of forcing dozens of business owners to lose their livelihoods, the Chinese government should focus more on tackling the ongoing pandemic itself. “I wish the government could conduct more coronavirus tests on citizens, because I suspect many of them could still be asymptomatic patients or patients with mild symptoms,” she said.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

But we must phase it out at the earliest opportunity.It could lead to many more deaths than the virus itself as the economy tanks, people lose jobs and families get poorer and sicker. We need a game plan for ending this.One key Government doctor has said some measures may be in place for up to six months.Stringent lockdown measures must remain in place beyond next week, Mr Raab - the Foreign Secretary, who is standing in for Boris Johnson while hes recovering at Chequers - confirmed on April .He didnt indicate when exactly the stay-at-home orders will be lted.At a press briefing, Raab said: The measures will have to stay in place, until we’ve got the evidence that clearly shows we have moved beyond the peak.I know these restrictions take their toll, day in day out. On people’s livelihoods, on people’s quality of le, on people’s mental health.And I appreciate that it’s often the little things that hurt the most.It’s been almost three weeks, and we’re starting to see the impact of the sacrices we’ve all made. But the deaths are still rising, and we haven’t yet reached the peak of the virus. So it’s still too early to lt the measures that we’ve put in place. We must stick to the plan. And we must continue to be guided by the science.Nearly , people have already died from coronavirus in the UK, as of April , while more than , have tested positive for the bug.Mr Raab also said: SAGEwill meet next week to discuss the latest evidence and well keep the measures we put in place under review.Health Secretary Matt Hancock has warned outdoor exercise could be bannediniduals continue to ignore social distancing measures.Englands chief medical officer, Prof Chris Whitty said he would expect the number of deaths to continue rising for at least two weeks past when the number of people in intensive care starts to flatten off, showing the peak is still some time away.Government advisers now believe April  is the likely peak date.The UKs three-week lockdown mark will be reached on Easter Monday.Legislation behind the mass containment must also be reviewed at least once every  days - with the first due to be carried out by April  at the latest.No easing of the lockdown will happen until at least the end of next week, Mr Raab said - but the strict measures will likely continue for even longer, with suggestions that some form of restrictions could last for up to  months until a vaccine has been developed.Ministers have warned that the lockdown could be stretched into May, after warning that relaxing it too soon will kill thousands more.Deputy chief medical officer Dr Jenny Harries has previously told the nation that restrictions could remain for the next six months.Englands Health Minister Ed Argar said the country was not at the stage where the lockdown can be relaxed.The lockdown is expected to be lted in stages amid Treasury fears that businesses wont survive past June.On April , the Mayor of London suggested the peak of the virus was ten days away.Sadiq Khan said: I think we’re nowhere near lting the lockdown.I speak to experts regularly, we think the peak, which is the worst part of the virus, is probably a week and a half away.A joint survey on the impact of the coronavirus lockdown upon , UK residents found that % are drinking more booze, and % are arguing with their family or housemates more than normal.Halfreported feeling more anxious or depressed as a result of coronavirus, while one in fivesaid they already cannot afford essential items or housing costs, the survey by Kings College London and Ipsos Mori found.April : Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab announces it is too soon to lt social distancing restrictions,  with SAGE to review the restrictions after Easter Monday.April : The Prime Minister is admitted to hospital for treatment, ten days after first displaying coronavirus symptoms on  March.March : Boris Johnson announced a partial, three-week-long lockdown, telling us to stay at home to stop the spread of coronavirus.

For those of you who say this virus is nothing out of the ordinary, a big fuss about nothing – how often do we have a Prime Minister in intensive care We all wish Boris a swt recovery. The country needs a strong leader at a time like this and Boris has proved, in three short months, he is that leader.There have been calls for a national unity government. All the parties coming together to see us through this crisis. It’s happened before, of course — most famously during World War Two, when we had a coalition government led by Boris’s hero, Sir Winston Churchill. We had one during the Napoleonic Wars back in , too, when that short French tosser was causing havoc in Europe.But do we need one now I think not. The only reason people are raising the issue now is because the Labour Party at last has a leader who isn’t actually certiable.Nobody would seriously think that giving power to an oaf like Jeremy Corbyn would help us through this crisis.But there are plenty of other reasons to object. First of all, we kind of already have a unity government.The Conservatives have a whopping -seat majority. In the last opinion poll Boris had  per cent of the country behind him, thinking he was doing a good job. That’s about as close to unanimous as you will ever get in a democracy. The Government, then, has a free hand.Perhapsthis virus had struck back in October last year, there might have been a point. Then we had a paralysed government with no working majority.Battling this virus would have been nigh on impossible in such a position. But the December General Election changed all that.But then there’s this. Unity governments are usually convened when we are threatened by a foreign power — as happened in World Wars One and Two and indeed the Napoleonic Wars. There have been brief exceptions.But by and large we have a unity government to show the foreign power that the whole country is united. The virus isn’t a ­foreign power. It is an insentient microscopic parasite. It doesn’t give a monkey’s who is running the country.But the most important objection is this. We are a democracy. And democracy is no less important during times of crisis than at other times. And we need a competent opposition to hold the Government to account. Boris and co haven’t done a bad job, so far. But there are plenty of questions that could be asked. Did the Government react too slowly  Why do our frontline medical staff not have adequate protection against the virus  Why did we allow planes to land from China, back in March, when the danger was apparent.OK, you may think some of those questions unfair. And asked with the benefit of hindsight. But it is the job of the Opposition to ask dficult questions, to challenge policies and highlight incompetency.I would argue that is more vital now than at any time in the last  years.Labour’s new leader, Sir Keir Starmer appears to be a sensible bloke.He is generally behind the Government in its fight against this pandemic.But he must be allowed to question, in public, the Government’s policies.We are no less unied when dficult questions are asked of politicians.The more those dficult questions are asked, the quicker this virus will be beaten.The Sun has launched an appeal to raise £MILLION for NHS workers.The Who Cares Wins Appeal aims to get vital support to staff in their hour of need.We have teamed up with NHS Charities Together in their urgent Covid- Appeal to ensure the money gets to exactly who needs it.The Sun is donating £, and we would like YOU to help us raise a million pounds, to help THEM.No matter how little you can spare, please donate today herewww.thesun whocareswinsappealLIFE will never be the same again. No, I’m not talking about this wretched virus for once.The Labour Party has got rid of almost all of its nutters from positions of influence.Diane Abbott has gone. John McDonnell has gone.So has the former chairman, the godawful Geordie Ian Lavery.Corbyn himself will be gone very soon.What are we going to do for a laugh without these clowns spouting rubbish all day long Luckily — thank the Lord! — the genuinely berserk David Lammy has been installed as Shadow Justice Secretary.It’s up to you, now David, you dingbat. Keep us chuckl­ing during these dark days.DONALD Trump has turned his guns on the World Health Organisation.He’s threatened to cut off its funding. He reckons the WHO has handled the virus pandemic very badly.The WHO told Trump he was wrong to ban flights from China at the start of the outbreak because it “wasn’t necessary”.He said: “The WHO receives vast amounts of money from the United States and we pay for a majority, the biggest portion of their money, and they actually criticised and disagreed with my travel ban at the time I did it.“And they were wrong. They’ve been wrong about a lot of things.”He may look like a morbidly obese Belisha beacon in a badly fitting wig.He may sometimes talk out of his a***hole. He may have the diplomatic abilities of a semi-housetrained wolverine.But he may well be dead right on this.SOME experts reckon we could be in a state of lockdown until well into autumn.That sounds pretty grim. But there is a silver lining.It means that tour by Genesis might have to be called off.WHO’S nicked all the flour, then  Can’t find the stuff anywhere.It’s aspeople thought: “Uh oh. Armageddon’s coming. Better make a really nice cake. Maybe a coffee one with walnuts, or something. Or a Swiss roll.” I suppose stockpiling flour is more sensible than stockpiling bog rolls. People seem to have given up on that now. Crisps, though, are selling out really quickly.As I mentioned last week, that’s because most sensible people are sitting on their sofas watching Netflix. And you need a snackyou’re doing that for  hours a day.Plus copious quantities of alcohol. One serious point – round my way, it’s impossible to get a click and collect slot for any of the supermarkets.And it’s been that way for two weeks. I know these are dficult times.And I’m pleased the supermarkets are giving priority to vulnerable customers. But would it tax them too much to take on a few extra drivers LONDON Mayor Sadiq Khan reckons that bus and Tube drivers in the capital don’t need protection kits to keep them safe from the virus.With every day that passes, this looks more and more dangerously wrong.There is growing evidence that the virus is more severeyou catch it from multiple sources. That explains the tragedy of young doctors and nurses dying.And also London bus drivers – nine have died so far.All the people selflessly working in frontline jobs where they meet thousands of people deserve proper protection.These PPE kits cost less than  quid per person. Not much to ask, is it I SEE that my home town is in the news.Middlesbrough has been named the place in the UK where people are least likely to obey social distancing directives.This is almost certainly because they think thatthe virus comes anywhere near them, they’ll kick its f***ing head in.“Come near me, you radged microscopic t**t, and I’ll give you a split lip.”JUST seen a report that says our pets don’t know what the hell is going on.They don’t know why we’re home all the time. And they don’t get why we’re so stressy.I tried to explain to my daughter’s hamster, Alastair, what the problem was.“It’s the coronavirus,” I told it. “We’re all a bit worried.”It looked at me levelly for a moment and said: “Well stop Chinese people eating small mammals, then,” before crapping on my hand and going back to run around on its stupid wheel.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

our schools is one of the key issues the nation will face when it steps carefully away from this Covid- lockdown.Based on the evidence, I believe that re-opening schools should be considered early in the exit strategy because it appears they play a relatively small role in transmissions.We tend to see children as excellent spreaders of bugs, and therefore ­closing schools seems to make sense.Yet research published earlier this week shows that this isn’t necessarily true for the Covid- virus.Almost everything we know about closing schools to stop disease outbreaks comes from influenza.Flu is a very dferent virus to coronavirus, and children drive much of influenza’s transmission.Coronavirus is less likely to affect children and young people.They rarely get very sick, and they mostly get very mild symptoms or show no ­symptoms at all.During the  epidemic caused by Sars — a cousin of Covid- — the data showed that schools and schoolchildren played no role in transmitting the virus.To

getting some online teaching  —  my -year-old had brilliant support from his school before the holidays.But we know that some schools are offering much less, and I worry that it is particularly the poorest children who are ­missing out.Children also benefit from school through contact with friends and adults outside their family.Plus there is support for mental health and even in the food that they might not get at home.School closures also force children together with parents at home for weeks on end.This can be a source of great bonding, but we know that, particularly for teens, being cut off from peer groups and other adults is not good for their development or mental health.The issue of forcing key worker parents to stay home has been largely solved during the pandemic by keeping some schools open just for their ­children.But for parents who are not key workers, being forced to look after ­children for weeks at home can prevent them earning an income.Closing schools has in the past been shown to increase social contacts between children outside school, and between children and adults looking after them, particularly grandparents, who are most vulnerable to this virus.Currently, those over  should be self- isolating away from children.But there are many grandparents who are under .Andschools stay closed while we allow adults to exit lockdown first, we risk an increase in contact between children and grandparents.One of the problems is that we tend to think of schools as being entirely closed or open.Our research showed that there are a range of potential options.It would mean a partial or staged re-opening with social distancing built in.The point of social distancing for schools is to reduce the number of children in contact at any one time.Ensuring that dferent school years don’t meet would be a useful start.So have half the school attend in the morning and half in the afternoon, close the playgrounds and stagger year-group start, end and break times so that ­dferent years never meet.Then ensure that dferent classes don’t meet.This could mean staggering start times by class or alternating the ways that classes enter and leave school, and ­keeping students in form classes for all their lessons.Schools could also look at how feasible social distancing is within classes.True, most British classrooms could not fit a metre between desks.However,only half of the school is attending at any one time, classes could spread out across more than one classroom.We also need very clear rules on when not to come to school with any ­symptoms, and the need for self-isolation at homeothers in the family had been ill will be required.Teachers need to be protected, as we protect those who ­continue to drive buses, man shopping centres and work in our health ­system.And teachers should be early in the queue for testing.This may all sound too dficult.However, we owe it to our ­children to examine all of these options.It could be done more easilywe had sufficient testing to know which children or teachers had had Covid-.But we may need to proceed ­without that, given what we are currently told about antibody-testing timescales.As mentioned, our schools are already ­partially open — for the children of key workers and vulnerable children.Let’s gradually increase that “partially” in a way that’s guided by

And the bus drivers — nine already dead in London alone from Covid-. And the pharmacists filling out prescriptions in tiny, windowless shops.And the postmen, delivery drivers, papergirls — and anonymous neighbours who put notes through doors offering help for the vulnerable.And the supermarket workers who stack the shelves to keep our nation fed. And a round of applause for our Queen,  this month, who gave the speech of a letime last Sunday — and for our Prime Minister who ended up in intensive care.From the bin men to Boris, we are surrounded by heroes — but the one glaring exception has been elite football.Despite inidual acts of heroism, such as Manchester United’s Marcus Rashford raising £million for underprivileged schoolkids, football has not covered itself in glory during this national emergency.On Wednesday, Premier League captains announced they were banding together to create a fund to raise millions for the NHS.This is a big-hearted gesture but can’t hide the fact that for much of this health crisis the national game has been hopelessly out of touch with the national mood.When the Prime Minister was seriously ill, it made the skin crawl to see whining millionaire footballers resisting pay cuts from clubs that have nothing to sell, no revenue coming in and no idea when football will begin again.Gordon Taylor, the £million-a-year chief of the Professional Footballers Association, has made his members about as popular as bankers.While the country fights for its le, Taylor has fought for the rights of loafing footballers to keep every last million. He has badly misjudged the moment, as have the clubs owned by billionaires who have furloughed their tea ladies while pampered footballers continue to earn up to £, a week.It has been embarrassing to see hypocritical footballers mistaking “lockdown” for “lock-in”, acting like the new rules do not apply to them.After previously urging fans to stay at home, Aston Villa’s Jack Grealish emerged bleary-eyed from an all-night party and pranged his -grand Range Rover.Manchester City’s Kyle Walker had a couple of escort girls delivered to his door, soon before telling the peasants to social distance and save lives and blah-blah-blah. All that stuff about washing your hands, Kyle — should that be before or after the escorts have been round And Spurs manager Jose Mourinho oversaw a training session on Hadley Common, for all the world asthere was one rule for the princes of football and one for the plebs who pay their wages.Do the fatheads of football ever watch the news Mass unemployment is coming. Many of the millions about to be chucked on the dole will be football fans. So how the hell can football — the players, clubs, PFA — continue to kid themselves the bubble they exist in has not already burst The world has changed.There should be no more all-night parties, no more escort girls and no more car prangs. Like it or not, footballers are role models and many will follow their lead.Troy Deeney, Watford captain and one of the prime movers behind the Players Together fund, defends Jack Grealish’s busy social le during the time of lockdown. “What’s he going to do ” Troy asked. “Sit in the yard on his own ”Yes, Troy — because that’s what millions are doing right now. Shocking, I know, but the new rules apply to footballers, too.Most footballers come from working-class backgrounds but too many of them have a sense of entitlement worthy of Marie Antoinette.Look what happened to her.NEVER going out is placing an unbearable strain on relationships.So it is nice to see that Camila Morrone, , and Leonardo DiCaprio, , seem to be happily self-isolating together.I was afraid Leo might decide Camila’s just too old for him.STEVE HEDLEY, rail union fat cat at the RMT, boasts that he would “throw a party”Boris Johnson died of coronavirus – and hopes “the whole Cabinet of Tory b******s” also become victims.If Hedley was on a ventilator fighting for his le, would he check how the doctors and nurses caring for him voted at the last election You don’t think those NHS heroes all voted Labour, do you, Steve WILLIAM and Kate carried out their first virtual royal duty this week, thanking teaching staff who look after the children of key workers.I have never seen smiles that wide on the faces of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge.I am sure that, deep down inside, they are really missing Harry and Meghan.They are just covering it up really well.FAREWELL Honor Blackman, who has died at the age of , immortal for ever in her career-defining role as Pussy Galore in Goldfinger.It is funny how certain names fall out of favour.At school I had mates called Keith and Ian, but nobody is called Keith or Ian today.Same thing with Pussy Galore. Bond girls just don’t get called things like Pussy Galore any more.THIS lockdown is taking an enormous toll on jobs, education and mental health but most of us understand it is necessary.I am infuriated, though, by the constant threats to intensy the lockdown, including closing the parks,a handful of idiots continue to flout the rules.Health Secretary Matt Hancock rages that he finds it “unbelievable that people are not staying at home” – and threatens to ban all exercise.Personally, I find it unbelievable that Hancock makes threats like some little home counties Hitler.Give credit to the MILLIONS who are doing their best during the lockdown.Don’t threaten the decent majority with a punishment beating because a selfish minority break the rules.If this Government ramps up the lockdown they will lose the British people. And something will explode.If some morons can’t stick to the rules, punish THEM – not the rest of us.KILLING EVE lost its way when the show’s creator Phoebe “Fleabag” Waller-Bridge bailed out after the first series. The second series was painfully naff.Early reports on the third series, starting tomorrow on BBC iPlayer, are not promising.But Jodie Comer as Russian assassin Villanelle will always make you want to tune in. Evenit is just for her new outfits.THIS global catastrophe started in China.When the dead are buried and we stand among our ruined economies, there MUST be some kind of reckoning.After World War Two, the Potsdam Conference decided that Germany should pay billion for what Germany had inflicted on humanity.China is now boasting that le is back to normal there, while we are burying NHS nurses like Rebecca Mack, , who worked in a children’s cancer unit. She has been hailed as a “wonderful daughter” by her heartbroken parents.Coronavirus was not an act of God. It started in China.A study by  senior Tories concludes that the UK should pursue China through international courts for £billion in coronavirus compensation.Germany paid for starting the war. Why shouldn’t China pay for coronavirus GREAT news that Boris is out of intensive care and on the way to recovery.But when he emerges from that ICU, he must give himself all the time it takes to fully recover.And then Boris has to lose weight. I saw David Cameron describe Boris as “very fit”.Sorry – a -year-old man who weighs over st is emphatically not “very fit”.He is a serious illness – a heart attack, stroke or diabetes – waiting to happen.I know from having Boris as my neighbour for years that he loves his jogging and cycling. But please slim down, Boris.Carrie and your unborn child need you. So does Dilyn the dog. So does your country.Because Boris Johnson’s great genius is for giving people HOPE.God knows we need some of that right now. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It was a magnicent address, from a magnicent woman.Her experience and serenity did more to calm and inspire the nation than anything  I can think of as this crisis has unfolded.Best of all, she reminded us that there will be le beyond this lockdown — that we will meet again.If we just focus on the here and now, we won’t be able to prepare for the future beyond the virus.But it’s also true that none of us can think straight when we are in the eye of the storm.That is where good leadership comes in. It helps us all to hold strong, not to go to pieces and to stick to the guidance given to us.Everyone looks to the leader to make decisions, and it’s the decisions we make that will chart our way out of the crisis.Unfortunately, after the Queen’s address to the nation came the news that Prime Minister Boris Johnson had been admitted to hospital intensive care.At that point, anyone who was in any doubt this illness did not discriminate was forced to reconsider.At the time of writing, Boris was back on a regular hospital ward. But his illness has been a reminder that any of us are susceptible to Covid-.Most people are shocked he is in hospital and sympathise with his pregnant girlfriend Carrie Symonds.But of course it has raised the question: Who is really in chargehe is not  Without leadership, we all get distinctly uneasy.We all have leaders in our lives. We are all looking towards them to show us what to do and lead us through it.But while they are helping save lives, who is there to help them The Sun has launched an appeal to raise £MILLION for NHS workers.The Who Cares Wins Appeal aims to get vital support to staff in their hour of need.We have teamed up with NHS Charities Together in their urgent Covid- Appeal to ensure the money gets to exactly who needs it.The Sun is donating £, and we would like YOU to help us raise a million pounds, to help THEM.No matter how little you can spare, please donate today herewww.thesun whocareswinsappealSome companies have stepped up to the plate and are doing good things — reassuring their staff, treating people well and doing their utmost to make sure people will be paid. Some aren’t, of course. But good bosses are taking pay cuts and doing everything they can to keep their businesses alive and look after their staff.At West Ham United we continue to pay all our full and part-time staff  per cent of their wages.My financial director, my manager and I have all taken a  per cent reduction to make sure this happens.It’s when there’s a crisis like this that we see who is made of what.Boris’s temporary stand-in, Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab, while talking about the PM’s hospital admission, referred to him as his boss, his colleague, but also his friend.Respect and friendship are the key words when it comes to good leadership.A good leader makes the tough decisions because they are right, but they are also governed by ethics. They want to do the right thing, for the right reasons. They are happy to make personal sacrices to ensure the majority are looked after.It is more important now, than ever, to put people before profits.After three weeks of lockdown, with no chance of a let-up, it’s all too easy to fall prey to catastrophic, even apocalyptic thinking.But we have to sht our thought process. We have to accept and understand that, at some point, this WILL be over.When things are calmer and clearer, we can ask what we can do to ensure we are still operating as the world gets back to normal — whatever the new normal is.The experience we are all living through really is like a storm, which continues to rage.There are so many unprecedented aspects to this situation and there is not one person in the world who will come out of it unchanged.So while there are so many challenging and dficult things going on, perhaps this lockdown is a chance for us all to learn more about ourselves.How are you responding  Have you thought about how you can help others  Have you thought about volunteering for the NHS As well as the importance of good leadership, we all have our inidual roles when it comes to showing autonomy and courage about our own decisions.I’m sorry to say, things are going to get a lot worse before they get better.So we all need to take responsibility — or we will never get out of lockdown.ANYONE who saw the social media video of Naomi Watts reaching breaking point after her printer, vacuum cleaner and dishwasher all broke down will surely have smiled in recognition.Naomi, who has been self-isolating in her Los Angeles home for three weeks, shared her very understandable anguish with a slow-motion video of herself screaming with the sound of a lion’s roar played in the background.I think we can all relate to her frustration.My lockdown revelation I am happy to report that I have given up ironing!WHEN it comes to illness, particularly cancer, I’ve long resisted all the talk of going into battle – mainly because of the unhelpful implication of weakness among those who “lose” that fight by dying.I feel the same way about descriptions of people “fighting” coronavirus.Illness is a fact of le. It is not a sign of weakness.The sad and terrible truth is that some people get this virus and others do not.Some have it very badly – a whole lot worse than others.We don’t yet know exactly why. We don’t even knowwe have the virus and may infect people.We don’t knowthere are antibodies that can protect us from getting it again, or how long that will take.We don’t knowthere will be a more deadly mutation of the same virus in the future.There is just too much we don’t know.But there are some practical things we can do.We need to help those who have it now, and the NHS and the Government are doing all they can in this regard.We also need to stop the spread of the virus, through testing. Hopefully that is going to happen soon.Meanwhile, scientists are also working around the clock to create a vaccine.Perhaps, most of all, we need to prepare for the possibility that this could all happen again.We need to learn lessons on food distribution, working from home, adapting our businesses – and having proper personal protection and hospital equipment ready and waiting.AS time ticks on, we are all realising what le is like without the things we used to consider necessities.Like our hairdressers.Claudia Winkleman’s Instagram post showing how unmanageable her fringe has become during lockdown made me laugh in recognition.My hair is grey, long and unkempt.On the one hand, it’s the least of my worries, which is quite liberating.Still, I did manage to get my hands on some hair dye for the roots.Do I care that it’s completely the wrong shade NO. I do not.So please, can we all just agree to turn a blind eye to the way we look when we finally emerge from lockdown HAPPY Easter Sunday, people. How will you be spending yours Personally, I have lost track of what day it is. The past few weeks have been a blur, with every day feeling like a cross between Sunday and Monday.It was my birthday last week and, without loved ones to hug, friends to see, drinks to be had, it was more or less just another day.Equally, this is the first time ever that Easter has felt like just another weekend.But I hope you can find ways to make it special. Just make sure you do so at home.THERE has been talk of schools possibly reopening after the Easter holidays – and who knows whether or not that is true But one thing I do know is that, whenever they do reopen, working parents will not only give the most massive sigh of relief, they will all be thanking their children’s teachers profusely for everything that they do.We will all also be thanking doctors, nurses, all NHS employees, as well as bin men, cleaners, shop assistants and all the other key workers we have under-paid and taken for granted.I really hope that is one thing which changes as a result of this pandemic.These people are the backbone of our country.To receive The Suns Coronavirus newsletterevery tea time, sign up here.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

One says that restrictions should be lted sooner rather than later to reboot our ecomony, while the other argues that the restrictions are working, so now is not the right time to lt them.When Chancellor Rishi Sunak first announced his bail-out plan last month, it was estimated that ten to  per cent of workers in the ­private sector would need Government support.Now economic forecasters believe it could be a third of the total private sector workforce. That will cost the British taxpayer between £billion and £billion every three months.To date, about a fth of small businesses have been pushed into bankruptcy. If the lockdown continues to July, that figure will rise to a third.The effect of this on the economy will be catastrophic. According to the ­Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, Britain’s GDP could contract by  per cent over the next two years. It shrank by six per cent during the global financial crisis of -.The Centre for Economics and Business Researchsays the lockdown is costing £.billion a day.Given we are now  days into the lockdown, this means we are already more than £billlion out of pocket.In short,we don’t ease off on the social distancing measures and re-boot the economy, we’re heading for the biggest economic downturn since the s.Against this, we are told thatwe end the lockdown more people will become infected, demand for critical hospital care will outstrip the NHS’s capacity and we’ll begin to see people dying in even greater numbers.I’m sceptical about that prognosis.It is based on the statistical modelling of Professor Neil Ferguson and his team at Imperial College, but there is mounting evidence that they under-estimated the percentage of the population already infected with coronavirus and over-estimated how deadly this disease is.According to Prof Ferguson’s model, fewer than five per cent of people have been infected. But according to another model, this one produced by Oxford University, it could be higher than  per cent, which would mean we are on our way to acquiring herd immunity.When Chris Whitty, England’s Chief Medical Officer, was asked at Thursday’s press conference what percentage of the world’s population has been infected, he put the figure at  per cent.If the true figure is between  and  per cent, the NHS can probably copewe ease off on some of the more extreme social distancing measures.Would ending the lockdown be ­gambling with people’s lives  Yes, but so will keeping it in place.Economic downturns cost lives, just as surely as viruses. During the global financial crisis of –, the suicide rate in Europe increased by . per cent. Economic recessions also cause a rise in poverty, domestic ­violence and murder.Philip Thomas, professor of risk ­management at Bristol University, has calculated thatour GDP falls by more than . per cent as a result of the lockdown, more years of le will be lost than saved.Politicians here and where have justied their cautious approach by ­saying they refuse to put a price on human le, as though the trade-off is between the lives of vulnerable people and economic growth.But the real trade-off is between the lives we might losewe end the ­lockdown tomorrow and the lives we know we will losewe keep it in place indefinitely.MPs aren’t being morally ­courageous. Rather, they’re just focusing on the next -hour news cycle, as they always do.What’s needed is a bold political leader who’s willing to risk some short-term pain to re-start the economy, thereby safeguarding all of our futures.I know of just such a person, but unfortunately he’s in hospital recovering from coronavirus.The Sun has launched an appeal to raise £MILLION for NHS workers.The Who Cares Wins Appeal aims to get vital support to staff in their hour of need.We have teamed up with NHS Charities Together in their urgent Covid- Appeal to ensure the money gets to exactly who needs it.The Sun is donating £, and we would like YOU to help us raise a million pounds, to help THEM.No matter how little you can spare, please donate today herewww.thesun whocareswinsappealThe UK government’s measures to contain the coronavirus epidemic are just starting to make a ­dference.And with the three-week lockdown under review tomorrow, now is NOT the time to lt them.After a slow and indecisive start, the measures they now have put in place, including recommendations to stay at home, limiting travel, physical ­distancing, banning large gatherings and shutting shops and pubs, are just starting to show signs that they are slowing the spread of the virus.This means that there are fewer new cases, with fewer people becoming seriously sick and less demand on hospital beds, intensive care and articial ventilation.This means that the pressure on health services is reduced, which, in turn, will lead to fewer deaths from Covid- and other causes.Without the actions that have been taken and just letting the epidemic run its course, we would be likely to see more than half the population infected, and an overwhelmed health system with maybe five million hospital admissions and at least , deaths.The measures that have been taken in the UK have been of moderate strength compared to other countries.In France and Spain, the lockdown has been more severe, while in Sweden it has been less strict.The coronavirus epidemic can be thought of like a fire.If we starve a fire of oxygen, then the flames will stop and it will die down.So it is with the epidemic — reduce transmission from person to person and the number of cases will go down.Butyou let the oxygen come back too early, any embers in the fire will light up again and it will restart.So,we relax the lockdown too early, while there is still transmission of the virus going on, then the epidemic will restart.And that means that we would have wasted the efforts we have made so far.When transmission has stopped, or is at low enough levels that it can be monitored and each case and their contacts identied, isolated and treated, then the lockdown can be relaxed.We have not yet reached the peak of the epidemic, and we do not yet have the infrastructure in place for the systematic testing that will be needed to identy new cases, so now is not the time to relax the lockdown measures.Some people have talked about the serious damage done to the economy by measures the Government has put in place and the social disruption these have caused, in order to protect the public health of the nation.They have argued the lockdown will cause more harm than good in the long term. This is a  dilemma.Every le matters. Each person lost is a family member, a friend, a neighbour, a human being.They are not a number on a spreadsheet.This lockdown is the only way for us to get back on our feet.If left uncontrolled, the coronavirus by itself will cause social and economic disruption as well as damaging public health.It doesn’t need any help from politicians.It is up to us all, for the sake of ourselves, our families and our loved ones, to follow the rules, and our solidarity will allow the country totowards normal as soon as possible.  Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Some are pushing for young people — less prone to serious illness from the virus — toto work first.But a sceptic remarked: “It’s the over-s with the money and experience who are the wealth creators. We need them back soon.”Without a game plan, there are fears that tough limits could still be in place this time next year.The First Secretary of State, Dominic Raab, has rightly said that there is a huge team spirit behind the Prime Minister, willing him on to get back to full health and back where he rightly belongs – leading the Government and our country from  Downing Street.It is important that the business of Government continues at pace during the Prime Minister’s temporary absence from the Downing Street tiller, eventhat is for some time. Decisions, even signicant and dficult decisions, must still be taken by the Cabinet as and when necessary.In this country, we have a system of Government where key decisions are taken by the Cabinet. It is, of course, true that the Prime Minister has signicant personal authority, especially where there is disagreement.However, while the Prime Minister is out of action, his authority will be exercised by Dominic Raab, the First Secretary of State, because he is the Prime Minister’s chosen deputy.Ministers, I am sure, will be very conscious of the fact that it was the Prime Minister who made that choice and he will expect it to be respected. I am sure the Prime Minister will not be amused to read about what has been going on in Cabinet committees in his Sunday newspapers.When the Prime Minister announced the current restrictions on  March, he said this would be reviewed after three weeks. The time for this review is next week.Given we are yet to reach the peak of the virus, I am quite sure that next week the Government will formally decide that the current restrictions will have to stay in place for another three weeks into May.The data on the number of new cases is starting to suggest that the current social distancing measures are working but continuing with them for another period is necessary to ensure we protect the NHS and save lives.That’s why people need to continue to stay at home over the Easter weekend, apart from the four allowed exceptions. Thinking about the future, we will only be able toto something like normal le once we have created a vaccine.This is likely to take somewhere between - months and so, in the meantime, we will need a recovery plan that continues to protect the health of the nation whilst allowing us to get the economy going again.The Government must work on that recovery plan at pace whilst it continues with the current restrictions and it must also be as open as possible with the public about what that plan will look like as and when the pieces are put into place. There are three reasons for this.First, whilst the vast majority of the population has been doing a fantastic job complying with the rules so far, the longer the restrictions are in place, the more likely we are to continue this level of compliancethe public can see the light at the end of the tunnel.Second, over the coming days and weeks, the many people in our country who are self-employed or who run larger companies are going to need to take decisions about the future of their businesses.So we need to give them as much information as we can, as soon as we can, about the future so they are prepared to take the calculated risks necessary to keep their businesses going. That’s vitally importantwe’re going to minimise the economic cost of defeating this virus.Finally, any recovery plan is likely to involve a signicant volume of testing, with contact tracing and perhaps the use of technology seen in countries like South Korea to ensure any resurgence of virus can be dealt with swtly.As we have seen from the challenges facing the Government on testing for NHS frontline staff, it takes time to get this capacity in place.We need to make sure than when the Government is confident that the evidence is in place to allow a relaxation of the current measures, our testing capability, and all that goes with it, is ready to be rolled out quickly.I am confident that the Cabinet, led by the First Secretary of State Dominic Raab in the Prime Minister’s absence, will continue working hard and making the necessary decisions when they need to be made so that the PM, upon histo health, can hit the ground running and, as the Prime Minister’s great hero Sir Winston Churchill would say, take “action this day”.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I have a hole in my heart and an enlarged heart. Whenever I get the flu or colds, it goes straight to my chest. Am I more vulnerable to coronavirus A. Yes. You are more vulnerable with any form of heart disease and you need to stay home, socially distance and wash your hands regularly.Q. I have a regular B injection. Am I more vulnerable A. Having regular vitamin B injections will not make you more vulnerable nor will any underlying medical condition, which has caused B deficiency.Q. How can you keep safe when going shopping A. Try to do it infrequently and don’t travel too far. If there is a queue stand two metres away from everyone  and keep your distance from the checkout. You can still be sociable and polite. Try to choose shops where the staff are wearing protective equipment. When you get home, throw away packaging and wash your hands. Q. Should I use antiseptic wipes on my food shop when I unpack A. Antiseptic wipes only have a very weak effect on bugs and germs on packaging. For cleaning the virus from surfaces you really need a chlorine-based cleaning product, such as bleach. For your hands, use a product containing rubbing alcohol of at least  per cent strength.Q. Is it safe to continue to take fluticasone nasal drops and nitro-furantoin capsules I have been prescribed  I am concerned they could weaken my immune system.A. While the nasal drops are steroids which reduce inflammation they only act locally. The nitrofurantoin anti- biotics will make no dference whatsoever. You should continue to use your medication as the benefits are far greater than the risks.The Sun has launched an appeal to raise £MILLION for NHS workers.The Who Cares Wins Appeal aims to get vital support to staff in their hour of need.We have teamed up with NHS Charities Together in their urgent Covid- Appeal to ensure the money gets to exactly who needs it.The Sun is donating £, and we would like YOU to help us raise a million pounds, to help THEM.No matter how little you can spare, please donate today herewww.thesun whocareswinsappealQ. My partner is terminally ill and I have diabetes. I am a key worker. Should I self-isolate for  weeks A. What awful decisions so many of us have to make. While your husband is in the high risk group, you are categorised in the vulnerable group and you should work from homeyou can and keep a physical distance from others.Key workers may continue to work under the current guidance but you need to take extra-special care of yourself. You could also ask your bossyou can work in a non public-facing role.Q. I work in the NHS in a child development centre. One of the nurses advised to shower and change my clothes at home because my husband has an autoimmune condition. Is this really necessary A. I think going to these s is unnecessary unless you are a healthcare professional exposed to high levels of risk, seeing potentially in-fected patients.If you are washing your hands regularly you will not be transmitting any virus from clothes or hair to your face this should be sufficient.Q. I’m , a diabetic on insulin and a key worker. Should I be working A. Diabetes puts you into the more vulnerable group being advised to work from homepossible. Key workers, however, are an exception and while you can still go to work it is worth askingyour role can be adapted so you are not in a public facing role.Practice very strict personal hygiene too. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The lionising of a Prime Minister thankfully released from hospital only adds insult to the terrible injury endured by families mourning lost loved ones. Deputising Dominic Raab boasting his boss is “a fighter” was grotesquely insensitive: thousands of husbands, wives, fathers, mothers, sons and daughters didn’t perish from lack of courage yet some almost certainly died who could’ve been saved. Justice and maintaining le demands we scrutinise Johnson’s errors, Britain’s toll of , deaths in hospitals alone a loss far greater than Germany’s under , in a larger population despite the coronavirus infecting both countries around the same moment. The warning from one of the Government’s most senior scientic advisers, Jeremy Farrar, that the UK’s likely to be among the European nations hit hardest, possibly even the worst, surpassing Italy, France and Spain, is a brutal condemnation of a PM slow to act. Failing to prioritise tests, masks and ventilators cost lives, probably including NHS workers. Johnson’s boast at the beginning on March  he was shaking hands with everyone in a hospital, lying it had coronavirus patients, was the blasé recklessness of a politician more worried a lockdown might damage his popularity than doing what was right.

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor more information on how we use your data and your data protection rights.Thank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee ourprivacy noticeInvalid EmailIt was on a trip to India that Nav Sawhney was first inspired to come up with a creation to help women in poverty.The -year-old engineering student was on a placement in the rural village of Kallipalayam, which had limited access to water and electricity. Every day he would pass his next-door neighbour Divya, and see her hunched over a bucket, scrubbing clothes. ‘I walked past this woman’s house every day, and every day she was washing clothes,’ Nav says. ‘We got chatting and she told me how her back hurt and she showed me the rash on her hands. I thought there must be something I could do, and set my mind to finding a solution.’ A modern washing machine was out of the question for Divya, , who does not have regular electricity, so Nav knew he’d have to be creative. He says, ‘Seventy per cent of the world’s population doesn’t have access to an electric washing machine… I realisedI could make a low-cost washing machine for Divya, which she could operate by turning a crank, it would save her so much time. That’s time that could be spent pursuing an education or paid work.’ Divya became a good friend of Nav’s while he was in the village, and she was over the moon when he told her his plan. ‘Her eyes lit up,’ he says. She loved it.’ Watching the mum-of-two struggling reminded Nav of his own childhood growing up in London. Nav’s dad Avtar died suddenly from heart failure when Nav was eight, leaving his mum Mohini, now , to care for three young children. ‘I remember Mum toiling away all day,’ he recalls. ‘As soon as she came home from her job in the civil service, there was cooking, cleaning and laundry to do. My siblings and I would try and help out around the house, but we were only young.’  Nav had always had an inquisitive mind and, growing up, he would take kitchen appliances apart and try to put them back together again. ‘Dad was an engineer too, and he’d encourage me to figure out how things worked,’ he remembers. ‘It would drive Mum nuts, but I was fascinated by the mechanics behind the gadgets.’ Nav went on to study engineering at Queen Mary University of London, and later joined Engineers Without Borders UK, which encourages people to find solutions to the hardships of people all around the world. It was through Engineers Without Borders that he met Divya and came up with the idea of building the hand-crank washing machine. He formed a team of specialists and put his head together with fellow engineers, anthropologists and data scientists, and they created a prototype. The prototype was then trialled at the Response Innovation Lab in Iraq, led by Oxfam, which provides funding for new innovations that improve poor people’s lives.  In , as part of his research for the washing machine, Nav visited Iraq and met families living in camps in Iraqi Kurdistan in the north of the country. ‘People have been through so much hardship,’ he says. ‘I sat with families in their tents and often there was a father or a brother or an uncle missing, taken away by ISIS and never seen again.’ Nav spent time learning what families’ needs were, and carried out research which showed that women were spending as long as  hours a week washing clothes. ‘The average size of a family in a camp is nine, with half being under the age of five – so lots of dirty clothes, lots of washing to be done. We took this all into account people wanted drums with a bigger capacity and they didn’t want to bend down. They didn’t want interaction with soap because it caused rashes. They wanted it to be light and portable. We incorporated all that into our design.’  Nav and his team created a washing machine from wood and plastic costing just £. The machine, which Nav named after Divya, has a drum capacity of kg but only uses  litres of water per cycle, as opposed to the  litres used by the average electric washing machine. ‘We believe that using the washing machine, women could wash the same amount of clothes in  minutes instead of  hours! Can you imagineyou gave back  hours to Divya, what she could do with her time  She could have the power to do whatever she wants,’ he says. In February,  washing machines were distributed by Oxfam to refugee camps in Mosul as a pilot project. ‘I think the burden placed on women is so unfair, so seeing that first-hand at home with Mum and then trying to be able to equalise that in some way is something I’m really passionate about.  aposMy mother is really proud of me, she’s my biggest supporter. She is what drives me. I see her struggles in other women’s struggles.’ And Nav’s dad, who was an engineer, would have been proud too. ‘During the Partition of India in , he became a refugee after fleeing his home with nothing but the clothes on his back. It’s up to us to help people along the journey and the refugees that I’ve met in Iraq have had it the worst. aposUnimaginable things have happened to them, things that are really hard to fathom. Becoming a refugee can happen to anyone,’ he says. ‘We’re put on this planet for a short period of time, and our impact on other people’s lives is what matters the most. It’s up to everyone around the world to help.’ "},{"url":null,"title":"mum shares coronavirus cooking tips","story":"NewsMum shares coronavirus cooking tips after feeding family-of-four on WW rationsAs coronavirus makes us obsess about food stockpiling, Claud Fullwood explains what it was like to live on Second World War rations for Lent with her young familyShareCommentsByChristine Smith:,  APR NewsClaud Fullwood makes a box of food like this last all week \" to FREE email alerts from Mirror - The Coronavirus BriefingSubscribeWe will use your email address to send you newsletters.

In her own words she tells us how she managed to do it... I was working on a hunger campaign for CAFOD, a religious charity, and I wanted to do something to help. I’d also been watching a wartime farm TV programme and, mindful that there were so many food shortages around the world, the idea came to me to live off Second World War rations for Lent, rather than simply giving up chocolate, as I do every year. The war rations were basic – British seasonal vegetables, fruit, potatoes and bread , as well as fish . A set number of rationed items – like g of meat per week – were also included. And people were given  points a month on top of that to buy other items, including tinned tomatoes. I knew it was going to be tough, but I was determined to complete it. I decided the first thing I would do was start up a blog and invite everyone to share their ideas. I also reached out to family members who had lived through the war to hear their stories and the importance of stretching everything out. Like most of us in the modern day, I’d grown very used to the fact food was available  . I was on a good salary in London and I tended to pick up a bacon sandwich at the station for breakfast, and I’d either have a meal with work colleagues or grab a baguette for lunch. If ever I ran out of anything at home, I knew I could pop out to get the ingredients.  Potatoes were plentul in the wartime rations and I knew I would have to incorporate them a lot in my own food plan. And so for breakfast I’d either have fadgeor porridge mixed with water. Lunch was homemade vegetable soup – obviously including potatoes – or a small amount of cheese, which I’d grate onto soda bread I’d make using a recipe given to me by my lovely gran. For dinner, I’d have a stew, pasty or shepherd’s pie packed with vegetables, a tiny bit of meat and more potatoes. In February March, there are a lot of root vegetables around, but not many juicy fruits like oranges, so I just used to eat apples as a snack or dessert. It was also important that I stuck to the strict rules of only eating British seasonal fruit, given that is what would have been available in the war. Breakfast Irish potato cake or porridge Lunch Soda bread with a bit of cheese or homemade vegetable soup Dinner Meat and vegetable stew, homity pie or shepherd’s pie Snacks dessert Apples Ration tips to make your meals go further – Grate cheese onto a sandwich rather than cutting it – Use a non-stick pan to avoid using lots of oil– Don’t use meat and cheese in the same dish– Make stock from your chicken carcass– Make potato rosti from uneaten roast potatoes– Never throw any leftover food away. You can always add a fresh ingredient the next day Week two also went OK, but by the halfway point everything was starting to get boring and repetitive. The war rations were nutritional, but very samey and I got sick of the sight of potatoes – something I never thought would happen. And I wish I’d known more about seasonal eating. There’s actually a lot of food available, even in the winter, which I just wasn’t aware of. One of my lowest points was when I just couldn’t face dinner one evening. I’d spent my points on a tin of Spam, which was  points. The whole point of the challenge was to not waste food, but I simply couldn’t face eating it! Thankfully, I had just enough points left to get some raisins instead, but I felt very flat. There were other times when I couldn’t face eating the same meal – and that was a challenge, along with issues like not planning properly and running out of things.  I also found socialising and eating out limiting. I only went out twice over the whole period and I had fish and chips on each occasion, as it was the only meal I could think of that guaranteed I wasn’t cheating! But that said, people were very kind and they would meet me for a cup of tea instead of a drink after work, or we would take our lunch and eat it outside, or they’d come to my house. People did still drink in the war, so I was sensible and had one each time I went out to eat. A gin and tonic. The foods I missed most were eggs and oranges. I avoided making desserts, as I didn’t know what to make without eggs. I also found myself longing for something juicy, so I really found it dficult not being able to have any citrus fruit. Bizarrely, despite being bored I felt healthy. It was all aimed to be nutritional. For an average, non-pregnant adult, the weekly rationed foods in  were:  pints of milk g meat, -g cheeseg bacon ham g tea g sugar g butter g cooking fat Plus  egg per month Non-rationed foods Vegetables, bread, oats, pearl barley, wheat, rye, fish Points system food Other food was rationed on a points system, subject to availability. Adults received  points a month for these foods : – British tinned fruit  points per g – Cereals  points per lb – Crackers  points per lb – Dried fruit  points per lb – Rice pasta  points per lb – Tinned tomatoes  points per lb Weirdly, I found the food I had the most of at the end of each week was sugar. I didn’t bake, and I only used a bit on porridge. As the challenge drew to an end, although I was very bored of eating the same food over and over, it felt amazing to know I’d managed to stick to the challenge for  days. I’d also lost about half a stone in the process. To celebrate on Easter Sunday, the first thing I did was tuck into eggs and oranges! I wasn’t interested in chocolate at all. The experience was an inspiring one. Not only did it open up so many new connections with amazing people who offered tips along the way, but I also learnt so much. It taught me how wasteful I’d been, and I became a lot more conscious of what I was throwing away and putting in the shopping trolley. It taught me how to rotate my fridge to make sure I used the food that was going out of date first, and to not always go by the sell-by date.  You can’t mess around with chicken or prawns, but you can look at your potatoes or carrots to seethey have gone off, rather than going by labels. The lasting effect of the challenge has been that we now live off a third of what we used to and we’ve continued to use many of the tricks I learnt. We have potluck dinners at the end of the week where we eat whatever is in the fridge, and we’ll adapt a recipewe don’t have everything we need in the cupboard. Not surprisingly, these tricks have proved very useful over the last few weeks during the lockdown. And just like the rations, it is about being adaptable.

Temperatures rocketed to C in some parts on Saturday and Sunday, as the government urged people to stay indoors over the bank holiday weekend. However, this didnapost stop some flocking to parks and beaches, with pictures showing police moving sunbathers on. And even those who were carrying out their permitted exercise struggled to maintain proper social distancing on pathways and in parks. In Brighton, officers were seen patrolling the beach, with a group of men being moved away on Sunday afternoon. A scuba er was even caught fishing under Brighton Pier on Saturday night. Elsewhere, Royal Parks in London were used by sunseekers, including Battersea Park, where a sunbather took advantage of the weather by relaxing on the grass.Police were seen breaking up groups of people at Primrose Hill on Saturday, with officers on horses seen talking to a man in Victoria Park.Officers blew the whistle on ridiculous excuses given for breaking coronavirus lockdown rules which have included shopping for a trampoline and Pokemon hunting. One family said they were playing Pokemon Go when quizzed by officers at a West Midlands park in Coventry. Other excuses revealed by the force include one person quizzed as they searched through a hedgerow, who said they were aposlooking for wild rocketapos and another who said they were going to their allotment to aposget a caullowerapos. Drivers in Wales also gave officers daft excuses for their supposed essential journeys such as buying gravy granules and a trampoline. Queues were spotted on Brighton seafront outside an ice cream kiosk in the popular seaside resort as UK temperatures hit C on Good Friday.Elsewhere in the country runners, walkers and cyclists were seen filling crowded pathways in Windsor Great Park, with little apparent regard for social distancing guidance. Meanwhile a family who drove from London to Devon to go fishing during lockdown were kicked out of the county and slapped with fines. The flouting family were located in Torquay in the early hours of Sunday morning after travelling from the capital overnight. Lockdown rebels were even chased away by police after throwing a house party. Almost two dozen officers and four paramedics were called to the mass gathering where selfish partygoers were chased away and asked tohome. A sea of police cars and an ambulance filled the residential street after the party kicked off at around pm on Saturday in Stockton, Durham.Onlookers were ordered toto their homes as the party was broken up,  Teesside Live  reports. It comes as the UKaposs official coronavirus death toll soared above , after  more deaths were reported in England, as well as  in Scotland,  in Wales and  in Northern Ireland. Temperatures are set to plunge from C on Good Friday, officially the hottest day of the year so far, to an average of C on Easter Monday. And some parts of the UK will struggle to reach double figures, forecasters predict.

One wrote beneath the song on YouTube: “Hahahah, whoever did this on Meghan and Harry’s website is a genius.”And a  Twitter  user called Violet added: “Meghan and Harry leave the UK to raise their son in privacy.No, we aren’t going to launch a foundation. Two weeks later they announce Archewell Foundation. “If you type Archewellfoundation YouTube plays Golddigger. Hilarious.”Trolls have also been at it on Instagram too, setting up numerous accounts which Harry and Meghan could set up under their new venture.The handle aposarchewellapos has been taken by a person who has published just one image of a block of turquoise. The accounts ‘archewellglobal’ and “archewell.global” have also been snapped up.  It appears to be part of the latest desperate bid by the anti Megan brigade who are seeking “revenge” for her and Harry quitting the Royal Family. And the trolls who have taken over the website domain appear intent on Harry ing to his former le. The couple officially stepped down as senior royals on March  as they upped sticks from their rented mansion in Canada and moved to Los Angeles, Calornia.

TV’s Paul McKenna has invaluable advice on how to cope. Over the next three days he will provide techniques and guidance on dealing with stress, sleeping and relationships. Controlling stress and reducing anxiety Stress is caused by the fight or flight mechanism, which we inherited from our ancestors and was there to fight a wild animal or run away. Unfortunately, this gets triggered any time we perceive a threat and with everything that’s going on in the world right now, it’s easy to become anxious about our health, the health of our loved ones, the economy and our future. The point of fear-based emotions such as stress is to prepare us for emergencies, which is positive, however, when we trigger the stress response many times a day, we begin to live in world of stress with too much adrenaline and lactic acid, which make us feel fatigued and weakens our immune system. So, positive stress is being prepared for emergencies and negative stress is when we overprepare and weaken ourselves. The following techniques when practised regularly can signicantly reduce our stress levels for better health and well-being. HeartMath The Institute of HeartMath was set up in the early s to further study the role of the physical heart in health and well-being. Their work and its applications have become so successful that their stress management programmes have been taken up around the world, including by all four branches of the US military. What they discovered was that focusing on the physical heart measurably reduced the presence of stress hormones, increased DHEA and other anti-aging hormone levels, and enabled peak performance in a iety of situations. The basic idea is that when you sht your attention from your head to your heart, your body relaxes, your mind gets clearer, and your brain releases the positive chemical changes of natural relaxation. You can use the following exercise any time you are experiencing a stressful feeling in your body or an overly busy mind. It will help you to feel better almost immediately – usually in less than a minute. In addition, you may get insights into actions you can take to make things more the way you want them... The more you practise this exercise, the easier it becomes to interrupt the stress response, even in the midst of the chaos of daily le. It will help you to reconnect with a feeling of relaxed alertness and emotional equilibrium by getting you out of your head and in touch with your common sense and deeper wisdom. From Head to Heart  Become aware you are having a stressful feeling in your body or that your mind is racing.  Put your hand on your heart and focus your energy into this area. Take at least three slow and gentle breaths into your heart, maintaining your focus on the feeling of your hand in the centre of your chest.  Now, recall a time when you felt really, really good - a time you felt love, joy, or real happiness! Return to that memory asyou are back there again right now. See what you saw, hear what you heard, and feel how good you felt.  As you feel this good feeling in your body, imagine your heart could speak to you. Ask your heart how you could take better care of yourself in this moment and in this situation.  Listen to what your heart says in answer to your question and act on it as soon as you can. Havening Therapy Havening Therapy was created by my friend Dr Ronald Ruden. Scientic studies have shown that it is amazingly effective at relieving sadness and reducing stress, trauma and compulsion.Havening has been hailed as a remarkable breakthrough and recently Justin Bieber has endorsed it.Patterns of repeated touch to parts of the body combined with specic eye movements and visualisations have a rapid, reliable and predictable effect on our feelings. Years of research have created a signicant advance in what is known as “psychosensory therapy”. The patterns of touch used in Havening are what enable a mother to comfort her baby and they are hard-wired into every infant. Havening combines these deep-rooted patterns of reassurance and comfort with sequences to break down the associations that triggered unhappy feelings. We can now reduce the intensity of an emotion or feeling and establish calm, robust relaxation. Studies have shown that when we use the Havening technique, we reduce stress chemicals in our body and produce states of relaxation and calm. Over time, we can also change the way our brain processes thoughts and feelings. A safe haven You should practise this sequence of eye movements, body touches and visualisations several times until you know it off by heart. Then you will be able to use it anytime you need to get rid of unhappy feelings.  Notice how much unhappiness or sadness you feel and rate it on a scale of -. This is important as it lets you measure how much you reduce it.   Now clear your mind, or just think about something nice.  Now cross your arms, place your hands on the tops of your shoulders and close your eyes.  Now stroke your hands down the sides of your arms from your shoulders to your elbows, down and up, again and again.  As you carry on stroking the sides of your arms imagine you are walking on a beautul beach, with each footstep in the sand count out loud from  to  with each step that you take.  Now, keep stroking the sides of your arms and open your eyes, but keep your head still.  Now, while you keep stroking your arms, move your eyes laterally to the left and laterally to the right,  times.  Close your eyes and stroke the sides of your arms while you imagine walking down a flight of stairs and count out loud with each footstep.  Now open your eyes and check, on your scale from  to , the number of the feeling now. If it is way down the bottom, congratulations - you have personally changed your own feeling state. If you think that the unhappy feeling is not yet reduced enough, just repeat the Havening sequence until it is reduced as far as you want.

While things will be a dferent this year, with coronavirus stopping them from being together, the familyaposs normal celebrations are very traditional. The Queen invites her loved ones to the castle for the long weekend, during which they spend quality time together, go to church and enjoy a lot of good food. Former royal chef Darren McGrady believes that Covid- restrictions wonapost mean standards slip as the Monarch and her husband Prince Philip sit down for a much quieter Easter. He told OK! magazine “Even though she’s self-isolating, she’s at her happy place and she can go for walks in Home Park unbothered by her protection officers. I don’t think the big kitchen will be open this year as there’s no need for it. There will be minimal staff on duty so they’ll use the small kitchen. “Although it’ll be pretty much the two of them eating together, they won’t have TV dinners on lap trays. They’ll still be served at the table as always. Heaposs shared some of the secrets from his time cooking Easter dinner for the Queen and her relatives.  Food Meal times are a big deal at the castle over Easter weekend, and they enjoy a lot of delicious meals. On Friday night they tuck into a traditional fish dinner, which always goes down a treat. After church on Sunday, the family sit down to a four-course roast dinner. Darren says: We’d go straight into the main course – a traditional roast lamb with seasonal vegetables. The Queen likes her meat well done so she’d always have the first two slices.  They’d also have a compound salad served in a kidney dish attached to the plate – just some lettuce and cucumber with a little mint or some grated carrot and coriander. The family also have their cheese with lunch, rather than dinner, with the Queen being particularly fond of the fresh Windsor Cheese made specially at the Windsor Dairy. Darren said: The most incredible sweet white Windsor peaches grew on the estate too in my day. We’d have to lock them away in the kitchens because everyone wanted to taste them. The Queen always looked forward to those but she’d have to wait until they were in season.  The family like to eat food which is in season, and Darren says the Queen would put a really thick line through the menushe didnapost think something was right for the time of year. Chocolate The Royal Family - and the Queen - love chocolate. According to Darren, his old boss gives it up every year for lent so tucks into a good portion on Easter Sunday. Sheaposs particularly partial to dark chocolate and her favourites are Bendicks Bittermints. But the chefs at Windsor make their own Easter eggs, which are decorated with sugared flowers for the adult and fun designs for the children.  Alcohol They booze is flowing at Windsor on Easter, with everyone coming together for pre-lunch drinks. Darren said: The Queen would usually refrain, and save her habitual Gin and dubonnet until the evening.

Temperatures peaked at  degrees in London,  degrees in Norwich and  in Manchester. But the afternoon saw the North, the Midlands, Wales and parts of Scotland and Northern Ireland suffer downpours and thunderstorms. Monday will bring a sharp drop in temperatures, with the mercury set to plunge to around  degrees in the capital, Manchester and Birmingham.But the Met Office said temperatures will begin climbing again from Tuesday with “lots of blue skies and sunshine”.And thermometers will nudge towards the high teens on Wednesday. Emma Salter, forecaster for the Met Office, said: “From Monday onwards, there’ll be a cooler area of high pressure, generally fine and dry but certainly much cooler than it has been with top temperatures on Monday for central London expected to reach just C. “On Thursday, there will be a band of rain sweeping up, affecting southern parts of the UK. It will be warmer across the country, with temperatures back up to the low s. “We expect Friday to be cloudy on the whole, with heavy showers across the south.” The middle of the week is expected to dry and mainly sunny but with cold mornings to deal with. BBC meteorologist Sarah Keith-Lucas said the nation will wake up to a “touch of frost first thing on Easter Monday”. She added: ”[Easter Monday] will be a much colder day across the board. We have a brisk, northerly wind, some places reaching up to mph. “Temperatures will range between C and C as the east coast bears the brunt of the cold front.” "},{"url":null,"title":"woman out shopping vulnerable friend","story":"NewsWoman out shopping for vulnerable friend finds nasty coronavirus note on her carSarah Crosland from Leeds took to social media to share her thoughts on ‘how not to be too judgemental’ after she was accused of breaking lockdown rules in MorleyShareCommentsByRobert Sutclfe:,  APR Updated:,  APR NewsSarah Crossland, was delivering some food shopping and ed to her car to find a mean note \" to FREE email alerts from Mirror - The Coronavirus BriefingSubscribeWe will use your email address to send you newsletters.

A recent survey by SilentNight revealed one in five of us sleep on pillows so dirty that a quarter of their weight is made up of dead skin cells and dust mites - gross. And, according to the research, one fth of us havenapost washed our pillows in five years. Five years! But how do we know how often we should wash them Dr Lisa Ackerley, also known as The Hygiene Doctor says a lot of people who suffer from runny noses or coughs do not know that dust mites can be the cause - and they can even cause asthma and eczema.Lisa explains how often we should wash our household items to ensure theyaposre not the cause of any potential illnesses and to stop the spread of germs. Pillows You should be cleaning your pillows every six months to a year. Nobody likes the idea of sleeping on dead skin cells, dust mites and whatever  might be hiding in our pillows. Simply pop them in your washing machine to clean, or, invest in some pillow protectors that are much easier to wash more frequently.  Duvet Wash your duvet twice per year. Some people might have dferent tog duvetaposs depending on what season weaposre in, but others who stick to just the one duvet, will need to be more aware of the dust mites that can build up over time. Since itaposs unlikely that your mattress will fit into your washing machine youaposll need to take it to a launderette for a professional clean.  Mattress Your mattress should be cleaned every single month - which is much more often than we realised. Whilst using your vacuum cleaner, gets rid of most of the dust mites than can be found lurking there - but for optimum results you should flip it over every month too. You can also use a mattress protector which you can wash alongside your bed sheets every week.  Dressing Gown For people who live in their dressing gowns, they may be surprised to know that it should be washed every week. This does depend on how often you wear it and what you wear underneath it. If you wear long-sleeved pyjamas you might not need to wash it as often, compared toyou wear less and wear it every day.  Slippers These should be washed alongside your dressing gown - weekly. Slippers are a breeding ground for germs since they get pretty warm after wearing them for prolonged periods of time. If you can, pop your slippers in the washing machine, but,you canapost you can also spritz on some disinfectant. A spray like Dettol will help get rid of any germs or infections like athleteaposs foot.  Shower Curtain The best idea is to have two shower curtains that you can swap in and out when you wash the dirty one. But after washing make sure not to try and dry it after use as itaposll get mouldy. And trying to rid it of mould is incredibly dficult. Pop it into your washing machine - you can add a few of your dirty towels too - and put on a gently wash with half a cup of vinegar and half a cup of baking soda.  Washing-Up Sponge Your washing-up sponge should be washed daily. You can either put them in the dishwasher or your washing machine at  degrees. Or, after boiling a kettle pop it in a bowl with the water and some laundry detergent. And make sure theyaposre completely dry or  theyaposll go mouldy too.

Out come the burgers, hot dogs, sausages, chicken legs, fish and tasty char-grilled veg, all cooked in the sunshine. Most homes have a designated BBQ chef, who has their own special way of cooking outside - but Gordon Ramsay says theyaposre doing it all wrong. And since he owns a burger restaurant in Las Vegas he obviously knows what heaposs talking about. In a video viewed more than million times, Gordon explains not only how to make the perfect patty but all of the most common mistakes we make and how to avoid them. Gordon said: This is one of my most desired burgers, one of my favourite burgers and then goes on to mention that this burger is on sale at his burger restaurant in Planet Hollywood, Las Vegas, and is known as the F-Word burger. Use dferent meats Gordon explains that the secret behind a perfect burger is a mixture of dferent quality meats. He uses chuck, as well as ground beef and brisket. Preparation is key Gordon generously seasons the meat with salt and pepper and binds it altogether using a touch of egg. He says you canapost season the burgers after theyaposre cooked so he makes sure to roll the seasoning around the edge of the burger too. But says this should be done the day beforepossible, then you need to set them in the fridge so they stay nice and firm and donapost fall apart on the grill. And when it comes to cooking the bruegrs, donapost put them straight onto the heat from the fridge because then theyaposll be dry on the outside and raw in the middle. Drizzle a little olive oil onto them too - he uses grapeseed oil.  Put the BBQ lid down When you place the burgers onto the grill it should be piping hot and you should place them onto the hottest part - which is usually two thirds of the way up. When youaposve placed the burgers on the grill Gordon explains: The secret is to move it as less as possible. The more you move it, the more chance youaposve got of breaking the burger. Make sure to put the BBQ lid down once your burgers are in as this incorporates the heat, and gets a great sear on the bottom, so when we come to turn those burgers they donapost stick. How many times have you stuck burgers on the grill and wondered why itaposs sticking  Nicely oiled, quick sear and put that lid down - itaposs really important.  Toasting the buns Once the burgers are cooking the next step is to toast the buns. Gordon says We toast the buns because thereaposs nothing worse than a soggy bun. Toasting the bun makes them nice and crisp, and it protects the burger. He seasons the buns with salt, pepper and a drizzle of oil, before putting them on the grill and closing the lid again. And even toasts the tops of the bun too.  Get set up Gordon ensures that the rest of his ingredients are prepped, ready for when the burgers are cooked - they only take three to four minutes each side to cook completely. Tomatoes and lettuce are chopped, and the onions are on the grill cooking. He said: This is a really important tip. Why  It stops the burgers going cold - you want to at it when itaposs piping hot.  Adding butter Approximately two minutes before the burgers are ready to come off, Gordon adds butter. Gordon says: “Now at my burger restaurant in Las Vegas, we baste the burgers with Devonshire butter. “Today, we’re going to lightly brush a bit of butter onto the burgers. “With that flame underneath, it caramelises the butter and puts this wonderful flavour on top. “It makes the burgers so tasty.” He also suggests making a red-wine butter or a chipotle butteryou want to be even more chefy. And lightly season them again with salt and pepper.

Wuhan-based virologist Shi Zhengli is one of the worldaposs top researchers on coronaviruses and has discovered dozens of deadly SARS-like viruses in bat caves. She studied samples taken from some of the first people to become infected with the new and then-mysterious respiratory illness in China in December and found it was similar to SARS. It was identied as a novel coronavirus and within three days she completed its gene sequencing, finding that it was  per cent identical to a virus found in horseshoe bats in Yunnan. But she was muzzled and her team was ordered not to reveal any information about the new disease, which was already spreading rapidly as China kept the world in the dark. Have you been affected by coronavirus  Email webnews@mirror. The claims are the latest to emerge after a cover-up by Chinese authorities who failed to share information or issue warnings early on and, ultimately, contain a virus that emerged in Wuhan and then spread around the world, leading to tens of thousands of deaths and more than a million confirmed infections. Chinese journalist Gao Yu said he spoke to Shi during his incarceration in Wuhan, which was locked down for more than two months, and she told him her findings were hushed up, the Mail on Sunday reported. The journalist added: We learned later her institute finished gene-sequencing and related tests as early as January  but was muzzled. The information about gene sequencing wasnapost made public until a week later.  The day that the genetic information was mapped, Yanyi Wang, director of the Wuhan Institute of Virology, ordered staff not to reveal any information about the disease, it is claimed. After local doctors were detained for warning locals about the virus, the director claimed inappropriate and inaccurate information was causing general panic. She ordered staff not to post any information on social media or speak to the media.  Just over a week later, a team in Shanghai published a sequence on an open access  after studying samples from an infected patient. Their laboratory was shut for rectication two days later. One of the earliest Covid- cases emerged in mid-December when a patient, who worked at a wildle market in Wuhan that became the early epicentre of the outbreak, was hospitalised with a double lung infection in the city in central China.The usual treatment for flu-like illness failed to work and new cases soon emerged. On December , Wuhan health officials were told that the illness was being caused by a new coronavirus. Three days later, at least two doctors from Wuhan - Li Wenliang and Ai Fen - shared information about the new virus on the social network WeChat. Li, a whistleblower who was warned by police to stop making  comments, died in February after contracting the virus.Ai is missing after giving media interviews criticising Chinaaposs censorship and hospital authorities for suppressing early warnings of the outbreak. She told the Chinese magazine, Renwu, or People, that she was reprimanded after alerting her bosses and colleagues of the new virus in December. On  December, she received the laboratory results of one case which stated: SARS coronavirus. The next day, Wuhan officials confirmed almost  cases, shut down the wildle market and notied the World Health Organisationaposs local office about the mysterious illness.  New cases continued to emerge and the outbreak was spreading outside of China, but for a week in January health officials in Wuhan insisted they had not received any new patients. During that time, the first known case outside of China was detected in Thailand and a case was reported in the US as infected people left Wuhan and surrounding Hubei province to travel across the country and around the world. Chinese authorities insisted they hadnapost seen any clear evidence that the virus could be spread from human to human. By then they had lost control and hospitals were becoming overwhelmed by the rising number of infected patients. Within days Dr Zhong Nanshan, the countryaposs top respiratory expert and the face of its containment effort, revealed that human transmission was taking place. Wuhan and several other cities struggling to contain the virus went into lockdown on January , days before the Lunar New Year holiday, but by then millions of people had left without being screened. That day, Shi Zhengli and her research team published their data identying the illness on a scientic portal before it was published in February by the medical journal Nature. In the weeks that followed the lockdown in Wuhan, the virus rapidly spread to and within other countries due to imported cases and community transmission. Throughout the outbreak, China has been accused of underreporting its total number of infections.

Gloria also developed a fever and tests confirmed she had coronavirus. She said: “It was terrible, I was sick, I wasn’t breathing.” At first Gloria went to hospital in Alba but then she was moved to Cueno. She was very ill for about six days before she began to feel better, when it became harder to be apart from her family and new baby. She said she spoke to her family every day on video calls, and her older daughter Olivia had started to give her kisses through the screen. Gloria said not being able to hug her daughter was “excruciating”.

There were at least  ambulances queueing to deliver patients for treatment in one video as the Kremlin said Moscow’s hospitals were in “emergency mode”. One long line was outside a hospital in Khimki, close to Moscow’s main Sheremetyevo airport. Another was seen at Hospital No. for war veterans in Losinoostrovskoy district. In a video filmed by a resident from his window opposite the Khimki hospital, the man says: “All these [ambulances] are driving coronavirus [patients]. “Thataposs the hospital opposite my window. “And this is the line of ambulances. “Just think about it, every patient needs to be admitted. That takes about  minutes per patient. “So many ambulances… “…this is the end…” One Telegram channel, Mosnow, said the hospitals “cannot handle” the flow of ambulances.  “Ambulances are spending hours driving between hospitals. “It looks like there are no places everywhere already.” The report said “dozens of ambulances with patients are waiting to be admitted” to hospitals. The “majority” have symptoms matching coronavirus. Newspaper Komsomolskaya Pravda was told by a hospital official: “Due to the dficult epidemiological situation, the flow of patients has really increased in recent days. “All patients will be placed in hospital and will receive the necessary medical care.” The figure of confirmed cases in Moscow soared today by , to ,,  per cent of all registered cases in the country.  Russia has more than , COVID- confirmed cases, with  deaths. But there are suggestions that the total does not tell the full grim story in the capital. Vladimir Putin’s spokesman today conceded that the capital’s hospital’s faced an aposextremelyapos dficult situation with the pandemic. “Moscow’s hospitals are in emergency mode,” he said, adding that St Petersburg was also hit by a rise in cases.  The spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Putin’s health was “excellent” despite meeting a senior doctor who had contracted coronavirus. He claimed Putin’s early action had saved Russia from the high numbers seen in other European countries. But he conceded it would only be known in two weeks whether the country had reached it peak. On Friday deputy Moscow mayor Anastasia Rakova said: Along with the growing numbers of people who are seriously ill, pressure has grown sharply on the capitalaposs health service. “Our inpatient facilities and ambulance service are now working at their limits.” Meanwhile mayor Sergei Sobyanin said worse was to come. I can tell you for sure, there hasnapost been any peak yet,” he said. “We are more in the foothills of this peak, not even in the middle…”  He urged hospitals: We have a time lag so we can prepare better for the blow that is coming our way.” Peskov said Russiaaposs aim was the emulate Germany rather than other European countries. Russia is preparing to open a brand new emergency coronavirus hospital within days, built from scratch on a greenfield site in less than one month. The new £ million clinic in Moscow has been built by ,-plus construction workers deployed round the clock. It is the largest of some  new-build hospitals now being erected across Russia to deal with the Covid- crisis, and the only one not constructed by the army. Almost half the beds in the new Moscow clinic will be in intensive care units.

Scientists say it is highly likely that Covid- first came from bats, but first passed through an intermediary animal before jumping to humans.Follow the latest coronavirus updates hereIt is widely believed that the flu-like virus first began infecting humans in late  after being transmitted from an animal at the Huanan seafood market. However, UK government sources have told the Mail on Sunday that while the balance of scientic advice is still behind the animal market theory, an accident at the lab is no longer being discounted. The experiments, which relate to the origin of coronaviruses, are said to have been paid for by a .m grant from the US government. Funded by the US National Institutes of Health, the results of the research were published in November  under the heading: Discovery of a rich gene pool of bat SARS-related coronaviruses provides new insights into the origin of SARS coronavirus. Scientists are uncertain about several aspects of the origin of Covid-, with fresh doubts also arising last week following research by Cao Bin, a doctor at the Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital, which found that  of the first  diagnosed patients had not had any contact with the market. However, responding to the claims, the Chinese Embassy has described speculation around the labaposs activities as hasty and reckless allegations.

There are only two people amongst the shops and surgeries that call me by my actual name. When I come back after a week#s holiday a lot of them say, #oh we#re glad to see you back Mo.# I just love it.#The Monieth resident, who works Monday to Friday from around am to pm, has always gone above and beyond in her role.#The customers used to come in and say #I want Maureen to serve me.

This has been dficult to accept.“The SPFL board and executive freely admit that they focused on the sporting merit of the proposal and did not take into consideration any financial fall out to their member clubs.“Fundamentally, we believe that in these exceptional and uncertain times, no member club should be worse off as a result of this proposal than they are today.“The current proposal will see member clubs cumulatively have in the region of £.-£ million pounds of lost revenue.“Amongst the member clubs there have been numerous discussions of the SPFL’s offer as well as viable, equitable proposed alternatives that could see, potentially, a neutral outcome for all clubs involvedthe season cannot be finished.“In all cases, current placement monies could be distributed to the member clubs in very short order while maintaining all SPFL obligations.“Make no mistake we would have to work quickly and diligently to ensure that members’ current needs are met and that the democratic process is followed, but it is achievable.”An SPFL spokesperson added: “It is very important that clubs consider carefully the resolution and we are grateful to those clubs who have voted already.“With the Ladbrokes Premiership and Ladbrokes Leagues One and Two isions each having approved the resolution, we await the voting slip from the one Ladbrokes Championship club that has yet to vote.“We will provide an update as soon as we are in a position to do so.”The SPFL set an initial deadline of pm for clubs to vote.However it is understood league rules give members  days to vote on resolutions – and Dundee are keen to weigh up their options.It is believed Partick Thistle and Inverness Caley Thistle were the two Championship sides to vote against the plan.As a result, Dundee appear to be in a position to set whichever agenda they please in negotiations with the SPFL.🔵 In these troubled times, when many people are struggling to get out for their paper, we are pledging to help readers by providing a FREE digital edition of the Eveningfor three months.

I’m looking at it and going, ‘Wow’.“I think in that two weeks, with the Scottish Cup Final and then that game, I got beat - on aggregate.“I had a week in Dubai between that so I suppose that makes up for it.”McPake is approaching six years at Dens Park, after initially joining as a player in May , and he didn’t envisage such a long spell at the club.He said: “If I did, I’d be living in Dundee or somewhere around about there.

It would be our intention,the season is brought to an early conclusion, where practical, to reimburse those season ticket holders for the remainder of the season that was not played.  This will be further assessed for timelines, etc., as we make our way through the claims process. We have often said that the club is a family and that remains true throughout this situation.In addition to our insurance coverage, we have also sought to access ious sources of support offered by the League, the Association, Government agencies and our associates.  All that have been involved have been extremely helpful in our solidication of the club as a business.  I would like to personally thank John Bennett for his very generous and selfless gesture of suspending rent on the stadium. His call, on day one of this crisis helped to set the tone for all that followed throughout this shutdown and is the epitome of showing how we are all in this together.The UK Government and its agencies have also been extremely helpful in the offering of grants loans and providing relief through the Job Retention Scheme.  That includes HMRC. It is our experience, thus far, that this country’s handling of the crisis exceeds others in the mitigation of losses for businesses as well as iniduals.  In the coming days we will be implementing elements of the job retention scheme in respect of our staff and it is our intention that all are looked after fully throughout this crisis. This includes our football players, football staff and administrative staff receiving full pay while they are on furlough for the foreseeable future.We also think it is right to give credit to the dedicated workers at the SPFL and SFA. They have been working in an ever-changing landscape throughout this unprecedented event. They have continued to keep us informed and provide us advice on how to best navigate this predicament. They have freely shared the advice and guidance they are receiving from the government and UEFA as we all feel our way through these weeks. We continue to take advice and express our opinions on what football should look like when football resumes. Although none of us know yet what will transpire with this season, it is clear that football will be back.We’ve been inundated with requests on how people can help the club.  It’s truly been heart-warming. The one way to helpyou can – and onlyyou can # is to purchase season tickets and merchandise online.  We still have limited availability of this year’s Third Strip, which may become a collector’s item as it may never be worn.This supports the club as well as SSAFA and The Black Watch Association charities.  We will soon be launching our - kit in the upcoming days and we know it’s not enough to completely fill your appetite for football, but keep an eye on the social media sites for Dundee FC and DFC in the Community, which will provide some entertainment while we all do our part to save lives by staying home.We wish we had something more definitive to say, but we hope this brief update will provide some reassurance that we are still here and will remain here when this crisis is over. So from all of us at Dundee Football Club, please stay safe, keep your families safe, that is the most important thing and know that we are all in this together and we will come through this together!"},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/04/2.51154311-240x180.jpg srcset=https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/04/2.51154311-496x372.jpg 620w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/04/2.51154311-752x564.jpg 940w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/04/2.51154311-240x180.jpg 300w ","title":"dundee united mark connolly leadership coronavirus","story":"Dundee United’s Mark Connolly has stressed the need for positivity in his leadership role during the lockdown.The -year-old Irish central defender is one of the senior players selected by manager Robbie Neilson to keep an eye on their team-mates while they are on furlough caused by the coronavirus.Along with the other United leaders – captain Mark Reynolds, Calum Butcher and Dillon Powers – Connolly will be keeping in touch with the people in his group to make sure they are staying well during Scottish football’s shutdown.Of course, mental health has as much value as physical well-being, especially in troubled times like these, and the former Kilmarnock player is keen to keep the mood upbeat.Connolly, whose is not receiving any contact or instruction from United during furlough, said: “We just need to keep ourselves as fit as we can so we are ready to go back when the professionals tell us when it is safe and well to do so.“We are due back in around the th of April because that is when the lockdown is due to end although we all know that could change.“It is frustrating because we don’t know what is happening and the club don’t know what is happening either.“However, we are a good group and we are all looking out for each other, which is huge.“Some boys will get through this no bother and there will be others who will find it harder and you just need to try and keep them positive.“We have the group chat and there is a lot of banter flying about to keep spirits up,” added Connolly.“One of the boys has put ‘week two in quarantine’ and posted this photo of a fish in a fishbowl!  It is all good craic.“A lot of the boys will be playing Call of Duty and FIFA and stuff and the older ones with the kids have dferent priorities.“I know it sounds clichéd but you have to stay positive and set yourself goals.“You can’t just wake up in the morning and lounge about on the couch and eat rubbish all day.“That is when it becomes dficultyou keep doing that and it turns into four or five weeks.“You see a lot more people out exercising now and maybe that is one of the positives that can come out of this terrible situation.“Hopefully, we can take the positives and it can change our lives for the better going forward.”United have chosen their group leaders wisely.All four – Connolly, Reynolds, Butcher and Powers – are confident, assured iniduals with a wealth of experience.Connolly is , Butcher and Powers are a year older, while captain Reynolds is .

and they gave me a contract from September to June on £ per week – a far cry from the million-pound lestyle people associate with some footballers.There was an appearance fee on top but spending time on loan at Ross County meant I couldn’t get that and it was a really tough time in my career.Right now, there are worse things going on in the world with people’s health but adding the stress and worry of work problems just piles on top for a lot of people.I think the move to furlough staff for the time being is a sensible one for both city clubs.What the players are desperate for now is some sort of certainty from the powers-that-be.The UK Government has gone to town on footballers this week completely unfairly.They are an easy target right now.I understand why people think players should front up and take pay cuts to either help non-playing staff at clubs or the NHS or whatever.However, they all seem to be lumped in the same bracket when only a small percentage of professional footballers earn millions of pounds.Boys playing for clubs like Dundee or United or St Mirren, Hamilton etc are not earning fortunes and they have bills to pay like everybody .I think everyone should be doing their bit to help during the coronavirus pandemic, whether that’s through paying taxes or some sort of voluntary work, but it seems like footballers have been called out because they are an easy target.There are plenty of people across the country earning big bucks but not getting hammered.A better way to go about it would have been to say to players exactly what their club needs to save and to give an option to donate part of their salary to the NHS.It seems a weekly occurrence at the moment that we see an SPFL meeting as the time decisions will finally be made.I’m not holding my breath too much for this one tomorrow but you never know.I saw Celtic put out they want to finish the season but they are in a position where they can take the high ground.Everyone has their own agenda but what we really need, what clubs and players need, is some idea of how Scottish football will continue.Cheering on the Virtual Grand National over the weekend was about as close to sporting excitement as you can get at the moment.I didn’t have much luck in my sweepy – my virtual horse fell over a virtual hurdle#"},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2020/04/92354387_1011646992562892_7719572959957876736_n-e1586539337459.jpg ","title":"local artist

Invergowrie, has created a fairy door trail around the local area to give children a fun activity to do on their daily exercise, while keeping a safe distance from others.She was helped by her children, including nine-year-old daughter Breagha, who came up with some of the door design ideas, and there are now around  for kids to find.She said: #We have placed these around Invergowrie and it#s giving local children and their families something to get out in the fresh air and look for. vw, px\"  #I also hope that it#s leading to creativity among others and as well as giving them a walk in the fresh air leads them also to think of ways they can spend their time during lockdown.#I#m also thinking about putting some blank doors around so that anyone finding them can design their own fairy door.# vw, px\"  Gill also painted  shells in rainbow colours, and has now scattered them around the area, for people to collect or leave as they see fit.She said: #I got the idea from a friend and painted around  rainbow shells.#I realise that people are struggling in these dficult times and the idea was to leave the shells around so that they could give a wee bit of hope to anyone who found them.#Gill said that so far her shells and doors had been very well received locally and she was  planning to create and distribute more fairy doors and increase the trail.She said thatit got to the stage where the trail could make any money, it would be donated to a local charity.#This has been something lighthearted and inexpensive to do at this time and I hope it#s spreading a little

As we stood about on deck while the dishes were being washed a boy from one of the motor boats passed in his dinghy. He was wearing blue shorts and red stockings which brought from the Pilot the remark: #In Brodickyou don’t wear red stockings you might just as well be in Lamlash.#All but the Skipper and Mate went ashore on Centre Island for a stroll. The Major was still completely paralysed in his hind quarters but he was full of spirit and when the Bosun held up his hind legshe galloped along. It was a quiet peaceful evening with a very light northerly breeze but it was distinctly chilly and there was a magnicentsomewhat lurid sunset. The shore party back aboard the Bosun took the Tar off in the dinghy and they landed on Eilean na Beithe and while the former explored the island the latter played on a shingly shore – it was long after dark when they ed.At half past ten we began to turn in and, as always on the first evening, this was a longer business then usual as pillows and blankets had to be allocated and pillowslips put on but by a quarter past eleven we were all in bed and shortly after that a light shower pattered on the deck. The problem of what to do with the Doctor’s mattress was solved by the Pilot double banking his bunk. We were all very glad to have had such a good day for the start.It was noticed that voices were still coming from the ladies’ cabin when the last of us in the main cabin fell asleep.The Tanky brought an innovation to the Fulmar # #Quickies# # a patent washing gadget that saved precious water.We had a dead quiet night with, as far as any of us knew, no rain but the forecast was not good, promising north to north-east winds, force  to  with frequent heavy showers. The glass had continued its steady drop. When we turned out, a light but cold north wind was blowing from a well broken up sky.We had a breakfast of bacon and eggs then the Bosun took the Major ashore for his walk. The latter was possibly a little better and was able to take a few steps on the deck, but ashore on the rough ground could do nothing. While they were ashore the big motor boat with the red-stockinged boy left after very nearly going ashore on Seil Island while getting his anchor aboard.At twenty past ten we were away under engine, but as soon as we were outside the sails went up to the north-easterly breeze and we set off for the Sound of Mull. There was no sign of the swell that is usually met south of Kerrera and we got along quite well, but we could not point any higher than a mile or so south of Loch Don. The Pilot went below and brewed a welcome cup of tea which warmed us up, then we took a tack right up to the south coast of Kerrera and had a close up view of Gylen Castle and the Skipper waxed historical.Putting about again we passed close south of the Potlid Island, but when we were about halfway across to Loch Don the wind died and the strong ebb began to force us south and about the same time the rain came on.The engine was started and we headed up for Duart, but our progress was pitully slow, and indeed at one period we but barely held our ground. The Lady Rock and Lismore Lighthouse seemed never to get any nearer closing. When the engine had run an hour we waited for the first sign of the old familiar falter but none came and we began to hope a cure for its stopping had been effected by replacing the HT coil.This change was a despairing effort made because it was the only thing we had not tried, though all the pundits declare it could not possibly be the cause. The engine would either go or not go, they said, and it would never startthe coil was defective. We got one scare when it staggered for a moment, but the Bosun, who was at the tiller at the time, said we had just passed though a big mass of floating seaweed and may have got some round our propeller.As we were to prove later the cure had been found and the engine ran impeccably all the cruise and the Skipper had a lot of unkind thoughts about all the many professional motor experts who had caused him a great deal of trouble, not a little acute anxiety and more than considerable expense through their failure to diagnose a not very obscure disease.As we came up to the Black Memorial Tower Leonora crossed our bows making for Oban and another yachtpassed close by south bound under engine though by this time quite a reasonable and, for then, favourable breeze was blowing from the north-east and our sails were drawing.We learnt later that the owner’s we would not allow a sail to be set under any conditions as long as she was aboard – a pity, we thought, as she certainly was a lovely job and we felt it would have been betterthe we had decided to stay ashore.At Duart we stopped the engine and were able to make good progress, but the rain got heavier and heavier and our sandwich lunch was taken below in relays. Then at about three with the turn of the tide the wind died completely and the engine was started again. Near the Grey Rocks we saw St Roma coming south under power so we altered course to intercept her then at slow speed turned back the way we had come for a few hundred yards while we exchanged news.We heard a thoroughly bad forecast at mid-day, the wind had gone, the rain was stotting in the glassy sea, and, though the glass had come back only a fraction, we decided to call it a day so, with the Bosun the only dissentient, made for Loch Aline. As we turned inshore at Ardtornish we saw Seewolf to the north of us, becalmed but heading south, and guessed she would be joining us later. Coming in, when between Morven Pier and the Ferry Pier, the Skipper held too close to the west shore and the bottom showed up suddenly far too clearly for our peace of mind and a quick sheer out was necessary.Through the narrows we turned to starboard and anchored at half past four in Kyle Bay in a flat calm and the rain coming down heavier than ever. Gratefully we realised that it was not quite as bitterly cold as it had been out in the Sound.Seewolf came in shortly after going very slowly and Hamish Lawrence called over that he had run a big end and was on his way to Oban for repairs and to hand over to brother Alec and his family. Soon after that we were joined by a small motor boat, Saguenay, flying a blue ensign which, in view of her size, the Skipper was sure she was not entitled to do and then a little later, while we were warming up with some coffee, Lindisfarne arrived and anchored close beside us with Guy Clephane in his usual tremendousform – he’s a proper marvel is Guy.Hamish Lawrence came across in his dinghy and came aboard for a gin and while he was there Guy called over inviting Tanky and the Pilot across to Lindisfarne then sent the Pilot back to Fulmar to fetch the Bosun. Hamish gone, the Skipper began to put nine inch tacklines into our line of flags as we had discovered at Rothesay at the Royal Clyde Centenary Regatta that without them our line was about fteen feet too short and we wanted them to be right for the Queen’s visit to Tobermory.When the Pilot came back he and the Bosun got the tents up as the rain was by then torrential.We had a supper of sausages and beans and while the dishes were being done the Bosun took the Major ashore. He was walking a little bettervery slowly, but there was, unfortunately, no concrete results from his exercise.At nine o’clock we went in two loads across to Seewolf and were offered drinks OR tea, but the Skipper insisted on both. We were, however, not allowed any biscuits with our tea as to have them would have meant opening a new box and broaching Alec Lawrence’s stores. The Tanky had not wanted anything but tea, but Hamish had given her a good strong gin which she tried to hide on a shelf behind her and it was only got rid of when the Pilot took it off her hands and quickly put it to its proper use. The Bosun was drinking beer and when he opened up the tin a goodly portion of it bubbled onto the fitted carpet in the cabin.On board Seewolf were, besides the two paid hands, Hamish’s mother and his two sisters. The old lady, well over eighty, was in grand form and waxed eloquent on #The old days# and the greatness of #Belshaft#. Also on board was a great big collie who was obviously petted and spoilt beyond measure and he behaved more like a lap dog than the great big clumsy creature he was.It was half past eleven before we went back to Fulmar all in one load with little enough freeboard for the dinghy considering the conditions. There was a nasty little lop on the water, the northerly wind was bitterly cold, and the rain was as heavy as ever. As quickly as possible we got below and into our warm bunks, not even the Bosun wasting any time about it, though he did read for some time after all the rest were sound asleep."},{"url":null,"title":"bobcast podcast episode 10 nessie and the lost golf balls","story":"The Oban TimesUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsWelcome to Episode  of the Oban Time#s BOBcast.Charting Bob#s progress  and discussing lots of things golfare  presenters Stephen Day, George Graham, Martin Laing and Keith McIntyre.

As part of this project the fund provided MACPool with seven aqua cycles and training from Hydrorider.Arriving early to take photogaphs of the others giving these bikes a go, any sense of nervousness was set aside as I watched healthcare professionals and fitness and well-being enthusiasts laugh and chat through their shot.After some quick adjustments to the bikes June, from our advertising department, and I were raring to go.Partially submerged, the feeling of being weightless combined with the resistance of the water as we began peddling was initially a bit odd. As we got used to the feeling, we started to speed things up, pretending we were racing the rest of our group to The Cairnbaan for a gin and tonic.Finding our rhythm, instructor Kathryn Craig began to lead us through arm exercises. Our co-ordination was put to the test as we carried on cycling while doing simple arm movements that felt more impactive due to the water resistance. Then for the real challenge # floating off the back of the bike while continuing to pedal – not an easy taskyou are short-legged but a workout that feels like it is doing you the power of good.For me aqua cycling is everything I hoped it would be – a fun, impactiveand enjoyable way of exercising. And I could still walk after it!With no aches and pains the next day and still smiling, I signed up for some of the classes.Classes y in intensity and are currently running on Tuesdays from .-.pm, Wednesday evenings from .-.pm and Saturdays from  .-.am.

Included in this is the Isle of Jura.This is as shockingly reckless as it is offensive.The Isle of Jura is not a #bolthole# as the Daily Mail has chosen to state but a very beautul island steeped in culture and rich history.On both Jura and Islay we, like so many rural areas, are struggling to deal with all of the challenges related to the Corona virus out break. Our local health services have very limited resources as it is, along side a population that has many elderly residents who are more at risk to the virus.We have seen a local uptick in people traveling to Islay in camper vans and this is happening at a time when the UK government is advising against non essential travel.Those who are choosing to travel to our islands of Islay, Jura and the many other islands in Argyll and Bute in order to avoid the coronavirus may end up inadvertently spreading it to islands who arenot as much affected in the same way as so many built up urban areas are. Such actions are as reckless as they are selfish and I would implore people who do not need to travel to our rural constituency to avoid doing so until this global pandemic has passed.Jura, Islay and the rest of Argyll are some of the most beautul places you will ever visit and you won#t find an area where the people are more hospitable and friendly but while this crisis is ongoing I would ask everyone who is not currently living here to avoid traveling here for the time being.Councillor Alastair Redman # Kintyre and Islands ward.To the Scottish public,During this time of unprecedented uncertainty, we are all concerned about the safety and wellbeing of our families, friends and colleagues.Our hearts go out to those who have been affected personally by the outbreak of coronavirus , as well as the many communities around the world that are facing extreme measures in an attempt to slow its spread.We appreciate and are mindful of the challenges iniduals are currently facing as well as the impact this pandemic has had on our vital emergency services as well as the grocery retail sector, supply chain and producers.Like our retail partners, we want to take this opportunity to assure you that Scottish farmers, auctioneers, hauliers, processors and butchers are doing everything they can to maintain the ongoing availability of fresh, locally sourced Scotch Beef PGI, Scotch Lamb PGI and Specially Selected Pork.We would like to thank all those who work in the Scottish red meat industry and their families for their ongoing and unwavering efforts to keep our supermarket shelves and butcher shops stocked, fuelling Scotland with top-quality red meat during this challenging time.As bodies supporting the Scottish agricultural and red meat industry, we are constantly reviewing the developing situation and are doing all we can to support everyone involved in putting nutritious food on your plates.Alan Clarke, chief executive, Quality Meat ScotlandMartin Morgan, executive manager, Scottish Association of Meat Wholesalers Duncan Todd, secretary, Scottish Beef Association Jen Craig, president, National Sheep Association Scotland Penny Montgomerie, chief executive, Scottish Association of Young Farmers Clubs and Gordon King, executive manager, Scottish Craft Butchers.What on earth is going on  It was banal enough when Ben Goldsmith # English financier and environmentalist # tweeted that #overgrazing# by upland sheep farmers, was responsible for the devastating floods in South Wales, rather than record-breaking torrential rainfall.Unbelievably we now have a government official, Dr Tim Leunig, suggesting the whole of the UK does not need farming, and his comparison of the UK to Singapore in this context is absolutely ludicrous. You truly have to wonderthere is something in the water that he is drinking – could it be flood contamination Surely, every person having a full and ing set of neurons and synapses, the complete opposite is the truth, as we dearly need our hard working farming community.The UK Government should be fully supporting the farming industry and indeed, good land management. The Welsh Assembly has totally lost its way with its mindless policy of devastating Welsh forests with thousands and thousands # an understatement # of trees being felled for wind farms, and compounding the felony by covering acres of land with very limited electricity generating solar parks # Wales is not the Sahara and the sun disappears at night! Solar  will generate about  per cent of their maximum capacity in the UK.Returning to farming perhaps some kind person should tell Dr Tim Leunig that the answer lies in the soil and then lead him to a darkened and quiet room so he can lie down and contemplate the truth # wise men recognise that truth is the daughter of time, not of authority.Dave Haskell, Cardigan."},{"url":null,"title":"the voyages of the fulmar part 10","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsWhat a night! All of us were agreed that never had we experienced anywhere a worse one and we were glad we had been in Loch Aline on Sunday night not in Tobermory as intended as, from what we heard, that night had been similar but twice as bad.It was a wild night lashing with rain and a big swell was rolling in from the north-east causing us to pitch and roll horribly. Everything banged and rattled and the ropes, despite their lashings, slapped on the mast, the chain rugged continuously on the bobstay, and there was one most annoying thump that kept everyone awake .We could not trace its origin until in desperation the Pilot donned oilskins, sou’wester and seaboots, and went on deck and found it was the tiller end bumping on the bulwarks. The Pilot had a very justiable grouse about this as he had suggested lashing the tiller, but the Skipper had said that he did not think it necessary and that we would lie easierit was allowed to go free.About six we heard Murdoch in Venture hailing us and the Skipper and Pilot hurried on deck. The yachts in the harbour were all lying higgledy-piggledy owing to the swell, to there being little or not wind, to the strong surface current from the swollen river, and to it being about the turn of the tide.Venture and Fulmar were lying stern to stern and what had aroused Murdoch was that the Venture had got her mizzen boom over our main boom and as we pitched we had lted it up crutch and all – how nothing was broken was a miracle. She had then swung round and her now free boom had knocked the cap off our jackstay. As the Skipper came on deck Venture again surged towards us and started pitching and her counter came down with a terric slam not six inches from our bulwarks. We put our helm over and swung clear.Murdoch and Barclay were both in their dog-house and the Pilot and Skipper stayed in ours until the new tide took charge and the boats began to swing in normal fashion and all were able to retire once more to their bunks. Luckily the rain had cleared off shortly before this episode took place.At a quarter to eight we heard the usual poor forecast but for the first time since the cruise began there was not a gale warning for any area. The glass had risen well during the night. What wind there was was from the north-west.The Skipper went ashore for the milk and rolls. The dinghy had a lot of water in it and owing to the rolling it was impossible to get into it and balance on the thwarts till it was baled so the Skipper got his feet thoroughly soaked – the simple remedy of wearing seaboots had never occurred to him. Again the rolls were sold out and again he had to take porter biscuits.On board the Pilot lit the fire then started in to get our breakfast of bacon and egg. After our meal the sky cleared and it became a beautul sunny day, and everything we had was up on deck drying off or airing. The owner of Rose came alongside and for a good time tried to get us to persuade him to go north against his better judgement, but when we heard he had the lady member of his crew of three sick in her bunk our advice was that he go south and that immediately and reluctantly he was forced to agree and half an hour later he sailed. Hervor also went out about the same time and she turned north and we were to meet her later in Iona."},{"url":null,"title":"worldwide ceilidh community sign up for tunes in the hoose","story":"Fiona ScottUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsCapercaillie founder Martin MacLeod, originally from Oban, and his son, also Martin, have came up with an innovative way to connect musicians from all over the world and allow them to play together for the enjoyment of others.#Tunes in the Hoose# was inspired by Scottish musician, and family friend of the MacLeods, Peter Wood, who was posting videos of himself playing tunes in his home during self-isolation.Having saw the footage Martin senior, called his filmmaker son to askhe had the technology and know-how to put a video together of him playing along to Peter’s video.#I run my own production company based out of Glasgow, so it’s relatively straight forward work for me ,# said Martin Junior.#From that first successful attempt, our new idea was to create an online community for all Scottish musicians to help them connect and continue to play together during these uncertain times.#Housed in Facebook, Tunes in the Hoose amassed over  followers last week with ,+ views worldwide.

I was definitely not expecting it to get as big, but I guess that is how social media works.ldquoI canrsquot believe how much itrsquos spread. All I wanted was two or three people to smile and Irsquove managed to do just that.ldquoIrsquom quite surprised at how many people of all generations it has attracted. Itrsquos bringing them all back to their younger days.ldquoTherersquos some bears that have been posted in the group that are  years old and falling to bits, people are going up into their attics and bringing their own old ones down and are telling stories from when they were a child.ldquoTherersquos been over , comments so far and most of them are people sharing their childhood stories, they arenrsquot even talking about the virus.Jodie said that Lexii has been collecting beanie baby teddy bears since she was born so is ldquovery excited to get them all out.She added: ldquoItrsquos given her that distraction that she needed. Shersquos been out with Steven looking for more.Jodie is in talks with people who can knit bears and is hoping that a bunch can be made and auctioned off, she is hoping this will happen in the next couple of weeks.The bears are going to be NHS bears and will also be raising money for them."},{"url":null,"title":"tims-tales-isolated-not-alone","story":"THIS virus has had a devastating effect on so many people in so many ways. Almost nobody has been untouched by it, although for some it has been more cataclysmic than others. But we are in this together, and it will be together that we pull through it.One of the real heartbreaking consequences of the lockdown has been the separation of families. Many grandparents now cannot see their grandchildren, or even their own children. Family of people who are ill cannot visit their loved ones. Each story has its own set of circumstances and sadly more is to come before it gets better.While we do need light-heartedness at this time, itrsquos also really important to acknowledge peoplersquos struggles. It was with gut-wrenching despair I realised a number of weeks ago that the arrival of Covid- in Europe was going to seriously affect so many families, my own included.I have five children, but my middle child, who is now  years old, has for the last eight years shared time between Scotland and Sweden.She went to school here until she was seven, when she began to attend school in Sweden. It was then that I had to adjust to the painful reality of less time with her, although I was still able to maintain regular time with her in Scotland and of course keep in daily touch.Itrsquos been an emotional rollercoaster, in which I have stories of me sleeping at airports, travelling through Scandinavian landscape at ungodly hours, and along the way meeting people who have helped and made a real dference. But itrsquos been worth it as it meant our blended family remained connected and my daughter hasnrsquot felt ided between two families but rather a full part of both.We were due to travel to Sweden this Friday andlater, but of course the flights were cancelled a couple of weeks ago. Explaining this to my daughter, and then not being able to say when we would be together was heartbreaking. I felt so helpless, unable to comfort her. Wersquod all counted down the days and now it seems it may be weeks, even months, before any reunion will be possible.I know that there will be families in similar or worse situations. My heart goes out to them all. My initial response to my situation was to close down with despair. The idea of not being with my child, for whom I was the equal main carer until recently, feels unbearable. Some friends have said, with good intentions: ldquoAt least shersquos safe.Yes she is, and I give thanks for that. But any loving parent facing long-term enforced separation from their child will understand the grief that such separation creates. It seeps into your being and makes it dficult to get through the day without having really dark moments. I tried to hide my emotions, but my loving and understanding we knows me too well yet she too felt helpless.There are moments in our lives when we are just overwhelmed by the impossibility of a situation and we just want to curl up and close down. I recently reached that point.Then my daughter asked me while we were talking online: ldquoI wish we could get a magic flying carpet or something dad, or ask the faeries to make a portal. She understood this wasnrsquot possible, but it was the wake-up call I needed. It made me realise I needed to get out of the pit of despair and, for her sake as well as mine, use my creativity to make that magic carpet, and that portal, to help us stay closely connected during this awful time.And the magic ingredient is stories. My daughter has always loved stories, and we have made many up together some of them have even been printed on this page. Now these stories help keep us connected and ease the pain of separation for us both.And so, with the help of technology, and, crucially, a good relationship with her mother, stories have begun to create a vital space for my daughter to be with her Scottish family, even when separated. We can all be together, even my grown-up daughters, who I miss even though they are isolating close by.We storytell to each other, make stories up and even share them in short films. Wee sister Skye, who is six and misses her sister like crazy, holds the tablet which she uses to speak to her, so they can be together while I tell stories and share riddles. We draw and add to the stories together, make fun dramas in which we film ourselves on phones acting out stories like Cinderella, and I have learnt to put wee films together which we can then watch together.Sharing stories like this has given extra meaning to our online communication. It takes us away from just asking ldquohow was your day  or ldquowhat did you do today  questions that often just seem to emphasise our current disconnection. Later, after this crisis is over, the wee films, the artwork and written stories will be memorabilia of this time our evidence that we remained close, even when forced apart.I write about this because I know there are parents and children out there in similarly dficult situations to say you are not alone in this and letrsquos be kind to each other and share the ways we keep ourselves connected. I also know others will have discovered better solutions, as Irsquom no technical wizard.Children are resilient, often more than their grown-ups are, but we need to help them manage this time emotionally, and when we canrsquot give them a hug or be physically with them in hard times, an inheritance of stories they can access can be a real support.I have often been less than enthusiastic about social media in the past, but right now people are discovering in this crisis it has become a leline in many ways.If you, or someone you know, are in a similar situation, please do get in touch. Letrsquos share our experiences, and understand that while we may be isolating, we are not alone."},{"url":null,"title":"european-stone-stacking-championships-dunbar-postponed","story":"The European Stone Stacking Championships were due to take place between April  and , with a place at the World Rock Stacking Championships in Texas next year up for grabs.However, James Craig Page, creator and director of the festival, broke the news that the event, like dozens of others across the county, had to be postponed amid concerns surrounding coronavirus.Mr Page said: ldquoIt has been postponed but we are very hopeful that we will find another venue or be able to go ahead at a dferent time.ldquoHowever, for the time being we have to postpone.This year would have marked the fth year a stone stacking event had taken place in Dunbar event.Each year, it attracts thousands of people to the area, as well as competitors from throughout Europe.Mr Page spoke to the Courier upon ing from the World Rock Stacking Championships in the USA last month.Initially, he was keen to see the European event, which takes place at Eye Cave Beach, off Bayswell Road, take place.However, upon ing to British shores, he became aware of the state of the global issue.Speaking to the Courier, he said: ldquoWe were just waiting for word and advice but it became apparent when I got back how bad things were and that we needed to put it on hold.ldquoWe donrsquot want to be taking any risks with anybodyrsquos health and wellbeing.

There are obviously many reasons why you may be thinking about acquiring a new dog.Our receptionist Lesley Baillie ndash who works in both Dunedin Vets branches in North Berwick and Prestonpans ndash recently had to bid farewell to her elderly dog Millie, her companion and friend for many years.Lesley was devastated but knew she needed a companion to fill the void. She began to consider which breed or type of dog would be best for her.The arrival of a new pet is a very exciting time, but careful consideration should be made regarding the type and breed of dog you choose.Many problems we encounter in the practice are a result of purchasing a pet not suited to lestyle and family environment.There are, however, many benefits of owning a pet. Companionship is the most obvious.Having a pet to talk to and interact with can take away many of the stresses of daily le.Taking a dog for a walk provides exercise and helps in creating a healthy lestyle. Having a pet is known to assist in the recovery from illness. In fact, PATdogs are encouraged in some hospital wards to help patients on the road to recovery.Dogs come in a huge iety of breeds, shapes and sizes, so choosing a dog to fit your lestyle can be extremely dficult. It is best to do lots of research before contemplating buying a dog.Many dogs have natural instincts such as herding and guarding, and these should be considered prior to choosing a dog.Also consider how the pup was raised. Were they house or kennel reared There are seven main classes of dogs, each with their own characteristics:l Toy dogs: as the name suggests, they are small dogs but are generally high maintenance and require a lot of grooming. They are, however, dogs and not toys or accessories. Examples: Bichon Frise and Chihuahua.l Utility breeds: there are a iety of breeds in this class but most tend to be courageous extroverts so need good control. Examples: bulldog and Dalmatian.l Terriers: they hunt by instinct and are brave and tough. They may be generally small but require lots of exercise and play. Examples: Border terrier and Airedale.l Hounds: these hunt and can be quite aloof they are quite independent and often like to be with one owner. Examples: bloodhound and basset hound.l Working dogs: as the name suggests, they have specic jobs. They are intelligent and may be quite large and guard dogs. Examples: St Bernard and Samoyed.l Pastoral dogs: these are bred to work with livestock and are very intelligent. They require mental and physical stimulation and tend to be tough and need a role. Examples: Border collie and Belgian shepherd dog.l Gundogs: they find and retrieve game. They have amenable temperaments and are active and affectionate. Examples: springer spaniel and retriever.We cannot, however, forget the crossbreed dogs, which are by far the most popular dogs around. Their nature will depend on their breeding and obviously they come in a huge range of sizes.Nowadays, there a large number of crossbreeds which are designated lsquodesigner breedsrsquo. Breeders will tell all the advantages of these lsquobreedsrsquo, but be aware not only are there advantages attributed to the parents, genetic traits from both breeds may also be present and in veterinary practice, we do see a disproportionately high number of problems with these dogs.There are many questions you should ask yourself before considering buying a dog.l Are there young children in the family  A utility dog, such as a miniature Schnauzer, or gundog e.g. Labrador may be breeds to consider.l Is everyone in the family out of the house during the day  Are you really able to look after a dog  An independent cat may be the best option.l Do you live in a flat  Consider a toy dog, e.g. Chihuahua.l Are you fit and able to go for long walks  Then the working or pastoral dogs should be considered e.g. Border collie or Doberman.l Do you have any fur allergies  Consider some the soft-coated dogs such as poodles.l Do you have a large garden  The terriers enjoy running around in enclosed spaces, e.g. Border or Patterdale terriers.Lesley considered very carefully what breed she should choose.She knew she wanted a fairly active dog who would enjoy long walks and travelling in her campervan with her.She also knew she did not want an overly large breed. She works part-time so wanted a breed which could be trusted to be left for short periods but was also friendly and enjoyed loving, human contact.After much deliberation, Lesley settled on a Tibetan terrier.These are a medium-sized breed originating in Tibet.Despite the name, they are not terriers but actually working dogs.They are therefore very loyal and affectionate but also energetic and sensitive.Tibetan terriers have a mid- coat which is very soft and hypoallergenic so excellent for anyone with animal hair allergies, but does require a good deal of grooming.After searching far and wide, Lesley found a breeder who had just had a litter of puppies.So, after a few weeks and a long journey, wee Hetty arrived home with Lesley.She really is a cutie and was so well behaved when Lesley brought her to the surgery.She is settling in well at home and hopefully she and Lesley will have many happy years and enjoyable adventures together.The rewards of owning a pet are immense.With careful consideration prior to purchasing a pet, you can have a cherished companion for many years to come.Caring for them can sometimes be a challenge but should give great pleasure to owner and pet alike."},{"url":null,"title":"couple-toast-diamond-wedding-anniversary","story":"The message came as a very pleasant surprise for Lyn and Alan Vaughan, who are living in self-isolation on the townrsquos Williamstone Court.Lyn said that, unknown to her, her daughter Julie had made contact with the relevant officials.ldquoThe letter from Her Majesty was as a huge surprise when it arrived, said a delighted Lyn.It was also thanks to Julie ndash though inadvertently ndash that the couple were able to celebrate with  members of their family and friends at a pre-anniversary dinner in La Potiniere restaurant in Gullane a few days before the coronavirus lockdown was imposed.ldquoJulie was going on be on a ski holiday on the actual date of our anniversary, so we had a family lunch at La Potiniere, said Lyn.ldquoDue to the lockdown we canrsquot see them now, so it was very fortunate that we got together that day.On the evening of their anniversary, they joined the applause for the NHS in their road.Lyn, , and Alan, , were both born and brought up in Birmingham.The couple met at a ballroom dancing class and got married three years later on March , .The couple moved to Scotland in the s when Alan was working as a chartered surveyor on the St James Centre in Edinburgh.They moved to Gullane in  and lived there for  years before moving to North Berwick so they could be closer to the railway station as Alan had become partially sighted.As well as Julie and Andrew, the couple had another son Chris, who sadly died in  from a brain tumour.

You could use them.The hare stroked his ears.ldquoSo I do he said, ldquovery well I will do what I can do.And so the squirrel and hare ran to the river.The squirrel dipped her bushy tail into the river, and the hare dipped his ears, collecting as much water as possible.They both ed to the fire, and stood a safe distance away. The squirrel shook her tail and the hare wiggled his ears.They sprayed the fire with droplets of water, and as before the flames fizzed for a moment, but it made very little dference.Just then a wild cat came by. She saw what the squirrel and hare were doing.ldquoYou foolish animals, said the wild cat, ldquoyou canrsquot put out the fire, just the two of you.The hare looked at the wild cat and nodded.ldquoWe know he said, ldquobut the forest is our home and feeds us, so we are doing what we can do.Then the squirrel looked at the wild cat and asked her, ldquoWill you help us The wild cat looked at the squirrel and the hare, and licked her lips.Normally they would be a good lunch option. But the wild cat lived in the forest too, and without it her habitat would be gone.ldquoI wouldI could, said the wild cat, ldquobut the thing is, I am afraid of water.ldquoHmm thatrsquos true said the hare, ldquobut we are also afraid of you, but we will be brave and work with you to save the forest.The wild cat thought for a moment. ldquoVery well I will be brave too she said, ldquoI will do what I can do.So the squirrel, the hare and the wild cat all ran to the river.The squirrel dipped her busy tail into the river, and the hare dipped his ears, while the wild cat took a deep breath and bravely jumped in and quickly out of the water soaking her coat.They ed to the fire, and all three stood a safe distance away. The squirrel shook her tail and the hare wiggled his ears and the wild cat shook her whole body.They sprayed the fire with droplets of water, and the flames fizzed for a moment, but it made little dference.Just then, a golden eagle was flying above and saw the squirrel, hare and wild cat.ldquoWell thatrsquos something Irsquove never seen before, said the golden eagle to herself, ldquoa squirrel, a hare and a wild cat working together. I have to find out whatrsquos going on.So the golden eagle flew down and watched what they were doing.ldquoYou foolish animals, said the golden eagle, ldquoyou canrsquot put out the fire, just the three of you.The wild cat looked at the golden eagle and nodded.ldquoWe know she said, ldquobut the forest is our home and feeds us, so we are doing what we can do.Then the squirrel looked at the golden eagle and asked him, ldquoWill you help us The eagle had wide wings, and although he lived in the forest he could easily fly away and find another forest.But this was his home too no other forest had the memories this one had.ldquoI would like to help, said the golden eagle, ldquobut the thing is I have no bushy tail, no long ears nor a coat of fur.ldquoHmm, thatrsquos true, said the wild cat, but you do have many feathers.The eagle thought for a moment.ldquoSo I do, he said, ldquovery well I will do what I can do.And so this time the squirrel, the hare and the wild cat ran to the river, while the golden eagle flew above.The squirrel dipped her bushy tail into the river, and the hare dipped his ears, while the wild cat took a deep breath and bravely jumped in and quickly out of the water soaking her coat.Then the golden eagle swooped down and collected water in his feathers.They ed to the fire, and all four stood a safe distance away.The squirrel shook her tail and the hare wiggled his ears and the wild cat shook her whole body, while the golden eagle ruffled his feathers above the flames.They all sprayed the fire with droplets of water at the same time, and the flames fizzed for a moment.This time it made a little dference.The other animals of the forest, who were running away from the fire, suddenly stopped and stared at the squirrel, at the hare, at the wild cat and at the golden eagle.ldquoYou foolish animals, they all said, ldquoyou canrsquot put out the fire, just the four of you.The golden eagle looked at the other animals and nodded.ldquoWe know, he said, ldquobut the forest is our home and feeds us and has our memories, so we are doing what we can do.Then the squirrel looked at all the other animals, and asked them, ldquoWill you help us The fox looked at the deer, the deer looked at the pine marten, the pine marten looked at the capercaillie, the capercaillie looked at the buzzard all the animals and birds of the forest looked at each other and had a think.The forest was important to them all in dferent ways.ldquoVery well, they all said ldquowe will do what we can do.And so they did. Each animal did what they could do, no matter how little.And when all the little was added up, it became a lot.

The days are getting longer, buds and blossom are appearing on the trees and we see clumps of daffodils appearing but it doesnrsquot feel like Easter because normal le is on hold. Churches are closed, families are in lockdown and there will be no gatherings, picnics or Easter egg hunts.\"Yet perhaps we have a chance of understanding Easter in a new way. For the followers of Jesus, the start of the first Easter Sunday was not a special day. He was gone and their dreams, hopes and vision for the future died. So they, like us, that first Easter had no gatherings for worship and the disciples were in lockdown. But after the resurrection death was defeated, hope was reborn and that Friday was rebadged Good Friday. It seems to me that is a pretty good reason for us to celebrate Easter this year. Christ is risen ndash He is risen indeed.\"Hallelujah!\"SCOTLANDrsquoS CATHOLIC BISHOPS\"The pandemic is afflicting the whole world and we pray for all those who have caught the virus, their loved ones and those caring for them. Our lives are greatly restricted and on Easter Sunday, the holiest day of the Christian calendar, we will not be able to go to church. It is hard but as Christians we know that the risen Lord is our hope. His suffering death and resurrection give us hope that we will recover, that le will get better and that our nation will feel the peace and love of the risen Christ.\"We also have hope in the ingenuity and the generosity of humanity. Though many uncertainties lie ahead, our hope and our determination to recover the lives we once lived is strong. We especially give thanks for the commitment and compassion of our medical professionals and we pray that all their decisions will respect the lives of the most vulnerable, entrusted to their care. We pray too for the researchers working to develop a vaccine and for our political leaders who must make dficult decisions.

In those first weeks, it seemed all too early. Some out there were identying silver linings, like the fake news that there were dolphins in the canals of Venice, or that ndash and this was true ndash pollution had almost melted away over China, or even that we could hear the birdsong better. But it felt to me we were too early in the grief cycle of denial, anger, bargaining, depression, and acceptance. Therersquos a hope that is about not accepting what has happened, or its true gravity. I wanted to resist that  hope.Still, itrsquos Easter and now Irsquom listening to the blackbirds singing ndash in the dead of night ndash and thinking about hope. For in the tiny moments when I can step back from my fear for myself and loved ones, hope is what I find myself looking for. Itrsquos all too easy to gaze out and see only the story that ends badly, the oncoming economic depression in which the poor are made poorer and the rich hold on to their wealth and health, or the segueing of disasters, one into another, in which our children find themselves lurching from pandemic to climate crisis. Many of us are finding that our thoughts are in a very black place. The nights can be long and wakeful.So we do need to foster hope ndash and thatrsquos an active process. You have to work at it. You have to plant seeds. You have to water them. Hope doesnrsquot really last without doing anything. It doesnrsquot survive long as just an idea in your head. Itrsquos all about finding those grains of something you can work with. And they exist ndash itrsquos just they seem more dficult to access, more virtual, in an era when we are being told to stay at home. Even the reaching out wersquore doing across the internet is a start. Even our clapping for the NHS provokes hope that we can come together and create a society in which our carers are valued.Many people are already looking for new roles ndash what they can do, not only to help others now, but perhaps as part of some human movement towards creating a better society, somewhere at the almost unimaginable end of all this. Wersquove signed up for things. Wersquove helped neighbours out. Wersquove felt inadequate, and worried we have nothing to offer. Wersquore still trying to work out , and how, the things we used to value and fight for matter in this new universe. Many of them still do. What we always used to hope for ndash a fairer world, a new relationship with the environment, an end to homelessness ndash seems all the more important now, evenour immediate concern is the virus threat. As Rebecca Solnit wrote this week: ldquoOne of our main tasks now ndash especially those of us who are not sick, are not frontline workers, and are not dealing with other economic or housing dficulties ndash is to understand this moment, what it might require of us, and what it might make possible.These problems ndash how to reinvent our economic system, how to change our physical impact on the planet or how to rejuvenate mental health ndash are issues people have been proposing solutions to for some time. There are blackbirds out there that have almost been waiting for this moment to arise. It may seem crazy to hope that this crisis could be what propels these ideas into action, but one thing about the dramatic change we are experiencing is that it does make other change feel more possible. We now see, for instance, that we donrsquot have to constantly travel around trailing emissions. People can stop flying. Homeless people can be put into empty Airbnb flats. The British state can reinvent itself at startling speed. The virus has brought many terrying changes with it ndash but some of the changes it has brought are in themselves, hope. Irsquoll water that.TWITCHYcoronavirus rulesThe curtains are twitching. The smartphones are twitching too, every time someone sees someone out in the park, not quite keeping the two-metre rule, even though they may be a group that lived crammed together in a small flat with zero outdoor space.

In another case, a dferent business was told the virus was SARS, but their policy excluded SARS and so they would not receive a payout either.These discrepancies have prompted outrage from politicians, with several SNP members now writing to the head of the ABI, Huw Evans, demanding urgent action.Case study:Business owner devastated by art school fire faces second insurance fight over Covid-Alyn Smith, SNP MP for Stirling, and John Nicolson, MP for Ochil and South Perthshire, are among those who wrote to Edwards this week explaining that they are ldquobeing contacted daily about the issue.Their letter states: ldquoThese businesses cannot operate, as per UK and Scottish Government instruction, and as a result have no income stream ... They remain extremely troubled by the potential closure of their business as a result of the stance taken by insurers.Smith said: ldquoI raised the conduct of insurance companies in parliament weeks ago, and since, sadly, like all my colleagues have had dozens of constituents getting in touch about insurance companies either trying to get out of their obligations or being posted missing when theyrsquore most needed.ldquoThe insurance industry is in trouble, I get it, the scale of the losses over this pandemic are dwarfing anything the insurance or global reinsurance market have ever seen.ldquoI do think there is a need for the state to stand behind some or all of the policies to ensure people have certainty and am glad our Treasury spokesperson Alison Thewlis has been so active in pressing this case.ldquoBut it is simply not good enough. Businesses have taken precautions in good faith and are finding their expensive policies to be worthless. We need to see the UK lose the laissez faire attitude and get in about these companies.Dr Liz Cameron, chief executive of the Scottish Chambers of Commerce, said that the SCC was aware of businesses facing problems with their insurers, adding: ldquoEarlier this year, the Scottish Government and UK Government formally declared that coronavirus was a lsquonotiable diseasersquo. This would normally help companies seek compensation through their insurance policies in the event of any cancellations they may have to make as a result of the spread of the virus.: Fears grow over Covid- debt crisisldquoWe urge businesses to engage directly with their insurer or broker to discuss and confirm the type of cover that they have purchased and whether or not it covers coronavirus. This pandemic is an unparalleled crisis in modern times and we urge insurers to be as collaborative and supportive as possible.rsquorsquoHowever, the ABI says that, while insurers are preparing to pay out up to poundbn in total to cover travel, retail and entertainment industries, they simply cannot be responsible for funding everyone who has lost out during the pandemicthey do not have policies which cover them.The body is also calling for talks with the Government on how to make pandemic cover more affordable for all firms, in case such an unprecedented situation arises in the future.An ABI spokesman said: ldquoInsurers understand that this is a very worrying and uncertain time for all businesses. Some businesses may have bought pandemic insurance that will pay out for Covid- but most will have not.ldquoIt is expected that coronavirus-related claims will be well in excess of pound billion in the UK spread over at least a dozen dferent types of insurance, including cover for business.ldquoNo country in the world is able to offer widespread pandemic insurance. If insurers paid out for cover that wasnrsquot included in contracts it would be a shortcut to their insolvency. For pandemic insurance to be more widespread, there needs to be some form of government support. Once we are through this we need a debate about how this can best be achieved.:Coronavirus: A timeline showing the UK regions with the highest number of casesWatchdogs the Financial Conduct Authority and the Financial Ombudsman Service said they were aware of the problems affecting firms, with the FCA confirming they had already started receiving complaints about insurers failing to pay out."},{"url":null,"title":"rosemary-gorings-country-life-eery-silence-lambs","story":"Had anyone been so sneaky, it would have been a bad move.

But as whisky expert Angus MacRaild was about to find, behind the doors of the impressive property lurked an intoxicating and quite unexpected treasure trove unlike anything he had ever seen before.ldquoI was in the middle of Colorado, several thousand feet above sea level and feeling rather spaced out from jet lag, he recalls.ldquoI was quite discombobulated anyway. But inside this grand house and down the stairs in the basement was a wooden led room ndash a whisky cellar.As he crossed the tartan carpet, his jaw dropped. ldquoThe wooden shelves stretched from the carpet to rafters, specially designed for this whisky collection, he recalls.ldquoNo-one knew about this. It was like a preserved Aladdinrsquos Cave of treasures. It was remarkable.Whisky expert MacRaild had been dispatched to the high plains of Colorado to check out a collection of malt whiskies gathered by a very private enthusiast.What he found was a real-le whisky galore.On each shelf was crammed bottle after bottle of single malt whisky rarities. A  Macallan Fine and Rare -year-old worth an eye-watering pound million, bottle after bottle of  Black Bowmore ndash each one estimated at pound, ndash a Glenfiddich  Rare Collection , one of just  bottles ever produced, and dozens of highly sought-after bottles from lost distilleries: Dallas Dhu, Glenugie, Killyloch, some almost a century old.Still reeling from encountering one of the worldrsquos most stunning and secret collections of single malt whisky, MacRaild spotted something  that would make his heart sing.ldquoAt the back was a typical pub wood bar with a gantry and a wee sink. It was jammed full of bottles.ldquoIt was ridiculous, he laughs. ldquoThere would be a fairly standard bottle of whisky that would cost maybe  or  sitting next to a bottle that was worth ,.ldquoThat was his drinking stock, stuffed behind the bar, ready to be drunk.ldquoThat told me this collector was first and foremost a drinker who loved the social aspect of Scotch whisky.It seemed Gooding ndash who had been raised surrounded by soft drinks bottles so could be forgiven for enjoying the clink of a glass bottle against a tumbler ndash wasnrsquot collecting because he wanted to make a buck. Rather, this was a man who quite simply adored a decent dram.In the coming week, Perthshire-based Whisky Auctioneer will carry out the second part of its sale of Richard Goodingrsquos single malt whiskies ndash named ldquoThe Perfect Collection.The first, in February, saw more than , malts from the collection attract , bidders from  countries. Highlights included a rare Macallan  Valerio Adami -year-old which alone sold for a record-breaking pound,.It raised more than pound million.The second instalment of the collection consisting of almost , bottles went on sale on Friday and will continue for a further eight days. It is expected to achieve a similar sum.Part of the collectionrsquos charm, says MacRaild, is it eccentricity, quality and the fact that no-one knew it was there.ldquoIt was collected before whisky collecting took off as a global phenomenon,\" he says. \"It was an age of innocence when collecting whisky was a niche thing.ldquoThe internet came and changed the face of what was just a hobby.Born in Denverrsquos wealthy Belcaro neighbourhood in , Richard Goodings financial clout to lavish cash on fine whisky was never a problem.His grandfather, James A Gooding, launched the Pepsi Cola Bottling Company of Denver in , supplying bottles of soft drink across Colorado and parts of surrounding states.After his father retired, Gooding took over as owner and chief executive officer. However, his tenure only lasted from  to  when, aged , he decided to sell the company back to the parent corporation.The move brought him a fortune ndash his wealth was rumoured to be in the region of  million.And what better way to celebrate than with a dram or two However, nipping to his local Walmart was not going to bring Richard Gooding the liquid treasures he sought.His personal pilot, a silver-haired chap called Kirk with a bushy white moustache, recalls frequent jaunts across the Atlantic with Gooding in search of single malt whiskies.Speaking in a video produced for the Perthshire company organising the sale of Goodingrsquos collection, Whisky Auctioneers, he offers a fascinating insight into the lestyle that money can bring.ldquoWe went to Ireland, Scotland,  or  trips specically for auctions for purchasing whisky, he says.ldquoWe pulled up to Talisker and just knocked on the door. People answered and they gave us tours. It was before all the tasting rooms were open and all the displays and stuff like that.ldquoHe would go to Macallan and start taking to the people, saying lsquoOkay, I would like to have this one and this and that one and that onersquo.ldquoAnd they are looking at him and saying, lsquoDo you want this, or this rsquo And he would say lsquoI want them all!rsquo.ldquoHe was into the whisky business long before it became as popular as it is today, he adds.ldquoHe tasted a lot of them when we were on these trips, but the majority of his purpose was to have a collection of one of everything that was ever made.ldquoThe lsquoperfect collectionrsquo.Gooding, with a self-taught knowledge of whisky and very deep pockets, enjoyed a warm welcome at distilleries which were still to witness the global explosion in whisky collecting that exists today.ldquoIt was a golden age when you could find an incredible array of bottles, adds MacRaild.ldquoApparently he just turned up and bought stuff. He would go around Speyside with his driver and stop off at distilleries to see what was interesting.ldquoHe would go to Gordon  MacPhail, the whisky specialist shop in Elgin which had incredible stocks, and fill his boots.Gooding bought at the perfect time ndash many of the bottles he acquired  years ago for a few hundred pounds are now worth several thousands.ldquoRichardrsquos mission was to collect a bottle that represented every single distillery, said his we Nancy, who he had met at high school in Denver.Perhaps she was too busy enjoying her collection of horses to pay much attention to her husbandrsquos wood-led cellar, groaning with bottles and where he would happily consume parts of his collection at the bar.ldquoHe opened a lot of bottles with his friends, says MacRaild, who has helped to catalogue the collection for the auction sale.ldquoYou would find a fairly standard bottle of whisky that would have cost maybe  or  sitting next to a bottle that was worth ,.Yet, perhaps strangely for a man who built one of the worldrsquos most impressive whisky collections, his lersquos passion is absent from the obituary in the Denver Post following his death at the age of  after an -year struggle with melanoma.Described as a ldquoquiet and generous philanthropist who did not enjoy the limelight, among his interests ndash aviation, boat design, architecture, music, language, food and travel ndash whisky does not get a mention.ldquoHe was a person who enjoyed the concept of design, his obituary adds, perhaps an explanation for those remarkable wooden shelves, heaving with bottles of ious shapes, some with artistically designed labels, others strikingly plain, such as the most expensive of the current lot, that  Macallan Fine and Rare -year-old And like that perfectly arranged collection, he took pride in presentation: he didnrsquot do ldquodressing down, preferring a well-cut suit worn with a carefully-chosen shirt ndash he would always wear pink on a Wednesday as a tribute to all fighting breast cancer.His colourful collections of shirts were matched by one of his ldquosignature Leonard Paris silk ties.ldquoHis collection of ties has to be record-setting for quantity and iety, his obituary adds.Of course, ties are not what Richard Gooding is now known for.Experts who have sted through his whisky collection have described it as one of the most exciting discoveries of the whisky world. Itrsquos ldquojaw-dropping, ldquonothing short of overwhelming, ldquoeclectic and ldquopeerless, they say.Yet MacRaild says Richard Gooding was probably no dferent to the rest of us.He simply loved a dram.ldquoOnce you are bitten by the Scotch bug, thatrsquos it for le. Itrsquos a lelong passion. Itrsquos social, you can always learn more, therersquos always something to discover and at the end of the day itrsquos a delicious drink, he says.ldquoFor a pleasurable evening with pals, itrsquos intellectual nourishment, great flavour, history and geography, all those stories attached.ldquoRichard Gooding loved the liquid.ldquoHe bought whisky for his own pleasure ndash and he enjoyed it.Auction highlights - three bottles and what the catalogue says about themBowmore  Largiemeanoch  Year OldIslayrsquos oldest working distillery, Bowmore was established in  and is now regarded as one of the most popular malts not only on Islay, but in the whole of Scotland. The distillery was acquired by Stanley P Morrison in , ushering in an era of iconic single malts, including the legendary Black Bowmore, credited by many as the genesis of whisky collecting, bottled in . The distillery was bought under the control Suntory the year before , and it remains one of the most collectible brands in Scotch whisky today.This is an incredibly rare example, bottled under the Largiemeanoch label, a brand devised for a series of private bottlings for The Howgate Wine Co in Edinburgh in the late s.A legendary bottle of whisky, distilled at Bowmore in  and bottled from a vatting of three sherry casks. A -year-old was also bottled.Glenlivet Liqueur Scotch Mayor, Sworder and Co circa sThis was bottled by Mayor, Sworder  Co, a fine wine merchant from London. Up until the mid-s, the company also had many dealings in spirits, bottling whisky and gin. The firm contracted blends from Bulloch Lade, but also produced its own label called Red Monogram.It regularly received fillings of Glenlivet and Ardbeg for its production, and in earlier years, sought-after Longmorn malt as well. These casks would occasionally be bottled as single malts for the companys more discerning customers, as was the case here. Its Glenlivet was often pre-vatted for blending purposes, so bottled as a single malt here with an undiscernible vintage or age statement. This was bottled at some point in the early s.The early reverence for this now iconic Speyside distillery is clear in the wax dipping of these bottle tops, a practice the firm usually reserved for its high-end vintage port.Glenfiddich  Peter J RussellGlenfiddich was an early advocate of the single malt Scotch category, and its faith is rewarded today by being one of the best-selling Scotch brands in the world. It became the first distillery to market its single malt brand in , and was the first to open its facility to visitors. Glenfiddich was an important trailblazer in the whisky industry, whose contribution cannot be forgotten. The scale of its operation today is a testament to this.This is a spectacular example of one of the distillerys early single malts, bottled here especially for Peter J Russell  Co in Edinburgh.Pre-war vintages in single malt are exceptionally rare, particularly from distilleries like Glenfiddich. This is a real opportunity to own a true piece of whisky history.Longrow  First Distillation - Last CaskFirst distilled in , Longrow is the peated single malt produced at Springbank distillery. Although very popular, Longrow remains an elusive whisky, with only - casks of it filled at the distillery each year. Early champions of this spirit included the legendary Italian bottler, Silvano Samaroli, who bought and bottled a number of famous casks from the inaugural vintage, and is credited by many with a good deal of the brands success. It remains revered by connoisseurs to this day. ######This special release was bottled from cask #, the last to be filled during the inaugural year of production in ."},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus-scotland-ron-mckays-alternative-easter","story":"Itrsquos Easter Sunday and the usual rituals are mothballed.

Thatrsquos out, of course, with lockdown, which is pleasing to about half of the population.In the Philippines, devout Catholics practice self-crucixion and flagellation, which can, of course, be done at home with a dogrsquos lead or aof barbed wire, but tends to play havoc with the soft furnishings.Instead, the scourging should be done with wall-to-wall episodes of Mrs Brown complete with subtitles, which wonrsquot make any more sense than the spoken word.The Easter Bunny eschews visiting New Zealand, and who can blame itbecause in Otago, while wersquore rolling our eggs, they grab their guns and go on The Great Easter Bunny Hunt, with a top prize for the most flopsies killed.

This can still be done it you live in a high flat but itrsquos not likely to bolster community spirit.Why not just mix washing-up liquid in a bowl with water and make bubble wands from wire or coat hangers ndash you can even loop your thumb and first finger to make one, although itrsquos a touch messy ndash and blow them out the window. Although itrsquos a lot quicker and more fun with the bucket of water.In Greece, they paint eggs completely red, symbolising that Christ blood again, but also the stuff under the skin which keeps us alive. This presents two linked problems.First off you probably canrsquot get any eggs in the supermarket, because the shelves have been pillaged, and certainly not the free range ones because all the eco-conscious hoarders have nabbed them. Then therersquos the paint problem.With many DIY emporia closed for the duration, where are you going to get the paint  Perhaps therersquos lipstick lying around of vaguely the right shade  Crayons  You could let a vein, but that seems a little extreme, and you canrsquot invite a self-flagellator round, what with the distancing.

This clearly canrsquot be done today, for all of the reasons already stated. If you are community-spirited you could donate to a foodbank, or lob a goodie at a neighbour out for the permitted walk or,you dont like them, a brick.In Corfu, they gather at their windows at am and when the church bell sounds hurl water-filled crockery and jugs into the street, the symbolism of which is to create an earthquake like the one which is supposed to have occurred with Christrsquos resurrection, or alternatively may just be a way of letting off steam.I suspect itrsquos probably sponsored by a pottery company or a household goods shop.

We all have habits that we perform every single day, we make cups of tea, we brush our teeth, we have a glass of water. What I want to show you is a way we can take advantage of these current habits, to make new habits. So, letrsquos take my example of drinking tea.While Irsquom waiting for my tea to brew, I can practice doing push ups. Over time doing push-ups will become a new habit attached on to my old habit of making tea.PracticeThe next point is, I would like you to think of these exercises as practice not training. In training itrsquos easy to get bogged down by sets and reps but these are not important for practice. In practice, we arenrsquot concentrating on how many reps we can do but rather on the movement itself.Practice is as much about increasing our own body awareness as it is about performing the exercise. Try and do these exercises slowly and with focus. Ask yourself questions like, where am I generating tension in my body now If yoursquore struggling to focus as the exercise is too easy or too hard, each video will show you some iations that you may find easier or harder.FormThe last point I want to talk about is Form.No-onersquos form is perfect when theyrsquore starting out with a new exercise. We all find it dficult doing something new, so donrsquot beat yourself up about it and more importantly donrsquot give up in frustration.Dficulty gives an opportunity to improve.In each of the videorsquos wersquoll give you some pointers to help improve your form. We need feedback in order to make adjustments to improve this form.

Coronavirus is a threat to our very way of le, and it is right that we have put political dferences aside to tackle it together.I took part in the COBR meeting on Thursday, also attended by the First Minister and ministers across the UK, where we agreed that we need to continue to be guided by the science and maintain the current restrictions. I know that will disappoint many people who had been hoping for a relaxation in the rules, but that is simply not possible at this point.

Children want to play in the park with friends, and grandparents look forward to seeing their grandchildren. And, of course, it is a hugely special time for churches and synagogues across Scotland, when so many people normally come together.But this Easter, it just cannot be.

Many are full colour scans from paper originals.Technology and a certain BBC TV show, says Mr Ferguson, have combined to turbo-charge the popularity of genealogy as a hobby ndash and therersquos no sign of a slowdown.ldquoI would say there has been growth in the number of people being interested in family history, certainly, particularly around ten years ago, when Who Do You Think You Are was on television, he adds.ldquoAnd, as time has progressed, more and more records have been put up by family history societies and so on. People are far more keen. They have a thirst for knowledge.Itrsquos good to talkWhile technology undoubtedly supports the task of discovering an ancestor or their involvement in a major historical event, theres no substitute for conversation with family when it comes to unearthing the most exciting clues.Grandparents, aunts, uncles and, of course, mum and dad should all be among the first ports of call. Even older siblings and cousins can helpelderly relatives have passed away. And video chat apps mean the coronavirus lockdown is no obstacle to enjoying quality, face-to-face contact.ldquoTalking to your family is hugely important, says Tahitia McCabe, Genealogical Studies Postgraduate Programme Course Director at the University of Strathclyde.ldquoItrsquos the way you get the juicy bits - the stories and all the interesting stuff. Genealogy is about bringing history, people and places to le.ldquoThe official records donrsquot tell you the lsquowhyrsquo. They can only really capture the interface with governments and organisations, all the formal things that happen in your le. But there are lots of things that happen that donrsquot get captured in a formal way.Moving the focus of genealogy beyond official records and on to real human relationships is crucial to its wider appeal, says Ms McCabe, adding that the number of people under  attending her courses is definitely ldquocreeping up.The broader pictureAn accurate record of inidual events is vital but so is context - and few institutions are better equipped to provide this than the National Library of Scotland .Its huge multi-media archiveis a gold mine for digital genealogists and historians of all ages, particularly those seeking information about ancestors caught up in the two world wars.Lists of officers enrolled in the army, navy and air force, and an extensive collection of black-and-white photographs from the Western Front, are available free of charge. Also on offer are clan histories, maps and a moving image archive containing footage from communities across the country. Lucy Church, NLS reference services assistant, says such resources are vital for adding a social dimension to the raw information set out in documents such as birth, marriage and death certicates.ldquoPeople use [our collection] to find out about specic iniduals but what itrsquos best for is the bigger picture ndash social and local history, for example, she adds.ldquoWhat we have available has vastly increased in recent years. Since the internet has been available, the archiving world has really engaged with it - and how we can provide a service through it.Stressing that staff are always on hand to assist home users in dficulty, she says: ldquoIf you think of institutions like ourselves, the National Museum of Scotland, National Records ndash they all have really excellent websites. The best way [for people] to familiarise themselves with the collection is to have a look and just be guided by what their particular interest is.Parents in particular will find Scotlandrsquos major cultural institutions invaluable when theyre trying to keep children busy. The NLS website features a wide-ranging learning zone with materials about topics such as the womenrsquos suffrage movement.The Battle of Prestonpans Heritage Trust, meanwhile, has created dedicated online resourceswhich its leaders hope will inspire youngsters to create prose, poetry and art about Bonnie Prince Charliersquos famous victory in  over a government army led by Sir John Cope. Entries will be published online and organisers hope to include as many as possible in a special commemorative book to mark the battlersquos th anniversary.Also offering online home schooling assistance is the National Wallace Monument, which has launched a video series to help young people learn about William Wallace and the Wars of Scottish Independence. Available at www.nationalwallacemonument, it is aimed at children aged between  and  who are encouraged to watch the videos and answer questions based on the content.Catherine Morrison, Learning and Volunteer Co-ordinator at Stirling District Tourism, says: ldquoUsually, Irsquom hosting trips for school children at the Monument, or visiting schools to teach them all about William Wallace. These are things wersquore not currently able to do, but we wanted to do something to support parents and keep their children learning about history.Sidebar ndash top tips for the budding genealogist Start with what you know. Begin by writing down everything you know about your family ndash names, dates of birth, places of residence. Evenall you have are rough dates and more questions than answers, itrsquos a place to launch your project. Talk to your family ndash do this sooner rather than later. If elderly relatives have all passed away, try older siblings or cousins. Search official records. Generally, yoursquoll want to try and obtain birth, marriage and death information for your ancestors and anyone  on your tree that is of interest. Plus, finding them on available census records is of primary importance. Itrsquos best to start as close to the present as possible and work your way back. That way you can usually very facts with your memories and records, or by checking with other family members. Once you have built up your skills, keep going! You could get involved in new projects such as a transcription or indexing project in your spare time. This is a great way to expand skills in deciphering old handwriting. It also supports the genealogy community as a whole."},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus-scotland-comment-finance-secretary-kate-forbes","story":"The overall economic impact will be severe and we are treating it as an economic emergency triggered by the enormity of the health emergency we all face.We know that the challenges for Scottish businesses are acute so we are working to deliver three main economic aims. The first is to keep companies in business and with productive capacity so that they can recover.The second is to keep staff in employment with appropriate income protection and support.And the third and most important aim is to provide support to staff so that they can self-isolate and care for their loved ones.That is why we are doing all we can to protect peoplersquos lives and protect their livelihoods too.As we promised, we are passing every penny from all the funds received from the UK Government on to businesses and iniduals impacted by this crisis.We have introduced a package of relief and grants worth pound. billion. This will ensure that small businesses receiving the Small Business Bonus Scheme or Rural Relief will be eligible for a pound, grant. Hospitality, leisure and retail properties with a rateable value between pound, and pound, are eligible for a pound, grant.On business rates, we have effectively frozen the poundage rate next year and are providing relief for properties in hospitality, leisure and retail.While we are focused on ensuring this vital financial support helps as many businesses and employers as possible, we are clear that our responsibility is to meet the unique needs and circumstances of Scotlandrsquos economy. These are dferent to the rest of the UK.Proportionately we have a higher share of employees in small and medium size businesses than both England and the rest of the UK as a whole.As a result of the steps taken so far, hundreds more businesses are benefiting from our support compared with where and we have also been able to help sectors of the economy that are not being supported in other parts of the UK such as aviation, seafood fishing and fish processing, the creative industries and charities.We will continue to listen to the needs of businesses across Scotland to ensure they are receiving the maximum possible help and support. Crucially we will also continue to engage with the trade union movement to ensure employeesrsquo needs and concerns are being heard.And we will continue to urge the UK Government to deliver the greater level of support we need in Scotland because of our larger number of small businesses, rather than allocating funding on population share.Kate Forbes is the Scottish Governments Cabinet Secretary for Finance"},{"url":null,"title":"david-pratt-world-needs-journalists-ever","story":"Part memento, part reference documents should I ever need to apply for them again, together they represent a kind of reporterrsquos gazetteer, gleaned from government ministries, the military, and other authorities across the globe.South Sudan, Angola, Afghanistan, Iraq, Bosnia, Israel, Ukraine, and so the list of countries from where they were issued goes on.As one of the biggest stories of modern times now makes its mark on the world, that box of passes and permission letters got me thinking as to how my journalist colleagues and their ability to work is being impacted upon by the coronavirus pandemic.Like many of us during these lockdown days, Irsquove resorted to Zoom or Skype calls for talking to my friends and colleagues, many of them based in far-flung places.What Irsquom hearing during these chats are often troubling and at times alarming accounts of how press freedom is faring and the threats to the industry in which I have spent most of my adult le.For a long time now, in the eyes of some among the general public, journalists have generally been regarded as being about as worthy as something you would scrape off the sole of your shoe. Personally, Irsquove lost count of the times iniduals have rolled their eyes and given me contemptuous looks on hearing that I was ldquoa hack.What especially sticks in the craw is that rarely,ever, do they bother to ask what,anything, I specically do as a journalist. Simply being one is enough to warrant their disdain.A few days ago, on Twitter, I noticed a colleague urging people to buy a newspaper.His appeal was an existential one highlighting how some titles might disappear given the economic impact of the coronavirus.ldquoHelp newspapers survive, he implored in his tweet. ldquoYou can buy one for the price of a coffee.Some of the replies bore all the hallmarks of those smugly ignorant of whatrsquos truly at stake here.ldquoIrsquod rather buy a coffee, replied one person sarcastically.\"Good riddancethey do disappear, dismissed another casually.Concern over the loss of peoplersquos livelihood aside, it strikes me that some detractors of the media need to step back and examine whether their motives are often shaped more by the fact they simply donrsquot like being told things they disagree with.Irsquom the first to admit that within the mediarsquos ranks there are those whose behaviour has cast an unfavourable shadow on the profession.But therersquos an obvious injustice and even danger in tarring all journalism with the same brush, or blithely believing that all reporters are prepared to ride roughshod over the people whose stories they cover.Critics must realise too that journalism in the right hands is not just a positive tool, but a necessity when the cacophony of political opinion, ideology and downright lies threatens to drown out the space reserved for facts and truth.Within a growing climate of blanket cynicism, prejudice and criticism towards the press there remains little room these days, it seems, for asking the vital question: why does journalism ndash especially good journalism ndash matter Personally, Irsquove always felt the answer is perfectly summed up in the words that run across the front page of one of the worldrsquos great newspapers The Washington Post.ldquoDemocracy Dies in Darkness, the motto on the masthead declares, in a warning as resonant right now as it could ever be.Speaking with international colleagues, what I repeatedly hear is how the pandemic is testing the resilience of journalists and independent media almost everywhere. What worries them even more is how this works to the detriment and danger of many ordinary citizens likely to become infected.There are historical parallels here. As thesame Washington Post highlighted last week, as far back as  during the virus that then swept Europe killing tens of millions, the newspapers in Europe told readers of the ldquoSpanish flu.They told readers too that King Alfonso XIII of Spain was one of many stricken, but what they didnrsquot report was that their own populations were being simultaneously decimated.This was all down to wartime censorship in many European countries, meaning few citizens even knew that the largest pandemic in modern history was already culling countless numbers in their midst.It was only Spain, a nation neutral in the fight, that allowed its press to work largely uncensored, and so it was that stories of the contagion reached the wider world.If this sounds familiar then perhaps itrsquos because in January, despite efforts by the Chinese authorities to clamp down on reporting of what became identied as coronavirus in the country, journalists doggedly investigated the story ndash and the rest of the world as a result slowly woke up to what was happening.If that story had remained stled even longer by Chinese government censorship, chances are the world would have been even slower in responding as the virus spread. Therersquos a lesson here for us all, one that shows how media freedom sits at the heart of helping tackle a fast moving crisis.Those like the ldquocommentators who replied so dismissively to my colleague on Twitter the other day as to the importance of the mediarsquos role in this crucial process might do well to ponder that.They might also consider the sacrices journalists globally are making to ensure their own citizens and those in the wider world are not kept in the dark. This too despite some governmentsrsquo efforts to exploit concerns over coverage of the pandemic to further hinder press freedoms and consolidate political rule.Already in some places there is widespread evidence of authorities resorting to constraining the movements of reporters or using imprisonment and violence to prevent them working. As citizens of a world inextricably connected, that should concern us all.As European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen warned last week, ldquonow, it is more important than ever that journalists are able to do their job freely and precisely, so as to counter disinformation and to ensure that our citizens have access to crucial information.The same day that Von der Leyen issued her warning, several international press freedom organisations jointly wrote a letter to the Strasbourg-based Council of Europe, a rights watchdog to help protect the free flow of information.Pointing to recent events in Hungary, where prime minister Viktor Orban under the pretext of addressing the Covid- public health emergency gave himself unlimited power, the press freedom groups highlighted how other governments have used swt moves to criminalise ldquopromoting  information.The organisations also expressed serious concern about ldquoexcessive restrictions on media access to government officials, decision makers, medical experts, with many governments reducing or eliminating the physical presence of journalists at press conferences. Examples cited included Slovenia and the Czech Republic, which have announced an end to press conferences altogether.The letter from the press freedom groups also pointed out that unchecked and enhanced surveillance, to combat the spread of the virus, ldquoendangers privacy and datarights and journalistsrsquo ability to protect sources.Hungaryrsquos autocratic PM Viktor Orban is far from alone in using the current crisis to curb press freedoms. As Rachael Jolley, editor-in-chief of Index on Censorship brought to attention last week, Brazilrsquos right-wing president, Jair Bolsonaro, has suspended the countryrsquos Freedom of Information Act.In South Africa, meanwhile, the government there has stopped epidemiologists, virologists, infectious disease specialists and other experts from commenting in the media on Covid-, and insists that all requests for comment be directed to the National Institute for Communicable Diseases.Elsewhere, though, there is evidence that the restrictions on reporting and actions taken against journalists, in the name of ldquosecurity, have been totally disproportionate and often politically motivated.In Africa, since lockdowns began, journalists across the continent are reporting a sharp rise in physical attacks by security forces as they attempt to report on Covid-. Many reporters say they are fearful for their lives.ldquoI saw a parked military vehicle. A female military officer got out and came towards me. She called me and asked: lsquoAre you guys writing stories about us  Why are you doing that  We arenrsquot happy about that, Irsquom warning you.rsquoThis was how Ghanaian journalist Yuss Abdul-Ganiyu, the local correspondent for the German public international broadcaster Deutsche Welle , recently told of what he experienced.Moments after being approached by the female soldier, Abdul-Ganiyu was severely clubbed from behind, before being taken into police custody where soldiers confiscated his recording equipment.It was only later that he established what had triggered the attack on him and his arrest. Three days earlier, based on victim statements and eyewitness accounts, he had broadcast a report about an alleged case of military brutality against civilians during a coronavirus lockdown operation. The military insisted, however, he was spreading  information.Across the world countless similar reports of violence against reporters have been lodged with press and media rights monitoring groups.In Iran, a country where coronavirus cases have soared, authorities have moved to aggressively contain independent reporting about the virus by harassing and detaining journalists. Iranian officials have also ordered that the media only use official statistics when covering Covid-.Elsewhere, in places like the Philippines, journalists may face jail sentences of up to two months for ldquospreading  information about the virus and a fine of up to ,.Even in larger Western democracies the media finds itself the scapegoat and target. In the US, President Donald Trump has continued to belittle the press for its coverage of the virus at live press conferences and on Twitter. Last week,Trump actually deflected blame onto the Washington Post when asked about allegations that China ndash as well as Russia and Iran ndash is spreading coronavirus misinformation. Even right here on our doorstep in Scotland there have been concerns about limits being imposed on freedom of information accessOnly last week, Catherine Stihler, chief executive of the Open Knowledge Foundation which campaigns for openness across the world, criticised a Holyrood vote that was seen as a weakening of Freedom of Informationlegislation in Scotland during the coronavirus crisis.Under normal circumstances, the Scottish Government, the NHS and local authorities have  days to reply to FOI requests.As a result of the passage of the CoronavirusBill, this has been extended to  days.The Scottish Government argued the changes were necessary to relieve pressure on public bodies during the crisis.But others argued that restricting FOI would reduce transparency of government at a time when an open approach is essential.Both at home and overseas there are concerns that while in times such as these emergency legislation is sometimes necessary, it can often pass through parliamentary process with alarming speed ndash removing hard-won rights.And asall these challenges were not enough for a free and ing press, some also point to the economic impact of the pandemic on the media. As news outlets rapidly lose advertising revenues, many are bracing themselves for a massive downturn, threatening journalism globally.Certain countries to their credit have already recognised the longer-term implications of such a threat. Last week, Denmarkrsquos government focused on allocating around euro million to save its media.As in other sectors, job losses, salary cuts and political pressure in the media are all taking their toll during the current crisis, but itrsquos whatrsquos left of our journalism in its wake that is perhaps the biggest worry.In times of extraordinary crisis, governments often take the opportunity to roll back media freedom. The question now, however, is to what extent journalism can stave off such current threats and in future continue to right wrongs, hold power to account and cast much-needed light into the darker recesses of our world.That capacity cannot solely be dependent on the goodwill and commitment of those in power to do so. Irsquod like to think that many reading this would know that already, and,not, all the more reason for supporting a global press that reminds us of it."},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus-140-000-sign-petition-demanding-mps-10-000-work-from-home-fund-scrapped","story":"It comes after MPs have been offered an additional pound, each by the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authorityndash the body that audits expenses of those in the Commons ndash to pay for increased costs as they and their staff move to working from home during the Covid- lockdown.But some have expressed distaste at the decision to give MPs more funding while employees in the UK face being furloughed at % pay and others have lost their jobs due to the impact of coronavirus.:Coronavirus: Poverty, lockdown or missed Covid cases -

If someone is threatened by cattle, they are encouraged to release your dog and take the shortest route out of the field. As always pick up and remove all waste. A government spokesman said: #This is a temporary situation and it is more important now than ever to maintain good relationships between neighbours and within communities. This is not about restricting the general right of responsible non-motorised access to land but it is part of the wider approach to prevent COVID- deaths and preserving the nation’s food supplies.#Exercising access rights responsibly means respecting the needs of other people, and you will need to adapt your behaviour accordingly in the national effort to contain the spread of COVID-. Land managers should respect access rights, which are particularly important at this dficult time.

That meant some routine or non-urgent appointments were likely to be postponed.However, the changes did not apply to urgent or emergency illnesses, the management of poorly controlled or unstable long-term conditions or the provision of palliative and end-of-le care.NHS Shetland interim medical director Brian Chittick said he understood patients were hesitant to add to the burden of doctors and nurses at this dficult time or that they were afraid of catching Covid-.Mr Chittick said: “We need to stress this very important message – please do call your health centre and speak to a member of the clinical teamsomething is worrying you.“We don’t want serious conditions to be left untreated because this can lead to a serious medical situation that places your health or even your le at risk.”The Academy of Medical Royal Colleges message is:• Seek NHS help through your GP, NHS ,  or AEyou or your family become acutely unwell and believe that you may be suffering from a serious or le threatening condition• Continue with ongoing treatments for all medical conditions and attend any hospital or GP appointments that are requested.

Considering his past record as a caring inidual, including his efforts to help the homeless, that was not really surprising.But apart from manager Daniel Stendl, who waived his salary, others at the Edinburgh club appeared reluctant to follow Naismith’s example. Reports later suggested that no other Hearts player would be asked to take more than a  per cent reduction.Also last week it was claimed that Scotland manager Steve Clarke had accepted a  per cent cut, simply meaning his salary would go down from £, to £,.In England the men’s and women’s international bosses Gareth Southgate and Phil Neville apparently agreed to take  per cent less. In the former’s case he would still be pocketing £. million while Neville would get £,.At club level south of the border the situation is very inconsistent. Some managers, such as David Moyes, Eddie Howe and Graham Potter have volunteered to take a cut while Pep Guardiola donated a million euros to help fight the outbreak in Spain. There was a terrible poignancy to Guardiola’s generosity a few days later when it was reported that his -year-old mother had died as a result of the virus in Barcelona.But while most Premiership clubs have placed most non-playing staff on some kind of temporary leave, some receiving  per cent of their salary through the government’s job retention scheme, the situation with the majority of players is still unclear.This is a dficult situation and UK health minister Matt Hancock ruffled some feathers when he suggested that well-off footballers should consider doing more to help.Some journalists have even criticised Hancock, saying he was completely out of touch with what was actually happening. That was unfair. The minister was not speaking about the game in general, where players at lower-level clubs are paid a pittance compared with those at the top. He was merely highlighting the fact that many could easily survive with no pay at all for the foreseeable future.To put this in perspective, most players at Premiership level are earning several million a year, an increase of roughly two and a half times what they took home six years ago. A high proportion are on more than £, a week.At the top of the tree are Manchester United goalkeeper David De Gea and Man City midfielder Kevin De Bruyne, who are on over £ million and £ million respectively.Even a player I confess to never having heard of, Tanguy Ndombele of Tottenham Hotspur, is reportedly bagging £. million a year.In the Championship the average annual pay is considerably less, around £, a year or £, a week. And in the lower League Two it drops to £ or £ weekly, not all that much above the national average.During the current situation all these figures need to be taken into consideration. We should have no issue with lower-paid players still getting  per cent of their wages for doing nothing. They, like everyone , still have bills to pay.But for the multi-millionaires to grumble about being hit is about as hard to take as the coronavirus pandemic itself.No decision has yet been made about whether the football leagues in the UK will be completed, whenever the action begins again.In Scotland it has been proposed in some quarters that the title should just be handed to Celtic, as the Glasgow side had an almost unassailable lead when play stopped.Now a director of the other half of the Old Firm has suggested thatthat happened, their rivals would only be able to claim “eight and a half” in a rowthey were crowned champions.Personally I feel that this season’s scheduled fixtures should be played out, however long it takes. Only then should the - action start, evenit means a shortened campaign.There are currently eight premier ision football clubs in Shetland, all of which have been in existence for dferent s of time.Scalloway are the oldest, dating back to , with Lerwick sides Celtic and Thistle being able to trace their beginnings back to the early part of the th century.Spurs and Ness United both emerged during the s, with Whitedale, Whalsay and Delting joining the senior league more recently.Someone suggested to me that a best XI from each could be selected, to give players and supporters something to ponder over during the current period of uncertainty.There will no doubt be controversy over this, but that’s what opinion is all about. If anyone would like to submit their thoughts, or their own ideas of what their respective best sides would be, feel free to send them in.Next time I will give you the line-ups, in alphabetical order, from the past  years. Dferent formations may be used, depending on how many defenders, midfielders, or forwards are worthy of inclusion.Email me at j.tait@shetlandtimesyou have any suggestions..."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/MFS21-1.jpg","title":"theres gold on those","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineSeaweed in abundance was a ‘golden fringe’ to island le and for centuries provided food, fodder and fertilizer.. forexample # whether cast ashore by tideand storm or cut manually, and dferences in dialect which may reflect local dferencesin species types and uses to which they have been put over the generations.

The shot was clearly going just wide of the upright before Fraser MacDonald inadvertently erted it into his own net for a bizarre opener.”Under the canny guidance of manager Angie Murchison, Skye’s useful blend of youth and experience continued to revel on the big stage. Youngsters like Somhairle Macdonald, Ewen MacSween, John MacLean and Allan MacLeod had established themselves along with several survivors of the  team – Cowie, Willie MacRae, Peter Gordon, John ‘Bodach’ Mackenzie, Ally MacDonald and Ewen MacKinnon.With  minutes played the islanders doubled their advantage.McCormack takes up the action: “John MacLean delivered a corner into the danger area, and with keeper Kenny MacDonald under pressure Cowie took two attempts before slipping the ball over the line as he tumbled face-forward onto the pitch”.Skye’s fans were in dreamland but, as the reporter had noted: “Kyles are famous for their battling qualities”.By half time the match was level.From a powerful hit in from the right the ball broke to veteran Dan MacRae “who had time and space to place the shot beyond the reach of keeper MacKenzie.”Then, calamity struck Skye in the closing moments of the half.“Another massive hit in by Tom White caused panic in the Skye defence, and as MacKenzie lashed out in an attempted clearance the ball appeared to come back past him off team captain MacSween”.Seconds later it took an outstanding save from MacKenzie to deny Dallas Turner and prevent Kyles from turning around in the lead.Murchison’s men regrouped.“The second half had been underway less than  seconds before Skye retook the initiative thanks to a corner which was turned in by Cowie, with Peter Gordon hovering to pick up on any mistake.”For much of the second half Kyles were kept well away from the Skye danger area, but a fourth goal proved elusive – thanks in large part to legendary goalkeeper Kenny MacDonald.And with Skye just eight minutes away from sealing a place in the final the men in blue hauled themselves back from the brink.Our reporter said that Dallas Turner “had looked the likeliest threat” and it was the youngster who “saw a glimmer of an opening and fired in a shot which took a deflection and flew past Bodach MacKenzie and into the net”.“That was the signal for the islanders to lay siege to the Kyles goal and for the Tighnabruaich keeper to dig dep with a string of exceptional saves.”MacLean, Somhairle MacDonald , Gordon and Cowie were all denied before the whistle sounded to herald extra time.In “energy-sapping heat” it was hardly surprising that the added half hour was more low-key, but five minutes into the second period came a “glorious chance” for Skye.Referee Donne Fraser spotted an infringement in the area, and the islanders were awarded a penalty.Rankin stepped up, but was unable to make clean contact and the “scuffed spot hit was easily turned away by MacDonald”.And so to a penalty shoot-out. Both goalkeepers excelled themselves, MacDonald saving two, and MacKenzie doing likewise. With Kyles - ahead, Rankin had to score to force sudden death, but his shot sailed wide and it was Kyles who went through to the final.Ian McCormack concluded: “Rankin was hero as well as villain. Once he got the measure of Ronnie MacVicar he dictated play from the centre, giving a hundred per cent in effort and running himself into the ground in the process. Up front Willie Cowie was immense – especially for a player just back from injury.“And while the defence as a whole were tight, Willie MacRae at buckshee back gave another award-winning performance.“If there was a man of the match award it would undoubtedly have gone to Kyles keeper Kenny MacDonald, who had excellent cover from full back Fraser MacDonald.“Their most dangerous forward was Dallas Turner, while that veteran Dan MacRae showed he still has a few seasons left in him at the top level.”In the final Kingussie, in the middle of a run of seven-successive Camanachd Cup triumphs, proved too strong, though Kyles gave a good account of themselves and had taken the lead before succumbing to a - defeat.The redoubtable Kenny MacDonald was the final’s man of the match, but his remarkable career had still some way to run. Both he and namesake Fraser # the full back in the epic tussle of  – would again pick up winners’ medals in , by which time Kenny’s son Roddy had also emerged as a star of the sport.For Skye the wait for another shot at the big one goes on – with the club also missing out in semi finals in  and .Allan MacLeod, the current Skye co-manager, reflected on that game at Ballachulish – recalling that he played much of the first half without a contact lens.“I remember marking Dan MacRae – a fantastic player. But it was great chance for us.“We were the better side for much of it, but not for the first time Kenny MacDonald was the saviour for Kyles.“At the time Kingussie were virtually unstoppable and we’d have met them in their prime. Our chance of winning the cup may have been slim, but it would have been nice to have made the final.“A lot of that Skye team would have deserved a shot on that stage.”"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Covid-19.jpg","title":"details of covid 19 case on skye leaked to the free","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineAs of Friday th April, there were a total of  confirmed cases in the NHS Highland area, but the health board have not released any further details on where the cases originate.Amid fears that some people might still consider rural areas to be isolated and virus free, there have been calls for greater clarity on where cases are.

It was a Saturday afternoon and the game was a supposed friendly against Rothienorman.“Back then I was a hard man, or so I thought! I was up against a burly young farmer-type at centre-half. I had a couple of robust challenges with the lad and he warned me that next time he was having me! Two minutes later he came in from behind and elbowed me in the head, I shrugged it off and instead of walking away I turned around and said: #You ain’t big enough to put me down, kid.# The next thing I knew, the birds were tweeting around my head and my front teeth were missing!“The game was abandoned and I had to go to the emergency dentist that afternoon and had months of repair work afterward. He had to pay my dental bill and a £ fine. Torquil Mackenzie # a name I will take to my grave!” “I can#t remember how far back it was but it was a while ago — it was a cup final up in Uig against Portree. The game went to extra-time # we had Bruce Neil and Paul Flynn sent off but ended up winning something like -.“I remember John ‘Spod# Macleod scoring a goal and running up the touchline with his hands cupped over his ears to the once noisy Portree support who had given him dogs# abuse during the game. That lives long in the memory!” “It won#t come as a surprise to learn the best match was the title-winning game on th August , for many emotional reasons. We had a great campaign that year and had won  out of  games with only three matches remaining. We had to go to Kyleakin away on this date and they were the only team who could catch us in the title challenge.“It was a really nice summer evening and we had a strong team out, although leading striker John Murphy was unavailable through injury which meant young James Pringle played upfront with Craig Brown.“Kyleakin got out of the blocks quickly and we found ourselves - down early on in the match in front of a big crowd. We settled after that and played some decent stuff but Kyleakin, as usual, were well marshalled by Michael Taylor and we had dficulty in creating clear-cut opportunities. However, with  minutes to go, coach Ian MacLeod and I decided to put youngsters Ian Morrison and Angie MacPherson on each touchline to give us pace and width. The freshness seemed to galvanise us and with  minutes to go, we pulled a goal back through Craig Brown. It seemed the whole match swung on that goal, we picked up some real momentum and Brown scored again to equalise. Then with five minutes to go, we were awarded a penalty with two Kyleakin defenders tackling Brown as he broke into the box. Craig dusted himself down and scored the penalty in off the post # we were delirious on the sidelines. We saw out the game for our first-ever title and then won the remaining two games to make it  wins from  matches # it was a campaign never to be forgotten!” “It was my first game in charge, and funnily enough, it was also against Kyleakin. In those campaigns it was always the case that the first game of the season in the Bagshaw League pitted the reigning champions against the team which finished bottom the season before. The bottom club then had to play the runners-up from the previous season and so on, so it was very dficult for the clubs at the bottom to gain any early momentum.“We went down to Kyleakin with a whole bunch of youngsters against the likes of Scott Graham, the Nisbett clan, Darren Wainwright # who were all top players in the league at that time. We lost - and I swearit wasn#t for our young goalie Calum Montgomery making one save it could have been . But in essence, that is where I started from in management. We had great lads and not once did they let their heads go down in those early challenging years.”"},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_3069609.jpg--.jpg?1586507454000\n","title":"ve mural planned after covid casts doubt over street party","story":"AMBITIOUS plans for a special community celebration in Ballykeel to mark the th anniversary of VE day have had to drastically re-scaled.Ballykeel  Moving Forward community group had hoped to combine the best elements of a party with some great historical insights into the local connection of what became known as the peoples war.But that was before the restriction rules imposed due to the COVID outbreak.However, group members Pat and Jean Rainey remained determined to mark VE day which stands for Victory in Europe when the Allies completed the task of defeating Nazi Germany.VICTORYTo that end, the pair have been busily making materials for a special VE day wall mural to be placed on a wall overlooking Crebilly Road just opposite the entrance to Tesco.Jean said: “The victory came after six long years of war and at a terrible human cost.We wanted to blend in some enjoyable activities for our young people with some historical education - the sacrices made in the Second World War cannot be forgotten - but COVID scuppered those plans.We had organised WW era costumes and a special exhibition featuring photographs of many of the men and women from the local area who played their part in the conflict.”Now, members of the group will hold a ‘socially distanced’ commemoration when the new VE mural is completed on Friday, May  at .pm.

And this year, pregnant women also have to worry about Covid-, a virus that can affect a person’s lungs and airways.Last week, the UK government announced that pregnant women were at an increased risk of severe illness from coronavirus.However, the advice to pregnant women was described by Chief Medical Officer Chris Whitty as “a precautionary measure” because “we are early in our understanding of this virus and we want to be sure.”So how does the coronavirus crisis affect youyou are pregnant or have just had a baby This advice was compiled with the help of Dr David Glenn FRCOG, a Consultant Obstetrician and Gynaecologist at Kingsbridge Private Hospital and Clinical Director for Women and Child Health at Ulster Hospital.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseDr David Glenn FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappDr David GlennWhy are pregnant women in the high-risk category Pregnant women do not appear more likely to contract the infection than the general population. Pregnancy itself alters the body’s immune system and response to viral infections in general, which can occasionally be related to more severe symptoms and this will be the same for Covid-.Can a pregnant woman pass coronavirus on to her baby Transmission from mother to baby during the pregnancy or delivery is probable, although the proportion of pregnancies affected and the signicance to the baby has yet to be determined. Amniotic fluid, cord blood, neonatal throat swabs, placenta swabs, genital fluid and breastmilk samples from Covid- infected mothers have so far tested negative for the virus. However, a new report describes a case in which the baby born to a Covid- positive mother was found to have antibodies in their blood at birth. This is thought to represent a baby’s response to infection within the womb.Is there a greater chance of miscarriageyou test positive for Covid- There is currently no evidence of an increased risk of miscarriage or early pregnancy loss in relation to Covid-.Moreover, there is no evidence that the virus damages the baby. Despite recent evidence that the virus can be passed from mother to baby, the proportion of pregnancies affected and the signicance to the baby has yet to be determined.What symptoms should pregnant women be aware of, and what should they dothey are experiencing any of them If you are infected with Covid- you are still most likely to have no symptoms or a mild illness from which you will make a full recovery. Most women will experience only mild or moderate cold flu like symptoms. Cough, fever, shortness of breath, lack of smell taste and even gastrointestinal symptoms are other relevant presentations.For women who have had symptoms, antenatal appointments can be deferred until  days after the start of symptoms, unless symptomspersevere.For women who are self-isolating because someone in their household has possible symptoms of Covid-, appointments should be deferred for  days.If women develop more severe symptoms or her recovery is delayed, this may be a sign that they are developing a more signicant chest infection that requires enhanced care. In this situation you should contact your maternity care team.Are all antenatal appointments going ahead as normal in Northern Ireland If you are well at the moment and have had no complications in your previous pregnancies arrangements for your care may be altered but they are still important to attend.If you have a routine scan or visit due in the coming days, you will still need to attend but the appointment may change due to staffing requirements. Maternity care is essential to reduce complications in mothers and babies. Even in the context of coronavirus, it is important that pregnant women continue to attend their scheduled routine care when they are well.Pregnant women will be asked to keep the number of people with you to a minimum. This will include being asked to attend maternity appointments alone.There may also be a need to reduce the number of routine antenatal visits.If women have an urgent problem related to the pregnancy but not related to coronavirus, they should get in touch using the same emergency contact details they already have. They should not contact that number unless they have an urgent problem.If women have symptoms of coronavirus, they should contact their maternity service and they will arrange the right place and time for the visits. They should not attend a routine clinic.What risks are there of an expectant mother contracting Covid- on a trip to hospital for an antenatal appointment Maternity care is essential and has been developed over many years with improving success to reduce complications in mothers and babies. The risks of not attending care include harm to mother, her baby or both.Many provisions have been put in place to reduce risk to mothers. These include reducing the number of visits to the hospital to a minimum, advice to mothers on reducing the number of people travelling with mothers to the hospital, attending the appointments alone, keeping numbers reduced in waiting rooms, spacing patients in waiting areas, staff taking additional protective efforts to reduce transmission in clinics with hand washing, cleaning equipment etc.How prepared are hospitals to deal with pregnant women with the virus Very signicant changes have been occurring in hospitals over the past weeks to deal with pregnant women with Covid-. Signicant changes have been made in all areas of the hospital, from clinics to wards and including delivery suites. Practice drills are being run frequently to train staff, additional resources have been brought in to help and a huge effort has been made by all levels of non-clinical, clinical, administrative and management staff.If the mother of a baby has symptoms or tests positive for Covid-, should she isolate herself from the baby Given the current limited evidence, we advise that women and healthy infants, not otherwise requiring neonatal care, are kept together in the immediate post-partum period.A risks benefits discussion with neonatologists and families to inidualise care in babies who may be more susceptible is recommended.Can a new mother with the virus breastfeed The main risk of breastfeeding for infants is the close contact with the mother, who is likely to share infective droplets. In the light of the current evidence, it is advised that the benefits of breastfeeding outweigh any potential risks of transmission of the virus through breastmilk. Precautions should be taken to reduce spread to the baby such as, hand washing before touching the baby, avoiding coughing or sneezing on the baby while feeding, and considering wearing a face mask,available, while feeding or caring for the baby.Can a pregnant person be accompanied by a partner or have visitors A person in labour can be accompanied by one birthing partner, according to the new guidelines. No visitors are permitted in ante-natal or post-natal ward areas.Will babies continue to be delivered in all Northern Ireland hospitals No, not at Causeway Hospital in Coleraine. Antenatal services will continue but it is not possible to deliver babies in the hospital during this surge period.This is due to a lack skilled paediatricians available to provide emergency care to a baby born in distress throughout the  hour period. To protect the wellbeing of mothers and babies, women booked to deliver in Causeway will be contacted and have their delivery transferred to Antrim or Altnagelvin Hospital.Should parents introduce their newborn to friends and family Current government guidance is that you should not meet with people outside your household, so no family celebrations are permitted at present.Belfast ,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Castledawson man Jason is currently renting a flat on Ireton Street, off Botanic Avenue near Queen’s University in south Belfast with three other students. Jason said his letting agency were unsympathetic to the students’ situation, saying there was nothing they could do. He told Derry Now: “They said it wasn’t their problem – that was what guarantors were for. “The situation is that they won’t give us any sort of leeway in terms of paying it when they know we’re not in the house due to university being cancelled. googletag.cmd.push “They’ve said it’s not their problem because it’s privately rented and I understand that to a point, but common sense has to kick in somewhere.” Jason and his flatmates are renting their accommodation through USPM Ltd, a letting agent based on University Road and say they had to initiate contact about Covid-. “There’s very little contact with the letting agency unless you miss or have to arrange a payment. They hadn’t contacted us about the pandemic, we had to do the ringing,” said Jason. “I rang them, and our contact said they understood the frustration but there was nothing they could do. To them, we were renting a house in Belfast to live in. googletag.cmd.push “Our landlords are usually dead on, butthey had any sort of generosity, they could do something. It’s not always up to the person on the end of the phone.” While Jason is able to fall back on the support of his family, he realises not everyone has that support available. He said: “I have a few friends who wouldn’t come home as much, they don’t have a stable home to come home to and they’re paying rent through jobs in Belfast. “A lot of them were in part-time jobs and have now been laid off. They have no way to continue that, no income. It’s not a good situation for them.” Jason believes the ‘mortgage holidays’ mooted by the government could provide the solution to the problem, but that the options did not appear to be being explored. “Anybody renting privately is just being made to pay. There are no mortgage holidays coming into play,” he said. “We’re probably now having to pay- months where we aren’t there whereas we had been in years gone by. That’s probably half the year of not being in the house and having to pay for it. “If they can take mortgage holidays, there is absolutely no reason for us to be paying rent, except for making a profit.” Derry Now contacted UPSM Ltd for a response, but none was available at the time of going to print.

Its the time when things start to become very real, yet its a Hadrians Wall we all have to get over. The worry about what happens when the small talk runs out, only to be replaced with an uncomfortable silence. I didnt have that problem. Minutes into my visit, I was on the pigs back. One of the things I remember – apart from the never-ending flow of tea – was Paulines mother Bridie talking about school days in St Patricks Maghera, where she worked for  years. googletag.cmd.push The other was her father Patsy having the same fanaticism with talking football as I did. Hours later, a thousand balls were kicked, championships were won and lost, an th cup of tea was thrust in my direction before I headed for home. With the current social distancing, we are now talking in the window , yet little has changed. Before the more stringent lock-down, you were offered tea as soon as you land on the street with some of the weeks essentials and the chat has changed towards sporting nostalgia. “Mickey might make use of these,” Bridie said to Pauline on a visit, before the the lock-down. Yes that Mickey is me, but thats another story. googletag.cmd.push It was another stash of Maghera school magazines, The Patrician, going back to the early s. And low and behold, as I searched frantically for a photo of Niall Mullan to go with this weeks feature on Derry hurlings glory days, there he was in full flow in the  Patrician. TIME FOR CHANGE Like every media outlet, producing the County Derry Posts sport section has taken a change of direction. It involves more delving and conjuring. Gone are the reports and round-ups from the club league. The athletics, soccer and rugby seasons are on hold. The local cycling clubs have came to a halt. Now it is all about nostalgia. In these testing times, it gives our readers a chance to reflect on the past. We are living in unprecedented times. It takes a bit of readjusting, but sports writers are the lucky ones. We have a mountain of material out there – just begging to be sourced. There are stories waiting to be told. When researching Colum Rocks impact on Loups underage success of the early s, his nephew Ronan handed me a bag of scrapbooks. It was simply unbelievable. I am not from Loup, but it was compelling reading. Newspaper cuttings of match reports, previews and pen-pics. There was even a summary of each season and hopes of the next. I was relieved to leave them back. If I had lost them....lets just say, you couldnt replace them. For the Bellaghy piece a few weeks ago, Joe Cassidy was able to head to his father and mothers house in Ballynease and dig through the memories. If the walls could talk, they would tell the entire Bellaghy story, as well as the Derry pathway of their sons Joe and Damian. In an interview with teenager Enda Downey, before the postponed MacRory final, he mentioned his Granda and Granny Downeys collection of artefacts, including videos of games and how it gave him a taste of generations past, before he was even born. “We watched onethe other day and it was just catch and kick, it was so dferent to now,” he said of one of the s of videos, all stored away. The media industry has moved on. The newer generation is more au fait with online and getting their fix from social media. Thats the challenge we face, finding that balance. But, the last few weeks have reinforced one thing – there is no substitute for the hard copy. YouTube channels come and go, websites can vanish and hard drives can crash. On the other hand, a well archived set of papers, programmes and magazines is simply invaluable. As the pandemic continues, any glimmer of a date for the resumption of sport is far away over the horizon. When it arrives, we will embrace it like never before. My first visit to Patsy and Bridie Kennedy taught me well. Get the kettle boiled as soon as you can and lt the lid on all the great moments from the past.

Anyone caught neglecting to clean up after their dogs can now be issued with an pound fine and the council has wasted no time in getting the message across along some of the citys most popular walkways. Recently, Mayor of Derry City and Strabane District Council, Councillor Michaela Boyle, reminded the public of the need to take responsibility for their pets following an increase in the instances of dog fouling in recent weeks. Government measures to reduce the spread of the Covid  virus by limiting when the public can leave their home has led to an increase in walkers in local parks, greenways and public footpaths and with it more dog foul for Councils Cleansing teams to clean up. googletag.cmd.push Mayor Boyle urged dog owners to show respect for public health and other parks and greenway users when walking their pets. The vast majority of dog owners are conscientious and clean up after their dogs but there has been a noted increase in fouling since the new stay at home measures were introduced,” she said. Dog excrement left on our streets and parks poses a serious public health hazard and is putting extra pressure on our Cleansing team at this dficult time.  I would appeal to all owners to carry a bag to lt the dirt and dispose ofit in a designated dog bin where possible or in a black bin. googletag.cmd.push “Similarly, owners are reminded that when in designated pedestrian zones, dogs must be on a lead held by someone who is able to control it and owners should be mindful of other dogs and members of the public who could be scared of animals.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Kieran Stevenson was man of the match in their win over Antrim and Michael McMullan spoke with the Derry keeper, as he rekindled the memories of their golden era.  For  years, Derry had wandered around in Ulsters hurling wilderness. Until that moment. The  Ulster final was ticking towards a conclusion. Mickey Collins won a free which his brother Ollie drove between the posts at the Andersonstown Road end. Derry fans among the , strong Casement Park attendance exploded into another frenzy, as their caman-wielding heroes hit the front again. googletag.cmd.push Was this eventually going to be their day  Not just yet. There was time for Antrim to cast the dice one last time. Gary OKane composed himself over a stoppage time sideline cut. The wind carried the sliotar into the danger-zone, where vigilant Derry goalkeeper Kieran Stevenson deflected it wide. It was the last action and the final whistle kick-started an outpouring of emotion for the new Ulster champions. Bullfrog was the keeper in Banaghers three-in-a-row winning minor team, before moving into the county scene. An -year career began in , as understudy to Laveys Fergal Shorty McNally. The following year, he was second choice behind Padraig Oacute Mianaacutein when Derry won the All-Ireland B championship. googletag.cmd.push In , the Us lost to Antrimin the Ulster final. From that team, captain Colin McEldowney, Benny Ward, Mickey Conway, Gary Biggs and Geoffrey McGonigle would help spearhead Derry seniors towards Division One. The minors lost in the final that year, to the Saffrons, by an almost identical margin and Stevenson was the keeper on both teams. In , the Us took Antrim to a replay and  frees from the unerring Dermot Doherty, on his own Emmet Park turf, finished the job as Derry took the title in mid-week extra-time thriller. “That was a good win,” Stevenson recalls. “Antrim were always the team to beat, in terms of the county.” Things began to change. They ran Antrim to three points in the  senior final, but lost convincingly the following year. It was a spell in hurlings top tier that made the wheels of change turn that bit quicker. Promotion at the end of  began a four-year stint in the top flight. They ran Waterford to seven points at Ballinascreen in their first outing, before facing Cork and Kilkenny. The cream of hurling was lting Derrys standards. A -point slump to Tipperary, in Thurles, was their toughest afternoon. A one-point defeat in Laois was the one that got away, leaving Derry needing to beat Kerry in a relegation play-off to stay afloat before dropping down at end of the  campaign. “I think it as the Division One hurling that stuck to us and we were on an upward curve,” Stevenson feels. “There were more players added to the . “Derry hurlingwas about filling up the numbers and going out to play the matches. Then it changed and everybody was taking it serious. The club scene was improving and you could see the skill level going up from  to .” HARMONY In an interview three years ago, Conor Murray painted the Derry hurling scene he played on at the start of the noughties as a family. A unique one, with club rivalry left at the gates of Owenbeg and picked up on the way home. Stevenson agrees. “No club stuck to themselves, everybody got on well with everybody,” he said. Other managers werent chirping in players ears, telling them not to commit to the small ball game. In the  season, Kieran McKeever threw his lot in with the hurlers, while also playing in an Ulster football final weeks later. “Players were not restricted in playing for the county, in terms of hurling and everybody gelled,” Stevenson added A mountain of upside-down kit bags would be erected in the aisle of the team bus, with a coat thrown over it. Hey presto, they had a card table, around which they laughed on their journey to whatever battle they would later brace themselves for. It got more advanced when Stevenson, a kitchen manufacturer by trade, patented a custom-made card table. “When we were coming home, we were arm-wrestling on it and it was all a bit of craic,” he joked.  Emmett McKeever, Kieran McKeever and Geoffrey McGonigle celebrate Derrys  Ulster title. Steering the ship was Cushendall man Kevin McNaughton. After spending time helping foster Swatraghs structures and leading them to back to back intermediate championships, he came on board with Derry at the start of the  season. His trusted lieutenant, from the Swa, Roger Anthony Quinn, Laveys hurling godfather Tom Magill, Banaghers Gerard McCloskey and athletics coach Malcolm McCausland made up the management team. Heading up the M for the  final, Derry were in a decent place, following a - to - win over a Down team who had beaten New York in the quarter-final. Antrim were -point winners over London in their semi-final, but Derry blitzed them in the first half of the decider. Rookie defenders Emmett OHara and Declan McKillop were led a merry dance by the Derry attack. Ace attacker Geoffrey McGonigle and Emmett McKeever were missing through suspension. That told enough of the depth in Derrys squad. “We were getting better with playing all the better teams. There was plenty of skill, speed and fitness in the team. It was about trying to put it all together...it was a good ,” Stevenson explained. McKeever had been suspended after being sent off with Downs Noel Sands in the semi-final, on the advice of a linesman. With high-ranking officials on their July holidays, the appeal – lodged before the end of June – wasnt heard and McKeever would miss the final. “Beefywas our best player in defence...he was lethal,” Stevenson said of his captain. “We wanted to try and win it for him because he was hard done by. He was well-liked and in every match, hed have put his head in front of the hurl to stop the ball. “Antrim had Alistair Elliott, Gregory OKane was full-forward and Gary OKane started at centre half-forward, before going back .” DREAM START Kieran McKeever, Gary Biggs and Ollie Collins hit first half goals to leave Antrims foundations rocking. The Saffrons didnt score from play for  minutes. “We shouldve been further ahead,” said Stevenson of their - to - interval lead. “We had missed a pile of scoring opportunities and we were against the breeze in the second half. “We knewthe forwards were getting on the ball, they could score goals because they were skilful and quick.” Derrys backs were to the wall as Antrim notched  unanswered points and, with  minutes gone, went four points ahead. Derry replied with points to take the wind out of Antrims sails. Their case was helped further when John ODywer finished to the net for the crucial fourth Oakleafers goal. “It was the goals that won us the match,” Stevenson said. “I still have a hurling ball in the house, with the scorewritten on it.” All the press cuttings and programmes were kept too. A raft of memories from the glory years. But the hurl that deflected Gary OKanes last minute sideline cut to safety is long gone. “Some wee Belfast boy stole it,” Stevenson reckons. The Derry squad threw their history-making hurls on the turf to celebrate and within minutes they had vanished. “When the final was blown, it was more thepressure, you were always checking the time to see what was left. If the game had went onthere was less likelihood that we couldve won the game.” Conor Murray accepted the cup in the stand, before taking it down to the pitch for the suspended Emmett McKeever to again hoist it skywards to salute the magical moment. “We were there on merit,” was Stevensons assessment of their win. “We had a good defence and a good forward line. When you take the likes of John ODwyer, Geoffrey and Mickey Collins as your front three – you have a good side. “Conor Murray at full-back was safe, you had Collieand Niall Mullan in the corners.” Stevenson picked up the man of the match award and added to it with the Ulster hurler of the year accolade the following season when Derry retained their title. Later that night, the team partied into the wee small hours in Dungiven club. You could barely turn a sweet in your mouth. It was jam packed. Before that, on the joyous journey home, there was a poignant moment when the players got off the bus to carry the cup over the River Bann in Toome. “We had talked about it in previous years – the days when we were beaten,” Stevenson remembers. “It was a short walk, the boys were more interested in getting on the bus and heading on home.” Derrys fallow  years was over.

As one might expect there’s a strong representation from multiple John McLaughlin winners Ballinderry, Slaughtneil and Coleraine but I can’t believe some of the players that I have left out. However, I’m pretty sure thatan imaginary club was able to field this line-out in their prime, they’d not be far off lting the Andy Merrigan Cup. googletag.cmd.push  - MichaelConlan - Ballinderry A fixture between the sticks for Ballinderry for almost two decades, Mickey C was a good goalkeeper at the start of his career when winning an All-Ireland club medal in . By the s he seemed even better, maintaining a physical condition that would have been the envy of men  years his junior and adjusting to a massive transformation in what was expected from a modern goalkeeper. He just edges out Slaughtneil’s Antoin McMullan for the number one jersey.  - Karl McKaigue – Slaughtneil Karl might not be as well know as his elder brother, but he has been just as vital in Slaughtneil’s success. The archetype of the modern defender, who must meld man-marking skills with ability on the ball, McKaigue is often the initiation point for the Emmett’s attack. Has held some of the finest forwards in club football scoreless during Slaughtneil’s rise to national prominence including Conleith Gilligan, Ryan McHugh and Seanie Johnston. googletag.cmd.push  - Brendan Rogers Slaughtneil Another Emmets dual star Rogers, has been the defensive rock on which Slaughtneil’s success has been built. Named Ulster Club footballer of the year for , as a youngster Rogers initially chose to focus on hurling but has established himself as one of the football’s best defenders in not just Derry but Ulster, an automatic pick for this selection.  - Ciaran Mullan - Coleraine A superb athlete whose ball-carrying ability and pace have made him a nightmare for opposing forwards who end up spending much of their time tracking back into their own half. A key man as Coleraine claimed the John McLaughlin Cup for the first time in  and was still a fixture when they claimed their second title in .  - Kevin McGuckin - Ballinderry Another Ballinderry man with an All-Ireland medal in his pocket, the fact he was still making the starting  for the Shamrocks in  is testament to his qualities. A Rolls Royce of a footballer the former Derry captain’s experience was crucial as the Loughshore completed a hat-trick of victories between  and .  - Oisin Duffy - Foreglen It’s a measure of Oisin Duffy’s consistent excellence that he makes this selection based on performances in the Intermediate Championship. Could play any position in the backline, his strength and pace made him an effective man marker but equally comfortable in possession. Still as effective as ever as Foreglen claimed the Intermediate crown last October.  - Chrissy McKaigue - Slaughtneil First rose to prominence on the Derry minor side that reached the All-Ireland final in  the current Derry Captain has been a fixture for club and county for a decade. In addition to his evident abilities as a player, McKaigue provides the intangible qualities of leadership that every successful team needs. On the rare occasions that Slaughtneil find themselves floundering McKaigue is the man to whom his team-mates look to steady the ship.  - Patsy Bradley - Slaughtneil Another who’s career has spanned the ages, Patsy Bradley is an icon of Derry football. The quintessential quiet, hard man, Bradley’s aerial prowess rarely fails to catch the eye and his work-rate is immense. Has overcome injuries that might have restricted the career of lesser players Patsy’s toughness is the stuff of legend.  - Niall Holly - Coleraine Strong in the air and extremely mobile. Holly’s ball carrying skills have the been the starting point for countless Eoghan Rua attacks, with his languid style belying and athleticism allows him to glide past opponents. A perfect foil for the combative Bradley.  - Enda Muldoon - Ballinderry One of the most gted footballers ever to apply a boot to a size five, the Shamrocks man’s gts appeared to immune to the passing of the years as Ballinderry emulated their s antecedents in winning three in a row from  to . His ball to Raymond Wilkinson for the decisive goal in the  semi-final win over Banagher may be the best pass I have ever seen in club football.  - Benny Heron- Ballinascreen The only man in my team who doesn’t have some form of Championship winners medal to show for his efforts. Heron has been a prolic scorer for a Ballinascreen team that has regularly been in the mix for the John McLaughlin Cup without quite sealing the deal. With his phenomenal work rate and ability to score from both play and placed balls, Heron was a key factor in the St Colm’s club’s run to the  and  county finals.  - Sean Leo McGoldrick - Coleraine The oil that has kept the Coleraine engine running smoothly for a decade. Adaptable players can sometimes be the victims of their own versatility but Sean Leo McGoldrick’s quality is such that every manager in Derry would love to have him in their squad. One Coleraine mentor once told me that the one time in any game when he could relax was when Sean Leo had the ball because he knew it was secure. An incisive runner and an accurate passer the Eoghan Rua man can also chip in with a vital score when the occasion requires.  - Coilin Devlin - Ballinderry The flame-haired front man maybe didn’t have the profile of the other Ballinderry forward in this line-up but his impact for the Shamrocks in the early part of the decade was undeniable, bagged the decisive goal in the  final against Slaughtneil, and scored five points from play to earn man of the match honours in . Dooks pace and direct running made him a handful for opposing corner-backs.  - Colm McGoldrick - Coleraine The second member of the McGoldrick clan to make my team and you could make case for the inclusion of any of the brothers, but Colm is well worth his place. He was the fulcrum of the Eoghan Rua attack as they claimed their first county crown in . The intelligence of his movement is something that can’t be taught. As captain he scored four points in the  final as Coleraine doubled their tally of John McLaughlin Cups.  - Shane McGuigan - Slaughtneil The sharpest shooter in Derry club football in recent year. McGuigan’s scoring tallies speak for themselves scored - in the  Derry Championship and better that tally with - in . Performs well on the big stage top scored in the  Ulster final with - against Kilcoo and bagged - in ’s provincial triumph over Cavan Gaels. Every successful team needs a marquee man in their full-forward line, McGuigan is Slaughtneil’s. RELATED - Michael McMullans team of the decade- Click here...

As one might expect there’s a strong representation from multiple John McLaughlin winners Ballinderry, Slaughtneil and Coleraine but I can’t believe some of the players that I have left out. However, I’m pretty sure thatan imaginary club was able to field this line-out in their prime, they’d not be far off lting the Andy Merrigan Cup. googletag.cmd.push  - MichaelConlan - Ballinderry A fixture between the sticks for Ballinderry for almost two decades, Mickey C was a good goalkeeper at the start of his career when winning an All-Ireland club medal in . By the s he seemed even better, maintaining a physical condition that would have been the envy of men  years his junior and adjusting to a massive transformation in what was expected from a modern goalkeeper. He just edges out Slaughtneil’s Antoin McMullan for the number one jersey.  - Karl McKaigue – Slaughtneil Karl might not be as well know as his elder brother, but he has been just as vital in Slaughtneil’s success. The archetype of the modern defender, who must meld man-marking skills with ability on the ball, McKaigue is often the initiation point for the Emmett’s attack. Has held some of the finest forwards in club football scoreless during Slaughtneil’s rise to national prominence including Conleith Gilligan, Ryan McHugh and Seanie Johnston. googletag.cmd.push  - Brendan Rogers Slaughtneil Another Emmets dual star Rogers, has been the defensive rock on which Slaughtneil’s success has been built. Named Ulster Club footballer of the year for , as a youngster Rogers initially chose to focus on hurling but has established himself as one of the football’s best defenders in not just Derry but Ulster, an automatic pick for this selection.  - Ciaran Mullan - Coleraine A superb athlete whose ball-carrying ability and pace have made him a nightmare for opposing forwards who end up spending much of their time tracking back into their own half. A key man as Coleraine claimed the John McLaughlin Cup for the first time in  and was still a fixture when they claimed their second title in .  - Kevin McGuckin - Ballinderry Another Ballinderry man with an All-Ireland medal in his pocket, the fact he was still making the starting  for the Shamrocks in  is testament to his qualities. A Rolls Royce of a footballer the former Derry captain’s experience was crucial as the Loughshore completed a hat-trick of victories between  and .  - Oisin Duffy - Foreglen It’s a measure of Oisin Duffy’s consistent excellence that he makes this selection based on performances in the Intermediate Championship. Could play any position in the backline, his strength and pace made him an effective man marker but equally comfortable in possession. Still as effective as ever as Foreglen claimed the Intermediate crown last October.  - Chrissy McKaigue - Slaughtneil First rose to prominence on the Derry minor side that reached the All-Ireland final in  the current Derry Captain has been a fixture for club and county for a decade. In addition to his evident abilities as a player, McKaigue provides the intangible qualities of leadership that every successful team needs. On the rare occasions that Slaughtneil find themselves floundering McKaigue is the man to whom his team-mates look to steady the ship.  - Patsy Bradley - Slaughtneil Another who’s career has spanned the ages, Patsy Bradley is an icon of Derry football. The quintessential quiet, hard man, Bradley’s aerial prowess rarely fails to catch the eye and his work-rate is immense. Has overcome injuries that might have restricted the career of lesser players Patsy’s toughness is the stuff of legend.  - Niall Holly - Coleraine Strong in the air and extremely mobile. Holly’s ball carrying skills have the been the starting point for countless Eoghan Rua attacks, with his languid style belying and athleticism allows him to glide past opponents. A perfect foil for the combative Bradley.  - Enda Muldoon - Ballinderry One of the most gted footballers ever to apply a boot to a size five, the Shamrocks man’s gts appeared to immune to the passing of the years as Ballinderry emulated their s antecedents in winning three in a row from  to . His ball to Raymond Wilkinson for the decisive goal in the  semi-final win over Banagher may be the best pass I have ever seen in club football.  - Benny Heron- Ballinascreen The only man in my team who doesn’t have some form of Championship winners medal to show for his efforts. Heron has been a prolic scorer for a Ballinascreen team that has regularly been in the mix for the John McLaughlin Cup without quite sealing the deal. With his phenomenal work rate and ability to score from both play and placed balls, Heron was a key factor in the St Colm’s club’s run to the  and  county finals.  - Sean Leo McGoldrick - Coleraine The oil that has kept the Coleraine engine running smoothly for a decade. Adaptable players can sometimes be the victims of their own versatility but Sean Leo McGoldrick’s quality is such that every manager in Derry would love to have him in their squad. One Coleraine mentor once told me that the one time in any game when he could relax was when Sean Leo had the ball because he knew it was secure. An incisive runner and an accurate passer the Eoghan Rua man can also chip in with a vital score when the occasion requires.  - Coilin Devlin - Ballinderry The flame-haired front man maybe didn’t have the profile of the other Ballinderry forward in this line-up but his impact for the Shamrocks in the early part of the decade was undeniable, bagged the decisive goal in the  final against Slaughtneil, and scored five points from play to earn man of the match honours in . Dooks pace and direct running made him a handful for opposing corner-backs.  - Colm McGoldrick - Coleraine The second member of the McGoldrick clan to make my team and you could make case for the inclusion of any of the brothers, but Colm is well worth his place. He was the fulcrum of the Eoghan Rua attack as they claimed their first county crown in . The intelligence of his movement is something that can’t be taught. As captain he scored four points in the  final as Coleraine doubled their tally of John McLaughlin Cups.  - Shane McGuigan - Slaughtneil The sharpest shooter in Derry club football in recent year. McGuigan’s scoring tallies speak for themselves scored - in the  Derry Championship and better that tally with - in . Performs well on the big stage top scored in the  Ulster final with - against Kilcoo and bagged - in ’s provincial triumph over Cavan Gaels. Every successful team needs a marquee man in their full-forward line, McGuigan is Slaughtneil’s. RELATED - Michael McMullans team of the decade- Click here...

Twenty years ago this year, Derry pushed Offaly every step of the way and won the respect of a nation. The former Oak Leaf defender spoke to Michael McMullan….  Its your job to enhance the legacy so when you finish playing you have tothe jersey to a better place than what you got it in. - Dan Carter Dan Carters words are both romantic and sincere, painting a picture of a career that ended with the Webb Ellis Cup in his clutches. googletag.cmd.push Not everybody gets the perfect send off. Some stay too long and others dont achieve, both leaving a sense of regret. Niall Mullan is one of the lucky ones. The Kevin Lynchs man, from a family steeped in hurling, saw his -year senior career with Derry come to a conclusion under the spine-tingling, rapturous applause of a standing ovation at Croke Park. The Oakleafers, after winning Ulster for the first time in  years, pushed Offaly to the brink. The electrying realisation that – barring Offalys fans – the entire stadium was willing them on, allowed Derry to play with real purpose. googletag.cmd.push But it was Offaly who found enough to win the game. Boy did they earn it. They did benefit from Ollie Collins Achilles injury after  minutes. It was a huge loss to Derry who, in the final analysis, had no answer to Johnny Dooley. The Seir Kieran man had his snipers vision finely tuned and contributed  points. It was enough for the  champions. Niall Mullans final chapter in the red and white of Derry came in the most gallant of defeats. The rest of Ireland were forced to stand up and take notice. One of his opponents that day certainly did. Joe Dooley entered the fray after  minutes. Seconds later a sliotar flashed across his path. Goalkeeper Kieran Stevenson was always grateful for the positional sense of his defence. “They always seemed to know where the ball would land,” he said of Mullan, Collie McGurk and Conor Murray in front of him. For once, Mullan admits to having lost his bearings and Joe Dooley got a right introduction. “I took a wild swing rather than trying to catch it,” Mullan recalls. Without taking control of the ball he, lashed on it and his hurl broke across Dooley. It was all part of the battle for supremacy. No quarter was asked and none was given, with the duo swapping jerseys at the final whistle. The competitive respect we all drool over. As Mullan said farewell to inter-county hurling, he walked down the dressing room tunnel with Dooleys jersey in his grasp. “Its still my pride and joy,” he said. *** Sport was never going to be far away from Niall Mullans le. His father John, better known as Ginge, played both football and hurling. He gave plenty back in . He was Chairman of the football club and, until the recent lock-down, has been taking Irish language classes at Kevin Lynch Park. Sadly, his mother Anne passed away in recent years. Niall has two sisters, Anne and Maria and has three brothers John A, Hugh Pearse and Eoin, who have all been involved in the GAA. After his underage club career, he continued to represent St Canices and Kevin Lynchs with distinction. Its thought he has two senior football medals and won five titles with the hurlers. At the time of our interview, Mullan is unsure. For someone who has achieved so much, the silverware is over-rated. “I dont know, I am not joking,” came Mullans response to how many county titles he had amassed. “I got a thing for my thbirthday from one of my brothers. My medals are up on the wall, but I wouldnt even count them.” Mullan holds the memories closer to his heart. “The people who were foes then, that are good friends now. The likes of Declan Cassidy and Collie McGurk. There was Conor Murray too, who was playing on the Derry hurling team from the start.” Thats what he takes from it. Since making his debut when he was  or , Mullan was pretty much an ever-present in Derrys defence until calling it a day at the age of . “I think there was one of the years, I didnt go to the hurling as I was in the football . Hinpheystropped speaking to me because of it,” he laughs. Hinphey arrived in Dungiven from Kilkenny, along with the input of Laveys Tom Magill, left an unquantiable imprint on the hurling landscape of the county. With the big ball, Mullan won two MacRory Cups with St Patricks Maghera and was on Derrys All-Ireland minor winning team of . He played U football for the county and was on the  for the  senior final defeat by Monaghan, but missed out on the Ulster title in . In hurling, under the guidance of Joe McGurk, he was midfield on the first team from the school to land the Mageean Cup, .  Niall Mullan in action against St Louis Ballymena in the  Mageean Cup final “An experienced hurler, Nialls calmness and nerve rubbed off on the other players of lesser experience,” read an extract from the  school magazine, the Patrician. “His long-range pointing was an invaluable asset to the team.” The team was captained by McGurks brother Johnny and included future All-Ireland senior football winners Henry and Seamus Downey, who was the teams goalkeeper. Enda Gormley and Damian Cassidy, not from hurling clubs were on the team. Cassidy was the competitions top scorer and bagged - in the final against St Louis Ballymena at Bellaghy. For Mullan, the experienced hurler, he was only starting. *** It all began miles away from  and what it represented. Derry hurling had made a habit of languishing in Division Three, when Mullan joined during the mid-s. He is the only player to have played in all four isions of the league. He recalls how they would always lose as many games as they won. But it began to gradually change. Block by block, the building process began. In , after winning the All-Ireland B championship, Derry went to play New York in Gaelic Park. It was the era of Hugo McOscar and Pat Joe McKennas management. After arriving a day late and having to play in a searing  degrees heat in a dust bowl, they got slaughtered in the game, Mullan remembers. “After that, we had four or five days as a get together, as a team, and we enjoyed ourselves. On the flight home, I remember Declan Cassidy and a few of us talking,” he added. “We had grown close as a group, we knew the hurlers were there. We were talking that we could do a wee bit with this group.” The following year, Derry won promotion to Division Two and went on to contest the  and  Ulster senior finals. Mullan remembers ex-Down manager Sean McGuinness telling them how close they were getting. To make the final push they would need to be playing top level hurling in the league. A win over Wicklow, in Portlaoise, saw Derry promoted to Division One as champions. “Before we went into theUlster championship, we played Kerry in a play-off match in Parnell Park and we beat them well to stay up,” Mullan recalls of their first season dining with the big boys. “It gave us a lot of confidence. We played well that day andwe had played like that in some of the other games, we couldve beaten one of the bigger teams. “I remember playing Wexford, up in Slaughtneil, and it was a dirty, wet day. We held them for a long time and they pulled away in the second half with the wind.” A lot had a changed since theirfrom New York. Collie McGurk had committed solely to hurling and Kieran McKeeversto the hurling  in , rubber-stamped its attraction. Before that, players just came and went. There was no continuity. Now it was dferent. “You ask the likes of Co McEldowney, or anyone playing at that time, it was really enjoyable to play and we had plenty of craic on the way home on the bus. You could just see everybody that was there...wanted to be there.” Away from the fun, there was also an appetite for work. Manager Kevin McNaughton had enlisted fitness coach Malcolm McCausland. No longer was it running laps til you boked. “He would take us up to do sprints and he gave us a programme of what to do ourselves,” Mullan points out. Going into the Ulster final, Derry were perfectly poised. They had ran Antrim to three points two years previously, had a strong league campaign under their belt and were convincing semi-final winners over Down. Their win over Antrim in the final was all the more notable, with the absence of Geoffrey McGonigle and Emmett McKeever due to suspension. “Emmett was captain and he never missed a night of training right through and he never got his suspension lted...he just drove the thing on another notch. “Kevin was the manager, but Tomdid a lot of the training,” Mullan reveals. With an Ulster title in the bag, the duo ramped up the preparations even more. “Training wouldve involved a lot of shorter games...they had everything speeded up and closed in. The training matches were faster, there was no time - you just got the ball and got it away. “I remember that everybodys hurling was good at that time and you got used to the speed the big boys played at, thats what they concentrated on.” It was time to take their hurling to the biggest stage of all. *** Adrian Logan was deployed to Derry to get a taste of the new hurling revolution and arrived at Younger Homes in Maghera. It was the week of the new Ulster champions baptism against All-Ireland contenders Offaly in the Croker cauldron and Niall Mullan was the interviewee. “I remember telling him that theyknew absolutely nothing about us and we knew who they were. I thought that was an advantage and we were going to throw the kitchen sink at them.” Derry travelled south the day before the game and stayed out of Dublin. Everything was relaxed. During the week, the squad were flying at training. The scene was set. Sitting in the dressing room, Niall Mullan was conscious it could be his last game with the famous Oakleaf badge on his chest. “Collie McGurk was , Conor Murray was  and I was ,” Mullan now jokes. “So thats over  combined years, so there were no speed merchants.” As the team togged out, Mullan noticed the usual nerves werent present. He was taking it all in his stride. “I was walking about...thinking Ill beoff after  minutes or I will play well. Thats just how I felt.” “Collie would always talk in the changing room and he was telling us lets get wired into these b******s, there would always be some of the players chipping in.” From the win over Antrim, the management had some reshuffling to do. Declan Cassidy was on his honeymoon and missed the game. Mickey Conway dropped back from midfield to plug the vacancy at wing back. Ronan McCloskey reverted to midfield and Geoffrey McGonigle ed to the attack after his suspension. Derry took to Offaly with every sinew they could offer. “Ten minutes into the first half, your lungs were bursting because Offaly were going at a pace we werent used to, but they never pulled away from us,” said Mullan of his memory from the game. By half-time, some of Offalys key players hadnt scored. John Troy got little change out of Colin McEldowney before being replaced by Joe Errity and the towering Gary Hannfy was brought closer to midfield. “Cowas brilliant and then they brought out a big boyon to him and Co was only up to his waist, just swinging away...he had a brilliant game that day.” Derry lost Ollie Collins to injury and Johnny Dooley began to exert an interference on the game. And still Derry kept coming back. A second McGonigle goal was followed by a Mickey Collins point to level matters, - to -. “I remember the hairs standing on the back of my neck. Everybody in Croke Park was roaring for us. You could hear the atmosphere building because we were so close to them. You were going on adrenaline and we did think we could beat them.” The story didnt have a total fairytale ending. A second Brendan Murphy goal helped Offaly crawl past Derrys tectonic efforts. But after  years of hurling, Niall Mullan bowed out at the top. Like Dan Carter, Nelly left a legacy and Derry hurling was in a much better place.

Twenty years ago this year, Derry pushed Offaly every step of the way and won the respect of a nation. The former Oak Leaf defender spoke to Michael McMullan….  Its your job to enhance the legacy so when you finish playing you have tothe jersey to a better place than what you got it in. - Dan Carter Dan Carters words are both romantic and sincere, painting a picture of a career that ended with the Webb Ellis Cup in his clutches. googletag.cmd.push Not everybody gets the perfect send off. Some stay too long and others dont achieve, both leaving a sense of regret. Niall Mullan is one of the lucky ones. The Kevin Lynchs man, from a family steeped in hurling, saw his -year senior career with Derry come to a conclusion under the spine-tingling, rapturous applause of a standing ovation at Croke Park. The Oakleafers, after winning Ulster for the first time in  years, pushed Offaly to the brink. The electrying realisation that – barring Offalys fans – the entire stadium was willing them on, allowed Derry to play with real purpose. googletag.cmd.push But it was Offaly who found enough to win the game. Boy did they earn it. They did benefit from Ollie Collins Achilles injury after  minutes. It was a huge loss to Derry who, in the final analysis, had no answer to Johnny Dooley. The Seir Kieran man had his snipers vision finely tuned and contributed  points. It was enough for the  champions. Niall Mullans final chapter in the red and white of Derry came in the most gallant of defeats. The rest of Ireland were forced to stand up and take notice. One of his opponents that day certainly did. Joe Dooley entered the fray after  minutes. Seconds later a sliotar flashed across his path. Goalkeeper Kieran Stevenson was always grateful for the positional sense of his defence. “They always seemed to know where the ball would land,” he said of Mullan, Collie McGurk and Conor Murray in front of him. For once, Mullan admits to having lost his bearings and Joe Dooley got a right introduction. “I took a wild swing rather than trying to catch it,” Mullan recalls. Without taking control of the ball he, lashed on it and his hurl broke across Dooley. It was all part of the battle for supremacy. No quarter was asked and none was given, with the duo swapping jerseys at the final whistle. The competitive respect we all drool over. As Mullan said farewell to inter-county hurling, he walked down the dressing room tunnel with Dooleys jersey in his grasp. “Its still my pride and joy,” he said. *** Sport was never going to be far away from Niall Mullans le. His father John, better known as Ginge, played both football and hurling. He gave plenty back in . He was Chairman of the football club and, until the recent lock-down, has been taking Irish language classes at Kevin Lynch Park. Sadly, his mother Anne passed away in recent years. Niall has two sisters, Anne and Maria and has three brothers John A, Hugh Pearse and Eoin, who have all been involved in the GAA. After his underage club career, he continued to represent St Canices and Kevin Lynchs with distinction. Its thought he has two senior football medals and won five titles with the hurlers. At the time of our interview, Mullan is unsure. For someone who has achieved so much, the silverware is over-rated. “I dont know, I am not joking,” came Mullans response to how many county titles he had amassed. “I got a thing for my thbirthday from one of my brothers. My medals are up on the wall, but I wouldnt even count them.” Mullan holds the memories closer to his heart. “The people who were foes then, that are good friends now. The likes of Declan Cassidy and Collie McGurk. There was Conor Murray too, who was playing on the Derry hurling team from the start.” Thats what he takes from it. Since making his debut when he was  or , Mullan was pretty much an ever-present in Derrys defence until calling it a day at the age of . “I think there was one of the years, I didnt go to the hurling as I was in the football . Hinpheystropped speaking to me because of it,” he laughs. Hinphey arrived in Dungiven from Kilkenny, along with the input of Laveys Tom Magill, left an unquantiable imprint on the hurling landscape of the county. With the big ball, Mullan won two MacRory Cups with St Patricks Maghera and was on Derrys All-Ireland minor winning team of . He played U football for the county and was on the  for the  senior final defeat by Monaghan, but missed out on the Ulster title in . In hurling, under the guidance of Joe McGurk, he was midfield on the first team from the school to land the Mageean Cup, .  Niall Mullan in action against St Louis Ballymena in the  Mageean Cup final “An experienced hurler, Nialls calmness and nerve rubbed off on the other players of lesser experience,” read an extract from the  school magazine, the Patrician. “His long-range pointing was an invaluable asset to the team.” The team was captained by McGurks brother Johnny and included future All-Ireland senior football winners Henry and Seamus Downey, who was the teams goalkeeper. Enda Gormley and Damian Cassidy, not from hurling clubs were on the team. Cassidy was the competitions top scorer and bagged - in the final against St Louis Ballymena at Bellaghy. For Mullan, the experienced hurler, he was only starting. *** It all began miles away from  and what it represented. Derry hurling had made a habit of languishing in Division Three, when Mullan joined during the mid-s. He is the only player to have played in all four isions of the league. He recalls how they would always lose as many games as they won. But it began to gradually change. Block by block, the building process began. In , after winning the All-Ireland B championship, Derry went to play New York in Gaelic Park. It was the era of Hugo McOscar and Pat Joe McKennas management. After arriving a day late and having to play in a searing  degrees heat in a dust bowl, they got slaughtered in the game, Mullan remembers. “After that, we had four or five days as a get together, as a team, and we enjoyed ourselves. On the flight home, I remember Declan Cassidy and a few of us talking,” he added. “We had grown close as a group, we knew the hurlers were there. We were talking that we could do a wee bit with this group.” The following year, Derry won promotion to Division Two and went on to contest the  and  Ulster senior finals. Mullan remembers ex-Down manager Sean McGuinness telling them how close they were getting. To make the final push they would need to be playing top level hurling in the league. A win over Wicklow, in Portlaoise, saw Derry promoted to Division One as champions. “Before we went into theUlster championship, we played Kerry in a play-off match in Parnell Park and we beat them well to stay up,” Mullan recalls of their first season dining with the big boys. “It gave us a lot of confidence. We played well that day andwe had played like that in some of the other games, we couldve beaten one of the bigger teams. “I remember playing Wexford, up in Slaughtneil, and it was a dirty, wet day. We held them for a long time and they pulled away in the second half with the wind.” A lot had a changed since theirfrom New York. Collie McGurk had committed solely to hurling and Kieran McKeeversto the hurling  in , rubber-stamped its attraction. Before that, players just came and went. There was no continuity. Now it was dferent. “You ask the likes of Co McEldowney, or anyone playing at that time, it was really enjoyable to play and we had plenty of craic on the way home on the bus. You could just see everybody that was there...wanted to be there.” Away from the fun, there was also an appetite for work. Manager Kevin McNaughton had enlisted fitness coach Malcolm McCausland. No longer was it running laps til you boked. “He would take us up to do sprints and he gave us a programme of what to do ourselves,” Mullan points out. Going into the Ulster final, Derry were perfectly poised. They had ran Antrim to three points two years previously, had a strong league campaign under their belt and were convincing semi-final winners over Down. Their win over Antrim in the final was all the more notable, with the absence of Geoffrey McGonigle and Emmett McKeever due to suspension. “Emmett was captain and he never missed a night of training right through and he never got his suspension lted...he just drove the thing on another notch. “Kevin was the manager, but Tomdid a lot of the training,” Mullan reveals. With an Ulster title in the bag, the duo ramped up the preparations even more. “Training wouldve involved a lot of shorter games...they had everything speeded up and closed in. The training matches were faster, there was no time - you just got the ball and got it away. “I remember that everybodys hurling was good at that time and you got used to the speed the big boys played at, thats what they concentrated on.” It was time to take their hurling to the biggest stage of all. *** Adrian Logan was deployed to Derry to get a taste of the new hurling revolution and arrived at Younger Homes in Maghera. It was the week of the new Ulster champions baptism against All-Ireland contenders Offaly in the Croker cauldron and Niall Mullan was the interviewee. “I remember telling him that theyknew absolutely nothing about us and we knew who they were. I thought that was an advantage and we were going to throw the kitchen sink at them.” Derry travelled south the day before the game and stayed out of Dublin. Everything was relaxed. During the week, the squad were flying at training. The scene was set. Sitting in the dressing room, Niall Mullan was conscious it could be his last game with the famous Oakleaf badge on his chest. “Collie McGurk was , Conor Murray was  and I was ,” Mullan now jokes. “So thats over  combined years, so there were no speed merchants.” As the team togged out, Mullan noticed the usual nerves werent present. He was taking it all in his stride. “I was walking about...thinking Ill beoff after  minutes or I will play well. Thats just how I felt.” “Collie would always talk in the changing room and he was telling us lets get wired into these b******s, there would always be some of the players chipping in.” From the win over Antrim, the management had some reshuffling to do. Declan Cassidy was on his honeymoon and missed the game. Mickey Conway dropped back from midfield to plug the vacancy at wing back. Ronan McCloskey reverted to midfield and Geoffrey McGonigle ed to the attack after his suspension. Derry took to Offaly with every sinew they could offer. “Ten minutes into the first half, your lungs were bursting because Offaly were going at a pace we werent used to, but they never pulled away from us,” said Mullan of his memory from the game. By half-time, some of Offalys key players hadnt scored. John Troy got little change out of Colin McEldowney before being replaced by Joe Errity and the towering Gary Hannfy was brought closer to midfield. “Cowas brilliant and then they brought out a big boyon to him and Co was only up to his waist, just swinging away...he had a brilliant game that day.” Derry lost Ollie Collins to injury and Johnny Dooley began to exert an interference on the game. And still Derry kept coming back. A second McGonigle goal was followed by a Mickey Collins point to level matters, - to -. “I remember the hairs standing on the back of my neck. Everybody in Croke Park was roaring for us. You could hear the atmosphere building because we were so close to them. You were going on adrenaline and we did think we could beat them.” The story didnt have a total fairytale ending. A second Brendan Murphy goal helped Offaly crawl past Derrys tectonic efforts. But after  years of hurling, Niall Mullan bowed out at the top. Like Dan Carter, Nelly left a legacy and Derry hurling was in a much better place.

I went off to my daughter’s school and got everything sorted out and then came out home. “I thought we’d all go to the beach a run and walk the dogs to get away from the chaos for an hour, but I wasn’t in the house ten minutes until the police landed.” Maggie immediately realised her mistake when the police officers appeared, and they accompanied her back to Tesco so she could pay her bill. googletag.cmd.push However, once she had paid the outstanding amount at the Customer Service Desk, she was waved over by the store’s security guard.

Bishop McKeown visited the cemetery at dawn to sprinkle graves using Easter Water that was blessed in St Eugene’s Cathedral during the Easter Vigil Mass on Saturday night. The visit was arranged in co-operation with Derry City and Strabane District Council. Bishop McKeown said he hoped the Easter Blessing would bring some comfort to grieving families across the Derry Diocese who are unable to visit the graves of their loved ones. He said he was very aware that the government legislation that forced all cemeteries and burial grounds to close for visitors, was a dficult one for many people, but he urged the public to be mindful of their own health and welfare and to take heed of the government advice to Stay at Home. googletag.cmd.push He urged people to have faith and to remember their loved ones through prayer and reflection and encouraged the public to care for one another during this dficult time. googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

No matter where you go or who you are talking to up and down the country, they always ask about Roly. There is always someone who knows him or has played with or against him.The above paragraph was taken word for word from Drumaness Millsrsquos th anniversary booklet in . It captures brilliantly the essence of Roly lsquoThe Manrsquo.Roly died on Wednesday, March , sparking a deluge of tributes on social media. True gentleman, one in a million, what a lovely man, one and only Roly, top man, a legend mdash these tributes, among many others, appeared again and again.Roly was an integral part of village le in Drumaness, dandering to the bookies or the shop. He would make multiple stops to say hello to everyone he met, discussing the issues of the day.I have known him for a!most  years. He worked in Sam Bellrsquos egg factory across the road from St Josephrsquos Primary School in Crossgar. The workers would kick a ball about the road during their break and even to my untrained eye he was dferent class. It was my introduction to Roly lsquoThe Footballerrsquo.Some years later Roly and his brother, John, knocked on our door in Crossgar. They wanted me to play for the Mills in the Newcastle Summer League and I was more than happy to do so.Playing with Roly was a great education for a young player. He made football look easy, was stylish and talented, possessing the rare gt of keeping the game simple.Small wonder then that when talk comes around to the Millsrsquo greatest ever player, Roly is always in the conversation, despite competition from the likes of Robbie Strain, Osie Gelston, Conor Walsh and Davy Mills.Legend has it that in those days boys were born with boots on in Drumaness because this was a village where sport was king. So it was that Roly also excelled at billiards and cricket, reaching a very high standard in both.But football and the Mills were Rolyrsquos first loves and he rarely missed training or matches. Inevitably his talent came to the notice of Irish League managers and he enjoyed spells with Portadown and Cltonville in the early seventies. Nevertheless, Roly was a home bird and sooner or later he would pull on the Mills shirt again.By now I was playing for the all conquering Downpatrick Rec team of that era and we pitched up to a Border Cup final early in  to play the Mills. We had just won the Steel and Sons Cup and had our eyes firmly on the double, but Roly and Osie Gelston had other plans and proceeded to inspire the Mills to a famous - win.Roly had reached the twilight years of a glorious footballing career, but there was still time to lead the Mills reserves to another giant-killing act, beating Castlewellan in the Bobby Dalzell Cup final in .After such a stellar playing career, Roly was expected to become a manager. He did dip his toes in the managerial waters once or twice, but with no offence intended to the managerial fraternity mdash myself included mdash Roly was probably too nice to be a manager. In all the years I have known him I canrsquot remember him raising his voice. He was just so easy going, decent and level-headed.As a result people liked Roly and this popularity unsurprisingly proved to be an asset in his working le. After Sam Bells he spent a number of years working in the Co-Op shop in Drumaness before taking up employment with well-known butcher Vincy Doran.He was a familiar sight in Vincyrsquos van, delivering to hotels and restaurants, but it was his weekend door-to-door run which played to his strengths and further cemented his popularity.He became known as Butch or Butcher mdash a nickname he loved mdash and Vincy to this day has nothing but good things to say about Rolyrsquos eight-year stint with him.Rolyrsquos next stop was with Jimmy Quinn, who owned a bakery in Downpatrick. Jimmy shrewdly ed Roly to the door-to-door market and with people still finding it dficult to say no to the personable Roly, their successful liaison continued for  years.Jimmy likes nothing better than relating Roly stories,none of which can be repeated here, and like the rest of us he will remember Roly with the utmost fondness.Unfortunately Roly wasnrsquot immune to the ups and downs of le and deteriorating health curtailed his working le. He managed to fight and beat prostrate cancer a number of years ago, but this time around the lsquoBig Crsquo has claimed this lovely man.Ironically it was during these latter years that he seemed to be ever present on the streets of Drumaness, allowing him to befriend a generation entirely unaware of his past sporting prowess.Roly married Betty Rice on October , , and together they brought Noel, Pauline, Betty, Carol and Christine into the world. After almost  years together as a couple they remained best friends, as well as husband and we.Apart from my football connection to Roly, I have been his neighbour for  years and since his passing I have heard him described as lsquoMr Drumaness Millsrsquo, but for me he was Mr Drumaness full stop. This village will never be the same without him.Rolyrsquos family should be immensely proud of his impact on those who knew him and how sad it was to see coronavirus rob them and Roly of the fitting send-off he deserved.However, the good news is that I know there are plans afoot to have a celebration of his le when normality s. Nobody deserves it more. RIP Roly.Roly Hanna -.prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/8th April 2020 Cormac.jpg","title":"Ardglass golfer on teeing up with the best in the world  ","story":"ARDGLASS golfer Cormac Sharvin could be forgiven for feeling understandably frustrated right now.The richly talented  year-old should be locking horns with some of the worldrsquos best players on the European tour.But instead of prowling the fairways hersquos holed up in his apartment in Dublin mdash like many others undergoing coronavirus lockdown.Itrsquos not how Sharvin, currently th in golfrsquos world rankings, thought his first season on the European Tour would go.Having secured his card for the  season by finishing th on the  Challenge Tour rankings, he was gearing up for a potential breakthrough campaign on the top circuit.However, after just four events, he is unsure of what the future holds as the sporting world goes into shutdown due to the coronavirus outbreak.He clearly appreciated that golf, and sport in general, is of minor importance when compared with the COVID pandemic.Of the decision to close all golf courses north and south of the border, he told the BBC recently: ldquoItrsquos a precaution that needs to be in place.I donrsquot know enough about the virus, but theyrsquore obviously trying to slow things down. Hopefully wersquoll be back playing as soon as possible, I think thatrsquos the goal.ldquoI think we just have to accept it and sit tight and when it does pass, we can get things moving a bit quicker.Certainly things have happened fairly quickly for Sharvin in his career to date. He only took up golf seriously relatively late in his teenage years, but went on to have glittering amateur career.In  he was a member of the Great Britain and Ireland Walker Cup team, contributing three points and remaining unbeaten in a .-. thumping of the United States.Sharvin turned  the following year and joined the ranks of the European Challenge Tour.Having missed his European Tour card by a single shot in , Sharvin relocated to Dublin and It proved to be the right move.He amassed eight top ten finishes in  starts to earn a rookie season on the European Tour thanks in large part to his six top fives.Sharvin only missed four cuts, two of which came in the first two events of the season, before he kickstarted his campaign with back-to-back top ten finishes.However, his best performance came at the Irish Open at Lahinch where he finished tied for th and was also the leading Irish golfer.He showed impressive consistency during the  season and proved his elite-level credentials with a tie for th finish at the Irish Open, ending the week as the leading home competitor.He says: I had a really good year, I put myself into contention a lot which was great. I think I was ready to take that step and I think the way I played, I deserved to get my card in the end with a few good results.ldquoI also managed to play well in a couple of European Tour events as well which showed me that I was ready to take that step. Therersquos a relief that I have my card now but itrsquos only the start of it mdash I know I have to keep improving and moving up the rankings.At the Irish Open he finished ahead of future Open champion Shane Lowry, Ryder Cup star Tommy Fleetwood former world number one Lee Westwood and Ryder Cup captain Padraig Harrington.ldquoIt was disappointing to shoot level-par on Sunday, but I feel like I didnrsquot do much wrong, he said.ldquoIt was really nice to have that pressure of going into the final round of a big European Tour event with a chance to win. It showed me where I was mentally and physically, that I was able to come from the Challenge Tour and compete in a top-level European Tour event.ldquoThat was an unbelievable week. The crowds were incredible and I attracted a big following being the leading Irishman, and that was a great feeling.ldquoItrsquos a nice feeling when hundreds of people are following you and everyone is willing your ball into the hole. I think that really geared me up quite a lot. It was a class buzz.ldquoIt was dficult going back to playing the Challenge Tour in the middle of nowhere in France the week after, but that week gave me the confidence to string together more good results to get off the Challenge Tour.Sharvin admits itrsquos been a slow start on the European Tour, with a tie for th in the Oman Open his bestin four starts this year, but his belief in being able to compete at the higher end of leaderboards remains undimmed.ldquoI feel like my game is good, but I havenrsquot really put all the facets together. ldquoI think in Oman I was second in strokes, gained tee-to-green and just putted really poorly. I played quite nicely in Qatar and just didnrsquot get it going.ldquoItrsquos obviously such a short period of time so itrsquos hard to assess in four events, but I feel like Irsquom close. This break may help me improve other things and hopefully Irsquom a better player when we start again.Given his Walker Cup experience, Sharvin would dearly love to play in the Ryder Cup in the years ahead.ldquoThe Ryder Cup would definitely be up there for me. I grew up playing team sports and have been involved with them my whole le, so that would be huge.ldquoI feel like Irsquom pretty good in a team and having tasted a little success in team sports, I think thatI can get my game to that level, Irsquod be a good asset in that sense..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/8th April 2020 Ballynahinch.jpg","title":"Ballynahinch singer performs at nursing homes  ","story":"A BALLYNAHINCH man is serenading residents in local nursing and residential homes through the COVID- crisis with hit songs to remind them of happier times.The gesture from popular singer Wayne Rodgers is even more laudable as he lost all his work overnight in the lockdown as a driving instructor and a wedding band performer.The  year-old performed outside four homes on Monday, delighting the residents and carers in Redburn Nursing Home, Oakridge Care Home, Spa Nursing Home and Fishbourne House Care Home.Performing classic hits from artists such as Jim Reeves and Clf Richards, Wayne believes his singing is helping strike a chord with the elderly residents who need to be kept apart from family members at this time.ldquoThe singing helps the residents and it really helps me too as it passes the time for me as my work has had to stop due to the virus, said Wayne, who now lives in Bellaghy.ldquoIrsquove received photographs taken from the inside of the home showing residents enjoying my songs and itrsquos lovely to see. It can get really emotional as there are now family members turning up to wave and talk to their relatives through windows while I sing.ldquoItrsquos heartfelt to see their enjoyment at being able to connect with their parents or grandparents inside. It can be heart-breaking at times but itrsquos still nice to see it.ldquoI have been told by some of the carers that they have seen some patients with dementia sing along to the music and thatrsquos also really good to know.A former soloist with St Patrickrsquos Church in Ballynahinch and ex-pupil of St Colmanrsquos High and Sixth Form College, Wayne ensures he keeps the residents and carers safe at all times.A long extension power lead from the home is laid for him before he arrives so he can plug in his mixing desk, microphone and laptop.Wayne said: ldquoItrsquos sterilised before I get it and when I had it back itrsquos sterilised again so I have no direct contact with anyone in the home.ldquoI try not to sing beyond  minutes as the homes often open the windows to allow residents to hear better and Irsquom conscious of not wanting anyone to get too cold in the process.Wayne started off singing at a Magherafelt nursing home when a pub owner hersquos friendly with was approached by the home asking for suggestions at how they could entertain the residents.He added: ldquoThe residents in the home loved it and asked me to come back again so I did and then I got calls from other homes.He now has nine performances under his belt with the help of his brother-in-law, former Newry, Mourne and Down Council chairman Mark Murnin, and his sister, Michelle, who runs Paddy Kellyrsquos Bar in Ballynahinch.Wayne, whose parents Maurice and Naveen still live in Ballynahinch, has been a show band singer for years and once performed with the legendary Sunshine.Gigs for his wedding band, The All Stars, have been cancelled or postponed as couples were force to rebook their wedding dates.Wayne is performing free of charge and says he is happy to as it gives him some focus in his le at this time.ldquoI donrsquot have much  to do as work has stopped, but I do feel a lot better knowing that Irsquom bringing some happiness to others, he added..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/8th April 2020 Binmen.jpg","title":"Binmen receiving thank you messages for essential work  ","story":"THE districtrsquos binmen have been thanked for continuing to provide collection services during the coronavirus pandemic.Some people have been pasting messages on their bins thanking the men for the job they are doing, while their efforts have also been commended by Newry, Mourne and Down Council chairman Charlie Casey.Working in extremely dficult circumstances, the binmen are providing a critical service at this time and their efforts have not gone unnoticed by ratepayers who taking time to wipe the handles of their bins with disinfectant before they are collected to help keep refuse staff safe.Householders are also being reminded to ensure that they continue to place the correct waste in the right bin to help ease the burden on public health services to help stop additional risks to staff who are working under increasing pressure.Refuse collection staff have been singled out for particular praise as they collect and transport waste, with their work also helping to protect the environment.Stormont environment minister Edwin Poots said the materials refuse staff collect for processing such as cardboard, plastic and glass are vital resources in package production across the food and retail sectors, explaining that ain recycling could impact on the supply chain ing effectively.He added: ldquoAll those working in the waste sector are key workers and I have also established a COVID- Waste Group to provide support, guidance and regulatory direction to the waste sector.Newry, Mourne and Down Council mdash which recently closed all its household recycling centres to redeploy staff to work in refuse collection mdash said that all bin collections continue as normal.However, residents are asked to provide additional help by ensuring that bins are put out for collection no later than am every morning or the night before.Where possible, residents are asked not to restrict bin lorry access and park as considerately as possible. Over recent weeks, binmen have experienced issues accessing homes in a number of areas including Ballynahinch and Newcastle to collect bins.Residents are also asked to ensure that all bin handles are cleaned or wiped-down before and after use and not to approach refuse staff without following the minimum two-metre social distancing guidance.Commending refuse staff for the work they are doing in dficult circumstances, the council chairman explained that as the coronavirus crisis unfolded, the local authority was quick to implement a number of health and safety measures to protect staff.He explained that the measures allowed bin collection teams to continue the service with minimal disruptions to residents.ldquoCrews now operate staggered start times between .am and am and are authorised to leave work immediately upon the completion of their rounds, said Cllr Casey.ldquoTo support social distancing, crews are restricted to one driver and one loader in each cab. For crews that operate as one driver and two loaders, the loaders are transported behind the collection lorry in a support vehicle.ldquoLoaders are also asked to limit their time in cabs to an absolute minimum and can be collected and drop-off points along designated routes.Cllr Casey said the local authority is constantly reviewing its services in light of ldquorapidly changing events and may make further changes at very short notice.He said the current situation remains challenging and is dependent on the ongoing impact of COVID- on council employees.The chairman continued: ldquoWe would like to thank all our frontline workers who continue to engage with our residents to deliver essential services.ldquoI fully appreciate the disruption this has had on normal working routines. However, as a workforce and a wider-society we are now having to make signicant changes to our daily lives. I would also like to thank the public for their support and patience during very dficult circumstances.:Cllr Casey added: ldquoWith our household recycling centres now closed to free up resources needed to maintain domestic refuse collection services and help ensure compliance with social distancing guidance, we are appealing to people not to fly-tip and to do their bit to keep the district clean and safe..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/8th April 2020 County.jpg","title":"Down Leisure Centre to be community hub  ","story":"DOWN Leisure Centre has been transformed into a new community co-ordination hub to ensure that vulnerable residents across the district receive essential supplies.Set up by Newry, Mourne and Down Council, the Downpatrick hub is one of three that have been established across the local authority areas.Others have opened in Kilkeel and Newry but the distribution centres are not open to members of the public or community groups.Local council officials have been working in partnership with their colleagues across local government, health trusts and the Department for Communities to set up the hub which is to play a key role in delivering the service on the ground.Down Leisure Centre mdash which has been closed to the public for the past month as a result of global pandemic mdash has been transformed into a processing centre to organise deliveries, with other sites currently being identied should they be required.When fully operational, over  leisure centre staff will be redeployed to work across all sites and work alongside others from across the organisation to help operate a lsquovirtualrsquo hub to coordinate the response.Staff training is currently underway for those who will be working in split shts at the centres while observing social distancing and other safety protocols.The service was formally launched on Monday across the councilrsquos seven even district electoral areas, with deliveries expected to centre on food supplies.In addition, a COVID- community helpline is already operational, with those in vulnerable groups seeking support can make contact between am and pm, seven days a week.The Freephone number is   , while the email is covid@adviceni.net.

He said that when Secretary of State Humphrey Atkins meets Eire Foreign Affairs spokesman Brian Lenihan in Dublin later this month, he should remember his Governmentrsquos pledge that the future of Northern Ireland was a matter for the people of Northern Ireland, her Majestyrsquos Government and the Parliament of the United Kingdom.Mr Beattie said Mr Lenihan should be warned that Loyalists would not tolerate interference by Eire in the internal affairs of Ulster in order to prop up the SDLP or in any SDLP proposals for power-sharing or a Council of Ireland.ldquoMr Atkins should take note we will never surrender to any pressure from Dublin or London that would hasten the arrival of a united Ireland.

There was a marginal increase of  on last yearrsquos record total of , cars carried across, although the number of passengers using both ferries ped from , last year to ,.Inevitable delays developed in both Strangford and Portaferry as the two ferries tried to cope with the rush of motorists to the Ards Peninsula and Lecale coast.Easter Sunday was a particularly busy day for the ferry crew with , cars and , passengers being carried across mdash a considerable increase on last yearrsquos figures. Monday was again the busiest day of the year with a staggering , cars using the crossing and , passengers.The ferry superintendent, Mr Louis Fitzsimons, paid tribute to the work of police in Strangford in keeping traffic moving.

It is certainly a strange experience for me.I was ordained in  in Downpatrick. New technologies and new means of communication came after that, and Irsquove struggled ever since. So the recent experience of having to install web-cams at short notice into the three churches in my two parishes of Portaferry and Ballygalget, has been somewhat traumatic.This week is the holiest of weeks for Christians. The passion and death of Jesus is commemorated, in preparation for the resurrection on Easter Sunday. We celebrate this in ious ways. We might well ask ourselves what happened to Lent and how on earth do we celebrate what will seem like a lsquovirtualrsquo Easter Coronavirus suddenly intruded into our Lent, at close quarters, and changed everything.My mother still remembers the glow in the sky over Belfast, when from her home in Ballykinlar, she heard the planes over South Down on their way to blitz Belfast. No doubt her grandmother would have told stories of the terrible pandemic of Spanish Influenza just over a century ago.But my generation and that of my nieces and nephews have known little of such things and we experience this pandemic a grave threat.At the moment of writing, the streets of Portaferry and Downpatrick are entirely empty, as are the great cities of Rome, London and New York.The unexpected severity of lockdown leaves us feeling bewildered, disorientated, shell-shocked. We are acutely aware of the suffering around us mdash illness, hospitalisation, loneliness in sudden isolation. As schools close we are anxious about increased tension in family le. The loss of our work and leisure patterns, financial and employment worries.In the Old Testament Jobloses so much of what he had mdash health, family, possessions and friends mdash yet he refuses to rebel against God in his suffering. This is incredibly dficult for most of us. His attitude of acceptance of his suffering can be of help to us. He says: ldquoShall we receive the good at the hand of God, and not take the bad Jobrsquos story can be useful to us at present. If you can get a chance, read it.Lent mdash an old English word for spring mdash is more challenging this year than we ever expected. As we celebrate Holy Week here are two words that figure in the writings of Henri Nouwen, a Dutch spiritual writer, that I find useful.The first word is security. Where do we look in our lives for security. A basic human need  In success, popularity, money, friends, family, insurance and so on  We mightnrsquot think we do. We will always be influenced by them, but deep down they will never provide us with security.Many of those things are good in themselves, but spiritually, the only true security will be found in the everlasting love of the One who loved us first and who wishes to love us into and for all eternity. Job understood that mdash security.The second word is patience. Patience means a kind of ldquosuffering through the present. Itrsquos from the Latin, patior, which means to suffer. But being patient does not mean sitting back and doing nothing. It is not being passive. Having patience is not easy for us. How do we wait patiently for God this Holy Week, Easter and beyond during this world pandemic Being patient is an active waiting mdash it means a certain experience of suffering through the present moment. To let the seeds of our suffering be sown in the ground so as to grow later into healthy, strong plants.It means avoiding the dead-end of what could have been for the ability to pay attention to what is happening before our very eyes, paying attention to the people and world around us. By that patience, we can begin to catch a glimpse of the first rays of Godrsquos glorious coming.Last week, I personally saw those first rays when I witnessed the staff in a residential nursing home in Portaferry decide to live-in with the residents for as long as this emergency would last.This week I witnessed those first rays when a cousin, a retired doctor, rang me to tell me he was volunteering toto work to bolster the Health Service.In one way or another have we not all been privileged to witness the generosity of spirit, despite danger, of those carers, nurses, doctors, medics, ancillary staff and many others Might this not be for us another glimpse that helps us experience in our present circumstances that Christ is indeed risen and lives now among us  It certainly is a glimpse for me.The Old Testament reading for many of us on Sunday last was from Ezekiel. ldquoThe Lord says this: I am going to open your graves. I mean to raise you from your graves and lead you back to the soil of Israel. I shall put my spirit in you, and you will live, and will know that I, the Lord, have said and done this it is the Lord who speaks.The people of Ezekielrsquos time knew their frailty and experienced uncertainty as we do today. Their faith in God had been severely shaken. Could they start again Security, patience, maybe these two words might stay with us over the next while as the reason for the hope that we have I leave you with the words of a psalm, which St Patrick himself echoed in his own writings, his lsquoConfessionrsquo.The words encourage us to place our hope in the Son of God who will sustain and strengthen us in our days, the Son of God, Jesus, who knew what it was like to stumble and fall beneath the weight of the Cross. With these words I ask God to bless us and keep us safe:ldquoI waited, I waited for the Lord and He stooped down to me, He heard my cry. He drew me from the deadly pit, from the miry clay. He set my foot upon a rock, and made my footsteps firm.With security and patience we can put our trust in the fallen saviour..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/8th April 2020 Huge.jpg","title":"Huge boost for foodbanks  ","story":"THE districtrsquos foodbanks have been provided with a pound, boost by Newry, Mourne and Down Council to help them respond to increasing need during the coronavirus pandemic.The funding has been provided via the local authorityrsquos community network and is one of a series of initiatives the local authority is spearheading to continue providing a range of frontline services and responding to the needs of the vulnerable and elderly in particular.This week, residents across the district have been thanked for adhering to advice to help stop the spread of coronavirus by staying indoors and keeping safe.And, as the Easter weekend approaches, council chief executive Marie Ward has appealed to people to continue to listen to the advice to stay at home and save lives.

","story":"AMBITIOUS plans to redevelop Ardglass harbour could cost in the region of poundm, a new report has revealed.The figure is contained in a detailed consultants report commissioned to undertake an in-depth feasibility study to look at potential developments for the harbour which is home to Northern Irelandrsquos third largest fishing fleet.The key issue the consultants focused on was deepening the harbour to facilitate larger vessels, with work also undertaken to look at improving harbour conditions, berthing pontoons for smaller vessels and increased berthing facilities.In addition, the study included a comprehensive review of possible harbour layouts, historic document research, topographic and bathymetric harbour surveys, quay wall inspection above and below the waterline and computermodelling.The consultants also liaised with the Department for Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairswhich has been given a copy of the consultants report ahead of further discussions with its officials on the way forward.Ardglass has the only all-weather harbour between Howth and Bangor and has three primary areas including the so-called fish dock within the south pier.There is also the Phennick Cove marina located behind a breakwater mdash which could be extended mdash to the west of the main harbour which can accommodate up to  leisure craft and the inner harbour which dries out at low tide.The consultants say that the inner harbour is particularly useful for vessel maintenance but not utilised as extensively as the outer harbour due to limited water depth.Last August, ious concept layouts produced by consultants were reviewed by members of the Ardglass Harbour Developments group which has been set up to oversee the regeneration of the port. The concepts were subsequently amended in November.The prime focus is on deepening the harbour and moving forward, a cost effective approach may be to zone dredge levels in particular areas.The report suggests deepening the outer harbour by nine metres and the area adjacent to Cochranersquos building at the inner harbour by two metres to facilitate crab vessels.In addition, consideration is being given to creating a pontoon with so-called finger berths adjacent to the quay wall in front of Cochranersquos with gangway access for crab vessels. No leisure craft would be permitted at this part of the harbour.Removal of the existing slipway at the southern end of the harbour adjacent to the beach is suggested as it is not generally used and considered too deep for access, with potential issues in relation to the removal of an area know as Church Rock to be investigated.Quay reclamation work is suggested between the north west corner of the existing finger pier at the ice plant and north western tip of the fish market quay.This would feature a new piled quay, backfilled and surfaced with a heavy duty concrete. Extending theof the quay wall by  metres is also suggested.The estimated cost of the harbour dredging is in the region of pound, with piling work and the new quay line and reclamation work estimated at poundm and poundm respectively.The breakwater extension is estimated at pound.m with the new pontoon facility estimated at pound,.The consultantsrsquo report makes it clear that the costings include primary construction elements but does not include licensing fees, site investigation, engineering design and tendering costs.Before anything happens, a marine licence is required for specic site investigation work, rock quality design and testing, sediment sampling of overburden, contamination testing and an environmental impact assessment.The regeneration jigsaw also requires detailed design work and planning approval ahead of tendering and construction.An economic appraisal may also be required.News of the proposed investment at Ardglass harbour comes after the portrsquos importance to the Ardglass fishing industry to the district and wider South Down economy was highlighted during a recent meeting with Stormont fisheries minister Edwin Poots.He met with South Down MLA Colin McGrath and local councillor Dermot Curran to discuss planned improvement work at the harbour, with the politicians also highlighting the need for additional investment in the harbour and its infrastructure.They described Ardglass harbour as ldquostrategically important for the Co Down fishing fleet, highlighting its crucial role in driving the South Down economy and its location as a central hub for processing fish landed at the port.Mr McGrath and Cllr Curran say further investment is ldquocritical to allow Ardglass harbour to expand to provide an economic boost, not only for the village but the wider area, and create new jobs..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/8th April 2020 Mourning.jpg","title":"Please stay in  ","story":"ldquoHE was my superman ndash the moving words from Loughinisland woman Maria Farrell whose father sadly lost his battle with COVID-.As her sister also lies in hospital fighting the virus, the mother-of-two has bravely spoken out to warn others not to be complacent about the deadly disease.Maria, who buried her father on Sunday, warned: ldquoIf you think you are exempt from this or you are immune to COVID-, you are barking up the wrong tree.ldquoMy dad went really quickly, hersquos tackled prostate cancer, heart attacks, falls, you name ithellip and hersquos bounced back.

I have been transported to a time that has changed my perception of le forever.People with CF have a faulty gene which means the mucus in their bodies is much thicker and stickier than in other people.They donrsquot catch viruses more easily than other people but when they do, it affects their lungs by causing inflammation and increasing the amount of the sticky mucus. This makes bacterial chest infections more likely, some of which are resistant to antibiotics, leading to a decline in lungwhich is the leading cause of death in people with CF.As parents, for the first sixth months of Lorcaacutenrsquos le we were consumed with the fear. We were advised not to visit baby groups, not to let people with colds into the house, not to take him to the supermarket on a weekend when it was busy, not to let him play in soil, wet sand, or day-old playdough as well as taking many, many more precautions to keep him safe.We also discovered that my mother-in-lawrsquos COPD and my fatherrsquos bronchiectasis meant that Lorcaacuten would always have to be careful around his beloved Nana and Grandad in case he caught an infection from them. For the same reason, he could never be within six feet of someone  with CF because of the risk of cross infection. My world would never mdash could never mdash be the same.We rarely left the house. I gave up my job in the RSPB and postponed my studies. Much of our time was taken up with the heavy burden of treatment for CF, including daily physiotherapy and antibiotics. I spent a lot of time campaigning for a cystic fibrosis drug, Orkambi, to be made available on the NHS.And I cried a lot.Over the last three years, le has become more lsquonormalrsquo but beneath the joy of every milestone has been the fear of taking risks that could shorten Lorcaacutenrsquos le at any time.During this time we have learnt that there are some risks you need to take in order to be happy. Lorcaacuten began pre-school as well as swimming, gymnastics, and football classes and I resumed my studies and began working a few hours a week.There has been a lot of stress and sleepless nights, a lot of handwashing, and a lot of happiness. With the support of the public we won the campaign for Orkambi, a drug which can slow the decline in lungby up to % and can be taken by around half of people with CF. Lorcaacuten started taking it at the end of last December mdash the champagne was popped and finally we thought we could start to relax a little.Sadly it wasnrsquot for long. During the wait for Orkambi, Lorcaacutenrsquos lungs had become damaged, after catching a couple of colds in March, he ended up in the wonderful Royal Belfast Hospital for Sick Children for  days of IV antibiotics to treat a long standing chest infection.During those  days I watched the horrying news that COVID- was spreading. I grew ever more disturbed at the lack of action by the UK Government. How could our amazing health service, stripped bare by  years of austerity and cuts, possibly hold up under the strain of COVID- Lorcaacuten was moved to a room further away from other patients, masks appeared and I watched the eyes of the incredible staff in the hospital become more and more tense.With nearly every death I read that the patient was either elderly or had an underlying health condition. But why did that make it OK: Surely that made it worse  The message seemed to be that lsquoonlyrsquo the vulnerable were at risk but other peoplersquos lsquoonlyrsquo is my everything.As the days in hospital passed, I learned that the lung conditions of my son, mother-in-law, and father put them among the , in NI on the extremely vulnerable list. They would need to lsquoshieldrsquo for the next  weeks. Shielding means not leaving the house at all and having to rely on the government and the goodness of others to deliver medication and food to your door.When Lorcaacuten was able to leave the hospital, we arrived home mdash with great relief mdash to a lockdown. Once again, with no job to go to and my studies on hold, I am transported to those months of isolation three years ago.This time, however, it is dferent, because this time I have hope. For us, this too shall pass. We willto the normality so hard won in our lives. We, unlike so many others who will lose their lives, will have this as a memory to pass on. I let so much of Lorcaacutenrsquos infancy be marred by fear that I just canrsquot let it happen now. Every day I am thankful for my good fortune in a desperately unfair world. I am thankful for all the frontline workers and volunteers, for the Executive finally working together for the common good to sustain us and to protect the most vulnerable in society, for the kindness of people delivering food and medication to those most at risk.I am grateful to the other souls sitting in their homes feeling helpless and feeling like le is passing them by. But by feeling helpless we are helping more people have a le toto after this all ends.It will end but the world will never mdash can never mdash be the same and none of us will look at it in the same way either.Maybe it will be a world in which those who need support will begin to get it, a world in which our NHS will finally be built up rather than worn down, a world we protect rather than profit from. As I watch Lorcaacuten run happily and healthily around our safe home with his little sister, Saorla, I donrsquot feel fear for him. I feel fear for those putting their lives at risk for all of us, for those who will lose their lives and loved ones, and for those who are sitting in their homes feeling afraid.I often think that doing nothing is the hardest thing to do, but for the moment doing otherwise is a risk too great to take, for us all.

To help overcome this a new mobile telephone number is available mdash  .Good Morning Down was established to help reduce loneliness and isolation. Volunteers also signpost those who need further support to other agencies.Good Morningrsquos Down service has never been more important. One of the charityrsquos volunteers, Aidan Harris, says the current climate represents a challenge for everyone, particularly those who live alone.ldquoThe staff moved out of our base at the business park over two weeks ago, but we are providing the service from our own homes and what we are doing is very much appreciated by those we contact every week, he explained.ldquoWe certainly are living in unprecedented times none of us have ever experienced anything like this in our letimes and hopefully will never do again.Aidan explained that while a lot of information people need to hear is circulated via social media, many elderly people do not have access to it. In the main, he said they are relying on the television and radio.ldquoWe are letting them know what is happening and reinforcing the message to stay indoors and not let anyone into their home, even their own relatives. We are highlighting the importance of them doing all that they can not to catch the virus, the charity volunteer continued.ldquoPeople are very concerned at what is going on and many of those whom we contact used to get out to attend ious clubs but they have all closed due to the pandemic which means the elderly and vulnerable are spending even longer alone in their homes.Aidan also revealed that some who normally received only one call a week are now getting several more, with people brought off the waiting list so they can be contacted.He also revealed that the charity is also providing the people they contact with details about local shops which are providing a delivery service.ldquoWe are emphasising the hand hygiene message as much as we can and reminding people to stay indoors. We are also telling them to exercise social distancing and not let anyone into their homes, he said.ldquoWe are also telling those whom we contact not even to let one of their neighbours over the door as it is simply too risky. The people whom we contact are very concerned about what is going on but they are made of stern stuff.Aidan added: ldquoAll the volunteers are working hard to make sure we maintain contact with our clients, more regularly than in the past by increasing the number of calls we make to them.ldquoThe reward is how grateful they are for the service we provide and our main goal is do all we can to let them know that we are here for them and want them to keep safe..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.impartialreporter.com/news/18336274.mr-thomas-albert-bertie-johnston/resources/images/10194344.jpg","title":"latest figures reveal island trend","story":"Latest statistics show that in the Fermanagh and Omagh District region the number of positive cases rose to  with a total of  positive cases across Northern Ireland.Health Minister, Robin Swann explained that there is likely to be a second surge of the virus later in the year: ldquoEven then, a reasonable worst case scenario would involve signicant loss of le in Northern Ireland.

Performance of the Oberammergau Passion Play : Freelance“The nd Oberammergau Passion Play will be postponed due to the current situation caused by the corona pandemic.”In the Baian district of Germany, beside the Ammer River and framed by the Ammergau Alps, Oberammergau is a small town known for its woodcarvings, its NATO School and its internationally renowned -yearly Passion Play.The organisers of the Passion Play summarised the historical signicance of the postponement, explaining that the event “goes back to a vow made in . At that time, the people of Oberammergau vowed to perform the suffering, death and resurrection of Christ,no one died of the plague anymore.Engraving depicting the Passion Play in  : Freelance \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

Therefore the plans to perform the Passion Play in  are currently beginning.”Held in the ‘decimal year’I attended a performance in , one of the most vivid and moving experiences of my letime, and indeed, I had toyed with the thought of ing this year.There would have been  performancesstarting in mid-May with an expected , visitors from around the globe paying between € to € for a ticket.The enormous production has been running since  except for two cancellations and a postponement.Crucixion scene in the Passion Play in  : FreelanceNearly half of the , residents of today’s Oberammergau are involved with the show - actors, musicians, front of house, backstage and looking after the horses, sheep, goats, cows and doves that add to the often intensely dramatic scenes.The other half of the townsfolk run the restaurants, shops, hotels, BBs and farmsteads where many of the visitors stay,they’re lucky.The nearest accommodation I could get in  was St. Anton am Arlberg in the Austrian Tirol.Participants in the production must have been born in Oberammergau or have lived there for  years.Oberammergau on the River Ammer in  : FreelanceIt’s not unusual for up to four generations of the same family to be taking part in the same run of plays, which can involve around  children on stage at the same time.In the th century, passion plays were held in many parts of Europe, often performed on carts in the street.They re-enacted Christ’s last days, from his entry into Jerusalem to his trial, crucixion, resurrection and ascension.In the bigger and more elaborate productions, when scene one ended the cart trundled off to another part of the town or city and scene two arrived, and so on!They were the ‘poor man’s Bible’ enabling even the most illiterate become familiar with Bible stories.But Oberammergau’s is the only play with its origins in a collective vow to God which has run, almost without a break, for approaching four centuries. This unique double-accolade brought the town a UNESCO World Heritage award.It’s quite likely that passion plays were already common events but a document in Oberammergau’s archives records “the first decades of the th century went by in peaceful calm…but then followed the Thirty Years’ War with all its hardships from  until . As early as , infectious diseases spread in Baia.

From this day forward, not a single person perished, even though a great number of them still showed signs of the plague”.They made the pledge in  and the Passion Play was first performed at Pentecost in , on a wooden stage that some say was built on plague-victims’ graves near the church.Surviving documentation from the  production shows that the play ran ‘completed smoothly’ with seating provided ‘for spectators standing close by.’From  the date of the performance was changed to the beginning of each decade, by which time folk were coming from all over Germany to see substantial productions.Paint and painters for the  show’s scenery cost  guilders, ‘the gentlemen trumpeters’ got two guilders and  guilders went ‘to the actors for drink’!There was no performance in  when Maximilian III’s Clerical Council banned all passion plays and when another threat loomed in the s the so-called ‘mad’ King Ludwig II of Baia protected it from those who wanted to close down the ‘harmful’ passion plays. Following WWI the play was postponed until , and there was a special th anniversary show in  attended by Adolf Hitler.There were no performances in  during WWII, just the second cancellation…until now.Plans to perform the Passion Play in  are already under way, for over  five-hour shows, several thousand participants, a -strong orchestra and a -strong choir.\"\"Get the latest news on the CoronavirusWe have launched a daily public interest bulletin to deliver all the updates and vital information to your inboxSign Up Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-bEjcJn boXdXt\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-fOICqy kfiVLF\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-bEjcJn boXdXt\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-fOICqy kfiVLF\"This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us onExploreNewsSportIrish League FootballWhats OnLestyleFarming LeMore from the News LetterAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryLocal GuideReader ShopUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter\" fill\"#ea\"©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-bYSBpT sc-elJkPf kHpvMx\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policy Sign in\"Edit AccountSign OutSubscribeNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessEducationHealthPeopleRead ThisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"SportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoNightleRetroLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"LestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessCoronavirusFollow us \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

Please try again later.Submitting...However, the statement implied that Sinn Fein’s objection was on procedural grounds rather than because in principle it opposed any Army role. Ms O’Neill said that “we will not rule out any measure necessary to save lives” but added that Mr Swann “has a responsibility to exhaust all options, including the use of other blue light public services and civilian contractors, to ensure that ventilators and le saving equipment are moved swtly to where they are needed most”.In an interview with RTE on Saturday, Ms O’Neill said “we have to do everything necessary to save lives”, but then went on to say: “I don’t believe that British Army assistance is necessary at this point. I believe that all of our modelling indicates that we are coping, albeit in the most challenging of circumstances.”Three weeks ago in the Assembly Mr Swann said that his focus was on saving as many lives as possible and he would accept help from wherever it could be found.He told MLAs: “I’ll use whatever tool I have at my disposal to tackle this virus. If the Irish Army want to come up and help us too when they’ve it sorted down there, I’d be more than happy to welcome them.”DUP Agriculture and Environment Minister Edwin Poots said that Sinn Fein was not actually trying to stop the Army being involved, but accused it of a “silly PR stunt”.In a Facebook post on Saturday, Mr Poots said: “Michelle O’Neill would be better seeking a meeting with the republicans in her own constituency who entirely ignore social distancing than engaging in silly PR stunts about something she in reality has no intention of trying to stop.“Robin has my support in doing whatever needs done, however it is done, by whomever it is done.”With the exception of Sinn Fein, every other Executive party publicly endorsed Mr Swann’s attempt to secure support from the military in the battle against the pandemic.SDLP leader Colum Eastwood said on Saturday: “Fteen people died of coronavirus overnight in the North. I’ll support anything that gets PPE and ventilators to where it needs to go. Let’s stop playing politics and do whatever it takes to save lives.”Responding to Mr Eastwood’s comments on Twitter, Alliance leader Naomi Long said: “Could not agree more. Robin Swann has my and the Alliance Party’s full support for taking extraordinary measures to try to save people’s lives. All and any help is welcome at this critical time.”First Minister and DUP leader Arlene Foster said: “Northern Ireland has been working together on tackling this awful disease. We need to keep at it.“When your loved one is lying in hospital, who built the ward will be the last thought on their mind. Let’s build the capacity we need. We fully support the Army being used to build necessary beds.”Ulster Unionist MLA and Royal Irish Regiment reservist Doug Beattie said that Sinn Fein’s rejection of help from the Army was “becoming absolutely tiresome”. He highlighted that the military had in recent weeks already been used by Stormont to create a temporary morgue, without objection from republicans.He added: “I guess few will complainpersonal protection equipment or ventilators are supplied via a military driver or a civilian driver orthe doctor and nurse treating them is military or not.”As in most countries battling the pandemic, the Army has been increasingly involved in the effort to assist health staff as they have become stretched.At the weekend the Ministry of Defence said that nearly  members of the armed forces are being loaned to NHS ambulance services to support their work.Personnel from all three strands of the armed forces will be sent to work at five ambulance trusts.Although their responsibilities will y depending on the area, the new duties will include driving ambulances and taking calls from the public.Eighty service personnel will be sent to the South Central Ambulance Service NHS Foundation Trust where they will drive emergency response vehicles, larger ambulances and work at the response centre which covers five counties around London.In London,  medical personnel from the armed forces will form  critical care transfer teams to transport patients who need to be moved between intensive care units.Engineers from the Army are also supporting the London Ambulance Service to maintain suction units used in ambulances.In Wales,  soldiers finished their two-day ambulance training at the Sennybridge Training Camp near Brecon on April , ready to be deployed across Wales to assist paramedics with non-clinical tasks.Thirty-seven military personnel have been deployed to the East of England Ambulance Service, which covers six counties including Cambridgeshire and Bedfordshire, to assist with tasks including driving and logistics.The group all volunteer as emergency responders in their free time and have previously trained with the service.Members of the RAF are already assisting the Scottish Ambulance Service with a trial of a medical isolation and transport system, using RAF Puma helicopters to take critically ill people to hospital.Defence Secretary Ben Wallace said: “Our armed forces always step forward at the appearance of threats to the country and its people.“Across the United Kingdom, soldiers, sailors, airmen and women have got the backs of our NHS colleagues as they confront coronavirus.”Members of the armed forces have helped with the response to the outbreak in a iety of other ways.Military personnel were involved in the planning and building of the first NHS Nightingale hospital at the ExCel exhibition centre in east London, as well as its equivalents across the country.Armed forces personnel made up of  drivers and  driver’s mates have also been trained to fill and transport oxygen tankers to NHS facilities.The Ministry of Defence said there are hundreds of personnel delivering supplies of PPE for the NHS based at distribution centres across the country, amid reported shortages of the vital equipment.Speaking on Friday night, Mr Swann told this newspaper that he hoped the military request would not be isive, repeating his view that the only thing that will ide people in this pandemic is whether they live or die.\"\"Get the latest news on the CoronavirusWe have launched a daily public interest bulletin to deliver all the updates and vital

These communications are ongoing.“Prospective PPE supply routes from China for Northern Ireland have not been finalised. It would be a matter of great regretany potential arrangements were jeopardised by partial and malicious leaking.”The department was asked how the Nolan Show’s story could “jeopardise” any such purchase, but it did not respond by time of writing.A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

Ok, we have a ided society and all that. But we do have, I think, a much more cohesive society than maybe parts of England.“We have people who are maybe, on all sides, more prone to be looking out for each other... I think they’re maybe more likely to comply with their unusual or unprecedented restrictions on their movements.”He also said that the relative lack of large cities in Northern Ireland “would be a factor certainly”, adding: “You look at where we’re getting the bulk of our cases – they are happening around the predominately urban areas, Belfast in particular.”When it comes to when the current restrictions may be lted, Dr Waldron said: “It’s really, really hard to say.

It will cut planned capital spending to pound million from a budget of pound million and will work to grow online.MS said in a statement: \"Whilst we remain confident that the post-crisis future of the business and our transformation programme remains as strong as ever, trading over the next nine to  months in our clothing and home and international businesses is likely to be severely impacted.\"As a result, it is not possible to provide meaningful guidance on future earnings, although we are taking every step to secure future value for shareholders, colleagues and suppliers.\"The chairman of Wetherspoon has said that a decline in sales was accelerated when prime minister Boris Johnson told people to stay away from pubs.After rising in previous weeks, sales fell by . per cent in the week to March  and the slowdown has picked up further since the Prime Ministers statement, Tim Martin said.It came as the business reported profit before tax rose  per cent to pound. million in the half-year to January  on revenue of pound million.Health secretary Matt Hancock has warned that coronavirus will keep spreading as long as people continue to socialise.Speaking on talkRadio, Mr Hancock said: \"If you stay at home you are saving lives.\"I know, of course, this is a more dangerous disease for older people but not exclusively, some young people get it too.\"But, more importantly, the more that people continue to go out and continue to socialise, the more it will spread and the longer were going to have to keep these measures in place.\"So, were urging people to follow the public health advice.In the emergency Bill thats in front of Parliament right now, we are taking the powers to be able to enforce these measures, so we can make it happen by lawwe need to.\"Id rather not do that and the evidence so far is that the vast majority of people are following the advice, are doing what is sensible and right.\"The company said it was cancelling its interim idend, which had been p a year earlier.Mr Martin said: \"It is obviously very dficult to predict, in these circumstances, how events will unfold in future weeks and months, but we now anticipate profits being below market expectations, so long as the current health scare continues.\"As a result of this uncertainty, it is impossible to provide realistic guidance on our performance in the remainder of the financial year.\"The company has decided to delay most capital projects and to reduce expenditure, where possible, including the cancellation of the interim idend.\"As a result of these actions, combined with the Governments proposals on business rates relief and credit guarantee facilities, the company believes it has sufficient liquidity to maintain operations at a substantially lower level of sales.\"Nicola Sturgeon has urged anyone who left the medical profession in the past three years to consider ing to help the fight against coronavirus.Sharing a plea from Scotlands chief nursing officer Fiona McQueen, the First minister tweeted: \"Scotlands NHS needs our help to meet the #coronavirus challenge.\"Mr Hancock said some retired medics whoto work in the NHS to fight the coronavirus will be able to come \"straight back in\".Asked on the BBCs Breakfast programme when workers couldto the NHS, he said: \"Well, over the next couple of weeks because for some theyll have very recently left and they can come straight back in, their annual trainings been up-to-date and they can just restart.\"Imagineyouve left at Christmas, for instance, you can restart straight away.

The training will happen for those who need it over the next couple of weeks, at the same time well allocate people to a hospital near them because theres a logistical exercise here as well.\"Mr Hancock suggested that tougher measures could have to be brought inpeople do not follow the Governments advice.He told the BBCs Breakfast programme: \"What I can say is thatpeople follow the advice, stay home which saves lives andthey keep apart from others, more than two metres, more than six foot, then we can tackle this and we can turn the tide.\"The scientists advise that we can turn the tide in  weekspeople follow the advice.\"If people dont follow the advice, then itll be longer and we might have to bring more and tougher measures.\"He added: \"We have brought these measures in earlier than Italy did in terms of where theyre up to with the number of cases.\"But were absolutely clear thatwe need to, we have the powers, in fact weve got a Bill in front of Parliament now to strengthen those powers further.\"But I think its far betterpeople follow the advice.\"The FTSE  has risen by more than five per cent in early trading as travel companies jump out ahead after a bruising few weeks for the sector sparked by the Covid- pandemic.Intercontinental Hotels jumped by about a fth despite revealing that demand for rooms was the worst it had ever seen, as markets opened on Friday.EasyJet also rose by around  per cent and cruise operator Carnival jumped by around . per cent.Meanwhile, the price of a barrel of Brent crude oil joined the rally, rising five per cent to . dollarsafter a massive fall earlier in the week.Shadow chancellor John McDonnell has warned about the prospect of a recessionpeople do not receive their wages.Labour has urged the Government to ensure the salaries of workers are protected as businesses lose trade during the coronavirus pandemic.He told the BBCs Breakfast programme: \"We need the Government now to act to protect people to keep them in their jobs.\"In that way, what well be able to do is ensure people have an income coming in, their job will be protected, but we prevent the second wave of a recession hitting uswere not careful.\"Becausepeople lose their jobs, they dont have their wages, demand collapses in the economy and then you really do have a recession.\"The lesson from past crises like these is act fast and act big, so thats why were saying the Government should step in and say to employers, well cover  per cent of your wages, you keep people in work.\"Demand for a room at Intercontinental Hotels has reached its lowest point in history, the group said, as the travel industry continues to be battered by the coronavirus pandemic.The business revealed that it would be cutting costs, eliminating its idend and reducing salaries in a bid to save cash.However, shares in the group, which have been badly hit in recent months, jumped by around  per cent on market open in London as investors reacted positively to the companys proposals.Chief executive Keith Barr said: \"Demand for hotels is currently at the lowest levels weve ever seen.Intercontinental Hotel Group has a robust business model and the measures we are announcing today to reduce costs and preserve cash give us the capacity to manage the business through this unique environment and to support our owners during this incredibly dficult time.\"These were not easy choices and we are mindful of the impact these decisions will have on our colleagues and shareholders.\"However, we believe that these are essential to ensuring that we come out of this as strong as we possibly can and ready to capitalise on what remains an industry with excellent long-term growth potential.\"Geoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders , said the list of key workers to whom schools will remain open is \"perhaps more extensive than we might have expected\".He said: \"Realistically, theywill need to identy these children by lunchtime.\"Mr Barton added: \"We already know from the trajectory of this that were not going to have many staff.\"We have to be careful that the message to parents is not business as usual.\"Matt Hancock said that a communication will be sent to around . million people who are classed as vulnerable to set out specic action for them to take.The Health secretary told Sky News: \"The first thing were going to do is set out exactly what conditions that applies to.\"We expect about . million people to then get a communication from the NHS to say that they are part of this and what they need to do.\"Many of these people have pre-existing health conditions and so will be very worried right now, and I understand that, and theyll need very specic sets of action - for instance, how do you go about still getting your chemoyou have cancer whilst also social-distancing \"If you have cancer its particularly important to stay away from other people, but you also of course have got to keep going with your chemotherapy.\"He added: \"These are some of the most dficult and challenging cases so well be getting in contact with them, butpeople think that they are on this list and dont receive a communication from the NHS, then they also need to get in contact.\"So that is under way, the money was announced for it yesterday.\"A combination of money to the NHS and money to councils because theyve got a very big part to play in keeping people safe.\"ASCL general secretary Geoff Barton said schools will have first worked to identy vulnerable children, as they will know who they are, and will then be looking at the \"key worker\" category.He said the ASCL is telling members: \"You have to do your best to negotiate the key workers list. Youre doing this to a tight timescale, and what you offer children on Monday may be dferent to what you offer next Wednesday.\"Mr Barton said that initially, schools will be doing all they can so that pupils who need to can still turn up to their own school after the weekend.In the longer term, there will be more strategic planning of school provision, he added.Paul Whiteman, general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers , said: \"The Government has made clear that every child who can be safely cared for at home should be. And their advice makes clear too that this applies to children of key workers.\"For the vast majority of children and young people, school buildings will close tonight and not reopen for the foreseeable future.\"Taking up a place at school during this time of wider closure is the offer of last resort, for the minority of key workers, who have no alternative.\"School leaders have many questions that remain unanswered about how this will work in practice. We will continue to work with the Government throughout the day to provide greater clarity to schools to enable this reduced offer to be up and running as soon as possible.\"Dr Mary Bousted, joint general secretary of the National Education Union, added her voice to calls from school leaders urging parents to only send their children in as a last resort.She said: \"This is a very long list and could result in some schools having the majority of pupils attending. This will not achieve the goal of slowing the spread of the virus.\"So it is vitally important that parents follow government advice to keep their children at home, wherever possible. Schools can only accommodate a limited number of children and the fewer children making the journey to school, and the fewer children in educational settings, the lower the risk that the virus can spread.\"The competition watchdog has launched a taskforce to tackle businesses looking to exploit the coronavirus outbreak to take advantage of customers.The Competition and Markets Authoritysaid the outbreak has prompted concerns that people could be exploited by companies \"charging excessive prices or making misleading claims about their products\".It said it has already contacted traders and s over excessive pricing of hand sanitiser as part of its efforts.Andrea Coscelli, the CMAs chief executive, said: \"This is obviously a time when we all have to behave responsibly to protect our fellow citizens, and particularly those who are most vulnerable.\"We urge retailers to behave responsibly in the exceptional circumstances of the Covid- outbreak.\"Butthey do not, our taskforce is monitoring market developments to enable us to intervene as quickly as possible.\"We have a range of options at our disposal, from warnings to enforcement action to seeking emergency powers.\"The ceremonial of the Changing of the Guard at Buckingham Palace, St Jamess Palace and Windsor Castle is being postponed until further notice \"in line with Government advice to avoid mass gatherings\", Buckingham Palace has announced.The palace said in a statement that the situation would be \"reviewed on an ongoing basis, with a view to restarting when appropriate\". article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Irsquove grown up on the beach.ldquoI normally take landscape pictures because I love the water and some of the sunsets here are incredible, especially in the winter.Rochelle wrote her Instagram handle on the parcels, so that people who found them could send her a message.ldquoIt was just to make someone smile, and Irsquove had some lovely comments from people who got back to me on Instagram, she said.ldquoThey said they were going to put it up in their room and frame it.ldquoSome people were feeling a bit down and didnrsquot expect to find anything, so it cheered them up.ldquoMy job was done ndash the main purpose was to make people smile and it did - it made me smile too.ldquoI think itrsquos very important to say hello, especiallypeople are living by themselves orthey havenrsquot got their family around.ldquoWhen Irsquom normally walking the dog I say hello and have a chat, but itrsquos quite hard to do that now because everyone is quite wary.ldquoI donrsquot have to have that physical contact with someone to brighten up their day.ldquoArt is just a dferent  to communicate with. You knowsomeonersquos a bit shy and they donrsquot want to speak using words, they may want to draw a picture and open up that way instead.ldquoI think art can show feelings that words canrsquot quite express, so itrsquos a great idea to share that with the community.At a time of uncertainty and doubt, Rochelle ended with a message of hope and solidarity:ldquoI think as a community we could do so much more at this time, she saidldquoEveryone is concerned about how long it is going to last, but I am hopeful we can get past it, andwe all work together and remain positive we may come out of this in an even better situation than we was before.Rochelle would like to make clear that all parcels were fully sanitised.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.
