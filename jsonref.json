He is grinning mischievously and clutching a beloved Jumelle box camera that had recently been given to him by his father. In the next few years, Jacques will constantly record the world around him, photographing his bedroom, making portraits of uncles and cousins, and framing his older brother, Zissou, as he leaps into the air from a boat.Another 60 years will pass, however, before the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) in New York hosts the first exhibition of his work, belatedly bestowing on Jacques Henri Lartigue the recognition he deserves as one of the great innovators of 20th-century photography.When the celebrated American photographer Richard Avedon saw Jacques Henri Lartigue’s work for the first time on the eve of the MoMA show in 1963, he wrote to his compatriot to express his gratitude: “It was one of the most moving experiences of my life… You brought me into your world and isn’t that, after all, the purpose of art?”The world Lartigue created with his camera was a reflection of the one he was brought up in as a privileged, pampered boy in a family environment that was both bourgeois and carefree. His father Henri, a self-made businessman, insisted that neither Jacques nor Zissou attend school, instead recruiting private tutors whose main aim was to keep Henri’s offspring amused. He once said: “I have plenty of money. My children should learn how to spend it.”Later, Lartigue’s name would become synonymous with a certain kind of ritzy glamour and elegance, epitomised in his countless images of his lover, Renee Perle, whose sultry beauty captivated him. In the 1920s and early 1930s, he was known primarily as a society photographer, shooting the rich and beautiful in the resorts along the Côte d’Azur, where he felt effortlessly at home. The life he lived seems to have been as gilded as the lifestyles of the film stars, models, socialites and playboys he photographed.In her new book, The Boy and the Belle Époque, Louise Baring concentrates on Lartigue’s childhood and teenage years, the majority of the photographs included having been taken before he turned 18. She traces a formative journey that begins in the early 1900s, when the Lartigue family lived in opulence in Paris and their country retreat in the Auvergne, and continues until 1914, when the outbreak of the first world war signalled the end of the belle époque.Lartigue’s life during this period pertains to the arc of a classic French coming-of-age novel. He was an instinctively gifted, voraciously curious prodigy who found his creative medium as a child, and was sustained by it throughout his formative years and into his adult life.From the start, it seems, Lartigue had one eye on posterity, creating photo-albums and journals of the things he witnessed. Aged 11, he photographed his bedroom from ground level, furniture and a mirror looming over his toy racing cars.More often, as the array of model racing cars suggests, he was drawn to movement, and, as a child, often photographed relatives and servants jumping off walls and over tables to his instructions. In one memorable image, he captured his cousin Simone taking a tumble from a homemade scooter. His most intriguing early subject, however, was Zissou, a daredevil and a dandy, who built and raced his own go-karts, tearing around the grounds of Chateau de Rouzat, the family’s country retreat, in goggles and a tailored suit. Zissou was the eccentric action man, while Jacques, as Baring puts it, was “a sensitive child who became a lifelong spectator”.Later, he would photograph speeding racing cars in a blur of motion and beautiful socialite women framed like exotic creatures in closely cropped compositions. When these images were belatedly discovered and exhibited decades later, they attested to Lartigue’s instinctive embrace of what later became known as the snapshot aesthetic, a term loosely applied to 60s iconoclasts such as Garry Winogrand and Lee Friedlander, who disregarded the rules of formal composition. Back in the early 1900s, when Lartigue embraced blur and movement, his approach was so singular that it amounted to what Baring calls “a new visual language of the 20th century”.On 29 May 1910, Lartigue, then 15, began a new adventure in a new setting, arriving at the Avenue du Bois de Boulogne in Paris with an unwieldy folding plate camera. His aim was “to photograph the ladies in the most outrageous and beautiful hats”. Back then, the Bois de Boulogne in early summer was an open-air promenade, where society women paraded their style. They often crossed paths on the Allée des Acacias with the more bohemian and even more fashionable women of the Parisian demimonde: actors, dancers, musical hall stars and “grand cocottes” – courtesans like Liane de Pougy, a friend of the novelist Colette, and Émilienne d’Alençon, a great beauty who would later become Edward VII’s lover.Although cold-shouldered in public by respectable members of Parisian high society, these demimondaines, writes Baring, “set the style, deciding which couture creations would rise or fall in the coming season”. Lartigue captured them all, often startling his exotic subjects with the loud click of his camera’s shutter. The results are fascinating, a record of a time and place when this sartorial exhibitionism was simply another ersion in, as Colette scathingly put it, “the bustling lives of people with nothing to do”.At times, Lartigue inevitably comes across as a proto-paparazzo. More often, though, he captures vignettes that speak volumes about the elastic social mores of the belle époque. His snatched portraits, for all the period detail they capture, seem, like his previous images of speed and movement, oddly contemporary. The blur, the often fantastical silhouettes, the sideways glances, the way he crops his images so that his subjects loom large – and even more exotic looking – in the frame, point to a singular sensibility that was at odds with traditional composition.Throughout this period, his love of speed and movement remained. He photographed the early French pioneers of flight, Gabriel Voisin and Louis Blériot, as they risked life and limb in an aerodrome near Paris. At the 1912 Grand Prix in Dieppe, he made one of his most famous early photographs, freeze-framing the rear of a Delage racing car as it sped past him at close range. The driver clutches the wheel as observers on the other side of the track appear as leaning shadows, their blurred outlines evincing the sense of motion that Lartigue set out to capture. In retrospect, all those childhood days snapping Zissou on his go-karts and his cousins leaping through the air seem to lead to this defining moment.If Lartigue was a photographer of the age of speed and modernity, he was not a man of action when it came to the war, which, for the main part, seemed to pass him by as if happening elsewhere. As France ordered general mobilisation, he retreated with his family from Paris to the Auvergne and the sanctuary that was Chateau Rouzat.“The war inevitably made us unhappy,” he wrote in a secret diary, “but it was happy all the same… I played sports and we still amused ourselves.” There is a single image in the book that suggests the unfolding horror: a platoon of marching soldiers silhouetted against a grey sky as a spindly aeroplane flies overhead. The war inevitably curtailed his carefree life, writes Baring, but “Lartigue emerged intact, plunging into life with the passions of a child, refusing ever to grow up”. That childlike optimism would fuel his life and his photography for decades to come."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0814345af234de0659b1083e7836a90d04294451/0_1513_4253_2551/master/4253.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f8a5fabf6d550a6bfea908be1bf52ccf","title":"the big picture on the road in post ceaucescu romania","story":"An odyssey around remote parts of central and eastern Europe led Fabio Ponzio to this incongruous sightBefore the collapse of the Soviet Union, Italian photographer Fabio Ponzio would look at a map of Europe and find his eyes always drawn to the east, to its “mysterious names, inscrutable frontiers and roads that ran on into unknown, prohibited lands”. It seemed to him that the iron curtain was “the ision between the conscious and the unconscious mind of Europe”.He first travelled across that dreamlike frontier in 1987, two years before revolutions reunited the continent. After the wall came down, over the course of a couple of decades, he drove determinedly through all the remote territories from which he had been excluded, with a tent and a stove and a sleeping bag in the back of his car, along with three Nikon cameras and 100 rolls of film. He slept in woods or in the homes of people he met. Once, in the mountains of Albania, the villagers told him that he was the first foreigner they had seen since two Italian soldiers fleeing the armistice of 1943.His pictures from those years – of weddings and funerals, of drunks and pilgrims, the homeless of the cities and the rural poor – caught cultures in the hinterland after communism and before consumerism. That period, as the hope of liberation gave way to endemic uncertainty, is the subject of his book East of Nowhere. Ponzio’s camera was drawn to incongruity. He took this picture in Romania in 1997, eight years on from the fall of Ceaușescu. The international licence plates and the open road stretching out beyond the mountains might promise new freedoms, but the sheep in the back of the car root this image in a stranger, older more unstable kind of reality.

Having decided to devote her thesis to the way that fishing shapes a community, she moved to Newlyn in Cornwall – which is where she met Don, the skipper of a rusty old trawler called the Filadelfia. Would Don consider taking her out in his boat, so that she might stand, as it were, in “the same wellies” as his crew? Somewhat to her amazement – women are supposed to bring bad luck at sea – he said that he would, and so it was that one evening in 2017 she found herself rounding Land’s End just as the sun was about to set, her stomach a tight knot of nerves, her eyes already red from the salt-licked wind. “I’m someone who doesn’t think too hard about things before I do them,” she says. “I seem not to be very cautious I get overexcited. But that day, yes, I was nervous. I was very scared of seasickness. Not so much of being sick itself, but of it being so bad that I would be useless and they would have to take me home. I didn’t want to do anything to jeopardise their trip I knew that would cost them a lot of money.”In the end, she was sick, but only once. “You start yawning,” she says. “And that’s when you know you’re going to go, and you don’t want the men to see because it’s such a sign of weakness.” Most of the time, however, she was able to manage her constant, raging nausea with a combination of seasickness pills and hard work among other things, she learned to gut every kind of fish, holding the gasping, flapping creatures tight in her hands even as she struggled properly to stand upright. Life on a trawler is hard, the days long and tough and extremely cold, and thanks to this she found that she was always hungry for the vast meals the crew cooked and ate down below, sickness or no sickness.As for the things that tied her to the land – her parents, her friends – she learned not to think of them. It embarrasses her now to remember the moment when, not long after they had set sail, she asked Don for the Filadelfia’s wifi code. (“Do you know how much that costs at sea?” he told her, with a laugh.) Her phone useless in the pocket of her oilskins, she found that time deepened at sea. She learned to speak a new language, one at once both more reticent than the English spoken on land and yet, in some ways, more open, too. In the wheelhouse, talking to Don or one of the other men while they were on watch – on a trawler, you’re potentially only ever seconds from catastrophe hit an old anchor or some submarine cables, and the vessel can easily capsize – she learned to listen to the long, meditative gaps between sentences, spaces that allowed words to “expand and drift” in ways that rendered them altogether more meaningful.Did the world of the Filadelfia feel very male? Was it unnerving to sleep in her bunk – its size and shape made her think of a coffin – alongside all those snoring, hairy, briny men? “I didn’t especially experience it like that, no,” she says. “They were older than me they’re family guys, and their women are very strong. The biggest fishing family in Newlyn, the Stevensons, has a matriarch at the head of it. I never felt unsafe, though now and then I would ask one of them: would you say that to a man? But I did want to prove myself a bit. I was never going just to sit there and make notes and take photographs.” Ash studied English at Oxford, and Don made her think of Singleton, the old sailor on Joseph Conrad’s Narcissus: the men who could understand Singleton’s silences were, she recalled, those mariners who “knew how to exist beyond the pale of life”. Staring out into the blue-black, she realised on that first night aboard the Filadelfia that she and its crew had now themselves moved beyond the pale: a confined, almost monastic existence, and yet an unencumbered, roaming one, too – and so began what she thinks of today as the richest and most vast experience of her life so far.Ash’s eight-day stint on the Filadelfia forms the spine of her first book, Dark, Salt, Clear: Life in a Cornish Fishing Town artfully, she returns to it again and again, to the point where you come to believe she must always have known she would one day put the experience between hard covers. But this was, she insists, never her plan. Her thesis complete, she was interning at the Times Literary Supplement when a publisher spotted a piece she had written about a trip she took on another trawler, the Crystal Sea – that publisher asked to meet her, and duly gave her a book deal (she now works for an educational charity). And in person, it’s impossible not to take her at her word. I’m amazed and slightly shocked when she reveals that she spent, in total, just three and a half months in Newlyn something about her book – the intimacy of the encounters it describes the epic quality of her account of life on the Filadelfia – leads you to imagine that she must have lived there for a year at least, and possibly much longer.She and I meet in Penzance. She has been in Newlyn all weekend, seeing old friends and mooching around, and when I get off the train on a bright Monday afternoon, she pitches up in a long coat and with a ravishing new pixie haircut looking like someone who is slightly drunk on fresh air. For both of us, London and Covid-19 suddenly seem very far away. We can breathe. St Michael’s Mount casts its usual spell out in the bay (24 hours later, the National Trust will announce that it is now closed to the public). The Jubilee Pool, Penzance’s celebrated art deco saltwater lido, looks strangely inviting even in mid-March. The people, mostly retired, that we pass as we walk along the promenade are unhurried and smiling.Still, it’s important not to take things at face value. Ash has a family connection to this part of Cornwall she spent her childhood holidays in Lelant, near St Ives, where her mother’s side of the family has lived for generations. But if those times were idyllic – her mother, a former actor who once appeared in Poldark, was always encouraging her to let her imagination run wild as they walked on the beach – Cornwall has, of course, a darker side: chiaroscuro shades that she learned to see (“another way of looking”) more clearly during her time in Newlyn.In Newlyn, Ash carefully points out the sights to me. Here is the fish market, where she once spent a morning unpacking catch after catch, her fingers so cold she could not feel them (stored in ice, the lemon sole were the hardest to break apart) here is the Swordfish Inn, AKA the Swordy, where she used to drink with her new fishermen friends (it was once ranked second in a TV documentary entitled The Toughest Pubs in Britain) and here is the little house where she lodged with a couple she came to think of as her  angels, Denise and Lofty (Denise worked in a fishmongers Lofty is a ship chandler). Finally, we go past Newlyn’s lifeboat station and out on to the pontoons in the harbour to look at the boats. The creaking Filadelfia has, she says, finally given up the ghost, but there are two trawlers here that look just like it: rough, industrial vessels with huge derricks from which their nets drag. In her book, she likens these boats to prehistoric birds with skeletal wings, and as we gaze at them, clanking and inhospitable, it isn’t hard to see why.Brexit is mentioned only rarely in her book its politics are deliberately oblique. But the subject came up a lot while she was in Newlyn. The first trawler she went on, the Crystal Sea, was part of the Brexit flotilla that sailed into London in 2016 (organised by Fishing for Leave, it sailed from Ramsgate to Westminster, demanding that Britain take back control of its waters under the common fisheries policy, European fleets are given equal access to EU waters and fishing grounds up to 12 nautical miles from the coasts of member states). “Its crew spoke about ‘our seas’, which always felt bonkers to me. Fish migrate, and when you’re out there… the sea is vast. It feels as though it belongs to everyone. But we had good debates. They were kind of vital for me. They made me see that arguments about waters are very complicated I stopped assuming that a certain point of view was right.”And what about her? In what ways did her experiences at sea change her? She isn’t, she says, a particularly squeamish person apart from when she was dealing with rays, a fish that seemed to be somehow more fiercely alive than the sole and the monkfish, and which could only be killed with a stab to the heart, she didn’t mind the gutting and the filleting. She was learning new skills, and there was something so unexpectedly beautiful, she thinks, even about their arrabbiata-sauce coloured insides: “The brilliant thing is that every time I have fish now, I think about the supply chain. It has made me more appreciative, knowing that men are out there, risking their lives.” Most people are, she thinks, very distant from their shrink-wrapped food: far too distant: “I have the sense, living in London, of so rarely being involved in real things.”Her time in Newlyn also taught her to think, both as a city person and one determined to be more green, in a more nuanced way about the environmental issues around fishing. “People say we have got to get rid of the trawlers, because of the damage they do to the seabed. But I know that doing so will affect the lives of a whole community – though it’s a relief when you hear about the smaller boats: there is a future that could be greener.” British people need to start eating more hake, she thinks: “We catch so much of it.” (The fishermen of St Ives, incidentally, refer to themselves as Hakes, while the Newlyn men, with whom they are fiercely rivalrous, like to call the north coasters the Scaly Backs.)But she does not want to romanticise. As her book makes plain, fishing takes its effects on mental health some men come to have issues with alcohol (though it is strictly forbidden at sea), and depression is a problem, too. “I hope that I show the limits of close community, as well as its benefits,” she says. “I’ve had my own problems with depression in the past, and it was good to talk to the fishermen about their mental health. I recognised the disassociation they sometimes felt – it’s how they survive – and how scary it can sometimes be.” A fisherman’s life is one of extremes: his sense of jeopardy swiftly replaced by one of celebration when he arrives home safely and hits the pub. As one of the men, Nathan, once told her: when a fisherman is at home, he’s always counting the days until he leaves and when he’s at sea, he’s always counting the days until he’ll be back.On her last night on the Filadelfia, Don cooked (how on earth did he do it?) one of the best meals she has ever eaten – a huge roast dinner of potatoes, mashed swede, Yorkshire puddings, cauliflower cheese, parsnips and beef – after which the crew, in spite of their bloated bellies, landed the best catch of their trip, the derricks moaning loudly as they pulled up the immense haul of prized turbot and cuttlefish (“like waiting for lottery numbers to come up,” Ash thought, as she waited to see what the nets had brought). But after this, the mood changed. No one slept much on that last night.Fishermen call it “channelling”: when thoughts of home, and all the people in it, swim through your mind all night, waking you repeatedly. One of the men tells her that the term is drawn from the word “channel” in its spiritual sense: the conveying of a spirit from another world to this one. (The link between these two worlds is the boat.) And she came to understand that it’s a necessary process. The next morning, as the Filadelfia approached the harbour and a mobile phone signal was once again possible, the boat became simply another place of work rather than, as it was just moments before, the only world that mattered. And now it was the land that seemed suddenly mysterious: a single, unbroken entity she had found herself unable to imagine while she was at sea. Arrival was at once both exhilarating, and anticlimactic. Only when she came face to face with Lofty again did she realise how rancid she smelled – and how little her stench had mattered to her until that moment.Ash’s book comes into the world garlanded with praise. William Dalrymple has called her a new star of nonfiction: “precise, perceptive, humane and sensitive”. What will she do next? Does she have a plan? What, for her, could ever top Newlyn? “I always have lots of plans,” she says. “I want to go to Texas for a year, and write about my family on my father’s side: my grandfather was from Dallas, and after the war he set up the Marxist Leninist Society of London. For me, Cornwall is very blue, and I want to look at redness…” She thinks for a moment. “Or perhaps I’ll do a PhD about coastal communities. I need to wait for the pull.” In the meantime, though, of one thing she is certain: that she must go back to using an old-fashioned “brick” phone. “I enjoyed listening to the men at sea. Out there, I realised how our phones are stopping us from listening, and I want to get back really to listening to people.” Her eyes, which today are precisely the same colour as the English channel, meet my own, and hold them for a long minute."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cfacdefdd236d311cd6605d4f75a904d1eee3f2c/815_0_2222_1333/master/2222.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=53ecd2eb63f3af9d7d27b76de9021210","title":"philip green urged not to use coronavirus as excuse over pensions","story":"Billionaire Topshop magnate is planning to stop cash injections during pandemicSir Philip Green has been urged not to use coronavirus as an excuse to stop payments into the Topshop retirement scheme, as a pensions expert called on the billionaire’s Monaco-based wife, Tina, to plug any shortfall.Arcadia Group, the parent company of the Green family’s retail empire, is planning to halt cash injections into the firm’s pension fund as it seeks to conserve cash to survive the coronavirus crisis that has dealt a devastating blow to retailers.But MP Rachel Reeves said businesses “will need to answer for their decisions during this pandemic and whether they did the right thing by workers and pension holders”. She said the pandemic should not be used as an excuse to reduce pension provision for loyal staff.John Ralfe, who has previously advised MPs investigating the collapse of Green’s defunct retail chain BHS, said there was no reason to leave the scheme “short-changed”.Arcadia’s plan involves postponing payments that were agreed with the Pensions Regulator last year as Green sought a company voluntary arrangement (CVA), a controversial form of insolvency, to keep the retail group afloat.The regulator and pension trustees agreed to allow the company to halve contributions into the Arcadia scheme from £50m a year to £25m, in exchange for Tina Green pledging to put in £100m to make up for the shortfall. The deal involved Lady Green paying in instalments of £25m a year from her own wealth, plus an extra one-off £25m payment.While Philip Green chairs the business, it is owned by Tina Green, based in tax-free Monaco. The Green family took a £1.2bn idend from the company in 2005, while Tina Green was paid £25m by the retail group in 2017.While Arcadia plans to suspend the company’s immediate contributions to the pension scheme, it said the payments from Tina Green would continue and would arrive on time.But Ralfe said the company could avoid suspending any pension contributions during the coronavirus crisis if she agreed to bring forward the £100m in contributions rather than staggering them.“If Arcadia wants to delay its payments to conserve cash flow, then Lady Tina should bring forward her payments so the pension scheme gets the same amount,” Ralfe said. “Given Lady Tina’s significant net worth, the Pensions Regulator must ensure that coronavirus is not an excuse for the Arcadia pension scheme to be short-changed.“The latest Arcadia annual report at August 2018 shows a £138m deficit – £931m assets and £1.07bn liabilities – which today will be around £90m, given deficit contributions and other movements.“If Arcadia were to enter administration, the deficit would be much higher, at £350m–£400m.”Ralfe has previously advised a parliamentary committee examining the demise of BHS, which Green sold for £1 to former bankrupt Dominic Chappell. Following an outcry from MPs and the public, the billionaire eventually agreed to pay £363m to prop up the collapsed company’s pension scheme.Arcadia declined to comment."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d4efaaef554cae987f77ca43542930642c310238/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4fd941d00ae619c75a3b0c82595ef108","title":"coronavirus means we really are finally all in this together","story":"The realities of this crisis have punctured the isive myth of strivers and shirkers. If it returns, it will cause even more damageI saw a coronavirus banner the other day that said “Check in on your five nearest neighbours”, and I thought about Errol Graham.Back in January, just as China’s Covid-19 outbreak was turning critical, the story broke of how Graham, a grandfather of two and lover of football, had died aged 57. In June 2018, bailiffs pursuing him for nonpayment of his rent had found Graham’s body, which weighed just four and a half stone. A coroner’s report said he suffered from severe social anxiety, and had isolated himself from even family and friends. His flat in Nottingham had no gas or electricity, and there was no food in his fridge apart from two cans of fish that were four years out of date.Eight months before Graham’s body was discovered, his benefits had been stopped after he didn’t attend a fitness for work assessment. Among the items found in his home was a letter addressed to what news reports called “welfare officials”, pleading with them to “judge me fairly”.Graham’s case received a lot of attention, not least in the . But for all the awfulness of his story, it never really caught the popular imagination: at the time it was covered, the media was still aflame with controversy about the opinionated actor Laurence Fox and the fate of the Duke and Duchess of Sussex. Graham was one particularly tragic example of something that 21st-century Britain has long been in danger of accepting as a given: a nasty, punitive benefits system seemingly run according to the inhuman rhetoric we have regularly heard from politicians – and still might be hearing, had Covid-19 not arrived.For about a decade now, the cruelties of that system and their consequences have existed in plain sight. We all know the basics: a population ided into “skivers” and “strivers”, people either ill or disabled summarily judged fit for work, joblessness usually assumed to be the fault of the jobless person, and the endless cruelties of the “sanctions” that mean many people have had their benefits arbitrarily suspended, leaving them barely able to survive. In February it was revealed that the National Audit Office had linked at least 69 suicides to the workings of the benefits system, and this number was probably an underestimate.Six weeks later, the fact that people in charge are suddenly speaking a language of solidarity and accepting that unemployment is a consequence of economics rather than character failure is something to behold. Whatever its caveats, Rishi Sunak’s “plan for people’s jobs and incomes” is welcome so is hearing him talk about people “not being able to pay the rent or the mortgage” and “not having enough set by for food and bills”. There is a truly astral irony in Sunak’s efforts being saluted by that well-known Tory sympathiser Bernie Sanders. Nonetheless, just about every part of the benefits machine that has ruined so many lives is, inevitably, still in place. We will sooner or later find out if it can survive this huge undermining of its basic logic – and either grind on or at last be changed.As my colleague Polly Toynbee pointed out last week, there will be a very large gap between the communitarian words of politicians and the reality that people new to benefits will discover when they begin trying to access universal credit. This is already becoming clear in the stories of day-long waits on helplines and the mounting sense of a new segment of the population finding that supposed “welfare” falls far short of what is required to avoid debt, bad housing, ill health and all the rest. Yes, the government has loosened some aspects of universal credit, working tax credits and payments for housing. The Department for Work and Pensions has announced that people receiving benefits will not have to attend the usually compulsory jobcentre appointments for at least three months – a move that, in theory at least, suspends the sanctions regime. But even these things could sooner or later revert to normal, with consequences that this crisis and its aftershocks will inevitably make worse.Outside of major cities, I have heard these things so many times that they have often seemed as unremarkable as the weather. In many cases, they are a dysfunctional sign of the resentments and frustrations sown by insecurity and want. They have been repeatedly stoked by politicians – most obviously by Conservatives, though rifling through the news archives throws up such memorable headlines as “Gordon Brown to crack down on benefit cheats in Queen’s speech” (from 2008). But to some extent, people in Westminster were merely seizing on malign views already present in the culture. The most pitiful thing to see was the acceptance of these opinions by people whose experiences showed how misplaced they were. I remember going to the Cheshire town of Warrington eight years ago and, watched by press officers from the Department of Work and Pensions, interviewing a 27-year-old man who had just endured nine months of unemployment. He said he had been averaging 25 to 30 job applications a week, most of which had not even got a reply. “I think I should have applied for more,” he said. “I should have tried more. When you’re feeling down, you start blaming the world for your mistakes … You feel the world owes you. And it doesn’t.”If millions of people are suddenly staring into the most uncertain future imaginable, and 500,000 people are suddenly applying for universal credit, will those ideas survive? Put another way, what will happen to the beliefs and prejudices that have defined so much of the last 10 to 15 years, encouraged by politicians chasing votes: mutual suspicion, a manic belief in “personal responsibility”, and the very British tendency to focus your furies on the people down the street?In his capacity as a newspaper editor, the former chancellor George Osborne last week commissioned a special back page of London’s Evening Standard emblazoned with the slogan “London stands together”. God knows, in times as dreadful as these our capital city could do with as much solidarity and mutual care as it can get. But I also wonder about the infamous speech he made in 2012, all cheap misanthropy and cynicism: “Where is the fairness, we ask, for the shift worker, leaving home in the dark hours of the early morning, who looks up at the closed blinds of their next-door neighbour sleeping off a life on benefits?” While imploring the young and strong to stay in their homes in the interests of the old, infirm and vulnerable, we now want those same neighbours to be embracing their common humanity, and checking on each other’s welfare. We had better hope they will."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/31e81f5cf108273e03ec60496a5e75494cde448b/0_135_3370_2023/master/3370.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=426f34e9983d810823a23b7f624bad52","title":"coronavirus reality work unemployment","story":"This pandemic is throwing into stark relief a treacherous fact: we depend on employment, both for survival and a sense of selfOffices empty, restaurants and cafes closed, performance venues dark, schools and universities shut down. Across the world, numerous industries have entered a state of suspended animation, imposing a sharp and involuntary brake on the working lives of millions of people.This week, having moved my psychoanalytic practice online, I’ve sat in an empty consulting room talking to patients via video-conference, many of them struggling to process what life in the shadow of Covid-19 might mean in the short- and longer-term. Some are lamenting the lost sense of belonging they derive from their workplaces, as well as the claustrophobia of being shut in with partners and children.For others, the fear is more immediate: oneself or a loved one becoming ill and unable to work, the demise of a business, the contraction or total erosion of a livelihood. And lurking behind all these grim prospects, ensuring I’m not immune from this rapid contagion of anxiety, is the possibility that my psychoanalytic practice may be sacrificed to this grim new financial reality.My interest in the question of how to live without work lead me to write a book on the topic. I discussed clinical cases, as well as lives of major artists and thinkers, that spoke to the importance of renewing contact with our neglected inner lives and letting our minds roam without the imperatives of productivity or purpose dogging every moment. I asked how we could loosen the grip of the centuries-old ethic that ties our sense of self so inextricably to our work.In thinking about a world without work, I had in mind a future of automation and AI, rather than the unthinkable shock of a global pandemic. I followed Oscar Wilde in The Soul of Man Under Socialism and tried to imagine life unburdened by the yoke of necessity. Now, Wilde’s vision of a society freed by automation to realise its creative potential is a painful contrast to the workless reality being foisted on millions.Under very different conditions, we could imagine a period of life without work as the most precious of gifts – the chance to live at our own pace and rediscover the pleasures and possibilities of free, aimless time. But this can only be the case when work ceases to be a matter of survival and when its loss doesn’t plague us with anxiety, depression and sleeplessness. The virus, in other words, is throwing into stark relief an obvious yet suddenly treacherous fact of life today: we depend on work.This dependence is partly a matter of survival nothing is more liable to arouse a sense of helplessness than the threat of poverty or hunger. But beyond survival, work shapes our sense of self. The thought of being without it induces existential terror. “I’m scared of the loss of income, for sure,” a woman with a suddenly precarious job in the arts said to me recently, “and obviously my health. But I’m more scared of losing myself.”It’s a fear many will share. With the lockdown, it seems we’ve lost the routines that give substance to our lives. Need this mean losing ourselves? I’d like to believe that this period could help us discover new creative resources within ourselves, a thought that takes me to the unlikely figure of Xavier de Maistre, a French aristocrat who in 1790 spent 42 days under house arrest in Turin, Italy, for duelling with an officer.De Maistre whiled away the hours of solitude by writing a journal of his confinement, A Journey Around My Room, which takes us on a strange journey across the walls and floor of his bedroom. He envisioned this motionless travel as a kind of radically democratic tourism, requiring no disposable income or gratuitous effort. In words that take on an eerily hopeful resonance at this moment, De Maistre insists that the Turin authorities “may have forbidden me to travel through a city, one place, but they left me the entire universe: infinity and eternity are at my command”.But in these times, even the most insulated of us can’t be De Maistre. Even if we enjoyed similar financial privilege, we lack the comfort that the world we return to when our own house arrest is over will be as it was when we left it. And, of course, most of us enjoy no such privilege. Our reveries in front of our bedroom walls are bound to be disturbed by fears for the future – both ours and the world’s.What if those fears and concerns for others could help fuel a different kind of imaginative transformation? If we can’t, like De Maistre, withdraw into the peaceful cell of our own daydreams, we can (assuming we’re well enough) channel our creativity into refreshing our neglected social and emotional bonds.Think of those offers of help being popped into neighbours’ letterboxes, those helping at food banks, the thousands of NHS volunteers, or the Help Hub psychotherapy project, originating in Oxford and now offering free online sessions to those in need of human contact and solidarity. In a recent session, a patient who had signed up to at least one of these initiatives spoke of “a miraculous outbreak of community-mindedness”. “It’s not just about being good,” he said, “it’s about realising how helpless you feel, and taking back a bit of control.” Weeks ago, I’d never have imagined I’d hear that phrase again and feel warmed. But that, after all, is a lifetime ago."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c2c5f0fd58c815fe00c817a47ade7f0dfb55f31f/0_48_3928_2356/master/3928.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a567512b0645170227b867232d4204a6","title":"out with pub bores back in with the experts","story":"Boffins are suddenly in fashion again ... ‘waving their statistics and strategies like prayer flags. Help us, experts! We are sorry!!’“When the government closed the pubs, I said –I didn’t mince my words, I said to them myself,HURRY UP PLEASE IT’S TIME.”MS Toilets, The Wetherspoonland, 1922A public health official friend tells me her colleagues now call the Covid-19 virus “Wetherspoon’s Mumps”, a darkly comic response to Wetherspoon boss Tim Wetherspoon’s initial resistance to closing his pubs for the safety of his customers.It isn’t for civilians to criticise the black humour our brave health professionals deploy to combat the traumatic stress of the war on the coronavirus, especially as I made up the phrase “Wetherspoon’s Mumps” myself out of my own head. Twitter rumours that the virus first jumped species here in the UK after a certain Wetherspoon’s regular had sex with a Wetherspoon’s Steak \u0026amp Kidney Pudding ™ ® in the toilets at the William Withering in Wellington are similarly imaginary.But even as a diehard Remoaner, I have some sympathy for the Wetherspoon’s project. In many areas of the country, Tim Wetherspoon’s cheerful outlets are the only plug for the yawning social chasms left by his friends the Conservatives’ gradual closure of various community hubs over the past decade. And they are warm. And dry.Tim Wetherspoon’s booze palaces are pie-and-a-pint flophouses for the daytime diaspora of the austerity era, where inexpensively nourished customers are hypnotised by bespoke and quite brilliant regionally specific carpet designs and beguiling guest ales, before being seduced by slogan-strewn anti-EU beermats while at their most mentally pliable.One can hardly blame Tim Wetherspoon for making the scientifically unverified claim, on Sky News on Friday 20 March, that there had “been hardly any transmission in pubs”. If, like me, you have contentedly spent entire days in Tim Wetherspoon’s premises, you will know they are magical environments where the laws of science are routinely defied, leaving customers unsure of how they got home, which kind of pie they ate, or even of who they are. And Tim Wetherspoon himself fronted a factually fluid Brexit campaign, endorsed and abetted by our current prime minister, that eschewed evidence and experts as if they were the sort of things only traitors valued.But experts are suddenly back in fashion with a vengeance, emerging blinking from the hidden priest holes of the academic institutions that sheltered them during the public book-burnings of the Brexit campaign, waving their statistics and their strategies like prayer flags. Help us, experts! We are sorry!!In a strange synchronicity, the people who encouraged distrust in experts are quietly disappeared. Michael Gove is rarely seen, and the results of recent wastewater tests in London, which suggest cocaine use in the capital has fallen by a third, can be attributed solely to the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster’s absence from Notting Hill street corners.Jacob Rees-Mogg is also silenced, presumably in case he suggests the victims of Covid-19 had brought their suffering on themselves, by not having the common sense to stay inside their country mansions eating only food foraged from their private estates by their personal servants and their hounds.But Turds is rarely seen these days without being flanked by the mitigatingly solemn countenances of informed experts, his public performance mode of flippant and deliberate dishonesty suddenly forced into an ill-fitting rubber mask of knowledgeable concern, like the wolf in Little Red Riding Hood pretending to be the grandmother by pulling the bedcovers up over his snout and speaking in a high voice.You don’t have to be able to go outside your front door to see that senior Conservatives’ offer of a “Covid coalition” with Labour is a trap for Keir Starmer, the Conservatives’ Labour leader of choice, and the Little Red Riding Hood of this lupine ruse. Starmer could share the blame for the pandemic’s mismanagement, sparing Turds. It’s a trick as transparent as the warm pat on the back David Cameron gave to the slaughtered lamb of Nick Clegg in the Downing Street rose garden 10 years ago, before spinning him round to use as a human shield in the ensuing hail of press-corps machine-gun fire.Is it any wonder that the British public haven’t taken the social distancing advice of this gang of twats seriously when the whole thrust of their campaign this past half decade was that experts are not to be trusted, and that Blitz-spirit Britain could prosper whatever so-called facts were flung at it? But Covid-19 doesn’t just call the Brexit campaign’s bluff. It questions everything about the way we have allowed our society to be run.And as I write this, homeless people housed in Travelodges have just been thrown out into the officially unsafe streets, and we don’t know if kids whose only square meals come from their schools are even eatinge.I don’t consider myself as someone with a significant network of friends, because I spent the past three decades pursuing antisocial evening entertainment work, and because I am arrogant and ill-tempered. But suddenly I find myself in the middle of a massive and mutually supportive email conversation between dozens of like-minded self-employed misfits worldwide, most of whom now have no obvious means of support.The secondhand bookseller touched me the most, who plies his wares from Word on the Water, a barge floating on the canal behind King’s Cross station. He has headed north, unwaged and building a mail-order website, up the River Stort to an uncertain future, like Arrietty making her escape in a floating teapot. He writes: “Capitalism itself is looking like the shiny-suited boyfriend that didn’t bring a bottle.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7b7ad9bccf690f487d67b3bfd5135dc1ea385dee/0_164_5780_3468/master/5780.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1b27f5737c49b3b0d2f0702e66a7cfca","title":"the guardian view on covid 19 and politics institutionally vulnerable","story":"British government and parliamentary democracy are trapped in outdated buildings and habits. The coronavirus has exposed the need to rethink how they workLots of things about modern politics would surprise William Gladstone if the 19th-century Liberal prime minister was unexpectedly reincarnated into the Britain of 2020. Things like press conferences, video links and female MPs would all catch him out. Gladstone would, though, be reassured by one thing. He would easily be able to find his way around Westminster. That’s because the corridors of power in which politics, parliament and government are conducted in 2020 are remarkably unchanged since he died in 1898. The warren of staircases and rooms in 10 Downing Street and the cramped Commons chamber, with MPs jostling through the ision lobbies, would all be familiar to him.Whether Britain benefits or suffers from its traditionalised habits and settings of politics is a recurrent question. But the Covid-19 pandemic poses it in a new way. Parliament went on sitting through world wars and financial crises. Gladstone himself sat through the Great Stink of the summer of 1858, when the Thames became a sewer. But a modern pandemic that has made human proximity unsafe has meant that parliament cannot sit at all, and that MPs cannot do their fundamental job. Business in the chamber became a ghostly charade. Voting by crowding into the aye and no lobbies was deemed too dangerous to attempt. At the height of a national crisis, therefore, many of the checks and balances on government, and parliamentary democracy itself, have effectively collapsed. These issues must be addressed before parliament returns on 21 April.Now the Covid-19 virus has penetrated to the heart of government too. Last Friday, the three most important people leading the fight against the pandemic all went into self-isolation. The prime minister, Boris Johnson, the health secretary, Matt Hancock, and the chief medical officer for England, Chris Whitty, have all been put out of action. So has the Scottish secretary, Alister Jack. We wish them all well and a full recovery. But the disruption at the top of government is huge. The virus has done what the Luftwaffe and the IRA could not. It has made the work of leading the nation in an emergency significantly harder than it was already. When a government has just taken extraordinary powers to impose its rule, this is a particularly bad time to suffer that sort of hit.None of this is to imply that all would be well if only Britain’s government and parliament conducted their business in airy modern buildings with wider corridors, state-of-the-art health and safety provisions, and better designed workspaces. Berlin has spacious, modern government buildings of this kind, but Angela Merkel is having to self-isolate nevertheless. Prime ministers have also been stricken in past emergencies. In the first world war, David Lloyd George spent nine days with influenza in a temporary hospital inside Manchester town hall during the 1918 epidemic. In the second, Winston Churchill had a heart attack in late 1941 and serious pneumonia 15 months later. The reality is that the world cannot be designed, or politics conducted, without risk.Nevertheless, there are lessons to consider and apply. Politics, like the health service, needs the best possible circumstances for it to do its job. The buildings should be more suitable. New ways, like electronic voting, must be prioritised. Before the pandemic, there was already widespread discussion about the adequacy of the institutions of British government and democracy, including their centralisation in London. Spurning a more imaginative modern approach, plans are under way to move parliament into a recreation of the existing chamber while the crumbling Palace of Westminster is refurbished at a cost of at least £4bn, starting in 2025. The Covid-19 pandemic poses questions about that strategy which have to be examined. Many other aspects of public policy will have to be reconsidered when this crisis is over. The ways – and the places – in which we do politics must be part of that rethink too."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9264883e71334d52d6b8142123328394b9276bb8/0_131_3015_1810/master/3015.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=dbe722a3cbcedba43a62c06d590379e8","title":"the guardian view on hungarys coronavirus law orbans power grab","story":"The pandemic has allowed one of Europe’s most authoritarian leaders to marginalise critics and political oppositionIn functioning democracies, any request by a leader for “emergency powers” is rightly subjected to scrutiny. If granted, a suspension of normal constitutional practice will generally come with a strict time limit attached. Boris Johnson’s coronavirus bill, which gives sweeping new powers to ministers, was passed last week with the proviso that MPs would vote every six months on whether it should be renewed. In France, President Emmanuel Macron’s more wide-ranging and draconian emergency measures have a life of two months.It should come as little surprise that the situation is different in Hungary. With characteristic ruthlessness, the prime minister, Viktor Orbán, has taken the political maxim “never let a crisis go to waste” and run with it. In recent years, he has consolidated his power in office by curbing the independence of Hungary’s courts and media, and restricting the activities of NGOs. This week he will almost certainly acquire dictatorial powers. The Hungarian parliament, dominated by his Fidesz party, is expected to rubber-stamp the “protecting against the coronavirus” law, ushering in an indefinite period of what amounts to one-man rule in an EU member state.The new law allows Mr Orbán to rule by decree, alone and unchallenged. The prime minister will be able to override all existing legislation. Elections will not take place. Information on government actions will be provided to the speaker of the Hungarian parliament and the leaders of parliamentary groups.The spreading of “false” information that could lead to social unrest and prevent the “protection of the public” will become a crime punishable by a lengthy prison sentence. Some of Mr Orbán’s cheerleaders in the media have already suggested approvingly that this provision could lead to the arrest of critical journalists.There are well-grounded fears that these powers will be used to further exert and extend the government’s grip on the institutions of Hungarian civil society, and cast critics of government policy as unpatriotic at a time of national crisis. The decision as to when the current emergency is over will be in the hands of Mr Orbán’s Fidesz MPs. A compliant parliament may eventually choose to make permanent some of the arrangements introduced in the context of a global health crisis. “Emergency” measures introduced in 2016 to restrict the rights of asylum seekers are still in place.Dealing with the coronavirus pandemic requires harsh measures which curtail inidual freedoms. Mr Orbán is not the only autocratic leader to have spotted the chance for a power grab. Azerbaijan’s strongman, Ilham Aliyev, has stepped up the harassment of opposition groups. Israel’s beleaguered PM, Benjamin Netanyahu, used an emergency decree to delay the start of his trial on corruption charges, marginalised parliament and moved to enact unprecedented surveillance measures. It now seems possible that a national unity government will be formed with Mr Netanyahu’s main political rival, Benny Gantz, the leader of the Blue and White party. Ominously, in the United States, Donald Trump has begun to consider himself a “wartime president”.MEPs have called on the European commission to launch an inquiry into Mr Orbán’s new law. But it will be in place long before that begins. This will be another bad week for Hungarian democracy."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7cf3260d1426f949a604921473c7384a4933c7a8/0_0_3035_1819/master/3035.jpg?width=1200\u0026amp;height=630\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=crop\u0026amp;overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026amp;overlay-width=100p\u0026amp;overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n\u0026amp;s=07b6058a0c251f094542b5923d655418","title":"your pictures share your photos on the theme of ambience","story":"Wherever you are in the world, this week we’d like to see your pictures on the theme ‘ambience’The next theme for our weekly photography assignment, published in print in the Observer New Review is ‘ambience’.Share your photos of what ambience means to you – and tell us about your image in the description box.The closing date is Wednesday 1 April at 10am.

Like many city-dwellers who have made the change, I do sometimes miss the transport, theatres, cinemas and shops of the capital. Now that these are out of bounds for the foreseeable future, I value even more the things we moved here for: time, space, and nature.During the fine weather of the past week or so, mygarden has been alive with the sounds of spring. From my office window I can hear the metallic wheezing of a greenfinch, the metronomic sound of a chiffchaff calling out its name, trilling wrens, repetitive song thrushes, tuneful robins, and just now, a quartet of ravens high in the sky overhead, uttering their deep, croaking call. And this is not just at dawn and dusk – the traditional peak times for birdsong – but all day long.My large, rural garden is a far cry from the place I grew up – a three-bed semi on a suburban housing estate with a small lawn and flowerbeds – and indeed very different from the various urban properties I lived in for much of my adult life. But nevertheless, when I did live in London, I used to see all sorts of wild creatures in, from and over my various gardens.One advantage of city life is that most creatures are far less fearful of people in the urban jungle than they are in the countryside, meaning you can often get much closer to them. So, wherever you live in the UK – from the centre of the city to the heart of the country – there will always be plenty of wildlife on your doorstep.Given that we are all now living under the equivalent of house arrest, I’m thanking my lucky stars that this crisis has happened just as spring has sprung. Imagine if it had begun in November, when birdsong was non-existent, and the days were shortening. Instead, the timing could not be better, as nature nears its peak of activity. Over the next three months – which, God willing, will be all we have to spend in enforced isolation – Britain’s fauna and flora will be flaunting itself as never before.My teenagers appear to have locked themselves in their bedrooms for the duration, only emerging for meals or to walk the dog. So I have sympathy for those of you with young children, with their constant demands. The good news is that there’s no better way to stave off boredom – and get them outdoors – than engaging their interest in the birds, bees and butterflies making their home in your garden. Keeping a nature diary, making notes and drawings of what you see, is also a great way to motivate them and to maintain your new interest.Before you do, you need to persuade the wildlife to come to your doorstep. If you have never tried to attract birds to your garden, it’s easier than you think. Just as we humans need food, drink and accommodation, so do they. So your mission – should you choose to accept it – is to create the avian equivalent of a five-star hotel and restaurant.There are plenty of reputable mail order companies selling a selection of feeders and food – from a huge tubular apparatus to a small feeder that can be put on the outside of a window – so even if you don’t have a garden, the birds will still come. But don’t cut corners on quality: during the breeding season, when birds need to find natural food such as caterpillars for their chicks, they rely on high-energy foods like kibbled sunflower hearts.Water is equally important, especially during warm, dry weather. A bird bath serves a dual purpose: the birds can both drink and bathe, sprucing up their plumage so they can fly and feed more efficiently.If you haven’t already done so, it’s perhaps a bit late to put up nestboxes, as resident birds such as blue and great tits will already have started prospecting for sites. But if you can get hold of one – or make it yourself – during the next few days it might still be worth doing so. Ideally, put it two or three metres up a tree or fence post, facing north or east (not south or west as the chicks may overheat in the sun).Alternatively, if you have shrubs and bushes in your garden, robins, dunnocks, wrens, blackbirds and song thrushes may already be nesting there. One way to tell if they are is to watch them closely: if you see a bird carrying items of food in its beak, it is almost certainly taking them back to its chicks.Don’t forget to look above you. In towns and cities, house martins and then swifts will soon be with us, the latter tearing across the sky in tight-knit squadrons while uttering their screaming sounds. Here in Somerset, along with many people across the northern hemisphere, I’m eagerly awaiting the first swallow returning from its African winter quarters.Many birds are visible all year round, but now that spring is here, insects are also beginning to emerge. Bumblebees are tough enough to have been on the wing since February: check out the colour and pattern on their abdomen (the rear end) to see which species are visiting your garden.Butterflies are also out on warm, sunny days: many species love gardens as there are plenty of nectar-rich flowers for them to feed. So far only a few species have appeared, but over the next few weeks I’m looking forward to catching up with orange-tip, speckled wood, common and holly blues, and red admirals – which fly here all the way from southern Europe and North Africa. The key to attracting these and other insects is to plant flowers: native varieties are best, but any nectar-bearing blooms will work.Mammals are a lot trickier to see: even the really common species are often shy and mainly nocturnal. You may already be aware of foxes in your neighbourhood – and perhaps even badgers if there is a sett nearby. It’s OK to feed them as long as you don’t put the food too close to the house, and also avoid giving them items out of your hand.To see smaller mammals such as wood mice, voles and shrews, you’ll need to invest in a trail camera, so you can record what goes on in your garden while you are asleep, and then upload and watch the footage the next day. You will probably get lots of cats too.Another largely nocturnal group of visitors to your garden are moths. Forget your hostility towards the handful of species whose caterpillars munch through your best woollens: moths are one of the most erse, beautiful and fascinating creatures on the planet – yet most of us never even see them. To do so, simply wait until dusk, ideally on a warm, muggy and moonless night, and then shine a bright torch on to a white sheet. You’ll be amazed at what you find: including impossibly huge and exotic hawkmoths, which are found throughout Britain, including in our towns and cities. Younger children are especially enchanted by these fascinating and mysterious creatures.These wild visitors are much more interesting if you know what you are looking at so it’s well worth investing in a decent pair of binoculars (for birds and mammals), and in two or three field guides for the key groups you want to identify. Make sure you choose those that only cover British wildlife (not Britain and Europe), otherwise you’ll find that there are lots of species found only on the continent which we never see here at home.For birds, I’d recommend the RSPB’s Pocket Guide, while for insects those from British Wildlife Publishing are superb. And there are sound guides available too, to help you identify birdsong. The downside is that, because of the increased demand for books and other products, it may take a few days or even weeks to get hold of some titles.But why should you bother engaging with the natural world at all? Partly, for your own sanity: it is now proven that being in touch with nature – especially birdsong – is good for your health and wellbeing. Reducing stress and putting the world into perspective is exactly what we all need right now.Nature needs us, too: we don’t need reminding that we are living at a time of an even greater emergency – the climate crisis. The more we know about the natural world, the more we can help it – as Sir David Attenborough wisely noted, “No one will protect what they don’t care about and no one will care about what they have never experienced.”Finally, appreciating the part nature plays in our lives is also, I would argue, an essential part of what makes us human. If any good can emerge from the current situation, then surely one outcome might be a greater appreciation of what nature means to us, and what, in turn, we can do for nature. And whatever the future holds, I promise that you will never ever regret engaging with the wildlife on your doorstep.• Stephen Moss is an author and naturalist based in Somerset, who teaches an MA in Travel and Nature Writing at Bath Spa University. His latest book is The Accidental Countryside: Hidden Havens for Britain’s Wildlife ( Faber)With its smart black, white yellow and green plumage and perky habits, the largest member of the tit family is found in most urban and rural gardens. Listen out for its syncopated song: “tea-cher, tea-cher”, with the stress on the second syllable – hence my children’s name for it, the “teacher bird”.Britain’s commonest bird is normally elusive, but much easier to see at this time of year, when the males make up to half-a-dozen nests before the female chooses her favourite. Look out for a tiny brown bird with whirring wings and, when it lands, a cocked tail and listen for its loud, trilling song.Four species that overwinter as adults have already emerged: the peacock, small tortoiseshell, comma and bright yellow brimstone. And look out for the delightful orange-tip – like a cabbage white with Jaffa-coloured wingtips.If you are lucky enough to have a garden pond, or just some water nearby, this is the peak time for our amphibian species to be laying their spawn – with tadpoles soon to follow.Britain’s favourite bird is at its most belligerent, with the males chasing off any rivals that dare to invade their garden territory. Males are also the ones that sing that delicate, tuneful song the females, which look identical, are busy building a nest."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dc63932315d2ab8fbcb83575c103add1e5d1f9ba/149_0_1726_1035/master/1726.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=90759b5ba4c348c46bf3fa93ed1f2343","title":"the week in wildlife in pictures","story":"The pick of the world’s best flora and fauna photos, including a puma on the streets of Santiago, Chile"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/54d968da8e73715925e04e203f0ee22dbf9b8f63/0_160_3088_1853/master/3088.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c6677b931f1ab3d42c6803b76db1c1fb","title":"kely nascimento deluca if theres a time to use peles name its for something like this","story":"Pelé’s daughter on how she came to make a documentary on women’s football, racism in Brazil and the fight for equality“There are no words,” says Kely Nascimento-DeLuca, the eldest daughter of Pelé, when I ask about her journey from women’s football novice to documentary maker on the subject. “I’ve always been very into football. I love football. It’s like Christmas, every game in Brazil. It’s hard to explain the feeling, the electricity during a game.”Sitting in a cafe in downtown Manhattan, Nascimento-DeLuca is buzzing. Following this interview she will head off to celebrate with her co-director Justin Noto, having just dropped off the footage for Warriors of a Beautiful Game, their feature-length documentary on women’s football, at Rock Paper Scissors, the editors of the acclaimed Netflix documentary Icarus among many other productions.It has been a long and gruelling journey, one that, in January, had Nascimento-DeLuca seriously wondering if she would even finish the film given the money had run dry and she and Noto were running out of options. “But it’s a movie about women’s football” became the all-too-familiar caveat to the praise they would initially receive for the project.“You know what gets me about it?” says an exasperated Nascimento-DeLuca. “Here in the US, in terms of branding and marketing, we’re pretty good. I would sit in these rooms and I would be like: ‘Dude, we sold people a pet rock. Hundreds of thousands of people bought it, but you cannot fathom a cheeky slogan you could make up to get people to go and watch this movie, which is really not just about sport but is about passion?’ It’s people’s stories. It’s women’s stories – which is problematic because people aren’t used to that. My favourite stories in the world are about women, but they are men’s stories about women.”There are some huge names in the film. US women’s national team players past and present such as Alex Morgan and Abby Wambach, tennis and equality hero Billie Jean King, England’s Nikita Parris, as well as the Brazil superstars Marta, Formiga and Neymar are all interviewed. But at thedocumentary’s heart, is the story of the Brazilian Lais Araujo, now 24, who was spotted in a favela eight years ago by Wilson Egidio, Nascimento-DeLuca’s brother-in-law and coach of Manhattan Soccer Club, a youth side based in New York.“There’s this girl who I just saw, Kely, we have to try and get her here,” said Egidio in a text to Nascimento-DeLuca on his return to the city. “There’s no future for her there, she was playing with all the boys, she’s super skinny, she’s 16, she was playing with no shoes on and she’s phenomenal.”Nascimento-DeLuca wanted to help but was also hesitant given she worked as a creative director and, her father aside, had no connection with football. But then while working on a series of T-shirts for a fledgling brand, which included tops with images of Pelé on them, she had an idea. “Listen, I want to shoot this on a girl player,” she pitched to the CEO of the company. “I think we need to change the narrative a little and I know the girl.”It marked the beginnings of a relationship in which Nascimento-DeLuca would grow as much as Araujo. “I have four kids and a job and so our conversations were very much on the side,” says Nascimento‑DeLuca of the early period of their contact after the t-shirt shoot. “She would send me a WhatsApp message excited because she had heard that in a month a scout from the national team would be coming to her town and she was going to work extra hard. In the two years we chatted it happened several times and they never came, ever. Those things started to lodge themselves in the back of my head.”Then, however, Araujo’s life began to change. She got to the US, invested in a good camera phone and with the help of friends made a showreel. It worked – she was soon in the orbit of the University of Florida, having impressed at junior college level, and after impressing for them she caught the eye of those in charge of selecting players for Brazil’s under-20s team. By 2016, she was her country’s No 10 at the U20s World Cup in Papua New Guinea, playing alongside four players who are now senior Brazil internationals.As Nascimento-DeLuca followed Araujo’s journey, her eyes were opened to the struggles of women footballers. “I thought that this was a) an amazing story and b) truly fucked up. That this girl comes from a country that literally breeds talent and had to go through this journey to get to our U20 national team.”That led to Nascimento-DeLuca researching women’s football. “I was really shocked by so many things. I knew nothing,” she says. “I wasn’t necessarily shocked at the systemic sexism, because I’m South American, and a woman, and alive. But I was shocked at some of the statements that were being made in 2015 by those in charge of promoting the team and sport in Brazil.”For someone who has grown up with a global superstar as a father, Nascimento-DeLuca’s social consciousness is striking. “I’ve had a very profoundly unique experience being the daughter of Pelé in a country that is as systemically racist as Brazil. I was always very aware that everywhere we went nobody looked like me, and definitely not my father.“It was interesting because my father is the type of person who treats everyone that works for him like family. I don’t mean altruistically, I mean that he doesn’t know how to have staff. That sounds horrible, I don’t mean to sound uppity, he just doesn’t make that distinction. If you’re standing there and I’m eating? Sit down. It’s because he doesn’t know how to be wealthy.“You become very aware that if it wasn’t for one magical bit of genius, your life could be completely different because of the way you look. That’s huge. There were many painful things about moving to the US at that time. There was no FaceTime. It was like moving to Mars. But they put us in the United Nations school, so we weren’t aliens. And they moved us to a city where no one gave a fuck. Like truly. He was the least famous person here by a mile.”That has meant Nascimento-DeLuca never attempting to capitalise on her connection, partly because in the arts it wouldn’t have helped much anyway. But it certainly helped as she sought to make her documentary. It took a year to raise the money required for Warriors of a Beautiful Game to become a reality, with the first investor being Stéphane Mbia, the former Cameroon international who Nascimento-DeLuca met at a Paris Saint-Germain game.“It’s really interesting to see that it’s all the same emotions, it’s all the same strings it pulls on. And yet one has been allowed to thrive and been allowed to reach incredible parts of society and culture and the other one hasn’t to nearly the same extent.”For Araujo, it has not been easy. She graduated in 2018 and went to Norway, then to Adelaide. Now she is back in Brazil having fallen off the radar after she prioritised her diploma over the NWSL draft and staying in the pool for the under-20s team. For Nascimento-DeLuca, the hope is that she has done her story justice.“I feel a lot of pressure to make the women in the film proud and to tell the story that they want told. I want it to be a love letter to the sport that makes other people fall in love with it.”And perhaps a rather obvious question – has Pelé seen the documentary? “He’s seen the teaser. He said it’s good,” she says with a laugh. “But he’s always like: ‘I’ll reserve my judgment, let’s see the whole thing first’.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d5b563bef60c06a22dc65a18c391f63ff42549e6/0_205_4288_2573/master/4288.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7fbf6db44295c69e872bcaa9495cbe9d","title":"birds buds bright days spring healthier happier","story":" Longer, lighter days can help us banish old habits, sleep better and improve our mental health, even during the lockdownThank goodness that, in this time of crisis, it is now spring. In the northern hemisphere, at least, we can say hello to green shoots, flowers, bumblebees and butterflies. Finally, the clocks have gone back to British Summer Time. We’ve lost an hour of sleep, but hello, light.The greatest hope for the new season this year is that better weather will start to make it harder for coronavirus to spread. And for those lucky enough to still have their health, spring can provide other consolations. Its strong sense of a new beginning nudges our outlook and actions in welcome ways. Katherine Milkman, a behavioural scientist at the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania, has studied the phenomenon and found that there is more to spring cleaning than the sunlight suddenly showing up cobwebs and window smears. “The start of spring generally makes us feel more motivated – it’s a so-called ‘fresh start date’,” she says. As such, it makes us feel less connected to the past. “That disconnect gives us a sense that whatever we messed up on previously, we can get right now. Maybe the old you failed to quit smoking or start a lasting exercise routine, but the new you can do it.”These moments, she says, also tend “to promote bigger-picture thinking, which gets us focused on our goals”. Whether facing health, financial or professional worries, newly working from home or home schooling, or being suddenly at a loss for something to do, Milkman says this effect can stretch “across all of our goal-oriented activities. We’ve seen that it affects everything from decisions about exercise to retirement savings.”“As humans, we evolved in a tropical place, where there was a lot more light,” Selsick says. This means our brains have evolved to expect a certain amount of it. “It’s probably why we are so susceptible to changes in light,” he says. And why the gloomier months can negatively affect sleep patterns and mood.Sad symptoms that spring might alleviate include low mood, tiredness, sleeping longer than normal and, says Selsick, cravings of carbohydrates in particular. So feel free to harness this knowledge to fuel a new effort to start exceeding your five a day.Now that most of us are only allowed out once a day, for exercise, the greatest gains in terms of making the most of spring light are to be had from stepping out first thing in the morning. Not only will getting up and out help avoid the crowds of joggers, but morning light is the most crucial for setting our circadian rhythms. “It’s much better at synchronising our body clocks and getting us back into sync with the outside world,” says Selsick.When it’s dark, we produce melatonin, which acts as a time signal to the body, telling it we should be sleepy. “That first bit of light in the morning,” says Selsick, “is very effective at switching that melatonin off, which then tells the brain and the rest of the body it’s now time to be awake and active.The big danger with being locked down, warns Selsick, is “allowing your whole rhythm to drift”. Even if a temporary break from commuting allows you to sleep in a little, keep your waking-up time consistent to reap the benefits of the spring sunshine. “If you’re getting that first dose of light at a different time every morning, your body has no idea where it is in time,” he says. “You’re essentially jet-lagging your body by having a different rising time every day.” Setting regular meal times helps keep our daily rhythms in sync, too.It’s essential that we make the most of opportunities to be outside, whether it’s that one permitted outing, or additional gardening, or spending some time on the balcony. “The more outdoors you can get the better, without getting in close contact with people,” says Selsick.Getting some sun can fill our heads with new ideas, too. In 2005, psychologists at the University of Michigan found that half an hour out in the sun boosted not only mood, but also memory and creativity. To test the latter, they assessed changes in what they call cognitive broadening – “a style of thinking in which people become more creative and which is hypothesised to be an adaptive shift in cognition that leads to behavioral flexibility and exploration”, write the authors.Late-evening light may be less likely to have an impact on circadian rhythms than morning rays, but, says Selsick, “people do generally report a better quality of life if they have some light in the evening”. Indeed. A 2016 study by researchers at Brigham Young University in Utah looked at six years of data from more than 16,000 adults and found that seasonal increases in hours of sunshine correlated with decreased mental health distress.Longer days also seem to extend the amount of use we get from waking hours. When it’s light in the evenings, it feels like daytime for longer. Staying up to batch cook, bake bread or, in the current climate, have beers with friends over Zoom, will seem appealing all of a sudden. “Light does to some extent push sleep away a little bit,” says Selsick. “And people do often feel more alert when there’s bright light.”And of course, with spring, light and warmth comes nature. April will see the return of swallows, swifts, cuckoos, martins and other feathery summer visitors. The more birds we see in our neighbourhoods, and the more greenery, the more robust our mental health will be, according to a 2017 study by the University of Exeter. In 2019, data from 20,000 British people crunched by researchers at the same university showed that the more time spent enjoying nature, the greater life satisfaction reported.This is why GPs have been prescribing gardening as therapy. So plant some seeds and watch them grow, whether that’s in a flowerbed or a window-sill or balcony pot. Get a bird feeder – ensuring it’s inaccessible to squirrels, which are bird’s nest predators. Dig out your binoculars and indulge in some twitching, or figure out (with some online help) which song belongs to which bird. The green shoots of a new chapter in our lives provide opportunities to do better, says Milkman. “The Covid-19 crisis is inaugurating a new era and shaking up our routines. Horrific as the crisis is, it presents an opportunity to size up our routines and consider what we want to change and how we can be better. I hope people will capitalise on that motivation and find ways to help one another (from a requisite social distance) and themselves achieve important goals.”Yes, we are on lockdown. We may be emotionally exhausted and scared, but at least spring makes our daily outdoor exercise allowance more enticing. On warmer days, we can throw open the windows, let the fresh air flood in and expel the indoor pollutants that have accumulated from a winter’s worth of cooking and cleaning. We can welcome the reduction in traffic noise and fumes. These may be bittersweet byproducts of virus hell, but it’s all the better to hear the birds."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7431c7576caf1aa3627345d093d9f78a5ab7e95e/0_747_2900_1739/master/2900.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1c4181c15b547800e275c26aa4105ae5","title":"he didnt even pretend to let us win the worlds biggest stars by their children","story":"The sons and daughters of John Wayne, John Lennon, Caitlyn Jenner and others tell us what it was like to grow up with a world-famous dadA lot of the happy memories of my father are from the late 1960s at Kenwood, the old Tudor house we had in Surrey, when I was a little boy. Without knowing it, I probably saw some of the greatest musicians in the world come and go through that house.I remember sitting on the roof of that house with my dad making a balsawood aeroplane. There was a great view from up there. As a kid, I thought my dad was pretty happy – with the family, the family home and his place in the world. Who could have predicted that everything was about to change?At Kenwood, my father and I were close. So close, in fact, that though my first name is also John, I started to get called Julian or Jules since when my mum would shout, “John, your dinner’s ready!” both my dad and I would react.Then suddenly my dad literally disappeared off the face of the planet. At least, that’s how it seemed to me. He and Yoko Ono were deeply and publicly in love. And I felt as if my mum and I had been cast aside. Not everyone forgot about us, though. Paul wrote Hey Jules after dropping in to check how my mum and I were doing. (Obviously, the title of the song changed to Hey Jude).Maybe 10 years passed during which my dad and I barely spoke. I was very angry about how he left the family. It was thanks to my mum that we started having conversations again. She was such a gentle soul, never vindictive in any way, shape or form. She always wanted me to have a relationship with him.I was scared the first time I went to visit him in the US after my parents’ orce. I was becoming more aware of the magnitude of this man. Much to my relief, the visit was a success. My dad was charming and funny and warm. From that trip on, I remember us getting along better. I hesitated to enter the music business because of who Dad was. I would send him the odd cassette of me playing live, or song ideas I had recorded on a little Sony Walkman he had given me.He warmly encouraged me to continue playing, but sadly, he never really got to see my career unfold, as he passed when I was just 17. When I did finally become a professional musician a few years later, I felt like I understood him better.I try to remember my dad as fondly as possible. I strive for forgiveness and understanding in that area of my life, for the difficult times he put my mum and me through. I loved her more than anything and can’t forget how poorly he treated her. But our relationship was getting better before he died. He was in a happier place. He wanted to reconnect, not just with me but with the rest of his family. He never got a chance to do so. Even now, almost 40 years after he died, I hold my father’s memory dear.Julian Lennon is a musician and photographer and the founder of the White Feather FoundationMy father spent the first 65 years of her life trying to avoid answering the question “How are you doing?” And because of that, she didn’t ask it often, either. And, though, I understand that she avoided the question because the answer would have laid bare too many struggles, it made my relationship with her challenging. People connect with each other through vulnerability, and you can only get someone to open up to you if you are willing to be vulnerable yourself. Because she was shielding something so important from herself, Dad remained distant for much of my life.I don’t have many memories from before my parents split up and my father moved out. I was four at the time. They got orced because my dad had decided to start transitioning to female. I, of course, was too young then to have any idea what was behind their decision.I do, however, remember a few details from my early childhood that only made sense much later. For instance, when I was very young, I used to love to fiddle with people’s ears. Once when I reached out to touch my dad’s ears, he said: “Don’t do that. I just had surgery.” He pointed to a thin line of small black stitches behind his ear, grinned, and said: “They took my ear off, peeled my face back, and then stitched it back on.” For the first few years after their orce, my parents were amicable. Mom started dating David Foster, whom she later married. I never called him dad, but he was the one who lived with us, who told me to pick up my clothes and turn off the lights – all the typical dad things. So even though this is about Caitlyn, I could write just as easily about David. He was a wonderful father figure.A few years after my parents orced, Dad apparently decided that it wasn’t the right time to transition and had many of his surgeries reversed. After that, his relationship with my mother grew more hostile. She had worked hard to accept that the reason he couldn’t be with her was because he was working towards transitioning. When he started dating Kris Jenner, whom he would go on to marry, that line of reasoning fell apart. It was tremendously painful. The effect of my parents’ souring relationship was that I didn’t see my father more than half a dozen times between ages eight and 25.Because of this, most of the memories I have of my dad are from the narrow slice of time before I was eight. I remember him betting my brother Brody and me $20 that he could beat us to the top of these insanely high giant sand dunes in Malibu and then just smoking us. He ran a flat-out decathlete sprint. He didn’t even pretend to let us win.After Dad met and married Kris, family became a business for him, and I stayed away for most of my teenage years. I didn’t want to be a part of their dynamic. When I was in my 20s and his daughters with Kris – Kendall and Kylie – were teenagers, Dad and I began to re-establish a relationship. He wasn’t as needed around the house and, I think, was looking for someone to talk to. Although, to be honest, instead of talking, we did things. We worked on my car or flew radio-controlled planes in the park near his house. But even then, it always seemed Dad had his guard up.Once he decided to go through with the transition, I was the first of her children she confided in. As soon as Dad said it herself, I was so happy for her.As her son, I wish my dad had been able to transition sooner, not only because I think she would have been happier, but because I think we could have built a stronger relationship earlier. Now, I’m making up for lost time. I speak to my dad almost every day, and every time, she asks me, “How are you doing?”Brandon Jenner is a singer and songwriter My dad came from a family of actors. His father, Lloyd, was an actor. His mother, Dorothy, was an actor. His brother Beau is an actor, too. He knows firsthand how weird and challenging it could be to have an actor as a parent, which means he is very good at being a famous actor father.When I was growing up, my dad was really hitting his stride. He made many of his greatest films, from The Fabulous Baker Boys to The Fisher King to Fearless, before I was 10 years old. He was often away shooting for weeks at a time, leaving my mother to look after me and my two sisters. She likes to say she takes care of the empire – and she does.But when my dad was at home, it was like having the greatest, most imaginative friend in the world. What makes him such a wonderful actor is the same thing that makes him a wonderful playmate: he’s a great pretender. He relished opening up his rich inner life to share with me and my sisters, and he was always happy to be part of ours, too. My sisters and I loved to dress him up, put flowers in his hair – he’s always had a nice head of hair – and decorate his face with makeup. When Dad was around, we’d draw or paint or just play pretend for hours. He has such a playful spirit. The only time he ever brought his work home with him was the day he returned from shooting Blown Away still in makeup, his face appearing all bloodied and bruised. I think he wanted to scare us, but we just loved peeling off the stretchy plastic fake blood from his face. It was really satisfying.But, of course, he couldn’t always be at home. When he was away, Dad made sure we stayed connected. He’d call every night. He’d say something like, “Isabelle, when you’re asleep tonight, you’ll see a building. Go through the front door and climb up to the attic. What do you see?”“I see the branch of an oak tree by the window,” I’d reply. Then he’d ask, “Do you see the tree house nestled in the crook of the branch?” I’d laugh and say I did. “Let’s meet there tonight,” he’d say. “What are we going to do?” “We’ll jump on our horses and ride to the mountains.” “Sounds like a plan,” he’d say. In the morning, he’d call again, and we’d go over the adventures we’d had in our dreams the night before.I always knew my father was loving and sweet and playful, but it’s still funny to me that he’s become so closely identified with the Dude. By the time The Big Lebowski came out, I was in high school, and, just like a typical teenager, I had zero interest in my father’s work. (I still haven’t seen some of his films from that period.) What I remember most is that around that time, we were on vacation in Hawaii, and my dad was wearing those hideous Sun Jellies from the movie. They’re one of the most well-known parts of his costume, but they were actually my dad’s own shoes. Anyway, my sister and I were so embarrassed by those godawful jellies, we threw them into the ocean. Today, they’d probably be worth a lot of money.Another funny thing about people conflating Dad with the Dude is that he’s not really a laid-back guy. He gets anxious. He experiences stress. Before he goes onstage, he always says he doesn’t want to do it, and afterward, he is critical of himself. Though he describes himself as “Buddhish”, he doesn’t project Zen calm. He is, however, extremely present. Even more so now that he’s older and a grandfather. I have two kids of my own, and he is very focused on being in their lives. We live in Oakland, but he and my mom visit often. And when he’s not able to be with his grandkids, he calls to plan dream meetings with them, too.Daddy Daughter Day by Isabelle Bridges Boesch and Jeff Bridges (Penguin Random House) is due to be published in OctoberMy father is a big nerd, in the best way possible. He is completely different from his cool-guy persona. When I was 10 we would go to the comic store every week religiously. They even kept a pull box for my dad (the store pulls the new comics on a customer’s list and keeps them behind the counter). Dad’s pull box was full of weird and really violent comics that I wasn’t allowed to read. He and I didn’t start exchanging comic books until I got to college, and when I was there, whenever I went to the comic book store alone, I was sad. I wanted my dad to be there.Though I was largely shielded from it at as a child, my dad was struggling with addiction during much of my childhood. When I was eight, he entered rehab. He was gone for 60 days, which was a confusing time for me. I had no idea anything was wrong. I never saw him drunk that I know of. I just thought he was a dude who slept a lot.We moved to Los Angeles for my mum, LaTanya Richardson: she got a role in a shortlived TV series. But soon my dad’s career really took off, and my mum stopped working as much to take care of me. It’s funny that my father is the better-known actor, because my mum was the one who pushed him to act in the first place. They met in a teacher’s office (They went to different colleges but the teacher taught at both places.) Mum was doing some makeup work. She said, “You need to be in my play. Do you act?” Dad said, “Actually, I don’t,” and my mum replied, “Well, you do now.” And that’s how it went, and how it has gone ever since. My mum turns the key and sends Dad out into the world.I do think it was very hard for my mum to give up her career to raise me for as long as she did, though. She’s happy for my dad, of course, but it’s complicated. There’s a sadness there.I was 12 years old when Pulp Fiction came out. After that, my dad became cool. Or, he thought he did. And though much of the world agrees, he’s still just a big nerd to me. He goes through phases. Once, he gave me a sweatshirt he got from working on Django Unchained. He said, “I signed it for you!” I was like, “Dad, thanks. Now I can’t wear it!” It’s up to my mum and me to pull him back down to earth. I mean, isn’t that what family’s for?Zoe Jackson is an Emmy Award–nominated television producer and director I was born in 1962, at the height of my father’s career. He named me after Ethan Edwards, his character in The Searchers, which many consider to be his best role. My father was tough, but very loving. He was old school. I don’t know how else to describe it. He didn’t talk much, but he could make his few words very, very impactful and meaningful. Other actors fight for lines my dad tried to remove as many words as possible. His friends called him Duke, his childhood nickname. It was the name of his dog, an Airedale. Dad used to deliver papers with Duke. The local firemen called the pair Big Duke and Little Duke. The name stuck. He told me, “Now when someone calls me John, I don’t even turn my head.”In his free time, his life was centred on the ocean. We had a converted Second World War minesweeper called Wild Goose and every summer, we would sail up to British Columbia and Alaska. Every winter, we would take it down to Mexico.When he wasn’t on the boat, Dad was working. So I was raised on movie sets. They were rugged in those days. Our family would stay either in a small rented house or in a little motel. I had a tutor three hours a day, but I learned a lot from my father, too. He never told me “do this” or “do that”, but led by example. You never wanted to disappoint him. Once when we were at a friend’s ranch, he asked me to drive to the house in an old pick-up truck and grab some things for him. I was 12. I got the truck stuck and I had to go tell him. He was in the middle of a card game. He didn’t get up or offer to help. It was clear that I was expected to figure out how to get the truck out on my own.Some of my proudest moments came from living up to my father’s straight-ahead toughness. When we were in Cabo or La Paz, Mexico, we’d anchor the boat far from the shore and swim in. It was about a 25-minute swim. I remember once, when I was seven or eight, swimming into a bunch of sea snakes and saying, “Holy crap. There are sea snakes here, Dad!” He replied, “Yeah, just keep swimming, kid.”Once we made it to shore, we walked around until our clothes dried. He gave me a big hug and said, “Good job, Big Stuff.” I was just so proud to have made it through, proud to be my father’s son.My father died on 11 June 1979. I was 17. At the time, it was just him and me alone in the house my mother had moved out. That day, he said he wasn’t feeling well, so I drove him to the hospital. As we pulled up, there was a crowd of photographers waiting for him so we had to go through the back. I was worried, but I was also a naive teenager and thought he was going to be OK. He just always got through things. I didn’t know it at the time, but that was the last ride I would ever take with my dad.Ethan Wayne is the chairman of the John Wayne Cancer Foundation and president of John Wayne EnterprisesPeople think of my dad as the prince of darkness (the name of his 1967 album), a moody performer who turned his back on the audience out of disregard for them. That wasn’t him at all. But this wasn’t something I truly realised until I stood onstage with him as part of his legendary band: Dad wasn’t turning away from the audience he was turning toward the band. It wasn’t a sign of disrespect for those there to hear him it was a sign of respect for those there to play. And I was lucky enough to be there to play.I knew he was a famous musician, but didn’t quite understand how famous. As a kid, I was always telling him I wanted to be a musician. Finally, when I was 14, he asked if I wanted to go on the road with him in the summer. Of course, I said yes.I learned a lot, not only about music, but about my father, during those summer tours. As I stood in the wings, I saw that playing the music live was the most important thing to him. Those tours were the first sustained amount of time I spent with my father. What I discovered about him was how he could break down what was going on in any musical performance – and find something to take away from it. I remember once watching a heavy metal show on MTV, and when Slayer came on, I thought, “Dad’s going to hate this.” He watched for a bit and then said, “Huh. That drummer is really laying it down, isn’t he?” Then he just walked away.He finally asked me onstage for a tour in 1990. He was giving me a chance and I was terrified of blowing it. I played electronic percussion, which was a genre my dad kind of invented. I didn’t even get any rehearsals. I watched the guy who did it before me for a couple of shows, then I was just kind of on it, in the seat. It was nerve-racking for me, but at the same time, it felt wonderful to have my father turn toward me, to listen to me and to play with me as an equal.Erin Davis, along with his sister and cousin, is an executor of the Miles Davis estateTo Me, He Was Just Dad by Joshua David Stein is published by Artisan at £17.99.

It’s time for us all to try to love the ones we are withThere were a couple of hours, between Boris Johnson’s lockdown announcement and the publication of the document giving more detail, when it was not at all clear whether the children of separated parents would be able to move between them. I did not freak out. I could walk them over with the dog, and the right of a dog to a walk is respected all over the world. Once it was established by the World Health Organization that they couldn’t transmit the virus, quarantine became a moot point for the species, which was a crazy upside-down world, since previously I had never seen the word “quarantine”, except attached to the word “dog”. Yes, that’s right, WHO let the dogs out.My ex doesn’t have a dog, but figured he could borrow one. “It’s quite grumpy,” I said, “do you think it would walk 1.4 miles?” He had another idea. We would both drive to an equidistant supermarket and exchange the kids in the car park. Then I had an idea that was substantially more fun, which was to go into the supermarket, passing each other in an aisle and instructing the children to just change direction, like two spies. While we were arguing about whether that was, in fact, fun, or so extravagantly odd that it would form a mental scar they would remember better than the actual pandemic, new information materialised: children could, in fact, move between their parents’ houses.There was a bit of jiggery-pokery, of course. Michael Gove contradicted this on the telly the next morning, then contra-contradicted himself on the radio half an hour later. The man sounded wild, as if he had been waterboarded by reality.In the meantime, a tsunami of panic had been unleashed among unconventional families. I spoke to a guy who shared the parenting with his son’s two mums. His flatmate had decided that kids were super-spreaders (which, incidentally, they are not Greg Fell, the head of public health in Sheffield, made this explicit point 10 days ago. Kids are flu super-spreaders Covid-19, they seem to carry in the regular way) and did not want the child in the house. This, when you are not allowed out of the house, is some particular kind of headache. Conditions are not ideal for finding a new flatmate, either. Another couple were trialling a separation, but had to get back together to self-isolate.Having swapped the children in the regular fashion, I went home to phone interview a psychoanalyst, Lili Tarkow-Reinisch, who said that she described all familial love as a kind of Stockholm syndrome you are kidnapped into this family by accident of birth and you have to love them, otherwise you are screwed. “What we might be asking of everyone during these times,” she said, “is to engage in some form of Stockholm syndrome with everyone they live with because really, whatever you felt, you have to put in a box for another time.”I thought of the separated couple self-isolating together. It would be a great romcom for them to fall back in love by accident. But I can more or less guarantee that is not what will happen. Tarkow-Reinisch said I had gone quiet and asked my situation. I told her my children were with their dad, and my husband, stepdaughter and dog had got stranded on the other side of the Solent, self-isolating, and I was on my own with a rabbit.As soon as the lockdown relaxed in Wuhan, there was word of a spike in orce rates, a detail so intuitively believable that it went around the world before anyone could say: “Wait, that’s just a backlog because municipal offices were closed.” The peculiar, quite endearing quality of this crisis is that we have gone back to the ground zero notion of the family – a nuclear two kids, mum and dad, plus possibly elderly parents, who live together and do what they are told – and then patiently work through all the possible outcomes. What if they fight? What if they run out of jigsaws? Very occasionally, someone will remember that some couples live separately and then issue the hasty instruction that they should move in together. Single people get a hell of a ride in this, as suggestions pour in from far and wide – “Here’s what I’d do if I couldn’t have sex for six months” – from happily married people who themselves probably haven’t had sex since the 90s. The suddenness of it all has bleached out those little textural details that previously made up what we might have called “reality”. The greatest myth of all, of course, is the elderly parent who will do what they are told."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/151fffd473f49ad1e380f3b9577c42c1a63e8d50/0_180_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7bf4f753c9924f4bb8417ee99d4ec239","title":"coronavirus parliament media newspapers coronavirus","story":"With parliament in recess, the press has a vital role in holding the government to accountWhere was the compassion? The overwhelming mainstream media response to the announcement that Boris Johnson had tested positive for Covid-19 was anything but sympathetic. It was summed up by a Daily Mail headline which pointedly asked whether Johnson, his ministers and advisers had not practised the social distancing they had preached.Similarly, the  referred to accusations that the prime minister had been guilty of nonchalance by failing to heed his own advice to the public. Amid the crisis, he may not be held to account. But the Sunday Mirror, reflecting the consensus viewpoint, argued that later “he will have serious questions to face”.Altogether less serious was the Mail on Sunday’s suggestion, on the thinnest of evidence, that the EU’s Brexit negotiator, Michael Barnier, was the source of Johnson’s infection. This nonsense had a Trumpist feel to it, a pathetic attempt to take the spotlight off the prime minister it slavishly supports.Symptoms are defined by the NHS as either:NHS advice is that anyone with symptoms should\u0026nbspstay at home for at least 7 days.If you live with other people,\u0026nbspthey should stay at home for at least 14 days, to avoid spreading the infection outside the home.After 14 days, anyone you live with who does not have symptoms can return to their normal routine. But, if anyone in your home gets symptoms, they should stay at home for 7 days from the day their symptoms start.\u0026nbspEven if it means they\u0027re at home for longer than 14 days.If you live with someone who is 70 or over, has a long-term condition, is pregnant or has a weakened immune system, try to find somewhere else for them to stay for 14 days.If you have to stay at home together, try to keep away from each other as much as possible.After 7 days, if you no longer have a high temperature you can return to your normal routine.If you still have a high temperature, stay at home until your temperature returns to normal.If you still have a cough after 7 days, but your temperature is normal, you do not need to continue staying at home. A cough can last for several weeks after the infection has gone.Staying at home means you should:You can use your garden, if you have one. You can also leave the house to exercise – but stay at least 2 metres away from other people.If you have symptoms of coronavirus, use the\u0026nbspNHS 111 coronavirus service\u0026nbspto find out what to do.But, like the  titles, it was out of step with the general tone of media coverage which has passed through three phases. These rapid changes of approach echoed the swiftness of the pandemic’s grip on public imagination. Johnson’s dilemma was met initially with a measure of understanding that soon elided into a large dose media credulity.During that honeymoon period, it was largely accepted that Johnson was acting correctly by following scientific advice advocating “herd immunity.” This was challenged by other scientists, such as William Hanage, but counter arguments got little media traction. When the government performed a U-turn in mid-March the BBC tamely accepted the false No 10 line that its strategy changed because the science had changed.More than a week passed before the second phase saw natural journalistic scepticism kick in. Johnson found himself fielding pertinent questions. Did he really think “herd immunity” was either a practical or moral response? Sure, he was relying on the science, but were the scientists on which he was basing his policy right?Watching his press conferences, it was possible to sense a growing frustration among the questioning political editors. They were polite, as was he. He took care to name them – “thank you, Laura” … “yes, Beth” … “where’s Heather?” – and, after repeating his central messages about handwashing and social distancing, he passed the trickier inquiries to his scientific wingmen.As an exercise in transparency it just about held up, although it didn’t really amount to public accountability because it was impossible for the journalists to be as fierce and forensic as MPs in the Commons during prime minister’s questions. Nor were they able to ask supplementary questions. The problem of dealing with Johnsonian evasiveness became more apparent when the conferences were staged remotely.At the beginning of last week came the third phase: overt hostility. It was unsurprising to find the anti-Tory Daily Mirror in the vanguard with its accusation that Johnson and his government “were criminally slow to respond to the threat” and lamenting the “mixed messages and an absence of clarity”.But the “Boris distancing” took hold even in papers previously sympathetic to the government’s plight and even in those noted as fervent cheerleaders for Johnson. Look, for instance, at the Sun’s unexpectedly pointed criticism in a leading article which echoed the Mirror’s viewpoint.It took Johnson to task for taking far too long in enacting legislation to enforce social distancing. “The Sun,” it said, “has largely backed the Downing Street response so far … But there is a shambolic ‘on the hoof’ feel to it now.”Another whose faith was shaken, was one of Johnson’s most enthusiastic press supporters, the aforementioned title’s political columnist, Trevor Kavanagh. Looking to a future public inquiry into the handling of the crisis, he suggested a likely outcome: “It may be that Boris Johnson was too soft, too trusting, too unwilling to make hard choices.”If Kavanagh’s jibe surprised No 10, then the Times’s leader last Monday must have come as a shock. Johnson’s performance “has been chequered”. Why had he “disappeared from view” in February? Why had he failed to preside over the first Cobra meeting to discuss the pandemic? Why, even as the scale became apparent, did he not take greater measures? The Times’s conclusion was laced with sarcasm: “The country needs to know that Mr Johnson has a coherent strategy. Otherwise the prime minister who dreamt of being Churchill may find himself cast as Neville Chamberlain.”At the end of the week, the Daily Mail joined the growing chorus of disapproval by accusing the government of having been “lamentably behind the curve” and urging it to “raise its game … fast”. The Sunday Times took a similar line. Why had Britain not tested as widely and efficiently as Germany?The Observer was amazed at the lack of testing kits, as it was with the failure to procure extra stocks of ventilators and personal protective equipment.This media criticism should not be viewed as cynical or carping. Newspapers, in company with broadcast news outlets, have been doing their job. By refusing to accept the official narrative, they have disrupted the government’s agenda and, on the positive side, have played a key role in changing the direction of public policy. They held power to account and found it wanting.Now, with parliament in recess, their job becomes even more important. They must go on questioning and harrying the prime minister. They have to find a way to ensure that an executive backed by an 81-seat majority does not misuse its own version of self-isolation to pursue the wrong route in the difficult weeks ahead."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/93cadecba66833b8ad5fa69f91e3d44ce252681d/0_91_7762_4658/master/7762.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2fcad43f1d0a00d0a9784b726c0e208d","title":"im working at home can i make a comfortable chair myself","story":"My back is killing me and I need some DIY tips to find seating that worksEvery week a  Money reader submits a question, and it’s up to you to help him or her out – a selection of the best answers will appear in next Saturday’s paper.I’ve been working at home for a week now but my back is killing me.

I knew how conventional music sat on the page, but the score of Penderecki’s symphony looked like a byzantine scientific diagram had somehow got mangled in the photocopier with an Ordnance Survey map: disembodied staves, notes scattering everywhere, thick black lines sliding off the page. Once I managed to find a recording, it sounded great too – an utterly addictive playground of restless, relentlessly surprising noise.Penderecki, whose death at the age of 86 was announced today, was born in Dębica, in south-east Poland in 1933. He emerged as a force in Polish modern composition alongside such figures as Witold Lutosławski, Tadeusz Baird, Andrzej Dobrowolski and Henryk Mikołaj Górecki who, during the late 1950s, were all constructing pieces using clusters of notes jam-packed together, often requiring players to explore terrain that pushed beyond the conventions of their instrument.In 1960, the young composer wrote a piece for 52 string instruments that he called 8’37” (a nod towards John Cage’s 4’33”) in which sounds collided like swarms of bees instruments were slapped and hit, and bows were employed to make violins et al squeak and squeal rather than sing. The piece made an immediate impression and when Penderecki, struck by the emotional turmoil of the apocalyptic sounds he had unleashed, retitled it Threnody to the Victims of Hiroshima, he found himself with an unexpected hit.His First Symphony, which was completed in 1973, drew this period of sonic exploration to a close. By the time Penderecki started his Second Symphony in 1979, subtitled “Christmas”, he had re-engaged with a Romanticism that recalled Wagner, Bruckner, Mahler and Schumann, and obviously relished doing so the symphony took its title from references to Silent Night that he had woven through the texture. Traditionally perspectives on Penderecki ide sharply at this point: admirers of the Threnody and First Symphony pour scorn on the Christmas Symphony and everything that followed in its wake, while those who like the Romantic version of Penderecki thank their lucky stars that he had moved on from the avant garde.In reality, though, neither point of view really gets Penderecki right. Threnody – and similar works such as Fluorescences and De natura sonoris I – were undoubtedly impressive, but perhaps lacked the careful ear of Ligeti’s works using the orchestra as a sound mass, written during the same period. And if the project of latter-day Penderecki was about creating a sequence of symphonies, concertos and sacred works that could tap into that apparently unquenchable enthusiasm that audiences have for big Romantic statements like those made by the likes of Mahler and Shostakovich, those mass audiences never quite came.The Christmas Symphony had its longueurs, but Penderecki was a very devotional man, and the St Luke Passion he completed in 1966 suggested that his focus could be sharpened by the constraints of text – as the devotional works that followed, Canticum Canticorum Salomonis, Polish Requiem and De Profundis, proved. Penderecki’s later instrumental music could feel oddly misjudged: a 2001 Piano Concerto, written in the aftermath of the September 11 terrorist attacks, was liberally sprinkled with jaunty bass lines and comedy “wrong” notes.And yet Penderecki remained culturally important, a composer often considered a gateway into modern composition by those outside new music - his visceral, other-worldly sounds were eagerly repurposed by film-makers, and proved malleable and adaptable enough for musicians of other disciplines to work up into something new. His music was used in The Exorcist by David Lynch in Wild at Heart, Inland Empire and in his recent reboot of Twin Peaks and Penderecki was reportedly very displeased with how Stanley Kubrick had chopped up and looped sections of De natura sonoris II during the climactic scene of The Shining.In 1991 the Manic Street Preachers opened their song You Love Us with a lengthy sample from Threnody to the Victims of Hiroshima, while Aphex Twin produced remixes of the Threnody and Polymorphia in 2011, working with the composer himself. Penderecki also formed an unlikely partnership with Radiohead’s Jonny Greenwood, which resulted in a collaborative album in 2012 and a whole new audience for a composer then about to turn 80. That year, Greenwood told the  that he was attracted to Penderecki’s music because it spoke this universal truth: “Penderecki’s early music, and the whole thing of writing for orchestras, still feels very modern. If I think about music in the future, I imagine it often as not involving electricity, in some dystopian, postapocalyptic future. And that’s what I get from Penderecki: people making music by taking these instruments out of boxes and playing them. That’s a very bizarre and modern thing.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/231442240248c2f086b32789e920d8a1f61ed7c8/0_66_3600_2160/master/3600.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d699c1b8d9c6ae39e2efc078570146c8","title":"john prine coronavirus symptoms critical","story":"Musician has been hospitalized since Thursday and has been placed on a ventilatorThe family of John Prine says the singer-songwriter is critically ill and has been placed on a ventilator while being treated for Covid-19-type symptoms.A message posted on Prine’s Twitter page Sunday said the Angel from Montgomery singer has been hospitalized since Thursday and his condition worsened on Saturday.“This is hard news for us to share,” Prine’s family said. “But so many of you have loved and supported John over the years, we wanted to let you know, and give you the chance to send on more of that love and support now.

Here they discuss the fine art of music writingRachel Cooke on criticism in 2020: “What is the point if not to tell the truth?”Went to the NME awards at Brixton AcademyWell, I had my experience of being you, Kitty. It was quite hard. The odd thing was that, once friends knew I was going to the NME awards, after expressing general shock and envy – everyone has heard of New Musical Express it’s been going since 1952 – they all asked only one question: what will you wear? This old chestnut recurs every time newcomers go to classical concerts or opera: do I have to dress up? What’s the code? No one wants to feel silly, an outsider.I invited a knowledgable friend who has been a Mercury prize judge to go with me, thinking she would have all the answers. “What do I wear?” came the email back.I dressed as usual. The only addition was my “rock” T-shirt – black, emblazoned with Beethoven’s face and the message “Ludwig Lives”. It’s his anniversary year, after all. It felt like a talisman… in fact, as it was so cold inside the Brixton Academy, I kept my coat on for all five hours and no one knew about my subversive garb. Can I just say: at classical concerts no one gives a damn what you wear.Went to Mahler’s Symphony No 2, Royal Festival HallI did wonder about attire. I think nowadays it’s less about the music on offer than the habitual clientele of the venue hosting the concert. The Festival Hall is quite a modern and democratic space, so dressing down is no scandal, whereas somewhere like the Royal Opera House might have most people rummaging through their drawers searching in vain for some ancestral pearls. One of the first things I learned as an NME freelancer was how to juggle my coat, a notepad, a pen and a full pint of beer while remaining standing up in a heaving throng. Tangentially, there’s a US anthropologist called Wendy Fonarow who wrote a book about behaviour at indie gigs. Where you stick your Access All Areas pass says something about you, if I recall correctly. So, were you upstairs? Did you get a view of the moshpit? What did you make of all that, I wonder?KE: Ah, antics. Obnoxiousness is baked into the myth of rock’n’roll – and we’re using “rock’n’roll” as a shorthand here, and including the punkgrime hybrid of Slowthai. Pop critics – me included – routinely tie ourselves in knots, alternately calling out and defending bad behaviour, or uncouth lyrics, or what have you, because “rebelliousness” is both the fuel on which much pop music runs, but just as often a proxy for actual unsavouriness. Is an irritant speaking truth to power? Or are they just a misogynistic pillock?The performing arts, as we well know now, actively enables all sorts of outré behaviour. In this case, it sounds like Slowthai behaved like a berk over and above what the Beastie Boys might have called his “License To Ill”. I imagine the classical world must have its fair share of bullying and sexism, all papered over by discussions of “genius”. FM: How long have you got?KE: Ha! Well, on to my gig. My initial thoughts about the Philharmonia doing Mahler’s second symphony? There was an entire city on stage. 245 people in total. And two harps! It was fascinating enough solely from the point of view of economics – how on earth does the money work? Like a bumblebee seems too big for its wings, this sort of orchestral piece should be too big to stage. The vastness of the endeavour, so many parts pulling together, conducted by Jakub Hrůša, a conductor straight out of central casting, was truly impressive. I loved that there were “surprise” brass instruments playing from the circle. The massed voices of the choir had a humbling dynamic range.I had boned up on Mahler, and could apply some basic biographical understanding as to why he was moved to write about death and rebirth. He had lost so many loved ones. Then there was the intriguing fact of his Jewish heritage, and a Catholic conversion that, it seems, was the cost of doing business in 19th-century Europe. So I was wondering about the religiosity of the piece, which actually felt almost modern, in that it seemed to be about the human spirit rather than just your basic fealty to God.FM: Only two harps? Never enough. You should try some Wagner. In the Ring he uses six.I’m interested in how you found the whole business of sitting still in such a concentrated fashion? Mahler’s Second is about as big as it gets: an hour and a half long, in five movements, without a break (except enough for a wriggle between movements). It’s epic in reach, as you say. How do you write in depth about something on that scale where all that counts is the sound – the hardest thing to find words for? I’m still working that one out.Most pop and rock tracks last a few minutes. Singing along, at least in the case of the NME gig’s star act the 1975 (winners of best British band, and my new passion) is actively encouraged. You’d be escorted out in a symphony concert. Both have their place. I loved the atmosphere, but it’s no more or less real than the intense silence of an audience listening to Mahler.KE: Glad you liked the 1975, they are very clever boys. Sitting still for hours is not a problem. Being immersed and focused on the music at hand is a huge plus whether at classical or other sit-down gigs, or concerts where phones are locked away in Faraday pouches clubbing, too, can be intense communion. I particularly loved how quiet a massive orchestra and a sold-out audience could be. You and I went to very different things, over and above the differences in our genres: one epic classical thing, one awards ceremony where the turnover and synapse-burn was even higher than usual.FM: Yes, what I particularly noticed at my gig was that it’s the act, rather than the performance, that matters. Yungblud, who won the best video award, stomped around during his track, all high energy and aggro in mini yellow tartan kilt. It was fantastically noisy, everyone had a great time, just because he was there. I couldn’t judge how well he was singing, but that wasn’t the point. Maybe not surprisingly, I found FKA twigs easier – she had an amplified piano and cello playing behind her for the track Cellophane and the colours and breaks in her voice are immediately audible, part of the music. Her whole act looked as fabulous as opera.KE: As for describing the music, which is, as you say, the very hardest thing, I think you want to identify aspects of the music that your reader will find pertinent, rather than go on and on floridly about what old NME writers might call “cathedrals of sound”. Similarly to you with the pop acts, I struggled with knowing whether the French horns were having a bad night or whether the oboe was on point. I particularly enjoyed the mezzo soprano, but I just personally like that bit of the sung spectrum. I think in both our fields, we rely on context, whether biographical, or historical, or some stated artistic aim, to frame the discussion of raw sound.FM: Regarding the horn and oboe in the Mahler, you go to the heart of the matter. We could drown in the swirling waters of “historically informed performance” (engagingly referred to as Hip). What sound did Mahler, on his mountain in upper Austria but working with musicians in Hamburg and Prague, want when he wrote it at the end of the 19th century?

I hope so. Experiencing Mahler’s Second brought up a welter of thoughts about why we like what we like. Why do people hate jazz? I think it’s because they don’t hear the fracturedness, the urge towards freedom that strains against tidy metre, the boldness otherwise denied to African Americans in the 1920s. They just hear some busker be-bopping out of context in a shopping mall, and want to wrap that saxophone around the nearest lamppost. I have been that person, but grew up some time ago. There’s an American popular song from the 1960s called Do You Hear What I Hear? – it’s indirectly about the baby Jesus, but the central thought holds. A good critic will wear their learning lightly, but build a bridge of words from raw sound to a reader’s brain.FM: Wearing learning lightly – ah, that’s a minefield. And technical language – the stuff of sports reports – is another discussion. Do I write “it modulated into a remote key” or “it sounded strange and moody”? Anyway, back to my night in Brixton. It was a great ear-opener, an instant immersion into what’s current. I’m practising saying “Surely that’s Beabadoobee.” I’m keen to persuade you to come to Mahler’s other eight-and-a-half symphonies, but I can’t promise I’ll be first in line for Slowthai. The 1975?

Named after the Alabama creek that runs behind her childhood home, Katie Crutchfield, AKA Waxahatchee, ditched alcohol for good before making her fifth album, Saint Cloud, which sees her sound leap from reverb-laden indie rock to glossy, radio-friendly country. But even though her work has become progressively hi-fi since her scratchy, Cat Power-like 2012 debut American Weekend, there’s a sharpness in these songs that still unsettles.It’s there in Crutchfield’s vocals, louder and fiercer than before, and on songs such as Fire, which is also difficult to love. Her lyrics, tackling subjects including addiction and self-hatred, often feel too verbose, but they become surprising and refreshing on closer listen. Can’t Do Much is an intense, jittery love song with a great opening couplet: “We will coalesce our heaven and hell  My eyes roll around like dice on the felt.” Lilacs despairs of a girl who has harmful inner monologues (“I run it like a silent movie  I run it like a violent song”).

A decision will be made by the highest level of Iran’s multi-layered government. There is no guarantee that clemency will be granted, or that she will be allowed to return to the UK.Zaghari-Ratcliffe, seen by some as a bargaining chip in the wider diplomatic dispute between the UK and Iran, was given a temporary fortnight’s release from Evin prison, Tehran, on 17 March along with 85,000 other prisoners at risk from the coronavirus outbreak. She has been allowed to stay at her parents’ house in Tehran but made to wear an ankle brace that keeps her within 300 metres of her parents’ home.All prisoners sentenced for five years or less were given temporary release, permitting half of all Iran’s political prisoners to be freed.The supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, announced early last week that what had initially been seen as a fortnight’s release for furloughed prisoners had been extended to early April since there was no sign that the coronavirus pandemic was easing. Zaghari-Ratcliffe’s inclusion in that extension was only confirmed to the family by the prison on Saturday.Arrested in April 2016, she was sentenced in September to five years in jail. Her sentence is due to come to an end within 10 months unless new charges are levelled against her - something the Islamic revolutionary guards corps has threatened in the past.The potential offer of clemency, relayed to Nazanin’s father by the prison authorities at the weekend, will be recommended to the Iranian prosecutor general’s office. Her husband, Richard Ratcliffe, described the move as “potentially a baby step towards freedom”. “I spoke to her yesterday and her mood was pretty upbeat,” he said.Ratcliffe told the : “The deputy prosecutor can either approve clemency or refer the file back to the supreme leader’s office with a recommendation that she not be granted clemency, or it could just sit on his desk for a bit.“The supreme leader can refuse a recommendation not to grant clemency, or can follow it and specify that Nazanin not be granted. But the default in the process following the supreme leader’s proclamation last week is that the law requires eligible people to be granted clemency.“So it is a good that her file has been put forward – an acknowledgement by the judiciary that she is formally eligible, and she is being treated so far like everyone else.”He and his wife, 41, have suffered painful false dawns before, partly because the Iranian political system has many different centres of decision-making.British officials believe any decision to grant her clemency will be taken at the highest level, including an assessment of the wider political benefits to Iran in winning support for the lifting of sanctions. Zaghari-Ratcliffe has deliberately made no political statement since her release from jail, but the pressure to release other prisoners is intense, with reports of unrest in prisons continuing this weekend.The Iranian foreign ministry has been mounting an increasingly effective international campaign, including with American Democrats, to turn up the diplomatic heat on the US for its refusal to suspend economic sanctions to help Iran purchase medical equipment needed to help fight the pandemic. Britain has been privately urging Mike Pompeo, the US secretary of state, to see if the US can remove any blocks to a new Swiss channel, the Swiss humanitarian trade arrangement, that is supposed to ease the flow of humanitarian supplies to Iran.International bankers say they still do not have sufficient reassurance from the US Treasury that they will not be sanctioned if they finance the trade. At the same time, Iran has been seeking help in securing a $5bn (£4bn) IMF loan, something the US could block. A reformist MP from Tehran, Alireza Rahimi, tweeted on Sunday that the IMF was going to release “a substantial portion” of the loan.The Iranian foreign minister, Javad Zarif, said: “The US government had moved from sabotage to assassinations to waging an economic war and economic terrorism on Iranians and now to medical terrorism. This even exceeds what is permissible on the battlefield.”However, hardliners are determined to send out a message that the government can ride out the crisis alone, and seem mainly eager to take aim at the failure of Europe and the US to bring the pandemic under control.Pressure has also been mounting on the sometimes incoherent Iranian leadership over its handling of the pandemic. The Iranian health ministry on Sunday announced a further 2,901 new coronavirus cases in the previous 24 hours, taking the total number of cases to 38,309. The 24-hour total of new infections has ballooned in the past five days from below 900 new infections in a week.The official total death toll is only 2,640, and the daily recorded deaths are broadly static, something that is hard to reconcile with the higher level of infections. The death toll is a quarter of Spain’s, and may be due to Iran’s decision to classify some deaths as caused by respiratory difficulties rather than coronavirus.Following weeks of pressure to take tougher steps, Iran’s president, Hassan Rouhani, finally introduced physical distancing and city quarantines. An emergency 2,000-bed hospital has been built in Tehran, reflecting the pressure in the capital. A total of 3,467 patients are described as “in severe condition”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/99cfe3c4e67c6dd3c2ca5319f95abe618c76f408/0_98_3000_1799/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=304c3c1bd0c0ec5c692b3e001867909e","title":"what can we learn from chinas handling of coronavirus podcast","story":"After weeks of lockdown China is starting to lift restrictions in an attempt to return the country to normal. ’s Beijing bureau chief, Lily Kuo, discusses how China coped with coronavirus and what life is like there nowAccording to official statistics, China has defeated the coronavirus.

It also concluded that another charge of intent to rape was “not proven”, a Scottish legal formulation which stops short of a not guilty verdict but finds the accused innocent in the eyes of the law.During and since the trial, the nine women who alleged assaults by the former Scottish National party leader have faced an onslaught of abuse online and on Sunday morning released a joint statement in which they described their “devastation” at the verdict. It is understood that they have been issued with personal alarms and have been offered home security checks by police.Gordon Jackson QC was condemned for his “horrifying and completely unacceptable” comments after the Sunday Times reported he had been overheard making the remarks on board an Edinburgh to Glasgow train during the first week of the trial and that his conversation had been filmed by a passenger.Jackson, who is dean of the Faculty of Advocates, appears to name two of the women who alleged sexual assaults by Salmond, in contravention of rules that protect the anonymity of complainers – as they are known in Scotland – in such cases.Sandy Brindley, the chief executive of Rape Crisis Scotland, called for an investigation, saying: “Protecting the anonymity of all people who report sexual crimes is of critical importance and is one of few reassurances that can be offered as part of an otherwise daunting and intimidating process.“For this to be undermined by such a senior lawyer in a public place in such a high-profile trial is horrifying and completely unacceptable. Jackson is dean of the Faculty of Advocates and we cannot see how this behaviour – caught on film – is in keeping with the Faculty of Advocates’ own guidance on conduct. There should be an immediate investigation.”Referring to one complainer, he says: “We thought that eventually people might think she’s a flake and not like her,” and goes on to discusses his defence tactics with another woman, saying: “All I need to do is put a smell on her.”Brindley said: “One of the most chilling aspects of this is Jackson’s statement about his strategy for the cross-examination of one of the women in the trial: ‘All I need to do is put a smell on her.’ This statement alone confirms the fears of many who do not report for fear of what would be done to them in court. We need an urgent overhaul of how these cases are dealt with.”In a statement released on Twitter, Jackson said: “I have decided that the proper course of action is to self-refer this matter to the Scottish Legal Complaints Commission, and that has been done. It will be for the Commission to consider this matter.“I also deeply regret the distress and difficulties which have been caused, but given the reference to the SLCC it would not be appropriate to comment further.”A spokesperson for Salmond: “Mr Salmond … made a statement on the steps of the high court and said that he would make no further public comment on these matters until after the coronavirus crisis was over.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d5b99f8817c02f6867d12885dd7bee4ab43e39d4/1438_0_4673_2803/master/4673.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=611a35b1a8e543741b3126879ffe9f21","title":"michael gove appears to blame china over lack of uk coronavirus testing","story":"Minister says China was ‘not clear about the scale, the nature, the infectiousness’ of virusMichael Gove has appeared to lay the blame for the UK’s lack of mass testing on China, raising the prospect of increased diplomatic tension between the two countries.Some of China’s reports on the virus were unclear about the “scale, nature and infectiousness” of the disease, the cabinet minister told the BBC.Asked on BBC One’s Andrew Marr show why Britain did not have sufficient testing, despite the first case in China being known about in December, Gove said: “We’ve been increasing the number of tests over the course of the last month.The Mail on Sunday reported that senior Downing Street officials and ministers expect a “reckoning” with China over misinformation in relation to the outbreak. It also claimed there was anger over perceived attempts by China to exploit the crisis for economic gain.Gove announced that the UK had reached its initial target of testing 10,000 people a day for coronavirus. The aim is to raise the rate to 25,000 a day, but he did not give a timeline.Asked why there was still no fixed date for the rollout of mass testing , he said only that the government was setting the NHS Nightingale field hospital to free up the capacity of the equivalent of 50 hospitals.It was put to Gove that Germany was carrying out half a million tests a week while NHS workers in the UK still did not know when they would get a test.He said: “It’s certainly the case that the Germans have had success in testing. The acceleration here in the UK is significant. If one looks at, and this is not the way to look at it, but if one looks at a league table then the UK is rising up it.“We’ve managed to test significantly more of our citizens as a percentage than some other countries but frankly the most important thing is not to look backwards but to look forwards and to do everything that we can to increase the number of tests.”The UK lockdown was expected to continue for a “significant period”, Gove suggested in another interview, and he said he was unable to give a fixed date on when it would end. The expected date of the peak of the disease was also unknown, he said.Speaking to the Sophy Ridge on Sunday show on Sky News, he said: “As a result of the social distancing measures the government has implemented, we hope we can reduce the rate of infection, but at this stage we just need to make sure everyone observes those rules.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bcffd997e326005bcbaa5fa991944351dea46143/0_41_3607_2165/master/3607.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c95ef59be465007028f23b1dba33c0a0","title":"talking horses richard hannon counts blessings and plots way back for racing","story":"The former champion trainer hopes racing can resume with a condensed schedule but knows he is luckier than manyThis would normally be the start of a very busy few months for Richard Hannon, whose two big stables near Salisbury Plain are home to lots of fast, precocious young horses. The months of April, May and June are hay-making time for trainers with that kind of stock, so the suspension of racing until at least the end of next month makes things very difficult for his operation.“It’s hugely worrying,” says Hannon, who was champion trainer in his first season, 2014, with a licence. “These two-year-olds, you only have a certain window of opportunity. And then you’ve got the Classic generation.” But he notes the timing could have been even worse, if the coronavirus had sent Britain into lockdown in the autumn, after Hannon had spent hefty sums buying horses at the sales and before he had sold them on to various owners.“We’re lucky this didn’t come along in October, November, when I would have had about 50 yearlings around my neck. We sold them all but we need to get back racing, if we can.”Hannon has an idea of how it could be managed, if and when the sport is allowed to resume racing behind closed doors. He suggests a lot of action compressed into each day, rotating between the all-weather courses from one day to the next.“You could have 20 races a day, 15 minutes between each race. Jockeys could only ride in every other race. From 9am to 5pm and we can get through the backlog, maybe. The prize money’s there, it’s been allocated. They can keep the jockeys apart by giving them the grandstand. There could be five metres between them, other than when they’re in the stalls. And you wouldn’t need five different tracks each day, using five different ambulances.“It’s just an idea, I don’t know if it would work. The Flat trainers, we’ve got our horses ready now and with this nice weather, they come right in their coats they look great. I’m training mine as if we start early next month.”Hannon, his family and staff have remained healthy but he is acutely aware that others have been less fortunate. “The NHS staff are doing a fabulous job in really difficult circumstances. We all owe them a great debt of gratitude.”He plans to show that by donating £25 to the NHS for each winner he trains this year, which ought to yield a sum running into several thousand pounds.In the meantime there is hope, which has always been central to racing’s appeal and which Hannon believes can be a source of comfort to his owners.“I’m sure a lot of them will have had investments in the stock market and other things that obviously won’t have gone well. But the great thing about a lot of our horses is that you don’t know what they are, what they could be. People who own unraced two-year-olds have always got hope for the future. You could own that good one. That’s why two-year-olds are so exciting and why there’s always a market for them.”Aside from the horses, Hannon has his family to help keep his own spirits up. “I’ve got two young kids and the weather’s nice, so you can go outside and spend a bit of time with them. It’s OK now but I should imagine after a few weeks there’s going to be some awful cabin fever.“We’re very lucky, we live in a lovely place in the country and we have some space, we work with lovely animals. It makes us a lot better off than most people at this time. We don’t have anything to moan about, that way. There’s a lot of people living in cities who have it a lot harder than we do.”While he was at school, Hannon had no thought other than one day taking over his father’s racing stable will he now be getting involved in the home-schooling of his children? “I don’t think they’d pass many exams if I was home-schooling them,” he says, laughing. “But we have a bit of a laugh with them and they’re reading plenty of books.“They’re not allowed to see Granny and Grandad, even though they live 100 yards down the road and always have a drawer full of sweets. At the moment, the sweets are being passed through letterboxes and through the window sometimes.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ebe6c71247300cf4ae1d509c0d0799fe4583738e/191_0_2067_1240/master/2067.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0985e9ed0d9f4070b1db83181f6ce543","title":"learning apps for stir crazy kids while schools are closed","story":"These fun-filled educational apps provide perfect brain food for children while schools are closedThe closure of schools across the UK has left many parents and carers in the sudden, unexpected position of being home-school teachers. Schools are providing support where they can, but there are also still plenty of smartphone and tablet apps that can be used as part of learning.It may be tricky to get some children to see these devices as good for more than TikTok, Fortnite and (adult) YouTube, but the positive side is that the best learning apps are interesting enough to – perhaps with an initial nudge – engage children. Here are 20 apps that may get parents off to a good start. The “younger children” apps are most suitable for preschool and early primary kids, while the “older children” apps are more for later primary and early secondary age.(AndroidApple – free)After a rocky start when some non-child-friendly videos made it through the filters, YouTube has worked hard to make its official children’s app something parents can trust. It includes a dedicated learning category collecting great videos about science, nature, space and other topics.(Apple – £3.99)It’s been out for a few years, but this is still one of the best maths apps for children that feels genuinely educational. It’s built around a range of maths exercises and progress tests. Separate versions cover children up to the age of 11, and there’s a spelling series, too.(AndroidApple – £3.99) “Big A, little a. What begins with A?” Well, augmented reality does, for a start. Dr Seuss’s inimitable alphabet book has been turned into an AR app, with animated characters appearing in the room around your child. The learning aspects include tracing the letters to learn their shapes for (non-AR) writing.(AndroidApple – free) Field trips and museum visits may be out of bounds for a while, but Google’s Arts \u0026amp Culture app at least has virtual tours of more than 1,200 museums and galleries. Children can look and read as well as curate their own lists of favourite artworks to share.(AndroidApple – subscription) There are a number of great learn-to-code apps out there for children, but Mimo is one in particular that feels most connected to the world of professional programming. At a cost of £8.49 a month, it offers quick but interesting exercises in languages including Python, Java and Swift.(AndroidApple – subscription) Elevate is one of a clutch of quality brain-training apps (see also: Peak or Lumosity) full of mini-games designed to sharpen your memory, maths skills, focus and other mental skills. Like those other apps, it uses a subscription – £38.99 a year – but with a week’s trial to test it out.(AndroidApple – subscription) If music lessons have gone out of the window, Simply Piano is one of the best app alternatives. It helps children (or adults!) to learn songs and then listens to their playing on any real piano or keyboard to give feedback. Two courses are free, but then it costs £83.99 a year – pricey for an app, but not so much for piano lessons.(AndroidApple – £2.99) This is a history app focused on a range of famous women who “helped us to understand our world better, and to make it a better place to live in”. Rosa Parks, Marie Curie, Malala Yousafzai and Amelia Earhart are among the women profiled through animation and storytelling.(AndroidApple – free + in-app purchases) Duolingo isn’t just a fun and popular way to learn languages that children already study at school. It covers more than 30, including Arabic, Hindi, Hebrew and Welsh. It’s well designed, rewarding short daily sessions of practice. It’s free, but in-app purchases remove ads and unlock some extra features.(AndroidApple – freesubscription) Kahoot! isn’t just an app, it’s also a website: a big collection of trivia quizzes created by other users. It’s going to really come into its own as schools close. It’s also a good group-learning experience: one person hosts a game and the others compete on their own devices.(Apple – free) Swift is Apple’s own programming language, and Swift Playgrounds is its app for teaching people how to use it. It’s for adults as well as children, but it’s certainly accessible for the latter, with its lessons presented as coding puzzles that will give people the skills needed to start making their own apps and games.

We’ve taken five of the most common EV questions to the experts to help you make an informed decision ...Are electric cars cheaper and easier to maintain than internal combustion engine (ICE) cars?In short, yes. An electric motor is much more simple than an ICE, with fewer moving parts. As a result, the battery pack and motor need less maintenance than the equivalent parts in an ICE vehicle.“There’s no oil or oil filter to change, no engine to maintain and fewer parts to wear out, so an EV will be cheaper to service,” explains Emily Rice, product manager at Renault Electric Vehicles. “Some drivers also find they drive more economically as the instrument panel indicates how you are driving and shows you, in real time, the energy being consumed by the battery. This can mean drivers are lighter on the accelerator and brakes, therefore extending the life of brakes and tyres too.”Renault has also adopted an energy recovery braking system: every time the vehicle slows down, part of its kinetic energy is converted into electricity. The battery is recharged when the driver lifts the foot off the accelerator or slightly engages the brake. This helps preserve or even increase your driving range, and of course save you electricity charges.How far can electric cars go?This varies from electric car to electric car, but almost all will do more than 100 miles on a full charge, with most newer models going past 200 miles.Even EVs with smaller battery capacities can be charged quickly, though. Using a rapid charger, just 20-30 minutes of charging will give more than enough juice to complete most everyday journeys.Do electric cars pay road tax?Yes and no … depending on the age and price.All EVs registered prior to April 2017 pay zero vehicle excise duty (VED, often called “road tax”), as it’s all based on tailpipe emissions – and as EVs generate 0 gkm of CO2, they’re exempt.However, the rules around VED changed in April 2017, and a premium tax was introduced. Now, any car over £40,000 when new has to pay an annual supplement (£310-320 a year depending on the model year of the vehicle) for the first five years, regardless of its emissions.Fortunately, it’s possible to bag a brand new EV for far less than the £40,000 threshold. For instance, New Renault ZOEs start at £25,670 – no VED is just one of the reasons it’s the ideal first electric car.Are electric cars automatic?Not exactly. Like automatic cars, electric cars don’t have a clutch or gear stick, but that’s where the comparison stops. Unlike automatic cars, electric cars don’t have a gearbox at all, which results in a smoother ride and nippy acceleration.Confused? Rice explains: “ICE cars need gears as they can only generate powertorque in a narrow band of engine speeds and the gears help keep the engine within those bands. In an electric car, maximum torque is available instantly and at low speeds so there is no need to have multiple gears.”Can I charge my electric car at home?Not only can you charge your electric car at home, it’s the preferred option for most EV owners.When it comes to charging at home, you have two options. By far the most efficient is using a dedicated home-charging point – something Renault provides for free with every retail purchase** of the New Renault ZOE. These are wall-mounted, weather-proof units that you connect to your car to using a dedicated charging cable. It’s best to charge your car at night – when electricity rates are often cheaper – and then top up in smaller bursts throughout the day, if needed.The second home-charging option is to charge your car using a normal three-pin socket. This is a great solution if you’re away from home and need a top-up, but shouldn’t be your only, or primary, charging solution. Charging this way is much slower than using a wall-mounted unit, and gives eight miles of range an hour of charging compared with a 7kW home charger that will give around 30 miles of range an hour, according to WLTP testing*. You can also often top up for free on public networks when you are out and about – look for charging points at supermarkets and public car parks. Rapid DC charging at 50kW available on the New Renault ZOE will give an estimated 90 miles driving range in 30 minutes.Curious to learn more about EVs?

Motoring journalist Maria McCarthy explains why they’re more than just a passing trendThere’s no doubt that this acceleration is in part being driven by increased awareness and fears about the climate crisis. But while we know that EVs are greener than traditional internal combustion engine cars, making the transition from the familiarity of fossil fuel to embracing electric can feel daunting, no matter how urgently you feel the climate emergency. Will vast amounts of number-crunching and spreadsheets be required to work out if an electric car will fit your lifestyle? Might you have to draw on vague memories of what Kws are from long-ago physics lessons? Thankfully, that won’t be necessary.“People often worry that deciding to move over to an electric car will be a chore and involve a lot of research,” says Emily Rice, product manager at Renault Electric Vehicles. “But once they get started, they discover there’s lots of independent, accessible information out there, and the process can be very straightforward.”When electric cars first came on to the market, there was a lot of hand-wringing about “range anxiety” – the fear of the battery running out before you can get to a charging point. But it turns out that unless you embark on epic road trips on a regular basis, range anxiety isn’t a cause for concern. “The New Renault ZOE has a range of up to 245 miles according to WLTP testing*,” explains Rice. “And that’s plenty for most of us.”According to the Department of Transport, the average annual mileage for private cars in 2018 was 7,400 – this works out at just over 20 miles a day, so the New Renault ZOE will easily meet most people’s day-to-day needs.And when you do need to charge your battery, it’s as easy as charging your smartphone. Most electric car drivers charge at home – something made even easier by Renault, which provides a free home charge point for new retail customers purchasing a New Renault ZOE**. Once you set off with a full battery, you rarely need to top up on regular journeys. And if you do run out of juice on the go, there’s no need to panic – the UK now has more EV charging points than petrol stations (almost 10,000 locations now offer public charging points, according to Zap-Map).And best of all, the mileage costs are significantly cheaper. Costs will vary depending on your electricity tariff but, according to the Energy Saving Trust, charging an electric vehicle at home will cost on average 4-6p per mile, and 8-10p if using a public charging point. This compares with 13-16p for a petrol or diesel car.But choosing a car isn’t just about drawing up budgets – it’s about how it feels. And if you’ve never driven an electric car before then it’s time to get behind the wheel. “I find electric cars provide a versatile, relaxing drive,” says Thomas Clifton, electrification and new mobility manager at Renault. “As there’s no gear changes, they’re ideal for navigating city traffic. Then out of town, they handle just as well as a petrol or diesel car on motorways and rural roads. Forget the myth that electric cars are like driving a milk float – they give a smooth, powerful drive with great acceleration.”“If you’re curious about electric cars, then do take one for a test drive,” suggests Rice. “And don’t just try it out in town – take the New Renault ZOE out on a motorway or dual carriageway and let it show you what it can do. I would recommend asking to borrow it over night if you can and see how easily it could fit into your lifestyle.”It’s easy to put off making the switch to electric car ownership until some vague, undefined point in the future – but the truth is, there’s really no need to. If you have any reservations about the costs, charging options or drive, a little research and a test drive will quickly allay your fears. Once motorists take the plunge, they quickly become “electrical evangelists” with zero interest revisiting the dark days of internal combustion engine ownership. The only question is: when will you join them and start reaping the benefits of greener motoring?Curious to learn more about EVs?

Forecasts suggest a medium-term crossover point, probably towards the end of this decade, where the car industry is making more EVs than internal combustion engine (ICE) cars. Against that, there still exists a great deal of scepticism in the minds of consumers.“An EV wouldn’t work for me because …” is a familiar conversation starter. It’s true, there are some people for whom an electric car is simply a non-starter – but that number is a vanishingly small percentage of the population. For most, an EV is going to be a money saver that makes no obvious impact on lifestyle.Emily Rice, Renault UK’s product manager for electric cars, answers three readers’ questions.I live in a terraced house and park in the street, so I’m unable to have a home charging point. What are my charging options? Elaine Hills, BrightonAlthough it’s true that many current EV owners like to charge their cars at home using a dedicated wall-mounted charger in their driveway or garage, the good news is it’s far from the only option.The charging infrastructure to support EVs is constantly growing and evolving. For instance, it was reported in May last year that 1,076 new residential EV charging points had been installed in London as part of the Go Ultra Low City Scheme (GULCS), and this figure continues to increase. Virgin Media recently began a pilot project to convert its broadband cabinets into charging points, with a view to eventually providing 40,000 EV charging points across the UK. Elsewhere, there are initiatives such as the MK Promise, through which Milton Keynes council offers to install, within a short walk, an overnight charging point for all new EV owners lacking access to private parking.Access to a public residential charger is, however, still rare, and the much more common practice is to charge at the other end of a regular journey. “If you’d like to buy an EV, but don’t have the ability to charge it at home, check whether your workplace has charging facilities,” says Rice. “It’s common to simply not notice charging infrastructure if you don’t own an EV – but once you start thinking about switching, you really start to notice how many charging points are around you.”It’s worth noting that the notional “full charge” is an ICE hangover, driving until the warning light comes on and then filling the tank. Getting a full charge in Sainsbury’s or Starbucks may take a few hours – but with EVs such as the New Renault ZOE having a driving range of 245 miles*, it is unlikely you will need to find somewhere to charge every day, so owners aren’t arriving with the (usually metaphorical) needle in the red.If you charge an EV and then don’t use it, have you wasted your electricity? Jonathan Bailey, SheffieldThe short answer is: no. Or rather, not really. “The thing people tend to ask about is leaving their car when they go on holiday,” says Rice. “If you leave your car at the airport for a couple of weeks, you’re not going to notice a discharge. There’s lots of inbuilt technology in a Renault ZOE designed to ensure the batteries are as efficient as possible. Even if you leave your EV sitting around for a few months, it’s not going to be an issue for the traction battery.”The concern allied to this is the idea that battery performance will be less impressive as the vehicle gets older. While battery capacity can drop as the vehicle gets older – it won’t be to the extent it did a decade ago when the technology was in its infancy.“I think a lot of people worry that the battery in an EV is like the one in their phone, and they’re going to see the performance decline after a couple of years – but it really isn’t like that,” says Rice. “We all know that a phone reaches a point where you’re having to charge it a couple of times a day – but the technology in the lithium-ion battery of the car is far superior to that. If you’re driving it in the same way as a petrol or diesel car, you’re not going to experience any problems with an EV. We know it’s an area of concern, though, which is why Renault gives its EV batteries an eight-year or 100,000-mile warranty**. Hopefully that inspires confidence in the technology.”Is it more difficult to get a problem with an EV car resolved because there are fewer expert mechanics? Edward Jones, NorthamptonshireThe downside is that most of these technicians are employed by mainstream dealerships, with relatively little EV expertise in backstreet garages. EVs are, however, selling in ever-larger numbers, and mechanics are not immune to market forces. More technicians will train on EVs because, slowly but surely, that’s where the market is heading.Curious to learn more about EVs?

Then she turned her troubled Cardiff childhood into a rollercoaster ride through school crushes, sexuality – and bipolar disorder‘Growing up,” says Kayleigh Llewellyn, “my mum had bipolar disorder type one. So quite severe. The love you have for your mother or father is so deep-seated, there’s a contradiction: you love the person, but you also feel ashamed of them, because you’re a teenager and you don’t know any better.”Llewellyn has poured this experience into In My Skin, an emotional rollercoaster of a TV drama about Bethan, a Welsh teenager coming of age and living a double life as she negotiates mental illness, friendships and her sexuality. Bethan’s mother Trina has bipolar disorder and is sectioned in a psychiatric ward. In an early episode, Trina says something so horrible to Bethan that I gasped out loud in my living room. At other times, the sympathy I feel for her has me weeping. But there are plenty of laughs along the way.Bethan shoulders much of the burden of her mother’s illness alone, although her gran and a kindly but interfering PE teacher do try to help. She’s ambitious and dreams of being a writer, while trying to survive in a hostile and homophobic school. She also desperately wants to impress popular girl Poppy, on whom she has a crush, lying about her home life even to her closest friends, portraying it as secure and middle class.“I lived in fear that kids in my school would find out my mum was frequently being sectioned,” says Llewellyn. “I thought they would make fun of me, ostracise me – or even worse, make fun of my mum.”Llewellyn initially trained as an actor and didn’t start writing until she was 27. “Growing up, I didn’t know any actors, and I certainly didn’t know any writers. I didn’t know writing was a job.” It was only when she started acting and realised that the words were what really drew her that she began to write.Another script, co-written with a friend, won the Bafta Rocliffe New Writing comedy award in 2012 and helped her secure an agent. “For once in my life I got really bloody lucky,” she says. “I went from not being a writer at all to having a commission for a primetime BBC One show.”That series didn’t happen in the end: Llewellyn is keen to point out that her screenwriting journey hasn’t been an entirely easy one, even if she does now find herself in the writers’ room for Killing Eve. “About three years ago, I was so broke. I’d gone through six deaths in my family in the course of the year. And you really feel the weight of being an underclass person. I had no security blanket.“I was continuing trying to write Casualty while dealing with the most intense grief and setting up funerals. I just could not afford to live any more. I thought: ‘I can’t be a writer right now.’ Luckily someone recommended this charity – the Film and TV Charity. They kept me going. They paid my rent for a few months, gave me subsistence.”In late 2017, after another failed project, Llewellyn rattled off a one-page treatment based on her childhood experiences of caring for her mother – and emailed it to several producers. “Within about an hour, I had that feeling of regret, thinking: ‘Oh my God, I’ve exposed myself so much’.”Seven out of 10 wanted to option it. Within a week, producer Nerys Evans – who is also Welsh with a working-class background – had persuaded the BBC to commission the pilot, which won two Bafta Cymru awards including best TV drama. The show was then greenlit for a full series.In My Skin was shot in Cardiff, a few streets from where Llewellyn grew up. How does it feel to see her life played out on screen? Was it necessary to keep a bit of distance? “To a degree, I did have to,” she says, “so that I felt free to tell a good story.” She decided it would be too strange to film in her old school, and she made Bethan an only child. “Jo Hartley, who plays Trina, and I made a choice that she would never meet my mum. I didn’t even show her a photograph until after we finished shooting. We wanted to create this woman in her own right.”Hartley’s performance has been praised for its authenticity. “I gave it everything, my heart and soul,” the actor says. “It’s the only job where I’ve gone to these lengths. It was such a responsibility. It was about visualisation, breath work, and lots and lots of research, and I was able to use emotional recall from personal experiences.”Hartley watched videos of people with hypomania, and had in-depth chats with Llewellyn and others who had experience of bipolar disorder. On set, she was isolated from most of the cast and crew and didn’t wash her hair, staying in character for the duration. “We came up with a scale of one to five,” says Llewellyn. “Bipolar has stages– you’re not just hypomanic all time. So Jo could be given this number for the level of her mania. And then we had an amazing doctor based in Cardiff who specialises in bipolar patients, who read all of our scripts and gave advice.”Llewellyn’s sister also read all the scripts and gave her blessing, but her mother was very ill when they were shooting the pilot, and did not watch it until two weeks after it was first shown on BBC Three. “She was in Wales and I was in London and I was on the edge of my seat feeling sick waiting for the phone to ring. Eventually she called and said, ‘I’m so proud of you’.”Was there a temptation to dial down some of the more shocking things Trina says, to give a more sympathetic portrayal? Llewellyn says not. “I want people to have the takeaway that Trina is a kind woman and a good mother who’s very ill. I hope I struck that balance. But to give an accurate representation of what it is to care for someone who’s mentally ill, you have to show it warts and all.“We all know there is something we can each say to our mother, our sister, our partner, that would cripple them, but of course you love them, you don’t want to hurt them. When you’re with someone who is ill, they don’t have that filter. I can’t, when my mum is well, hold her to account for the things she said when she was completely unwell and that she has no memory of. You just have to absorb it. I’m sure that there are lots of people who struggle to, and I have, to a degree. But you won’t ever get an apology.”Llewellyn’s father died in 2015. They had been estranged for 10 years. In the show, Bethan also faces occasional cruelty from her dysfunctional father, an alcoholic Hell’s Angel who drives a rag and bone truck. He’s played by Rhodri Meilir.Having grown up in Wales, which has some of the poorest estates in western Europe, seeing the poverty and deprivation she knew portrayed accurately on screen was a new experience for Llewellyn. She says you either have the comedies, such as Gavin and Stacey and Stella, or dramas such as Sex Education and The End of the F***ing World, which are shot in Wales but look like America.“No disrespect to those shows, but Nerys and I talked a lot about wanting to recreate accurately the Wales we knew. You can be on a really grotty disgusting street that has old mattresses thrown out and litter everywhere, but the vista around you is the most beautiful green hills. The two live side by side. And the things that Gavin and Stacey and Stella captured, those warm, broad characters, that to me is real. We wanted that, but also the grittier side – people struggling on the breadline and struggling to find good mental health care.”In My Skin has plenty of comic relief, particularly from Bethan’s gran. “I love the phrase ‘Make ’em laugh, make ’em cry’,” says Llewellyn. “Mostly because I think that is life. And it comes naturally to me. Like lots of people who’ve been marginalised or have something to hide, you deflect with comedy. I’ve done that my whole life.”She’s influenced by Jill Soloway, whose show Transparent perfected that mixture of belly laughs and gut punches. She thinks ersity in the TV industry is slowly improving and that, as a working-class lesbian Welsh woman, it’s a good time to be “a box tick” because broadcasters are now interested in erse stories. “People are talking so much more about mental health issues, which is such a big part of the battle – that people feel able to discuss it and not hide in the shadows. But there is a long way to go.”She adds: “My mum, to this day, having been a mental health patient for over 30 years, has still never been offered talking therapy. It’s just extreme medication. I love the NHS. It’s kept my mum alive. But they’re spread so thin, they can’t offer something that would be so useful.”As for the show, she says: “I hope that anyone who has either mental health issues or has been a carer for a mentally ill person just feels seen. That they watch it and say ‘Someone gets me’ – and feel a hand on their shoulder.”• In My Skin will be available on BBC Three and iPlayer on 29 March. The seriesl starts on BBC One and BBC One Wales on 1 April at 10.45pm."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c8fdcbcb93bc9be48af77fefa45fa075750de94e/0_271_5082_3049/master/5082.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=51504150b10c5b68070ed6b09f67e99d","title":"america states coronavirus red blue different approaches","story":"Democratic states have tended to be more proactive while some Republican governors followed Trump in downplaying the crisisIt was a tale of two beaches. On Florida’s Atlantic coast, at the height of spring break season, the sand was deserted in the cities of Miami Beach and Fort Lauderdale, where Democratic mayors had imposed closures to fight the spread of coronavirus.Across the narrow neck of the state, the Gulf coast beaches in Clearwater were a world apart. There the Republican mayor had declined to impose a closure, and photos that would circle the world captured the result: thousands of carefree sunbathers lining the sand and mingling in the water.The public health risk from such large gatherings was not a secret. A day earlier the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) had advised against gatherings of more than 50 people, and New York’s governor, Andrew Cuomo, a Democrat, warned the coronavirus “has already spread much more than you know”.But at the time Florida’s governor, Ron DeSantis, like most of his 25 Republican peers across the country, did not see cause for alarm, and he has still not closed non-essential businesses statewide, despite warnings by medical professionals that coronavirus cases there could “explode”.Hundreds of US counties and all 50 states now have confirmed coronavirus cases – despite a widespread lack of testing – underscoring the indifference of the virus to the familiar political boundaries separating red states, dominated by Republicans, and blue ones, dominated by Democrats.But while the virus does not select for party affiliation, contrasting emergency responses at the state and local levels have split dramatically along partisan lines.States with Democratic governors have been quicker to declare emergencies, close schools, shutter non-essential businesses and impose limits on bars and restaurants, according to data collected by the Kaiser Foundation. Fifteen of 21 states to have issued stay-at-home orders have Democratic governors.States with Republican governors, meanwhile, have been less eager to ask businesses to close, and more likely to downplay the threat. “Go to the grocery stores. For crying out loud, go to the grocery stores,” Governor Jim Justice of West Virginia told residents on 16 March. “If you want to go to Bob Evans and eat, go to Bob Evans and eat.”The night before, Oklahoma’s Governor Kevin Stitt tweeted a picture of himself and his two sons at a restaurant, boasting: “It’s packed tonight.” The tweet was later deleted.The ergence in state responses to coronavirus does not cleanly split along the red-blue line, with Republican governors in states such as Ohio and Maryland among the most proactive in responding to the threat, said University of Southern California professor Manuel Pastor.“It’s more like the rational states versus the Trump Republican states,” Pastor said.All partisan disagreements in the United States in 2020 seem to emanate from or end with Donald Trump. But the president has encouraged a partisan ide on the coronavirus threat, analysts said, pitting state governors against each other and setting off bidding wars for medical equipment.While states and localities have primary responsibilities for public health under the American system of federalism, the president has an important role in focusing the national attention on the emergency and channeling the massive resources of the federal government to the states most in need, said Lawrence O Gostin, a professor of public health at the Johns Hopkins University.“This is something that’s really unprecedented and clearly American federalism is not well equipped to do it. You need every oar to work together. We have fragmentation, name-calling and wildly different responses,” Gostin said.Because past disasters were locally confined, states were able to help each other, by sending firefighters to combat wildfires in California, by sending first responders to help in New York after September 11, or by accepting refugees from Hurricane Katrina.“This is almost like we have a hurricane,” Maryland’s governor, Larry Hogan, a Republican who has moved aggressively on coronavirus, said on the radio show of the former New Jersey governor on Thursday. “But it’s hitting every single state in the country at the same time, and it’s been hitting them for 21 days, at least in our state.”Citizens judge the viral threat according to their politics, polling indicates. More Democrats than Republicans have told pollsters they were “extremely concerned” about coronavirus by a 20-point margin. A poll released on Friday showed that viewers of conservative Fox News, which spent weeks downplaying and dismissing the virus, were much less likely to take the pandemic seriously.“The idea that states can decide particular local issues on a wide range of things allows for such variation,” said Pastor. “That’s, of course, kind of stupid, in the context of the pandemic, because when one state has lax standards, then you wind up maintaining the infection in another location.”That picture is likely to change in the coming weeks, however. Governors in some non-coastal states have taken aggressive action against the virus, including Kentucky’s Andrew Beshear, a Democrat, and Ohio’s Mike DeWine, a Republican.While Kentucky was quick to set up lab testing for the virus and declared a state of emergency on 6 March, the governor nextdoor, Republican Bill Lee of Tennessee, waited a week longer to declare a state of emergency.In Ohio, DeWine became one of the first governors in the country to order bars and restaurants to close and limit large gatherings, while the Democratic governor of neighboring Michigan was slower to issue restrictions. As of last week, Ohio had recorded 351 cases, compared with 1,035 for Michigan – although variations in testing obscure the picture.“I think it’s impossible to talk about a Covid epidemic in the United States,” said Gostin. “We’d have to say it’s Covid epidemics. Because the epidemics will vary state by state, and the response will vary state by state.”It is “crucially urgent” for the Trump administration to coordinate aid for the states and for the president to use his bully pulpit to focus the national attention, said Gostin.“That should have been happening several weeks ago,” he said. “The longer we wait without having a properly coordinated national approach the worse the disaster will unfold in the United States.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1f38a51f256ea8452102dbba793b058aed03fe57/0_182_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=caa57d13ad9253b56a54fdc3f2720733","title":"a letter to the uk from italy this is what we know about your future","story":"An author in Rome describes what to expect based on her experiences of lockdownThe acclaimed Italian novelist Francesca Melandri, who has been under lockdown in Rome for almost three weeks due to the Covid-19 outbreak, has written a letter to fellow Europeans “from your future”, laying out the range of emotions people are likely to go through over the coming weeks.I am writing to you from Italy, which means I am writing from your future.

It will be true. This experience will change for good how you perceive yourself as an inidual part of a larger whole.Class, however, will make all the difference. Being locked up in a house with a pretty garden or in an overcrowded housing project will not be the same. Nor is being able to keep on working from home or seeing your job disappear. That boat in which you’ll be sailing in order to defeat the epidemic will not look the same to everyone nor is it actually the same for everyone: it never was.At some point, you will realise it’s tough. You will be afraid. You will share your fear with your dear ones, or you will keep it to yourselves so as not to burden them with it too.You will eat again.We’re in Italy, and this is what we know about your future. But it’s just small-scale fortune-telling. We are very low-key seers.If we turn our gaze to the more distant future, the future which is unknown both to you and to us too, we can only tell you this: when all of this is over, the world won’t be the same."},{"url":null,"title":"anywhere but westminster we need your help covering the coronavirus","story":"For our second episode we want to focus on work, and what the Covid-19 outbreak has done to it.

The team is headed by Masoom Stanekzai, an ex-security chief and supporter of president Ashraf Ghani, and includes politicians, former officials and representatives of civil society. Five members are women.“In order to reach true and lasting peace, the aforementioned team must be agreed upon by all effective Afghan sides so that it can represent all sides,” said Mujahid.The United States, which ousted the Taliban from power in 2001, signed a troop withdrawal deal with the group in February. But progress on moving to talks between the militants and the Afghan government has been delayed by a feud between Afghan politicians, and disagreement between the Taliban and the government over prisoner releases and a possible ceasefire.The spokeswoman for the Afghan ministry of peace affairs, Najia Anwari, said the Taliban’s stance was unjustified, as the negotiating team had been appointed after wide consultations among Afghan society.Ghani’s political rival, Abdullah Abdullah, has not confirmed whether he will support the delegation, which is potentially important given his camp’s strong influence in the north and west. Abdullah’s spokesman, Fraidoon Khwazoon, said that although the announced list was not final and there were “considerations that needed to be addressed”, it should not be rejected outright. “All sides including the Taliban should try not to lose the available opportunity for peace, by make illogical excuses. The Taliban should not lose the current opportunity.”The US embassy did not immediately respond to requests for comment on Saturday. US secretary of state Mike Pompeo failed to mediate between Abdullah and Ghana to create an “inclusive” government during a visit to Kabul on Monday, and announced a $1bn cut in US aid to Afghanistan, which he said could be reversed."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e41aa2561841f68c16be520491c2a1708343b383/0_353_5289_3173/master/5289.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=64792a70ed28ced82e7abc4d2345ccef","title":"australia restricts public gatherings to two people among further coronavirus curbs","story":"Scott Morrison says Australians should stay at home except for essential activities, and announces six-month moratorium on rental evictionsScott Morrison says gatherings in Australia will now be restricted to two people, down from 10, and there will be a six-month moratorium on evictions for commercial and residential tenants in financial distress because of the economic shock associated with the coronavirus outbreak.As the Morrison government continued work on Sunday night on the third economic stimulus package in as many weeks – which will include a wage guarantee allowing businesses to keep people on the payroll during a shutdown – the prime minister and the premiers signed off on regulatory measures to assist landlords and renters, while urging both parties to negotiate sensible commercial terms.The national cabinet has also tightened social distancing measures in an effort to contain community transmissions of the virus. The prime minister told reporters on Sunday night members of the same household could still mingle together both inside and outside, but a limit of two would be set for all other interactions, and the limits would be enforced by authorities in New South Wales and Victoria.Underpinning the new limit on gatherings, public playgrounds, outside gyms and skateparks would be closed from Monday, and group boot camps are no longer permitted.With the number of confirmed Covid-19 cases now heading towards 4,000, and 16 fatalities recorded, Morrison told reporters on Sunday night Australians now needed to stay home unless they were shopping for food and other essentials, attending medical appointments, exercising, or attending work or education.He said the “strong advice” was also that people aged 70 and over “should stay at home and self-isolate for their own protection”. The same advice applied to people over 60 with a chronic illness, and Indigenous people over the age of 50.Morrison said it was important for some retail outlets to remain open for now to allow people to gather essential items ahead of further social distancing restrictions, but he warned further closure of businesses was imminent. “As time goes on the national cabinet will continue to look at a lot of these businesses and may have to make further decisions in these areas, and in some cases that may not be too far from now.”The prime minister said Australians needed to adjust their habits. “When you are going out for shopping, you should be going for just stuff you need and do it and get home.“It is not a time for browsing. It is not a time for catching up with friends or bumping into people and having a long conversation and maybe drawing a few other friends across to catch up on how is it all going.“No, you can’t do that anymore. That is what we have to stop doing.”The chief medical officer, Brendan Murphy, said the goal of the tightened restrictions was to isolate confirmed cases and embark on contact tracing. He said the rate of new infections had slowed, but the positive trend was not enough to declare any breakthrough.“We have to slow it further and we have to stop the thing that’s worrying us most, which is community transmissions.”Sunday night’s announcements include a moratorium on evictions of people as a result of financial distress for the next six months under state laws.Canberra continues to work on other elements of a rental relief package. Morrison said commercial landlords and tenants needed “to sit down, talk to each other and work this out”, and he said banks had a role to play.“We need landlords and tenants to sit down and come up with arrangements that enable them to get through this crisis so on the other side, the landlord has a tenant, which is a business that can pay rent, and the business is a business that can re-emerge on the other side of this and be able to go on and employ people,” the prime minister said.“We want the banks to help them achieve this outcome.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9cc06240e72ef62340e2dab96accc2ffbe51b810/26_29_3329_1997/master/3329.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5b5612460149df463c97f632049d1405","title":"church goers around the world ignore social distance advice","story":"Services from Moscow to Rio go ahead as clerics disregard coronavirus riskMillions of people across the world tuned into online church services on Sunday as their usual places of worship were closed, but in some places clerics insisted on their doors remaining open.The day after Pope Francis delivered a blessing in an empty St Peter’s Square, watched on television by an estimated 11 million people, Sunday services were held at some of Russia’s largest religious sites after Orthodox church leaders said they were an expression of religious freedom.Dozens of parishioners, many of them elderly, crowded into Kazan Cathedral in St Petersburg to receive communion. Earlier this month, the cathedral came under fire for continuing to exhibit a relic of John the Baptist despite fears that visitors kissing the exhibit could hasten the spread of coronavirus.In virus-hit Louisiana, hundreds of worshippers attended services on Sunday, flouting a ban on large gatherings. An estimated 500 people of all ages filed inside the Life Tabernacle church in Central, a city of nearly 29,000 outside Baton RougeThe Russian Orthodox church had insisted that mayors could not close churches and that it would continue to “fulfil its pastoral duty” unless given an order from the Kremlin.But later on Sunday the church’s leader, Patriarch Kirill of Moscow, called on believers to refrain from visiting churches.Speaking after the liturgy at Christ the Saviour church in Moscow, Kirill said: “I have been preaching for 51 years, calling on people to come to church, overcome the gravitation of their own ill will and external circumstances, I dedicated my entire life to this call and I hope you understand how difficult it is for me to say now: refrain from visiting churches.”In Romania and Georgia, two countries with strongly Orthodox Christian populations, there has been consternation over the insistence of some priests on continuing to use a shared spoon for the communion ritual.Last Sunday, the day after Romania had been put into a strict lockdown, footage emerged from the city of Cluj of priests using a shared spoon. In Georgia, while the church has told worshippers not to spend long periods of time in churches and not to come if ill, it has rejected calls to abandon the reusing of spoons, claiming that as communion is a holy ceremony it is not possible to get ill during it.In devoutly Catholic Poland, coronavirus restrictions limited the number of churchgoers to 50 at a time, and this was reduced again last week to five. Archbishop Stanisław Gądecki, the head of the Polish episcopate, earlier in March called for more church services to accommodate worshippers, as not praying during the epidemic would be “unthinkable”. However, he has since urged faithful to use media broadcasts of services to prayer, especially over the Easter period.In Brazil, the president, Jair Bolsonaro – who has called the coronavirus a “little flu” and attacked lockdown – included churches in a list of “public services and essential activities” essential for the “survival, health and safety” of the population, provided they followed health ministry guidelines.Two days after Bolsonaro’s pronouncement, a judge in Rio de Janeiro state suspended his decree. Cathedrals in São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro are now closed. And while some churches are still open for prayer, mass and services have mostly moved online.Dom Walmor Azevedo, the archbishop of Belo Horizonte and president of the National Conference of Bishops of Brazil (CNBB), last week told congregations to “stay at home”. The CNBB and other Catholic organisations called Bolsonaro’s “disinformation campaign” a “serious threat to all Brazilians”.Rio’s Assembly of God Victory in Christ church is open every day for “prayers and to attend those who need it”, said its pastor, Alexandre Camargo, but services went online even after it won a court battle to stay open. Rio’s Attitude Baptist church – frequented by Brazil’s first lady, Michelle Bolsonaro – is only holding online services.“People are really suffering with this, because they need this spiritual, emotional and financial support,” said Pastor Josué Valandro Jr. “It is very serious to close all the churches.”The Vatican said at the weekend that Pope Francis did not have coronavirus after testing of Holy See staff resulted in one new case. The total number of people with Covid-19 at the Vatican is now six. “I can confirm that neither the Holy Father nor his closest collaborators are involved,” a spokesperson said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a27694cabab8fe4fd2a89b43d6c9d20d529367ff/0_56_4434_2661/master/4434.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ac8e880bc92b05e71f51d35f22484bad","title":"coronavirus symptoms what are they and should i call the doctor","story":"What are the symptoms caused by the Covid-19 virus, how does it spread, and should you call a doctor?It is caused by a member of the coronavirus family that has never been encountered before. Like other coronaviruses, it has transferred to humans from animals. The World Health Organisation (WHO) has declared it a pandemic.About one in six people, the WHO says, become seriously ill. The elderly and people with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, or chronic respiratory conditions, are at a greater risk of serious illness from Covid-19.In the UK, the National health Service (NHS) has identified the specific symptoms to look for as experiencing either:As this is viral pneumonia, antibiotics are of no use. The antiviral drugs we have against flu will not work, and there is currently no vaccine. Recovery depends on the strength of the immune system.No. In the UK, the NHS advice is now that anyone with symptoms should stay at home for at least 7 days. If you live with other people, they should stay at home for at least 14 days, to avoid spreading the infection outside the home. This applies to everyone, regardless of whether they have travelled abroad.In the UK, you should look on the dedicated coronavirus NHS 111 website for information. If you get worse or your symptoms last longer than seven days, you should call NHS 111. People will no longer be tested for the virus unless they are in hospital.Many countries have imposed travel bans and lockdown conditions in order to try and halt the spread of the virus. You should check with your local authorities for the latest advice on seeking medical assistance.People in the UK will only be allowed to leave their home for the following purposes:Police will have the powers to enforce the rules, including through fines and dispersing gatherings. To ensure compliance with the instruction to stay at home, the government will:Parks will remain open for exercise, but gatherings will be dispersed.China’s national health commission confirmed human-to-human transmission in January.As of 29 March, more than 665,000 people have been infected in more than 150 countries, according to the Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering.There have been over 30,000 deaths globally. Just over 3,000 of those deaths have occurred in mainland China, where the coronavirus was first recorded in the city of Wuhan. Italy has been hardest hit, though, with over 10,000 fatalities, and Spain has seen more than 5,900 deaths. The US now has more confirmed cases than any other country. Many of those who have died had underlying health conditions, which the coronavirus complicated.More than 140,000 people are recorded as having recovered from the coronavirus.Another key unknown is how contagious the coronavirus is. A crucial difference is that unlike flu, there is no vaccine for the new coronavirus, which means it is more difficult for vulnerable members of the population – elderly people or those with existing respiratory or immune problems – to protect themselves. Hand-washing and avoiding other people if you feel unwell are important."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d6dee53ed3a9f5ab0dac3511d8dd5300f66faf65/0_0_1000_600/master/1000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6545e252bfa8f09bf05d37da87ef68ec","title":"coronavirus uk how many confirmed cases are in your area","story":"Latest figures from public health authorities on the spread of Covid-19 in the United Kingdom.

We don’t knock on doors and hand parcels over. If we can, we avoid all contact. Many couriers know the safe places where customers are happy for us to leave packages. If it needs a signature we knock, put the parcel down and step right back. Some might feel we shouldn’t be out delivering packages but we are keeping people supplied with what they need. Normally you don’t find out what’s in the parcels but customers have started telling us. I’ve been delivering to some families in Whitby for years and this is the first time I’ve actually spoken to them.Some drivers are reporting peak volumes like they usually see at Christmas. I delivered a pair of warm joggers to an 82-year-old lady. She was worried about her heating bills going up with all the time she was spending indoors. I delivered some toys to a mother stuck at home. She told me I had saved her life because her kids were driving her up the wall. Today I only had 45 parcels. Normally it’s 70 to 80 – it has almost halved. There are couriers who will be on the breadline if they lose work.For the last few weeks I’ve been coming into contact with hundreds of people each day at work. It makes me feel apprehensive and worries my wife. We’ve had lots of people abusing staff and panic-buying. I spend the evening hoping everything will get a bit calmer during the lockdown.When I arrive at work at 5.40am there is already a queue of between 100 and 200 people outside. I spend most of the day restocking the shelves. People are still pushing past me or leaning across me to get something on the shelf, rather than waiting for me to move out of their way.I am on the till. A couple of people exceed the amount they are allowed to buy, and when I tell them, they swear at me. Abuse towards shop workers is quite prevalent in general, and it’s getting worse due to the outbreak.There are fewer gaps on the shelves, and the shop is quieter. It is the first day I feel the message about staying in is slowly starting to get through. But then I see couples still bringing their kids into the shop. Surely one of them could stay at home with their children while the other goes shopping.An elderly gentleman is told he needs to stand behind the line while packing his shopping. He makes comments like, “Oh, who makes these stupid bloody rules?” But then a man comes up and says he wants to thank us all for what we are doing. When you get one customer like that, you can forget about five of the abusers. This disease targets everyone, of all ages. I’ve seen patients in their 30s really sick with the heart complications you get with Covid-19, and fit and well patients in their 40s and 50s who are very sick. People are kidding themselves if they think they’re safe. So it was weird, before the lockdown, seeing the streets completely packed.Still seeing people on my way to work ignoring the lockdown blew my mind. The big challenge with managing Covid-19 patients is that it’s not obvious when they’re deteriorating. That’s heartbreaking. Patients seem blissfully unaware they may be about to die. I have the day off, which I spend reading guidance on the disease and listening to a podcast for non-intensive-care doctors about how to, for example, manage a ventilator. I want to be good at my job in the months ahead and aware of every possible challenge I am likely to encounter.Back at work. I have asthma, and my personal protective equipment is just a plastic gown, a pair of gloves and a surgical mask. It’s pretty alarming going in to see a patient who’s coughing their lungs out, and all you’ve got is a piece of paper over your mouth. But Public Health England says that’s all I need. I have got to trust that recommendation, and I do.I arrive at work for a night shift. More than 10 people with Covid-19 symptoms are waiting for beds. They all have an oxygen requirement. It gets busy but we remain in control throughout. I have confidence in our ability to manage this. My advice to people is: cherish the moments you have with your family. Because if you die from this, you die alone."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/839d28c451cbdb97b0469982d3b1015ee5087277/0_0_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4153e3d5b34d14caf1867bd46d0e5e6a","title":"italy sets aside 400m for food vouchers as social unrest mounts","story":"Rescue package comes as police now patrol supermarkets in Sicily following a series of theftsThe Italian government has designated €400m (£358m) for food vouchers amid brewing social unrest as the country’s coronavirus lockdown takes its toll on the poor.Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte made the announcement late on Saturday after reports emerged of people in the south running out of food and money. He said that €4.3bn would immediately be made available to mayors to help their citizens and another €400m would go towards an emergency food-relief fund.“We know that many suffer, but the state is there,” Conte said.Italy is currently the EU country worst affected by coronavirus and its economy has been severely damaged. The governmentapproved a €25bn financial package earlier this month to safeguard the economy.The entire country has been under lockdown for almost three weeks. The quarantine was due to end on 3 April, but will likely be extended.Tension has been mounting on the island of Sicily in recent days, with police now patrolling supermarkets following a series of thefts. People have been running out of supermarkets without paying or pressuring small shop owners to give them free food, according to Italian media reports.La Repubblica reported that one person shouted at cashiers in a supermarket in Palermo: “We have no money to pay, we have to eat.”With income lost or businesses closed, many have been forced to turn to charities for help. “We have nothing to eat,” Carmela, a mother-of-three from Palermo, told La Stampa.Citing recent data, La Stampa reported that 300,000 people across Sicily had been working off the books, among them carers, parking attendants and street vendors. “These must be added to the new poor,” the newspaper said. One young man who had been working off the books in a nightclub in Palermo was sleeping in his car, the newspaper added.A video also emerged of a couple begging for a €50 advance outside a bank in Bari, Puglia, after their shop was forced to close due to the quarantine.Leoluca Orlando, the mayor of Palermo, warned that if something was not done to help the poor, the Mafia could exploit the situation.“Discomfort and malaise are growing and we are recording worrying reports of protest and anger that is being exploited by criminals who want to destabilise the system,” he told told Sky News.“The more time passes, the more resources are exhausted. The few savings people have are running out,” he added. “This tells us socio-economic issues will erupt.”Pope Francis raised the alarm over the socioeconomic fallout of the coronavirus pandemic during a mass live-streamed on Saturday. “We begin to see people who are hungry, because they cannot work, they did not have a permanent job, and for many circumstances,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6e5c8f84f308e0f603dc0b8d43134d90fdbb3f69/0_0_1024_614/master/1024.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b23d018edf32bcdf1ab273c275c86705","title":"uk coronavirus restrictions could last six months deputy chief medical officer","story":"Dr Jenny Harries says lifting lockdown too soon could risk second wave of infectionThe lockdown in the UK to try to slow the spread of coronavirus could go on for six months and the country may not return to its normal way of life until the autumn, a key government doctor has said.The deputy chief medical officer for England, Dr Jenny Harries, said at Downing Street’s daily press conference on Sunday that the effectiveness of the current restrictions would be reviewed at the end of the original three-week period.“If we are successful, we will have squashed the top of that curve, which is brilliant, but we must not then suddenly revert to our normal way of living,” she said. “That would be quite dangerous. If we stop, then all of our efforts will be wasted and we could potentially see a second peak.”The public have been asked to stop all non-essential travel, work from home if at all possible and limit exercise to one walk outside a day.“We need to keep that lid on and then gradually we will be able to hopefully adjust some of the social distancing measures and gradually get us all back to normal,” Harries said.“So I think three weeks for review. Two or three months to see whether we’ve really squashed it, with about three to six months ideally, and lots of uncertainty in that, but then to see at which point we can actually get back to normal. It is plausible that it could go further than that.”The daily press conference was led by the secretary of state for housing, communities and local government, Robert Jenrick, who said the restrictions would be reviewed at Easter.Boris Johnson is still in isolation in No 11 Downing Street after testing positive for coronavirus. The likelihood of long-term government restrictions to try to limit the outbreak comes as Prof Neil Ferguson of Imperial College London, one of the epidemiologists advising the government, told the Sunday Times the lockdown would need to last for months.“We’re going to have to keep these measures in place, in my view, for a significant period of time, probably until the end of May, maybe even early June.

Photograph: James FordeThe Office of Public Works (OPW) has been given permission for extensive refurbishment of a historic house in the Phoenix Park after scrapping plans to use the property for Airbnb-style letting.Last May the OPW sought planning permission from Dublin City Council to refurbish Rose Cottage, formerly the home of the head deer keeper, and use it for “short-term holiday letting”.Planning permission is required to change the use of a dwelling from a permanent home to short-term letting accommodation. Minister for Housing Eoghan Murphy last July introduced additional regulations for the holiday let sector following concerns the proliferation of “Airbnb-style” rentals was reducing the supply of housing, particularly in Dublin.Several politicians and local residents’ groups objected to the OPW’s short-term letting plan for the cottage, which is close to the Ordinance Survey headquarters in the park.Labour’s Joan Burton, who was a local TD at the time, said the restored cottage should be made available for housing for park staff. She warned that the park’s wildlife, particularly the deer, might be “harassed” by holiday-makers.Fianna Fáil councillor Mary Fitzpatrick said the OPW’s application was “foolish” in light of the housing crisis in Dublin. “It’s a long-standing tradition that these lodges have been allocated to park constables, rangers and other members of the park staff so that they are close by during emergencies,” she said.Local residents’ group the Navan Road Community Council said the proposal was “wrong” when people were homeless, and suggested Garda vetting of guests would be necessary due to the proximity of Áras An Uachtaráin, the US ambassador’s residence, Garda headquarters and Farmleigh House. Material changeThe council’s planning department indicated to the OPW it was unlikely to approve the letting plan, noting Dublin city, including the Phoenix Park, was a designated rent pressure zone. “A short-term letting use of the cottage is therefore a material change of use from the established permanent residential use.” There was an “objection in principle to the proposed use”, it said.The OPW withdrew the application, but said refurbishment was still required, and last September submitted a fresh application for those works only.Rose Cottage, which dates from about 1800, is one of about 40 park lodges, several of which are occupied by park staff. The cottage was vacated in the last decade and has fallen into disrepair. Following the granting of permission by the council, the OPW will now restore the cottage and remove 20th century interventions, such as PVC downpipes, concrete roof tiles and modern doors and windows. They will be replaced with appropriate “conservation” materials. Renovation workIt is understood the use of the cottage after the renovation work has yet to be determined. The city council has said it is its policy to consider the contribution of existing uses to the special interest of an area when assessing change-of-use applications, and will “promote compatible uses which ensure future long-term viability”.While the OPW has not used any of the park’s lodges for short-term lets, it has leased a number of other OPW properties around the State, including lighthouses and schoolhouses, to the Irish Landmark Trust for holiday lettings."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4215133.1585496545!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"cocooning q a how does it work who must do it can people visit my home","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tTony McGrath (76) ‘cocooning’ at his home in Drumcondra, Dublin. Cocooning is now required for everyone over the age of 70 as a measure to limit the spread of Covid-19. Photograph: © Fran Veale As part of the latest emergency measures in the fight against Covid-19 the Government has introduced “cocooning” to help protect the most vulnerable in society. What is cocooning?According to a document released by the HSE, cocooning is a measure to protect people who are over 70 years of age or those who are extremely medically vulnerable by minimising all interaction between them and others. How does it work?Essentially, people in these two categories should not leave their homes at all, even if they feel fit and well. Iniduals who are advised to cocoon should not go to the shops, leave home or garden, or attend any gatherings.People should also avoid all non-essential face-to-face interaction and instead stay connected to friends and family through the phone or internet.Who does this apply to?The Government has released a list of people who should strictly adhere to the cocooning practices. They include people who are 70 years or older, solid organ transplant recipients and people with severe respiratory conditions including cystic fibrosis, severe asthma and severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).Other “medically vulnerable” categories include people with specific cancers, iniduals with rare diseases and inborn errors of metabolism that significantly increase the risk of infections, people on immunosuppression therapies and women who are pregnant with significant heart disease, congenital or acquired.How will I get food and medicine?The HSE has said that family, friends and neighbours can support you once you adhere to cocooning guidelines and they adhere to physical distancing guidelines. They also advise that iniduals use online services where possible.Assistance is also being made available through the local authorities, working with voluntary sector services, to ensure you can have access to food, essential household supplies and medicines. Each local authority will publish contact details for this service.How long are these new rules in place?The new measures and restrictions are in place until Easter. However, the HSE said this period is being kept under review.Can people still visit my home?Visits from people who provide essential support to you such as healthcare, personal support with your daily needs or social care should continue, the Government has said.However, carers and care workers must stay away if they have any symptoms of Covid-19.The Government advice also states that regular visitors should not attend your home unless they are providing essential care such as help with washing, dressing or feeding. All people entering your home should wash their hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds on arrival to your house, as well as other times throughout the visit, and should adhere to the physical distancing guidelines.I live with other people who are not 70 or medically vulnerable. Do they have to cocoon too?If you have someone else living with you, they are not required to adopt these measures themselves.They should do what they can to support you in cocooning by following guidance on physical distancing and reducing their contact outside the home.They should also wash their hands thoroughly and regularly, especially upon arrival home and observe good respiratory etiquette at all times.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":null,"title":"confronting","story":"A news podcast from The  that covers Ireland\u0027s response to the Coronavirus outbreak.

Photograph: Dara Mac DónaillA senior Labour Party TD has said the party should consider coalition with Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael if no other option works out.In a significant development, Cork East TD Seán Sherlock became the first of the party’s six-strong Dáil group to say publicly that Labour should not exclude itself from government-formation talks.“A lot of people have contacted me about that possibility,” he said. “It is something that is increasingly coming into focus in my view,” he said.“If the Green Party and the Social Democrats rule out coalition with Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael, and if a government of national unity does not come about, then it is something that Labour needs to consider if it means that a stable government can be established.”After a disappointing election in which it lost one seat from its 2016 result, the Labour Party decided it would be better off going into opposition for this Dáil term, in order to rebuild the party.Leader Brendan Howlin subsequently announced he was standing down. The outcome of the month-long leadership contest between Aodhán Ó Ríordáin and Alan Kelly will be known next weekend.The coronavirus emergency, in addition to decisions by other small parties to rule themselves out of a coalition involving Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil, is seen by some within the Labour Party as having changed the dynamic. There has been speculation that a new leader could signal a change of strategy by the party in favour of talks on government formation.Kelly supporterMr Sherlock is a strong supporter of Mr Kelly in the leadership race. However, other supporters of the Tipperary TD have continued to express opposition to the party going into government now.“We are halfway through this leadership election, and both sides agree it’s extremely tight. We’re confident of the level of support we are receiving. I don’t know what Alan Kelly’s view is but mine is clear.”Dublin councillor and Seanad candidate Rebecca Moynihan echoed that view. “We haven’t got a mandate to go into government,” she said. “There are other parties with bigger mandates who are in a better position to govern.”“I would be surprised if either candidate for the leadership thought differently.”Challenging timeThe Green Party and the Social Democrats have strongly ruled out any arrangement with Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael. The former wants a government of national unity to be formed for the duration of the crisis. The Social Democrats have said they may be willing to talk with one of the parties but not with both together.Taoiseach Leo Varadkar has said that a coalition involving his party and Fianna Fáil, supported only by Independents, would not work as it would not give the State a stable government in what would be a very difficult, chastened, and economically challenging time as Ireland struggled to recover from Covid-19.The nine-strong regional group of Independents is seen as the most likely target, although other Independents such as Michael Fitzmaurice, Michael McNamara, Marian Harkin – as well as some of the rural group of six TDs, including Mattie McGrath and the Healy-Raes – are also said to be interested.The best news and analysis from the campaign trail"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4206213.1584564281!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"eu sets out proposals for close uk ties after brexit talks","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tEuropean Union chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier and the British prime minister’s Europe adviser David Frost in Brussels on March 2nd. Photograph: Oliver HosletReutersThe European Union released a draft of its hoped-for future relationship deal with Britain on Wednesday, setting out ambitions for a tight relationship on trade and security.The 440-page document crosses several of Britain’s red lines, spelling out the bloc’s ambitions for Britain to agree “uniform implementation” of state subsidy rules, with the European Court of Justice remaining the adjudicating authority.It also makes reference to the so-called “level playing field”, provisions to ensure fair competition by keeping rules aligned, which London has already rejected.“The Parties recognise that the establishment of conditions that ensure a level playing field between the Parties is necessary for trade and investment between the Union and the United Kingdom, ” the draft reads.The EU’s draft envisages reciprocal access to waters for fishing rights, with negotiations held each year by December 10th on fishing opportunities for the following year, another contentious point.The UK negotiating team said it had also sent a draft to the EU. This includes a free trade agreement with annexes, as well as agreements on aviation safety and air transport, and a civil nuclear agreement.“We are sharing ours in confidence as a negotiating document, as part of the ongoing negotiating process,” a government spokesman said.“Teams will now analyse each other’s texts and we expect further conversations between the teams next week.“We will keep under review which documents it is appropriate to publish during the course of negotiations and whether it is useful to make them availablle more widely.”Though Britain has left the EU it is is currently in a transition period, continuing to adhere to prior norms pending the agreement of a deal on the future relationship. If none can be agreed, it will automatically begin trading on World Trade Organisation terms from January 1st, 2021, with potentially severe effects on the Irish economy.The government of prime minister Boris Johnson has until July to request an extension to the transition period, but has insisted it will not do so even as the Coronavirus pandemic delayed talks this week.Both sides said they were examining options such as using video conferencing in place of face-to face talks.“The negotiations can still proceed given all of the logistical arrangements that have been put in place,” British foreign secretary Dominic Raab said on Tuesday.“We’re confident that we can get this done and, actually, I don’t think delaying Brexit negotiations would give anyone the certainty on either side of the Channel that they need.”Stay on top of the latest news with our Morning Briefing and Lunchtime Latest newsletters"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4215078.1585492128!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"maureen dowd coronavirus has made a national shrink of andrew cuomo","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tNew York governor Andrew Cuomo at a news conference recently. Photograph: Benjamin NormanThe New York TimesIt’s no wonder that watching Andrew Cuomo’s daily briefings can make some people crave Chianti and meatballs. Besides coolly explaining the facts in this terrifying and stultifying plague season, the governor of New York evokes the feeling of a big Italian family dinner table.And that is the intended effect. “Call it psychological,” Cuomo, phoning from Albany, tells me. “Call it feelings. Call it emotions. But this is as much a social crisis as a health crisis.”Often in the past, when people called Cuomo patriarchal, it was not meant as a compliment. It was a way to describe his maniacally controlling behaviour, his dark zeal to muscle past people and obstacles to get his way. Adam Nagourney of the New York Times dubbed him the “human bulldozer”, and a former adviser once put it this way: “The governor thinks he’s a hammer. So everyone looks like a nail.”But now, the darker the zeal, the better, if it secures you a mask or ventilator. Given the White House’s deathly delays and the president’s childish rants, the US is yearning for a trustworthy parental figure – and a hammer.The warm, fuzzy feeling for the cold, calculating politician that developed among many Democrats in the past week was summed up by Bill Maher, who told me: “I see Cuomo as the Democratic nominee this year. If we could switch Biden out for him, that’s the winner.” He added, “He’s unlikeable, which I really like.”Progressives still have problems with Cuomo’s stances on Medicaid and the criminal justice system. And some people thought he waited too long to totally button up New York, although the governor maintains that his systematic rolling closure was designed to prevent panic in the streets.But even Jezebel blew him a kiss with a post by Rebecca Fishbein headlined, “Help, I think I’m in love with Andrew Cuomo???” chronicling how, solo in her Brooklyn apartment, she has become addicted to his briefings and morphed from intense distaste for him to admiration for his “measured bullying”.Then the governor actually called her to check in. On his own, after his 2005 orce from Kerry Kennedy and his split last year from TV chef and author Sandra Lee, he’d been thinking about the isolation of singles.“You know, it was sad, the piece,” he tells me. “Being alone in your apartment for virtually 24 hours a day for days and days in this fearful situation and there’s no one to lay on the couch with and watch TV with, and no one to hold. That’s terrible.”National shrinkTo the surprise of many who did not associate the name “Andrew Cuomo” with the word “empathy”, the governor has become a sort of national shrink, talking us through our fear, our loss and our growing stir-craziness. “This is going be a long day, and it’s going to be a hard day, and it’s going to be an ugly day, and it’s going to be a sad day,” he told officers from the New York National Guard on Friday, charging them to fight this “invisible” and “insidious” beast and “kick coronavirus’s ass”.Because New York is at the epicentre of the epidemic in the United States, with 519 deaths and 44,635 confirmed cases as of noon on Friday, Americans have their eyes on the state. Cuomo knows this. “New York is the canary in the coal mine,” he said during one of his passionate televised pleas for the president to provide more ventilators.It is more than passing strange that in this horror-movie moment, with 13 people dying last Tuesday at Elmhurst Hospital in Queens and a refrigerated truck parked outside to collect the bodies, the nation’s two most prominent leaders are both Queens scions. Both men grew up in the shadows of their fathers, the hard-working sons of European immigrants.The Trump family is a model of bad nepotism – noblesse oblige in reverse. Such is their reputation as scammers that congressional Democrats felt the need to put a provision in the coronavirus rescue Bill to try to prevent Trump-and-Kushner Inc from carving out a treat of their own.Cuomo-style nepotism at least has better values. Donald Trump got his start with his father discriminating against black tenants in their housing complexes Andrew Cuomo left his job as a political enforcer for his father, Mario Cuomo, also a three-term governor of New York, and created a national programme to provide housing for the homeless.Cuomo has brought two of his adult daughters onstage with him at briefings. He warned the 22-year-old Michaela to forsake parties celebrating her graduation – in absentia – from Brown.“Risk, reward,” he lectured her in front of millions.And Cuomo gave his 25-year-old daughter, Cara, a dollar-a-year job on the virus task force, echoing the time his father gave him a dollar-a-year job as an adviser when he was about her age.His brother, Chris, hosts a CNN show. The 62-year-old governor goes on it to bicker and banter with his 49-year-old baby brother about everything from the women swooning over Andrew’s machismo style on Twitter – “You know that what people are saying about how you look really can’t be accurate,” Chris teased – to their relative prowess at basketball.Annoyed motherIn his briefings, Andrew Cuomo talks about how cabin fever is causing him to get annoyed with his dog, a Northern Inuit named Captain. He talks about stopping his sisters from bringing their kids to see his 88-year-old mother, Matilda, who is “pure sugar” but vulnerable to the virus. He says his mother was a little annoyed when he named a social-distancing guideline for the most vulnerable “Matilda’s Law” in her honour.After Dan Patrick, the lieutenant governor of Texas, suggested that older Americans might be willing to sacrifice themselves for the good of their grandchildren’s economy and Trump buoyantly called for the US to reopen as soon as Easter, Cuomo said flatly, “My mother’s not expendable.”He also posted on Twitter: “You cannot put a value on human life. You do the right thing. That’s what Pop taught us.”At Wednesday’s briefing he displayed a picture of Mario Cuomo, who died in 2015, amid all the graphs on infections. “He’s not here any more for you,” he said, but “he’s still here for me.” He offered a quote from his dad about what government should be: “The idea of family, mutuality, the sharing of benefits and burdens for the good of all, feeling one another’s pain, sharing one another’s blessings – reasonably, honestly, fairly, without respect to race or sex or geography or political affiliation.”The quote was obviously meant to draw an odious comparison with the Republican in the White House who seems immune to feeling others’ pain.The two men go back. According to the Trump biographer Tim O’Brien, Fred Trump was a regular customer at Andrea Cuomo’s grocery store in Queens. Andrew and Donald knew each other as they rose in Gotham. They were never friends, but Donald Trump donated to Mario Cuomo’s campaigns and made a tape for Andrew’s bachelor party, warning him, “Whatever you do, Andrew, don’t ever, ever fool around.”Both men have often had the twin designation of charming and ruthless. The president is pure id, and when the governor was his father’s consigliere, he was known as “Mario Cuomo’s id”. Over the years, both have been called manipulative, expedient, bullying, vindictive, arrogant wheeler-dealers. They have both been described as obsessed with their press, thin-skinned and quick to belittle or intimidate critics.But, as Lis Smith, the Democratic strategist who rumbled in New York politics before becoming Mayor Pete’s Pygmalion, said, “Trump is selfishly ruthless for his own personal gain while Cuomo is more benevolently ruthless.”Surpassing ObamaI wrote admiringly about Cuomo’s LBJ-style blend of the velvet glove and the brass knuckles when he did what Barack Obama did not deign to do in 2009 and clawed back millions from the rapacious financiers scarfing up bonuses while they were taking federal bailout money when he pushed to legalise same-sex marriage in New York in 2011 and when he rammed through a gun control Bill after the Sandy Hook children were slaughtered, surpassing Obama’s efforts again.“It took a terrible political toll on me, but it’s still the best gun law in the nation,” Cuomo says now.He learned how to be a mechanic when he was a teenage gas station attendant in Queens and a tow-truck driver for the AAA with the call signal “Queens-15”. And he still likes to get under the hood with a wrench and fix things, from the state budget to the engines of his light blue 1975 Corvette and dark blue 1968 GTO.It is jarring to watch officials such as Cuomo and Dr Anthony Fauci, the head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases – people who have worked their way up through the system, gaining valuable wisdom – having to delicately deal with Donald Trump, the barbarian who crashed through the gates and who is ignorant about – and disdains – the bureaucracy he leads.Trump is now using the ego arithmetic he once used to brag about the ratings he got on Larry King’s show or the number of TV cameras he saw at rallies to falsely claim that his administration has done more tests than anyone and that everyone who wants a test can get one. He boasts about having the best tests on earth the same way he used to brag about having the best rolls in the city in the restaurant at Trump Tower.The governor got heated on Tuesday about the elusive ventilators that Trump kept promising. But in this crisis, Cuomo has put his own enormous ego aside to tend to the president’s, lacing his briefings with whatever praise for Trump is justified, willing to do what it takes to get what New York needs.The subtext is on vivid display, though, when Cuomo tweets: “Facts are empowering. Even when the facts are discouraging, not knowing the facts is worse. I promise that I will continue to give New Yorkers all the facts, not selective facts.”The governor also makes a point of praising Fauci, whose honesty has irritated a president who is intent on obscuring science with spin. Cuomo said that through their constant calls, including in the middle of the night, they have become friends and that Fauci is “so personally kind”.Itching to get his crackling economy back, recklessly urging Americans to gather for Easter Mass, the president sent a letter to the nation’s governors on Thursday saying that his administration was working on changing its social-distancing guidelines, classifying counties as high risk, medium risk and low risk.But this is asinine because we don’t have universal testing so we don’t know who is carrying the virus and because people travel with it.Unlike Trump the fabulist, Cuomo the realist doesn’t shoot from the hip. Trump, who is always alert to great performances by people who look perfectly cast, is well aware of the potency of Cuomo’s briefings. He veers between acting like Cuomo is ungrateful and should “do more” and acting like they are working together very well, depending on how thankful the governor seems for the president’s efforts.It was clear that Trump did not appreciate Cuomo pushing aggressively and publicly for the president to utilise the Defense Production Act so that New York could get 30,000 ventilators. On Thursday night Trump told Sean Hannity that he had “a feeling that a lot of the numbers that are being said in some areas are just bigger than they’re going to be. I don’t believe you need 40,000 or 30,000 ventilators.”But then he added, “I’m getting along very well with Governor Cuomo.”On Friday, the governor hit back. “Well, look, I don’t have a crystal ball,” he said. “Everybody’s entitled to their own opinion. But I don’t operate here on opinion. I operate on facts and on data and on numbers and on projections.”He implicitly mocked Trump’s tendency to rely on his feelings rather than data. “I hope some natural weather change happens overnight and kills the virus globally,” he said. “That’s what I hope. But that’s my hope. That’s my emotion. That’s my thought.”Primal differencesThe back-to-back daily press conferences of the governor and the president showcase some primal differences about how they see the role of government and the identity of the country. Cuomo thinks what defines the US is its humanity and its welcome mat for the globe. Trump’s view seems to be the economy über alles, even if we have to leave some stragglers on the field.After risibly saying he never does anything rash, Trump insisted: “But the country wants to get back to work, our country was built to get back to work. We don’t have a country where they say, ‘Hey, let’s close it down for two years.’ ”He seems to be following the George W Bush playbook from Hurricane Katrina: instead of going all in to save lives, he shrugs and says it’s the states’ responsibility: we’re at war with nature the enemy is overwhelming us, but it’s really the local government that’s in charge, not the feds.“We’re not a shipping clerk,” Trump said, when that’s exactly what the federal government should be when nurses are on TV all day begging for face masks.Unlike Trump, who tries to blame Obama when he’s the one who diluted the pandemic response force, and literally says, “I don’t take responsibility at all”, Cuomo regularly says “Blame me” if anything goes wrong.When I covered governor Mario Cuomo, he expressed his disdain for a political Darwinism that was overshadowing the nation’s religious principles. Once, in an interview in his office in 1991, he got down a copy of Teilhard de Chardin from the bookcase and gave it to me, wanting to make sure I absorbed the lessons of the Jesuit scientist and theologian who wrote: “Accept the burgeoning plant of humanity, and tend it, since without your sun, it will disperse itself wildly and die away.”He worried that government had strayed too far away from Franklin Roosevelt, another governor of New York who felt a strong economy and compassion for the poor went hand in hand. He worried that the US was spending “more money for bombs, less for babies”, as he said in the sonorous baritone that his son inherited. “More help for the rich, more poor than ever.”With President Trump on a Darwinian tear, I ask Andrew Cuomo how this crisis will change the way people look at government and how it will affect the 2020 election.He says that, in this era where personalities and celebrities rule politics, the pandemic “changes the lens on government, and you’re going to now inquire about experience and capacity and your past performance, almost like the normal hiring process. We got to a place in government where credentials didn’t matter and performance didn’t matter.”This, he said, would never happen “if you were interviewing a lawyer or a doctor or a nanny”.I ask the governor if all this has revived his dreams of a presidential run. After a long pause, he answers: “No. I know presidential politics. I was there in the White House with Clinton. I was there with Gore. No, I’m at peace with who I am and what I’m doing.”Loyal to BidenHis friends say that he will be loyal to Joe Biden. But if Trump is re-elected, they speculate, Cuomo could jump in in 2024, following his 2022 fourth-term re-election in New York. Or if Biden is elected and steps down after one term, Cuomo might get in. But that would mean he’d be up against whichever woman Biden chooses as his vice-president.“He’ll get criticised with the same BS about ‘ambition’ for going against ‘the woman candidate’, much in the same way he did going against Carl McCall in New York, but so what?” said one Cuomo ally, referring to his unsuccessful campaign for governor in 2002. “It’s hardly a clean, wholesome game. And some day soon, don’t we really need to return to what leadership actually is, as opposed to symbolism?”Cuomo has been through valleys: his orce amid a cheating scandal his father’s political disappointments his own. He talks about character so much that he can sound like a televangelist at times.“You can tell the strong from the weak, the selfish from the gracious,” he tells me. “I mean, these nurses who are willing to go take blood at these drive-through centres? What courageous, beautiful people. I have other people who won’t show up for work. I have legislators who say, ‘Well, we’re not coming to the capital.’ ”Before the governor gets back to his horrific night shift and a dawn wake-up call, I ask him how this Armageddon, which we know will last for months and months, will affect our identity.“We’ll have a different country – better or worse, I don’t know,” Cuomo says. “It will have a different personality. It will be more fearful. Less trusting. But maybe there will be a greater need for intimacy.”Mario Cuomo was known as Hamlet on the Hudson. He analysed his worthiness so much, he left the field to the privileged, pampered preppies who never analysed their worthiness – George HW Bush and Dan Quayle.When Mario was doing a Socratic striptease about whether to challenge Bill Clinton for the presidency in 1991, one woman got so impatient with his dithering, she mailed him a needlepoint pillow with the message “Carpe Diem”.Now Andrew Cuomo is trying to wrest the life-saving materials he needs from another privileged, pampered guy in the White House who never worries about his worthiness. But this Cuomo doesn’t need a pillow. Carpe diem is in his bones. – New York TimesEverything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our Morning Briefing and Lunchtime Latest newsletters"},{"url":null,"title":"matt cartoons march 2020","story":"Sign up for our exclusive, subscriber-only Matt newsletter - and get an unseen Matt  each week. www.telegraphmatt-nlOrder The Best of Matt 2019 by visiting books.telegraph or call 0844 871 1514.  ​To order a fine art print, signed or unsigned of this, or any Matt cartoon, go to https:telegraph.newsprints or call 0191 603 0178Coronavirus latest news: Grim milestone as New York\u0026#39s death toll passes 1,000How coronavirus could affect the US election: Mail or electronic voting might spare postponementDonald Trump extends social-distancing guidelines with US deaths expected to peak in two weeksHow can I join the NHS coronavirus volunteer army, and what would I do?How does a coronavirus home test kit work, and how do I get one?When will coronavirus peak in the UK?  How long will the UK coronavirus lockdown last?

Not even the country’s most senior health officials can say with certainty the trajectory of the US outbreak, but that has not stopped politicians speculating. Steny Hoyer, the second most senior Democrat in the House of Representatives, said: If it comes to it, and we still have the virus ... and best practices is being away from one another, disaggregated, then I think we ought to go to an election by mail.He added: “I think it\u0027s very, very important for the American people to be able to select as a commander-in-chief, particularly at the time when we have great challenges in our country, the person of their choice. So I would be opposed to delaying the November election.”The suggestion is not without controversy. The impact on voter turnout and whether it would favour some demographics over others is unknown and untested. Richard Blumenthal, the Democratic senator from Connecticut, has suggested more absentee or remote voting could be used to make sure voting happens safely. He has also talked about rethinking “how we can allocate space and distribute people so they’re not standing next to each other in polling places.” Mr Blumenthal said: We’re the United States of America. Democracies can conquer these kinds of logistical challenges. We should plan to have our election in November.”Sherrod Brown, the Democratic senator from Ohio, has been among those who has raised the possibility of Mr Trump trying to push back the date for the presidential election. He made the remark when discussing Ohio’s decision to delay its vote due earlier this month in the Democratic presidential nomination race over coronavirus concerns. Mr Brown said his “concern” was that “the president might ask for a delay in the November election based on something, perhaps this, perhaps something else”. However there is no evidence that Mr Trump would consider such a radical step. In fact he has recently talked about the importance of keeping polls open in tough times. Pressed on whether states should push back primaries in the Democratic race at a recent White House press briefing, Mr Trump demurred, declining to back the move. More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"english foxhounds help revive historic hunt pakistan","story":"The note of a hunting horn drifts over farmland as a small pack of English foxhounds bay and run through the brush.Encouraged by shouts from a young huntsman, the hounds plunge through woodland and riverside reed beds as riders try to keep up.While the scene could be typically English, it is instead 4,000 miles away in Attock in rural Pakistan and the quarry is not foxes, but local jackals.The dogs have been transported from the UK in an ambitious attempt to bring back foxhounds to Pakistan and revive the traditions and community of a celebrated old hunt.The scheme is the vision of Faiysal Alikhan, a Pakistani businessman and landowner who fell in love with English hunt life while studying at Oxford.He now hopes to resurrect the old Peshawar Vale Hunt (PVH) as a way to bolster Pakistan\u0027s own old hunting traditions and promote the community spirit of hunt life.“What it really is about is the essence of that countryside community and spirit,” he said.“For us it\u0027s seldom really been about the quarry, or the hunting part, its really a bit more about the opportunity to organise, have that inter-generational aspect, which we feel is really important.”Pakistan has rich, centuries-old traditions of both equestrian sport and hunting with dogs from horseback, though local dogs track jackals, hares and wild boar by sight, rather than scent. Yet as in Britain, the traditions face the challenges of a growing proportion of the population cut off from countryside life and a younger generation losing interest.“We are losing a lot of sense of the ethos about what countryside life is about and there\u0027s a lot of misconception here in the cities of countryside culture, of why we have these things and what they contribute,” Mr Alikhan said.Mr Alikhan was already a devotee of Pakistan\u0027s equestrian sports before he studied at Pembroke College, but became attracted to the community around English hunt life while living with his family in rural Oxfordshire.“As a foreign student, seldom do you get the chance to experience the countryside, or the breadth of people, he said. It just got me thinking, because I was involved here with traditional countryside sport and things of that nature.”At the same time, he also became aware of the story of the PVH. During the nineteenth century, British Army officers used to bring packs of foxhounds with them to India, when they used hunting for sport and training. The PVH was founded in what is now northwest Pakistan in 1870, when several regimental and private packs merged. It quickly became the  most famous hunt in India. The hunt kept its ties to Pakistan\u0027s military and continued to thrive after the British left in 1947.“Although it did have its origins in the British period, it was the Pakistani equestrian, polo-playing lot that carried it forward,” said Mr Alikhan.By the 1970s it faded out though, as the pressures of land reform and the strain of the conflict with India proved too much.Deciding to set up a pack of foxhounds in Pakistan under the banner of the PVH, Mr Alikhan went around hunts in England to see if they would donate dogs. Hunts were sceptical at first, but the Duke of Beaufort\u0027s hunt and Berkeley hunt eventually agreed on the condition an English huntsman stayed with the project in its early years to ensure the dogs were well cared for. Seven hounds were shipped to Pakistan in January 2019.Currently minding the hounds and helping set up the pack is Frederick Thackray, a 19-year-old from Hampshire who learnt his hunting trade with beagles at Radley. While his friends are spending gap years on the beaches of Australia or southeast Asia, Mr Thackray is sleeping in a kennel in rural Pakistan.The sight of his pack has been met with curiosity by nearby villagers.“One day we went hunting, it was just the three of us, and we finished the day with about 40 locals following us around. They were just rural people and hunting was in their blood,” he told the  last week.A breeding programme has so far produced three pups and more hounds are set to be imported. The dogs have had to adjust to a much hotter and drier environment, as well as new food and wildlife.“They had no idea about the smells in the beginning at all about what they were doing,” said Mr Alikhan. “We have civets here, we have foxes, jackals, we have porcupines, so that was a challenge.”A famed landowner and champion of traditional Pakistani equestrian sport, Malik Ata Muhammad Khan became the new hunt\u0027s patron. After his death in February, his nephew has taken up the task.Malik Muhammad Arslan said: “During the hunting season these dogs have been a great support while hunting. My uncle was very fond of these hounds in particular.”The ambition is to set up a pack of 20 to 30 hounds and eventually hunt two days a week, said Mr Thackray.More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"have diabetes lung condition conquered coronavirus","story":"Last Tuesday, I spent my birthday recovering from coronavirus. I’m a type 1 diabetic and I have a condition called A1AT that affects my lungs and liver.I started feeling tired just over two weeks ago but I thought that was just from the pressures of teaching. But then I felt freezing and the next day I developed a cough so I was advised by work to isolate for 14 days.By Wednesday, NHS 111 strongly suspected that I had the virus.I struggled to breathe and felt constantly dizzy – I felt like I was about to pass out. But I tried to keep calm, drink plenty of water and keep as busy as I could.By Friday I think I’m feeling better. I’m not coughing as much, my breathing is steadier and my fever isn\u0027t as erratic... oh how wrong I am!Friday afternoon and I’m sweating. The first sign that I’m not over this. Then – bam! I flop on the couch. Black out. Vomiting. Coughing fit. Stop breathing for a second.Over the next few hours I fluctuate quite rapidly between feeling better to feeling horrendous. By the end of the day I’ve been sick four times and I’ve had multiple dizziness or black out episodes.At this point I’m unsure whether to go to hospital. I feel as though I’ll be wasting valuable resources and I may be an infection risk to vulnerable patients.Through all this I have to somehow continue working, sending work in for the kids I teach, planning lessons. If you are unwell you shouldn\u0027t even work from home. It took me approximately 10 hours to complete one lesson and the work to go with it.At 7pm on Saturday night I ring NHS 111 again. I’m in a really bad way. We wait nine hours for an ambulance to arrive and face-to-face assess me.At 2am I get my third call-back. I feel like the person on the phone is trying to convince me to cancel the ambulance. My boyfriend speaks to them because I am so breathless. They tell me it will be a long wait and do I really want the ambulance? I do.The fourth call comes at 4am and the woman admits that the ambulance is hours away and it\u0027s best to make my own way to hospital. But she can\u0027t offer a taxi via the NHS because that risks others, so do we have a car? Luckily, I\u0027d just bought one in January and my boyfriend is on the insurance. At 5am we pack my bag and head to the Royal Free Hospital.On Sunday, I test positive for coronavirus.I was severely dehydrated so was ordered fluids, and then sent back home.By day seven of the virus I felt better and the symptoms started to lessen. My birthday was ruined though – I couldn\u0027t blow out candles!It\u0027s not pleasant but I have a lung condition as well as diabetes and I conquered the virus.More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"hbos banker wins 11k payout offices fluorescent lights caused","story":"A HBOS banker who suffers from light sensitivity has been awarded £11,000 compensation after being forced to work in a office with fluorescent lights for almost 11 months.An employment tribunal upheld Rajni Duggal\u0027s claim after it found bosses at the Fenchurch Street branch in London made her work under bright lights, which caused her to suffer migraines, dizziness, dry eyes and pain behind her eyes.Ms Duggal, who was diagnosed with light sensitivity 2009, joined HBOS in March 2008 and had her own office at the Mayfair branch in London.She began to suffer symptoms in 2013 after bright spotlights were put in the ceilings and walls to highlight posters.After she complained to managers, blinds were put on the glass door to block light, one of the lights in her office was removed and others were also adjusted so they faced upwards.In 2016 the lights were replaced with lower voltage bulbs and a white wall was painted dark blue. When the branch closed she was transferred to another in Fenchurch Street, London, because bosses claimed it was more dimly lit - but her office had two fluorescent lights. In February 2019, she complained ahead of her starting work a month later  - but no adjustments were made aside from providing her with a lamp. She was exposed to fluorescent lights, particularly the stairway, toilet and back-office and needed wore a headscarf and dark glasses to protect her eyes.Then the lamp was removed after it was tested and judged to be unsafe for customers.  She described siting in the dark for two months, with the only light coming into her office from the banking hall.The lights were then replaced with large square light panels - but Ms Duggal claimed they were also too bright.Almost 11 months after Ms Duggal first complained, LED spotlights and a dimmer switch were installed and the banking hall lights were also blocked out - changes she thought were suitable.Tribunal judge David Khan said: This was an excessive and wholly unreasonable delay and at odds with the best practice guidance which provided that implementation of workplace adjustments would take between five to 30 days.More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2020/03/27/TELEMMGLPICT000228614307_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfyf2A9a6I9YchsjMeADBa08.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"herd immunity way impasse","story":"Sweden has taken the herd immunity approach to dealing with Covid-19Just over two weeks ago Patrick Vallance told the Today programme that the government’s strategy for fighting the Covid-19 outbreak was built around herd immunity. This is a tried and tested method for managing outbreaks of infectious disease: once a sufficiently large proportion of the population has some form of immunity, acquired either through vaccination or surviving a disease, it becomes impossible for it to spread. Herd immunity worked for smallpox and it worked for measles - or at least it did until the anti-vaxxers decided that they would exercise their freedom of choice by refusing to immunise themselves or their children.The problem with herd immunity acquired through infection is that it comes at a price: namely that, in this first epidemic (and be in no doubt that this is not the only outbreak of Covid-19 that we will endure), the disease runs riot and the mortality is substantial. A large number of at-risk people will die while the rest of the population is acquiring immunity. This is likely why, once the reality of what herd immunity implies had started to dawn on the population at large, we have heard no more about it.The alternative strategy is to do what China and, to a lesser extent, Israel have done. In China the state knows where you are, or more specifically, where your mobile phone is at any given time. It can prevent you attending subversive events, it can tell whether you really are off sick or have just decided to spend a lazy day in bed. It can tell immediately if you have decided to breach the curfew, send a drone to tell you off and deliver an on-the-spot fine.In 1948, the government of Israel declared a state of emergency to enable it to manage the war that followed the founding of the nation that state of emergency has been in place ever since. History has shown repeatedly that liberties surrendered, however noble the cause, may be a long time returning.So there is both a medical and a philosophical reason why the authoritarian approach is not necessarily the answer.Medically, fighting an epidemic by suppressing it through draconian restrictions of liberty achieves the opposite of herd immunity. It ensures that the majority of survivors have no immunity and so are at just as much risk next time around. Of course, the advocates of this approach are banking on the development of vaccines and other therapies for the management of the next epidemic. But a usable vaccine will almost certainly not be available by the time this disease comes back for an encore. Novel treatments based on anti-malarial drugs and antibiotics will also need to be evaluated in proper clinical trials. So, we will have to do the same again next time with the attendant risks to the economy and the fabric of society.The philosophical question therefore is, in fighting this disease, what kind of society and economy do we want to leave to our children and grandchildren? To what extent are we prepared to throw the baby out with the bathwater?Much has been written and said about how this is the greatest emergency facing our nation – indeed, the world – since the Second World War. Then, more than 30 million people died fighting fascist ideology. There are few who question the justness of that struggle.For centuries we have found no difficulty in asking young men and women to put their lives at risk in defence of our democracy, to say nothing of asking them to do so in pursuit of some often questionable economic and colonial aims. The difference this time is that it would be those of us in the last third of our lives being asked to bear the greatest risk as opposed to those who should still have decades of life ahead of them.I strongly suspect that herd immunity has not disappeared from the agenda of the Cobra committee. I certainly hope that is the case because, when our children and grandchildren emerge blinking into the post-apocalyptic dawn I, for one, hope that the society into which they emerge is broadly-speaking the same as the one in which I have lived my life – not one that resembles the People’s Republic of China.The  values your comments but kindly requests all posts are on topic, constructive and respectful.

Also, please don\u0027t park across a resident\u0027s driveway unless you have their permission.”Newham Council, also in London, confirmed it would only penalise drivers who park in “an obstructive or dangerous way only” in a relaxing of its restrictions.While Kensington and Chelsea and Caerphilly councils added it will no longer be taking enforcement action against residents whose parking permits have expired.The  understands the measures were introduced by councils across the country as part of a widespread move to relax restrictions, and in some cases suspend fixed penalties.According to guidance seen by this newspaper, enforcement action has been generally scaled back in favour of common sense judgments when dealing with resident permits.Councils may adopt varying approaches over the issue depending on current pressures affecting its workforce and rules put in place before the coronavirus outbreak.And some enforcement will remain for safety reasons, such as councils keeping access clear to hospitals and food depots.In Cornwall, the council announced it would suspend car parking charges across the county until the end of April.The authority said it would reevaluate the situation on a monthly basis, with a spokesman declaring now was not the time for anyone to worry about parking charges.Cllr Geoff Brown, from the council, added: We need residents to stay at home and stay safe.“We also want to make it as easy as possible for essential workers to get to and from work and removing parking charges is one way in which we can support them during this critical time.“It is really important, however, that people always remember to park considerately and continue to follow government guidance about avoiding any unnecessary travel.”In Guildford, city centre car parks have been designated as free to use, with refunds on offer for anyone who has applied for a parking permit.The relaxation of parking restriction comes after charges were axed at hospitals following an outcry that doctors and nurses would have to pay to fight coronavirus.Schemes have been introduced to suspend parking charges for health workers, social care workers and NHS volunteers for on-street parking and pay-and-display car parks as they go about their work.Health secretary Matt Hancock confirmed last week that central government would provide immediate financial backing for NHS Trusts to cover the cost of NHS staff’s parking “for the duration of Covid-19”.Mr Hancock said: \u0027Our NHS is facing an unprecedented challenge, and I will do everything I can to ensure our dedicated staff have whatever they need during this unprecedented time.“So we will provide free car parking for our NHS staff who are going above and beyond every day in hospitals across England.“My enormous gratitude goes out to the many NHS Trusts and other organisations already providing free car parking and I urge other Trusts to do the same with our backing.”The National Car Parking Group also confirmed it will provide NHS staff free parking at all 150 of their car parks in England.More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue

it would be packed with pilgrims and tourists traipsing around the tomb revered as the place of Jesus Christ’s resurrection.But in the age of coronavirus, what mostly greets visitors to Jerusalem’s Church of the Holy Sepulchre is stony silence.A month ago, even as reports swirled of the extreme contagiousness of the disease, people were lining up to kiss the famous marble slab where the body of Jesus is said to have been laid.Now, the Stone of Anointment has been disinfected and, before the church was abruptly closed on Tuesday, visitors were being sternly urged to “avoid any act of devotion” that would contaminate it again.“The church is open, but no one is coming to the church,” Wajeeh Nuseibeh, the custodian whose family has unlocked the church doors every morning since the seventh century, told the  shortly before the closure. A similar story is unfolding across all major holy sites of Christianity, Islam and Judaism, as the inexorable spread of coronavirus hints at profound changes to worship that may linger long after the disease has been contained.Bethlehem and Nazareth have been transformed into ghost towns following an outbreak of Covid-19 that is believed to have come from American tourists.At the Western Wall, where Jews have prayed for centuries, yellow tape on the ground now marks out worship spaces where no more than ten people are allowed to gather.And beyond the wall, Islam’s 11th century Al-Aqsa mosque has closed its doors to the public, with prayers on hold until further notice.The shuttering of religious sites means that millions are now looking to other forms of spiritual nourishment as they are urged to stay away from places of worship. With mosques, churches and synagogues standing empty, some religious leaders are even recording their services and publishing them on social media websites.Meanwhile, a few religious sites can be brought to pilgrims\u0027 living rooms via virtual reality simulations. The Tower of David Museum, for instance, is offering free virtual tours of the Holy City on its website during the Passover and Easter period.   “It was not an easy decision, but for the sake of not spreading the virus, we said, let’s close the churches,” said Reverend Ashraf Tannous, a pastor at the Lutheran church in Beit Sahour, a town in the West Bank near Bethlehem.“Now the priests and pastors are using WhatsApp to stay connected with the congregation and we are broadcasting the services.“But this is not at all an easy thing for me, I am going crazy not being able to see people face to face and visit older people for Holy Communion.”Anna Koulouris, a spokesperson for the Greek Orthodox Church of Jerusalem, said it was also looking into new approaches to worship, such as live broadcasts of ceremonies via video conference app Zoom.“While the movement of iniduals is restricted due to the pandemic, we are exploring alternative ways in which the members of the church can maintain their bonds of faith, prayer and fellowship,” she said.“We are praying for a swift resolution to this devastating circumstance, as well as for those who are suffering and those who have died.”As a recent BBC documentary illustrated, some are also turning to religious apps which allow them to pray or study holy texts without having to set foot in a mosque or synagogue.But in a handful of cases, the virus is exposing isions between governments and the ultra-religious.In Iran, fervent believers have been threatened with prison if they continue to lick religious shrines as part of a misguided attempt to show that faith could protect them from falling ill.The Moroccan army has been deployed to Tangiers and Fez after groups of Muslims defied orders to stay away from mosques, and instead prayed and protested in the streets.There are also reports emerging from Turkey of imams urging worshipers to leave the mosque following a government-imposed ban on mass prayers.  And in Israel,  Jewish religious leaders have urged members of the ultra-orthodox community to stop ignoring government advice on limiting prayer sessions to fewer than ten people.Betzalel Cohen, a 45-year-old Rabbi, said he is concerned that the coronavirus could linger in Israel longer than other countries unless the advice is followed.“I myself stay at home with my children, but most of the people, even the grown up ones, are incapable of staying home and they go to pray, they don’t take enough care, he said. “This won’t end if we don’t respect the social distance.”However, Yulish Kroise, a Rabbi from the extremely conservative Mea Shearim district, is unperturbed by the virus and says his community has pressed on with prayer sessions of more than 10 people, in breach of Israeli emergency rules.  “We don\u0027t squeeze 50 people in a room, but we have 10 to 15 people in each room,” he said, adding that in children’s prayer sessions up to 50 were being squeezed into a room.With Easter and Passover fast approaching, there are few signs that life get back to normal in time, with Israel this week imposing yet more tough rules on social distancing that will close all non-essential shops.

There is no shortage of food, just an excess of demand as people stock up. So far, at least.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesWhen it comes to making sure everyone is fed, the front line of the fight is not in the pasta aisle at Tesco as shoppers scrap it out for the last pack of fusilli, but in fields up and down the country.British farmers warned this week of a coronavirus-induced labour shortage that could see millions of tonnes of strawberries, cabbages, apples, cauliflower lettuce and more rotting in the fields.‘Green lanes’ could ease shortages of fruit and veg to European shopsFor many years, the bounty of Britain\u0027s agricultural land has been picked and packed mostly by Eastern European hands. Work that years ago used to be the preserve of students making some extra money over the summer is now almost exclusively done by migrant labour.Some of those seasonal workers, mostly from Bulgaria, Romania, a few from Lithuania, are already in the UK but restrictions to stop the spread of Covid-19 mean there is a shortage of about 50,000 seasonal workers, presenting a serious problem for farmers.To plug the gap they have joined forces and launched a nationwide recruitment drive, calling on Britons to Feed the Nation by taking up seasonal roles in the fields. It\u0027s hoped that those who may have lost their jobs as a result of the crisis - chefs, retail assistants, waiters and others - will seize an opportunity for a very different kind of work.So acute is the need that the government is reportedly readying its own Pick for Britain campaign taking inspiration from the Land Army that tilled the fields during the Second World War.\u0026nbspMost places are OK for labour at this point, but in six weeks we\u0027ll be picking, says James Porter, whose family owns East Scryne Farm, a soft fruit farm near Carnoustie, home of the storied golf course on Scotland\u0027s east cost.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailWith a picking season that starts in early May, soft fruit farmers are at the sharp end of a potential coronavirus labour shortage.Most of East Scryne\u0027s pickers would normally arrive at the end of April to start picking raspberries, blueberries, blackberries and strawberries - the fruit that\u0027s often seen as the quintessential symbol of British summer.\u0026nbspGovernment adviser under fire for saying UK farming sector not neededBrexit is an chance to showcase Britain’s farmingStrawberry, white chocolate and pistachio choux bunsFood banks in crisis as coronvirus panic buying leaves families hungryHeartbreaking photo of elderly man by empty supermarket shelvesWe\u0027re concerned that we won\u0027t be able to bring those people over and we have to look at alternatives, says Porter.The farmers\u0027 call to arms needs to be answered soon if we are to avoid a supply shortage that would trigger higher prices. If things drag on, the apple harvest could suffer as could vegetables like cauliflower, broccoli, celery and cabbage.That would mean more imports of fresh fruit and vegetables. But other countries are experiencing their own problems. In Kenya, a major supplier of Europe\u0027s green beans and peas, Reuters reports that half of workers involved in growing and exporting have been sent home as flights are grounded and prices for freight rise.Spain is Europe\u0027s largest exporter of fruit and vegetables and a big supplier to the UK. But it too relies on thousands of migrant workers, many of them from Morocco, who have also been stranded at home due to Covid-19 travel restrictions.It\u0027s fair to say that British workers have turned their noses up at seasonal farm work in recent years, perhaps partly due to the availability of other, more secure jobs in more comfortable surroundings.It\u0027s hard work and the Eastern Europeans are experienced at what they do, says Oliver Shooter, owner of AE Lenton, which runs a group of farms between Skegness and Boston in Lincolnshire, the centre of England\u0027s vegetable production.It\u0027s not rocket science but it is quite a skilled job that these guys do, he says. A top picker needs to know and apply supermarkets\u0027 exacting standards for exactly how fruit and veg must look, as well as how to cut it and pack it. For that they\u0027ll earn £12 an hour if they\u0027re good. Many farms also provide free or subsidised accommodation.The process is more high-tech than most would probably imagine, says Beverly Dixon, group HR director at G\u0027s, a network of large farms growing salad vegetables across East Anglia.We harvest our products in rigs, little mobile factories that go out into the field. They cut the veg at the front of the machine, it travels along a conveyor belt, gets trimmed, wrapped, boxed and put onto pallets all in one go, ready to be transported.Each rig is manned by a team of 16 who work as a family unit and will be kept apart from others as part of social distancing measures the farm is introducing.G\u0027s is looking for 700 seasonal staff, many of them pickers, but also jobs in packhouses and processing operations, team leaders, quality checkers, tractor drivers, bus drivers, forklift operators, some administrators and a handful of engineers.Bardsley, one of Britain\u0027s biggest apple producers, with an 850-hectare estate in Kent, says that in just a few days since the recruitment campaign launched the response has been overwhelming.Come July, when Bardsley starts harvesting 90 million apples - mostly Royal Gala, Braeburn, Cox\u0027s and the farm\u0027s prize-winning Bramleys - it will need some 500 extra workers. We\u0027ve put out the message on our social media saying \u0027come and join us\u0027, particularly to those people who unfortunately may be out of work at the moment. We are not slowing down, says marketing director Georgia Bardsley.We\u0027ve had such a erse range of people getting in touch. Among them are many who had until recently been working the hospitality sector that\u0027s been hit so hard by the coronavirus, including one head chef.Hopefully it gives people who have been affected a bit of hope, says Bardsley.The company\u0027s agricultural technology director, Antony Yousefian, says he\u0027s quietly confident the farm will find the people it needs. He also sees another potential positive to the situation.We\u0027ve seen a big change in consumers wanting to connect with what they eat in the last few years, he says. What a great opportunity for people to do that.I think, longer term, students will come back to doing this as a summer job.More and more of our jobs are higher skilled. We\u0027re hiring software engineers now, we\u0027ve got data analysts. So if you are a graduate, what a way to get into a farming business and apply yourself. In the day earn a bit of money and in the evening you might do some data analysis.Yousefian is currently building a digital map of the orchard to help the farm managers make better decisions by giving them real-time data on things like the climate, soil health and how much fruit is on the trees.The whole industry is changing. It\u0027s not a job that you turn your nose up at anymore.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

But those are the headlines the difference lies in the details.The dirty truth about washing your handsWhat is the difference between Covid-19 and the common cold and flu?Can face masks really protect you against coronavirus or flu?The UK government’s four stages of fighting coronavirus explainedWhat are symptoms of coronavirus – and where has it spread?Employees (and employers) will have to wait until the end of April to get their money. For the self-employed, there’s no prospect of the cash coming in until “the beginning of June”.That’s a yawning gap of time for someone to go without income.Why the longer wait? Because the Treasury will have to establish an entirely new scheme to process claims from the self-employed.Officials will have to look at three years of declared self-employment tax returns so they can decide what the appropriate replacement income is for that worker, based on their average earnings.What of those who have only filed returns for one year or two? Officials will, apparently, use their discretion to decide on the right amount of compensation.And those who haven’t yet filed any tax returns at all?The chancellor made it clear they will, unfortunately, have to fall back on the welfare system, albeit one that has been made more generous in recent weeks. For some, that will mean a serious drop in income.And those self-employed who need cash now? They can try to access small-business loans.

Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailThat said,\u0026nbspthis represents a substantial support package for the one million or so self-employed workers likely to be hit especially hard by the economic lockdown.In some respects it’s more generous than the employee scheme because those self-employed who don’t actually see their incomes fall in this crisis will still be eligible for the payments.That’s an inefficiency the Treasury has clearly decided to swallow. And they’ve swallowed a lot of late.It seems that Rishi Sunak wasn’t planning to do anything initially for the self-employed beyond boosting the benefits system.This was never tenable given the fact that this group of workers has grown so rapidly as a share of the workforce in recent years and that they are, on average, less well off than employees.In the past, many would actually have been regular employees but for the perverse incentives of the tax system and cost-cutting employers.Government support for low and middle-income employees but not the low and middle-income self-employed would have been manifestly unjust.The government has – rightly – come a long way in a short time on this.However, with joblessness already rising fast and businesses struggling with the support schemes already set up, it would be rash to bet against ministers having to go further still in the coming weeks of this crisis.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

It came as workers in key sectors work overtime and cancel holidays during the outbreak.“Whether it is in our hospitals, or our supermarkets, people are working around the clock to help our country deal with the coronavirus pandemic,” said Alok Sharma, the business secretary.\u0026nbspSharing the full story, not just the headlines“Today’s changes will mean these valued employees do not lose out on the annual leave they are entitled to as a result of their efforts, and employers are not penalised.”Under existing rules, full-time workers are entitled to at least 28 days’ holiday including bank holidays each year, equivalent to 5.6 weeks.\u0026nbspHow to help the elderly and vulnerable during the coronavirusHow to feel less anxious about the coronavirusHow to be productive when working from home during coronavirusWhich countries around the world has coronavirus spread to?The dirty truth about washing your handsThe majority of this allowance cannot be carried over so employees lose it if they do not take it. Changes announced on Friday will apply to the Working Time Regulations which apply to most workers, including those employed through an agency and people on zero-hours contracts.Environment secretary George Eustice said: “From our fields to our supermarkets, we are hugely grateful to the many people working around the clock to keep the nation fed.“At this crucial time, relaxing laws on statutory leave will help ensure key workers can continue the important work to keep supplies flowing, but without losing the crucial time off they are entitled to.”He paid tribute to measures taken by the food industry to keep shelves stocked through the crisis. Supermarkets and logistics firms have increased the maximum daily shifts for lorry drivers from 10 hours to 11 hours to help ramp up deliveries after shoppers stripped many supermarkets bare.\u0026nbspThe government’s latest move to support workers comes after a raft of measures including state funding for up to 80 per cent of wages for employees who have no work during the crisis.On Thursday the chancellor extended that support to the self-employed, who can claim 80 per cent of the average of their last three years of profits.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

People are going to be waiting for help, likely until May or June as the bureaucracy to deal with this system is put in place.This risks pushing the self-employed into debt or will discourage them from staying at home even when they need to due to ill health.One of the key justifications for providing government funding for self-employed workers\u0027 earnings was to remove the financial incentive to go into work despite the risk of spreading coronavirus.Joanna Elson, chief executive of the Money Advice Trust, urged the government to introduce a dedicated hardship fund for self-employed people who are struggling while waiting for grants to be made.“Nearly every single call we are taking at our Business Debtline service is from self-employed people affected by the impact of Coronavirus, said Ms Elson.\u0026nbspThe electricians, plumbers and taxi drivers we are hearing from, who cannot work from home, are losing money by the hour – and telling them they can try and access Universal Credit is not enough.Accountants pointed to potential gaps in the new scheme. “The limitations do stand out, said Duncan Swift, president of insolvency and restructuring trade body R3.There are quite a few gaps in the support: for people who have only recently started working for themselves or who pay themselves through idends, there may be no help at all.Payments will be calculated based on each worker\u0027s last three years\u0027 self-assessment tax returns. People with fewer years self-employed will be assessed on the returns that are available.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

We will learn from this and will try not to make the same mistakes in the future.He added: Our intentions were only to seek clarity from the government as to whether we should keep some of our stores open we would never have acted against their advice.The Newcastle United owner said staff at the retail group are working very hard to save our business so that the company can continue trading after the coronavirus pandemic.Frasers Group is still selling goods online with orders processed at the firm\u0027s Shirebrook distribution centre.Next, River Island and Net-A-Porter are among retailers to have stopped selling clothes online amid fears for the safety of warehouse workers.Asos has also come under pressure after allegations that it has not implemented adequate social distancing measures at its South Yorkshire warehouse.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It came as workers in key sectors work overtime and cancel holidays during the outbreak.“Whether it is in our hospitals, or our supermarkets, people are working around the clock to help our country deal with the coronavirus pandemic,” said Alok Sharma, the business secretary.\u0026nbspSharing the full story, not just the headlines“Today’s changes will mean these valued employees do not lose out on the annual leave they are entitled to as a result of their efforts, and employers are not penalised.”Under existing rules, full-time workers are entitled to at least 28 days’ holiday including bank holidays each year, equivalent to 5.6 weeks.\u0026nbspHow to help the elderly and vulnerable during the coronavirusHow to feel less anxious about the coronavirusHow to be productive when working from home during coronavirusWhich countries around the world has coronavirus spread to?The dirty truth about washing your handsThe majority of this allowance cannot be carried over so employees lose it if they do not take it. Changes announced on Friday will apply to the Working Time Regulations which apply to most workers, including those employed through an agency and people on zero-hours contracts.Environment secretary George Eustice said: “From our fields to our supermarkets, we are hugely grateful to the many people working around the clock to keep the nation fed.“At this crucial time, relaxing laws on statutory leave will help ensure key workers can continue the important work to keep supplies flowing, but without losing the crucial time off they are entitled to.”He paid tribute to measures taken by the food industry to keep shelves stocked through the crisis. Supermarkets and logistics firms have increased the maximum daily shifts for lorry drivers from 10 hours to 11 hours to help ramp up deliveries after shoppers stripped many supermarkets bare.\u0026nbspThe government’s latest move to support workers comes after a raft of measures including state funding for up to 80 per cent of wages for employees who have no work during the crisis.On Thursday the chancellor extended that support to the self-employed, who can claim 80 per cent of the average of their last three years of profits.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

People are going to be waiting for help, likely until May or June as the bureaucracy to deal with this system is put in place.This risks pushing the self-employed into debt or will discourage them from staying at home even when they need to due to ill health.One of the key justifications for providing government funding for self-employed workers\u0027 earnings was to remove the financial incentive to go into work despite the risk of spreading coronavirus.Joanna Elson, chief executive of the Money Advice Trust, urged the government to introduce a dedicated hardship fund for self-employed people who are struggling while waiting for grants to be made.“Nearly every single call we are taking at our Business Debtline service is from self-employed people affected by the impact of Coronavirus, said Ms Elson.\u0026nbspThe electricians, plumbers and taxi drivers we are hearing from, who cannot work from home, are losing money by the hour – and telling them they can try and access Universal Credit is not enough.Accountants pointed to potential gaps in the new scheme. “The limitations do stand out, said Duncan Swift, president of insolvency and restructuring trade body R3.There are quite a few gaps in the support: for people who have only recently started working for themselves or who pay themselves through idends, there may be no help at all.Payments will be calculated based on each worker\u0027s last three years\u0027 self-assessment tax returns.

Under the disobliging headline “The Independent: a newspaper killed by the internet”, a piece in one of our competitors commented: “While a cacophony of voices exists online, the loss of a groundbreaking newspaper which was once considered radical and anti-establishment is likely to be keenly felt at a time of political upheaval and discontent.”While not as disobliging as the wreath sent round by another rival to the Indy’s editorial offices to welcome the launch of the first edition in October 1986, this death certificate was also premature – and completely wrong in its reasoning. The Independent is far from absent. The internet, if anything, saved The Independent.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesIt was precisely because of the web’s confused, chaotic conspiracies and discordant\u0026nbspmadnesses that the calm voices, radical attitudes and enduring values of The Independent were needed and indeed welcomed as we grew our online presence. The Independent’​s journalism found a vast new global audience, unimaginable before. We should not have been surprised, but it was heartening.\u0026nbspThe Independent had always been “forced to innovate”, as we always say, but success on this scale – not mere survival – is never preordained. Profitability, and the growth of our reporting teams, have returned after an absence of some decades.\u0026nbspSo far from crawling into some corner to conveniently expire, in the last four years, The Independent, troublemaking as ever, has once again confounded its critics, and has prospered by its presence on the internet.Today, we have an audience of up to a\u0026nbsphundred\u0026nbspmillion readers\u0026nbspeach month, more during the current pandemic, as more and more people turn to a trusted and truly independent source of advice, analysis and reliable information. The Independent\u0026nbspis the UK’s largest quality digital news brand, with\u0026nbspsubscriptions to Independent Premium and The Daily Edition growing.\u0026nbspWe must be getting something right.\u0026nbspBut that pessimistic article of 2016 was right about one thing, though the scale of the political upheavals it mentioned to come were far greater than anyone presaged. In the spring of 2016, after all, Barack Obama was still in the White House and few gave a boorish reality TV star named Donald Trump that much chance of winning the White House. David Cameron was still in Downing Street presiding over a small but stable government. His EU renegotiation and the subsequent Brexit referendum victory were assumed to be little more than formalities, an interlude before\u0026nbspGeorge Osborne took over. Corbynmania was “a thing”. Nigel Farage was in semi-retirement, Boris Johnson was an amusing afterthought, there were no gilets jaunes, the international effort on climate change was still alive, and various potentially deadly pandemics never seemed to actually materialise in Britain. Isis\u0026nbspstill looked invincible and the British royal family seemed boringly immutable. TikTok was what clocks did. There were even some who thought Leicester City wouldn’t win the Premier League.\u0026nbspSince then, as we know, we have experienced some fierce hurricanes, real and metaphorical. This collection of front pages of our Daily Edition from these turbulent years offers some insight into our times – and a reminder of how much the country and, we hope with no immodesty, the world needs the internationalist, liberal, environmentalist values The Independent has always stood for. Our reporting and analysis from the Middle East, for example, by Patrick Cockburn, Robert\u0026nbspFisk,\u0026nbspBel Trew, Borzou Daragahi and more is unsurpassed in its intelligence and prescience. Kim Sengupta’s dispatches from Ukraine to Iran to\u0026nbspZimbabwe have proved once again the worth of independent-minded journalists telling the stories as they see them on the ground. In election after election, vote after vote, leadership crisis after leadership crisis we have tried to make whatever sense we could of politics under Cameron, May, Corbyn and Johnson. We are proud too of our campaigns for a Final Say referendum and for the homeless, as well as our calls for urgent action on the climate emergency. We might also remember, in this strangest of years, the World Cup, Olympic Games and summers of sport in easier, happier times.\u0026nbspThe Independent has been there to report, analyse and comment upon these momentous events just as we always have been since 1986. A\u0026nbsptalented, tireless team of journalists,\u0026nbspthe support of committed owners and – above all – a\u0026nbspgrowing,\u0026nbsp loyal and independently minded readership\u0026nbsphave meant our digital future is at least as bright as our print one ever was.\u0026nbspThank you.\u0026nbspThis article is part of a special edition of the Daily Edition, featuring 50 of The Independent\u0027s most memorable front pages from the past four years.

Interestingly, herbivores such as sauropods and ornithischian dinosaurs are rare.“Many of the predators, including the toothed pterosaurs, preyed on a superabundance of fish.”Professor\u0026nbspMartill said: “We are in a golden age for discovering pterodactyls. This year alone we have discovered three new species and we are only into March.”The new pterosaurs – identified from chunks of jaws and teeth found in the middle cretaceous Kem Kem Beds of Morocco – had wings of three to four metres.The spokesperson\u0026nbspsaid: “These aerial fishers snatched up their prey while on the wing, using a murderous-looking set of large spike-like teeth that formed a highly effective tooth grab.“Large pterosaurs such as these would have been able to forage over vast distances, similar to present-day birds such as condors and albatrosses.”One of the species, anhanguera, was previously only known from Brazil.Another, ornithocheirus, had until now only been found in England and middle Asia.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Ian Colbeck, professor of environmental science at the University of Essex, told The Independent that the reduction in global emissions will most likely be temporary.“Emissions tend to bounce back fairly quickly shortly after a crisis ends,” he said.\u0026nbsp“Expect to see short-term impacts on energy and emissions disappear as governments introduce stimulus packages to increase industrial output at the end of the pandemic. Following the global financial crash in 2008-09, carbon emissions increased by 5 per cent as a result of such stimulus.”No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The Conservative government has pledged to make the UK carbon-free by 2050.“We are spending money on almost every company in the country right now. What we should be doing is saying, ‘You can have this money but you need to be compliant with a zero-carbon future by 2050,’” Professor\u0026nbspSiegert said.According to Professor Siegert, the transition to a low-carbon economy requires trillions of pounds of investment. If it is all spent on managing the coronavirus outbreak, “we will not have the financial muscle to invest in a low-carbon future”, he said.Dr Fatih Birol, executive director of the International Energy Agency (IEA), has also warned that the pandemic could stall global efforts to transition towards clean energy.“We should not allow today’s crisis to compromise our efforts to tackle the world’s inescapable challenge,” he said in a\u0026nbspstatement.Wildflowers move north as Earth’s temperature continues to riseThe IEA has already predicted that global oil demand will sharply decrease in 2020, by 435,000 barrels a day in the first quarter, due to the pandemic.“The sharp decline in the oil market may well undermine clean energy transitions by reducing the impetus for energy efficiency policies,” Dr Birol said.Cheaper energy reduces the appeal of cleaner, more efficient cars, homes and offices, Dr Birol said, calling on governments to reduce subsidies for fossil fuels. Coronavirus is also likely to stall production of clean energy technologies, such as solar panels and wind turbines, while many parts of China are under lockdown.“Governments can use the current situation to step up their climate ambitions and launch sustainable stimulus packages focused on clean energy technologies. Rather than compounding the tragedy by allowing it to hinder clean energy transitions, we need to seize the opportunity to help accelerate them,” Dr Birol said.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

People who previously struggled with universal credit continue to do so. Rough sleepers and sofa surfers continue to live without shelter. Services that once offered support have shuttered to protect workers, while people are burning through their kitchen cupboards faster than usual because they are stuck inside.\u0026nbspIn short, many of those who have needed to use food banks in the past, those who are not among the government’s 1.5 million most at-risk people and will not be able to call on its swelling volunteer service for support, still need help.\u0026nbspThe Independent’s Help The Hungry campaign aims to help give these people the support they need. Click here for ways you can help.And here are five things you might not have considered to help you to support your community’s food bank.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesA common misconception is that food banks exist to offer the bare minimum – but to do so would be to completely undermine what food can give us in our day to day lives. We don’t only eat for sustenance – we do it for pleasure, to access our cultures, to engage in tradition. Food is central to the human experience, and for millennia has been key to how we experience love and affection.How to support our campaignSo ultimately think about what is going to taste good. Of course you can pick up staples that will be warmly received, but you can also donate things that get you excited, and share that excitement with someone else.Take, for example, Easter eggs. They may not be a matter of life or death, but by donating them you can give a parent the chance to treat their child, and a child the ability to engage in a communal tradition they might have been left out of. You are not just handing out subsistence, but a moment of dignity and joy for a family – and all it took was a bit of chocolate.It’s not just foodFood banks have never been just about food. Poverty is about choices – do you buy something to eat, or put money on the meter to keep the electricity running? Do you really need the heating on, or can you hold out? Will you be hungry now, or hungry later?\u0026nbspAt their most fundamental level, food banks are about a community pulling together and trying to resolve those conflicts – so when you think of donating, empathy is key. On one side of the spectrum, this means not just dredging mystery tins from the back of your cupboard – if you didn’t want to eat it over the last two years, chances are no one else will either. On the other, it’s about thinking of the groceries you couldn’t live without – be that food or something else.In the early days of the UK epidemic, among the first things to be stockpiled were hygiene products – sanitary towels, hand wash, toilet roll. If you didn’t have the ability to bulk buy, or the spare funds to travel from shop to shop by car or public transport, you were stuck. Donating bathroom products means people who use the service don’t have to choose between hunger and hygiene.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailThe range of reasons people visit food banks is vast, reflecting many of the social issues seen across the country, from universal credit delays to limited post-prison rehabilitation systems, rising rents and jobs that simply do not pay enough to allow for survival.\u0026nbspBut helping rough sleepers and sofa surfers out represents a unique challenge for food banks – particularly those who do not have access to kitchens and so are less likely to feel the benefit of, say, the bag of dry pasta many would receive. While volunteers will build a parcel that helps as much as possible, you can go a step further by putting together boxes of much-needed items that can be handed straight over as is.\u0026nbspAsk if your local service is interested, then get a few shoeboxes and add things that might prove useful – like socks and underwear, first aid kits, compact waterproofs, or toothbrushes and paste. Once again as much as you are donating a small box of odds and ends, you are also handing over dignity, and the tools people need to look after themselves.\u0026nbspBags of bagsFood banks across the country have had to make drastic changes to how they operate due to the virus – while volunteers may have a few contingency plans up their sleeves to keep services running, readying for a global pandemic was not among them.What has followed has been a herculean effort to organise outright change in a matter of days. Entire delivery systems have been dreamt up out of thin air, while the elderly and at risk who make up much of the volunteer base have been sent home.\u0026nbspFood banks strained as volunteers isolate and demand surgesFood banks have never been more needed, or closer to collapseFood banks in crisis as coronvirus panic buying leaves families hungryFood banks are under threat – the government has to step inUnited and City make joint food bank donation to fight coronavirusOperations have also been streamlined to feed as many people as possible, as hygienically as can be achieved. And as every service user’s food is bagged up and handed over, a small mountain of plastic bags are being deployed.So, bizarrely enough, in this time of national crisis, that bag of shopping bags that you and every other UK resident has been keeping in the corner of their kitchen or under their sink for years might finally serve a purpose. After all that time of being stored and neglected after trips to the supermarket, they could be put to use in ensuring social distancing.\u0026nbspAsk your local food bank if they could use them – but if you can go a step further and also feel a little apprehensive about contributing to the impact of plastic on the planet, consider handing over canvas bags instead. There are so many feelings wrapped into asking for help – and when you’ve been let down by the world around you time and time again, one that’s likely to come up is shame.\u0026nbspVolunteers work hard to try to mitigate that – and make the experience about support and community, but it’s easy to feel self-conscious walking away from a food bank and onto the high street with an array of clearly worn and mismatched carrier bags in your hands. A canvas bag, while sturdier, is also more discreet.Possibly the most useful thing you can do for your local food bank is among the easiest – ask what they need. While the Trussell Trust, the nation’s largest food bank charity, helps to set up and support sites, the inidual operation in your region sets its own rules and runs its own show. Others run via other charities or completely independently.\u0026nbspSo check out their tweets to see what they are appealing for, or send them an email to check what they are after, or give them a call and offer up a few hours a week to stack some tins (particularly if you are young, physically fit and don’t mind lugging around crates of produce).\u0026nbspReaching out, at every level, is fundamental to what food banks are. In reaching out you will get the satisfaction that comes from rallying around your community at a time where we’ve perhaps never been more isolated. What the person who comes to ask for food will get, from your contribution combined with others in your area coming together, is help when it’s possible no one else can.Help the hungry\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

We have teamed up with The Felix Project – a start-up charity we helped launch in 2016 – to deliver produce to community hubs in London boroughs.\u0026nbspSharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe Independent is also asking food charities across Britain to contact helpthehungry@ to tell us about your project and help build a directory of ways that our readers can help the hungry in their area – through money, volunteering and food donations. Food banks, which were already struggling to meet the need for emergency food parcels, have seen a huge surge in demand in recent weeks, while at the same time coping with dwindling donations, supermarket rationing systems, and a loss of many volunteers to self-isolation – yet none of the government’s rescue money goes to them.British households have stored more than £1bn worth of goods in their homes in response to the pandemic, creating shortages for food banks as shoppers ignore assurances that supply chains are robust.How to support our campaignJess Phillips, the Labour MP who recently ran for party leader, has backed our campaign, saying: “Nobody should be in the position of not being able to get enough food. In my constituency, London and in places all around the UK the coronavirus pandemic is placing extra stress on a system that was already straining.“We should all do what we can to help food and other essentials get to those that need it. That is why I’m backing the Help the Hungry campaign – please give if you are able.”Pastor Obi Onyeabor, the manager at Barking Foodbank, part of The Trussell Trust’s national network, said his pool of around 50 volunteers has been reduced by a dozen or so people currently self-isolating at home. Yet he and his team have kept their two church hall food banks open, and are now making home deliveries on Tuesdays and Thursdays to make sure the most vulnerable get supplies.“We have been scrambling for the past couple of weeks, doing all that we can – but we’re appealing for more people to come and help,” he said. “Out of fear people have been buying for themselves and their families, but I’ve seen some real generosity too.“I hope that if we can get past the panic buying stage, more people will want to give money, food or some of their time too.”No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailIn London, charities like The Felix Project donate 10 tons of food – or 22,000 meals – to the needy every day. But funding has dropped since the outbreak of Covid-19, limiting their capacity to carry out vital work at a time when it is more important than ever. As part of the London Food Alliance, along with FareShare and City Harvest, The Felix Project will coordinate deliveries in London boroughs in order to distribute surplus food to the elderly, poor and vulnerable. The charities will deliver food to the hubs, where local volunteers will package up parcels and arrange “last-mile” deliveries to the homes of the vulnerable.Sadiq Khan, the mayor of London, has backed our campaign to help in the capital in partnership with our sister title the Evening Standard. He said: “In a city as prosperous as London, everyone should have enough food to feed themselves and their families – but unfortunately the coronavirus outbreak means some Londoners are facing even greater difficulties. It’s commendable these organisations are joining forces to help ensure surplus food isn’t wasted and instead reaches those who need it most. I urge Londoners to support this crucial initiative.”Mark Curtin, CEO of The Felix Project, said: “Our role is to pick up large volumes of nutritious surplus food from the commercial sector and deliver it to community hubs to ensure there is enough food for vulnerable people for as long as this health crisis ensues. We will be working all hours doing our bit – and it would be wonderful if your readers can get behind us so we can do this job for London.”Emma Revie, chief executive of The Trussell Trust, which supports 1,200 food banks, appealed for help from the public to get vital food to people who cannot afford the basics, and to boost volunteer numbers in areas where they are needed.\u0026nbsp“Our main priority as coronavirus unfolds is ensuring the safety of everyone who comes to a food bank – whether it’s someone needing help, someone volunteering their time, or someone making a donation,” said Ms Revie. “Until we are confident that adequate government protection against poverty is in place, food banks provide an essential community service to people unable to afford food. But this should not fall to food banks.\u0026nbsp“Our benefits system could be the life raft people need now. That’s why it’s more important than ever that we end the five-week wait for universal credit. While incredible food bank volunteers continue to help people unable to afford the basics, we would ask our government to take this essential step and end the five-week wait now. It’s five weeks too long.”Sabine Goodwin, coordinator of the Independent Food Aid Network UK, which oversees 834 independent food banks, said the charitable services were “struggling to stay above water” in the current climate and accused the government of so far “failing to act” to prevent an ever-increasing number of people falling into poverty.“Food bank use was rising before the coronavirus outbreak and the impact of job losses can only make matters far worse. But this catastrophe in the making is avoidable,” she said. “We’re calling for an income-based solution to this crisis which would mean that the Herculean efforts by volunteers across the country wouldn’t be needed.“FareShare, the UK’s biggest food redistribution charity, is also calling for more volunteers to help with packing and making van deliveries. The organisation takes food from the food manufacturers that can’t be sold in shops, either because of packaging errors or overproduction, and gets it out to food banks, hospices, homeless hostels and other charities.Commercial director Alyson Walsh estimates around 1,200 people have got in touch over the past week. “We have quite a lot of older volunteers who have had to stay at home, but we are now seeing a wave of interest in new people willing to fill in.”Ms Walsh added: “We know we have the capacity to do more – we have the warehouse\u0026nbspspace and the chillers.

The group includes eight other British citizens and one Irish national.“It’s been very surreal,” Forkan said, as the group reached its 12th day in quarantine. “We were given 24 hours to leave the country when they first announced the lockdown which obviously caused absolute chaos. When we realised we were too far away to get to the airport, we had to beg the hostel we’re now in to let us stay here after they initially refused.” After some tears, the Pariwana agreed and Forkan has been there since.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesForkan said initial measures being enforced by the local police and army weren’t “too bad”. It was on Sunday, when two people staying at the same accommodation tested positive for Covid-19, that rules became sterner.How to help the elderly and vulnerable during the coronavirusHow to feel less anxious about the coronavirusHow to be productive when working from home during coronavirusWhich countries around the world has coronavirus spread to?The dirty truth about washing your hands“We’ve been\u0026nbsptold we can’t leave our rooms for more than one hour a day and if we’re seen trying to escape, we risk being sent to prison for a minimum of five years,” she said. On Wednesday night, a girl was caught trying to jump the hostel’s fence in an attempt to flee to the nearest airport, but was stopped by police and told to return to her room.According to Forkan, those trapped at the hostel have been advised they should expect to be there for “a minimum of a month, possibly three”. There has been no explanation for these time estimations, though, which Forkan said is something she and others have been trying to contact the government and local British Embassy about.Forkan embarked on the backpacking trip with Abi Dennison, an ITU nurse for the NHS, who she is also being quarantined with. Dennison said the most “logical thing for Peruvian officials to do” would be to test all 140 hostel residents and send home the ones who test negative, but pointed out this “won’t be possible in a third world country considering the UK isn’t even able to test everyone”.Dennison, who is usually based in Nottingham, said the most frustrating thing about being stuck abroad is the knowledge that she could be at home, helping people fight the virus in her day job. She said: “Everyone in the hostel was clapping for me yesterday as part of the #ClapForTheNHS movement, but I just feel like a fraud sitting here doing nothing. I want to get home so I can help others, but that won’t happen if we’re stuck here for another three months.”There are an estimated 700 Britons currently trapped all over Peru, struggling to find feasible ways home. Since the South American country, which is a popular backpacking destination, announced it had entered a state of national emergency and shut its borders almost two weeks ago, the British government has been under intense scrutiny to fly all those from the UK home. An online petition campaigning for Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab to ensure their safe return has now reached over 44,800 signatures.Jyoti Madlani, a senior account manager who lives in London, is in the same hostel as Forkan. She also left the UK for South America in February, while on a three-month sabbatical from work.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailWhen The Independent reached out to the Foreign Office, it received the same automated response, quoting Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab:\u0026nbsp“The Foreign Office has chartered three more flights for British travellers in Peru - as well as domestic flights to help those in Cusco. We continue to work around the clock to help British travellers struggling to get back to the UK and thank the Peruvian government for all their support in making this happen.”The local Indian Embassy has\u0026nbspassured its stranded citizens that all accommodation and food would be covered for them, Indian travellers in the hostel have told Madlani.Last week, Kate Green, the Labour MP for Stretford and Urmston, raised the issue of those stuck in Peru to Raab in parliament. He assured Green: “We will look to do everything we can to provide support and advice for those that need it to return them.”\u0026nbsp“It would just be nice to hear a human voice, to know they’re doing all they can and that they care,” Forkan said. “Instead we’ve just had the one programmed response saying the government is aware of what’s going on. Our family and friends said they’ve heard nothing either.”Those stranded and their families\u0026nbsphave created a Twitter account, with the username @ukstuckinperu, to raise awareness of the situation and demand that both the Foreign Office and Peru’s British Embassy take action. The Embassy in particular is facing backlash for closing its doors when the lockdown was announced in Peru. Both its phone number and email, which British nationals like Forkan are being told to contact, are either generating automated responses or ringing out, those stranded say.\u0026nbspKate Harrison, the British Ambassador to Peru, has been bombarded with requests to respond to questions and calls for help made by those stuck in Cusco, Lima, Iquitos, as well as Peru’s second largest city Arequpia where 44 others are stranded. Harrison told The Independent that her “complicated schedule” meant she couldn’t comment on the current situation. The embassy did not reply to request for further comment.\u0026nbspHarrison took to her Twitter account on Wednesday to praise British Airways for flying roughly 200 British nationals home on the first repatriation flight from Lima, and shared a video message on Friday to give an update on what she described as the process of sending home those “who wanted to return to the UK”.The ambassador did not disclose how the hundreds of people trapped in their hostels, unable to leave and make the journey from places like Cusco (a 20-hour coach ride or one-and-a-half-hour plane journey from Lima), can hope to make the journey to Lima and be sent back to London. \u0026nbspPeru’s British Embassy announced on Friday, via its Twitter page, that two additional BA flights had been chartered to “continue helping British nationals get back home”. But Forkan and Dennison said they aren’t hopeful they’ll be on either plane, unless they’re tested and can “hopefully” prove they’re negative and so not at risk of spreading the disease.Meanwhile Madlani, who once worked as a psychological well-being practitioner, said: “It’s only a matter of time before all of this starts taking a massive toll on our physical and mental wellbeing.”“We just want to go home,” Forkan and Dennison said. “And the longer we’re left in this hostel, which is now a breeding ground for the virus, the less likely that is of happening.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

So we’re planning for that, quote unquote, worst case scenario, which the models predict.”Mr Cuomo also postponed the state’s primary election from April until June, to avoid people gathering.\u0026nbspMr Cuomo’s comments same a day after Donald Trump attacked him on Twitter saying that ventilators sent to New York should be deployed immediately.\u0026nbspThe point is, ‘Well they’re in a stockpile, you must not need them’ is just ignorant — of course you don’t need them today!,” Mr Cuomo said on Friday. “You need them when you hit the apex, which is 30,000.

At the same time, if he failed to prepare for the worst he would not be doing his job.The comments underscore what has emerged as a potential major problem as the crisis has played out in the US, and Mr Trump has sought make the inidual states take responsibility for tackling the disease, with the support – but not leadership – of the federal government.Several state governors have condemned this approach, among them Washington governor Jay Inslee who told Mr Trump the governors were looking for a quarterback like “Tom Brady”.On Saturday, Mr Cuomo said the total number of infections in the state had reached more than 52,000 people, and the death toll had reached more than 700.“The government has said they have sent us 4000 ventilators those 4000 ventilators are not currently in use.\u0026nbspWhy? Because we don’t need them,” added Mr Cuomo.\u0026nbsp“What we’re doing is we’re planning for that apex, we’re planning for the critical need, and making sure we have the equipment the staff, the beds, for that critical need.”He said the cost of the machines had increased from $25,000 to $45,000 as other states had sought to buy them.\u0026nbspHe added: “We’re literally bringing up the price ourselves.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

The launches were reported in a statement by South Koreas Joint Chiefs of Staff, which went on to condemn the behaviour at a time when the world continues to battle the coronavirus outbreak.It said: “In a situation where the entire world is experiencing dficulties due to COVID-, this kind of military act by North Korea is very inappropriate and we call for an immediate halt.”The projectiles are thought to have been ballistic missiles.Mayor Bill de Blasio said he has asked the federal government to deliver  more ventilators to city hospitals by Wednesday — otherwise the city will run out of masks, gowns and other hospital supplies in a week.With the expected peak of cases in the city still two to three weeks away, de Blasio said Sunday he asked the US military to aid with new waves of doctors, nurses and other medical personnel to the city.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

And by the looks of things, they’re already flattening that infamous curve. Now, our Government must follow where they’ve led.Yes, we understand that there are global shortages of some types of tests.

Cross-contamination is rampant. The animal cruelty is off the scale.Bears, tigers,  wolf cubs, crocodiles, hedgehogs and turtles are not spared in this notorious wildle food trade, either.Now the despicable wet markets used by some Chinese people — markets already responsible for the Sars outbreak in  — have finally brought the world to its knees.Scientists have established that it is highly likely Covid- was linked to a notorious live animal market in Wuhan.Gene sequencing analysis shows the new coronavirus probably started in bats and was transferred to humans via the scaly anteater the pangolin.So why is there so little outrage about the wet markets that we know have the potential to cause catastrophic outcomes to human health Even Donald Trump — slammed for branding Covid- the “Chinese virus” — avoided criticising the wet markets when prompted during a press conference at the White House on Wednesday.Maybe that’s because the moment someone tries to speak up they are accused of racism.That happened to reality star and retail entrepreneur Luisa Zissman earlier this week when she posted a video on Instagram of a wet market and called for them to be “banned completely”.After the usual social media outrage, she told me: “I wholeheartedly disagree with this particular part of Chinese culture, but that does not make me racist.” It should be remembered there are many campaigners within China desperately trying to get the wet markets banned too.After all, the addition of more exotic animals only dates back to the s, as the ruling communist party struggled to feed the population and million people perished in what became known as the great famine.By , the ironically named Wildle Protection Law encouraged industrial-level breeding of the likes of bears, bats and turtles to be sold through wet markets. And that’s when the viruses began to form.When the Sars crisis was linked to a wet market in southern China, officials shut it down and made wildle farming illegal. But they reversed the decision just a few months later.As of  it was a £billion industry, mainly because the rich and the powerful pay copious quantities of money to eat rare wildle as they believe  claims about their role in Chinese medicine.Now with coronavirus spreading, the government has again temporarily banned wildle trading and shut down wet markets.But it’s not permanent yet — and it must be.We already know that the early Chinese cover-up of Covid-, which makes Chernobyl look like a misdemeanour, resulted in the disease’s rapid spread.In fact,China had taken early action experts reckon the number of coronavirus cases could have been cut by  per cent, making its rampage all over the globe far less likely.The new illness was directly linked to the infamous wildle market in Wuhan on December , but it wasn’t until New Year’s Eve that the World Health Organisation was informed and the site closed.The brave Chinese doctors who tried to spread the word about Covid- were shut down by the authorities too, and early testing was stopped and samples  destroyed.I have no doubt the Chinese government has blood on its hands over coronavirus.And saying that now, at the peak of the health crisis, is not the time to tackle the issue is wrong.We must have this uncomfortable discussion while our anger is raw and the pain  all too real.To follow us on Facebook, simply Like our Coronavirus page.I DON’T have enough superlatives to describe my adoration for Lady Gaga.No pop star of her generation has been more consistently savvy, smart or, for that matter, talented.So it pains me to so deeply disagree with her decision to delay the release of her highly anticipated new album Chromatica, which was due to drop on April , in the middle of quarantine hell.In fact, I actually think the delay is quite selfish.Thanks to the technological advances in streaming, listening to new music is one of the few activities we can engage in collectively without having to leave the house. Gaga wrote that: “It just doesn’t feel right to me to release this album with all that is going on during this global pandemic.”Instead she wants us all to focus on “finding solutions”, such as providing medical equipment and school meals.All very good aims, of course.But what the world also needs now is music, sweet music, to unite us and, frankly, distract us.She’s also made a strategic error, given she had a captive audience with time on their hands at home to stream to their heart’s content.This is the time for the UK to show that, eight decades on, we still have the Blitz spirit in our blood.Many of our parents or grandparents were sent to the front line to fight Hitler.All most of us have to do is put our lives temporarily on hold while scoffing Domino’s pizza and watching Netflix.I don’t for a second underestimate the signicance of such a call, by the way.These are dark days and there is a growing coronavirus-shaped cloud over our daily lives right now, causing extreme stress and anxiety.It’s so easy to feel angry and uncertain and tearful and depressed.Like you, I’ve been through the gamut of emotions while practising social distancing.However, that is simply not an excuse not to try to  carry on with your normal lives.It won’t be for ever. In fact, the sooner we do this properly, the sooner this nightmare will be over.At such a trying time it is imperative we celebrate the brilliant work being done by so many to keep society running.So thank you to the doctors, the nurses, the NHS workers, the first responders, the supermarket staff, the cleaners, the bus drivers, the Tube staff, the delivery drivers, the journalists and anyone  who NEEDS to keep working to keep our society going.They’ll thank the rest of us for doing our part too and staying indoors.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

There isnt even a carton of juice.The mum, who did not want to be named, complained to the primary school in Barking and Dagenham about the food she picked up for her eight-year-old.She said they told her it was government issued and that was it.The mum told The Sun Online: Im really angry becauseI sent my child in with a packed lunch and deemed it unhealthy they would have removed it from the lunch, and this is what theyre giving us.In terms of rationing this is really bad. There are kids out there where this is not going to be enough. And it would be even harderyou had more than one child.Peter Overton, who runs Easton CE Academy in Bristol, handed out  of the inadequate meals to worried parents on Tuesday evening.Each weekly ration included a loaf of bread, with a sell-by date of February , a g portion of baking spread, a small block of cheese, five pieces of fruit, five biscuits or cakes, five packs of crisps and two yoghurts.Chartwells, the schools contractors that are part of Compass Group, provided the meals and a spokesperson has said they are working hard to fed every child while meeting the ying dietary and logistical needs of schools and their students for the issues we faced in providing packed lunches.The Sun Online contacted Ark Academy Alexandra for a comment.Schools across the Britain have been shut since March , and are not expected to reopen until summer at the earliest.This is the first nationwide school shutdown in modern history.Parents have been promised they will get free meals or vouchers for .million children who qualy for school dinners.For children that are in isolation, Spire Junior School in Derbyshire have dedicated team of staff have been put in charge of delivering food over the normal school lunchtime.To follow us on Facebook, simply Like our Coronavirus page.Get Britains best-selling newspaper delivered to your smartphone or tablet each day - find out more.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It is what a government should do, but only when faced with a le-or-death situation. It is not a sane strategy for normal times.What the old dunce cannot grasp is that such gargantuan bailouts will need to be paid back by years of tax rises and further austerity. If he wants credit for the spending, will he also accept responsibility for that future hardship No, we didn’t think so.Corbyn will be remembered as Labour’s worst-ever leader, the architect of their most abject defeat in  years. He drew anti-Semites like flies to dung. He repelled decent Labour MPs and voters.Only leftie cranks and Tories will miss him.IN six weeks as Chancellor, Rishi Sunak has saved an estimated .million jobs and bailed out Britain.

That we’d all wake up and think: “Nah. My job’s not important at all. I’ve been wasting my le really, so I’ll stay in bed.”Everyone thinks their job is important, so everyone went to work, and this meant that in London especially, the public transport system was rammed full of commuters. This made everyone very angry.I don’t want to blame anyone for what’s going on. If you shut a country down overnight there are bound to be issues. It’s no one’s fault.I do, however, have a helpful suggestion for people who really do need to get to work. A suggestion that no one will have considered. It’s a means of transport that’s virus proof.You can’t be infected when you’re inside it and you can’t pass your infection on to anyone . It’s called the “motor car”.For years, successive leaders and politicians have done their best to squeeze it out of society.They’ve lowered the speed limits and raised the taxes and ­introduced congestion charging and even suggested, hilariously, thatyou ­absolutely must have one, it should have an electric motor. Like a milk float.Even the great libertarian Boris ­Johnson — a former motoring correspondent for GQ magazine — has been involved, handing half the road network over to wretched cyclists.Well, now’s the time to stop all that.To follow us on Facebook, simply Like our Coronavirus page.Get Britains best-selling newspaper delivered to your smartphone or tablet each day - find out more.During the Covid- outbreak, when it’s important we keep our distance, all ­parking restrictions should be lted.Cars should be allowed to use both bus and cycle lanes and all traffic cameras should be turned off. I know this flies in the face of what the eco-mentalists say is good for us but buses are petri dishes so park them at the depot.Trains and the Tube are no better, so turn off the power immediately. In the last three months of last year, million people in this country had jobs. And that’s handy because at the last count there were million cars registered for use on the road.This means that everyone can get to their place of work, safely, in a virus-proof cocoon. Strange isn’t it. For years we were told that cars would one day kill us all. But now it’s obvious that actually, they are our knights in shining armour.I only ask because the phone she was using looked like it was from about .Who was she calling  Dial-a-Disc WHILE scrolling through my phone the other day I was interested to read that I could increase my immunity to coronavirus by taking more vitamin C.Then I was told I would not catch itI stared for two hours every day at a picture of Charlize Theron.Later, I received news from someone whose neighbour’s aunt lives next door to a doctor’s cleaning lady that I should drink my own urine.But I was quickly distracted by someone  whose hairdresser had hacked the World Health Organisation and found that under no circumstances should I eat anything containing vitamin C. Or look at Ms Theron.And then I remembered something Important. Every single thing on the internet is b******s.But there’s one small problem.How do you reach anything on the shelves AS I write, the whole world is trying to work out why Germany is doing so much better with the coronavirus than everywhere .The bald figures are certainly intriguing. In Britain, . per cent of people who catch the disease go on to die. In Italy, it’s a terrying nine per cent. Whereas in Germany, it’s . percent.Experts have claimed that the epidemic started there in the Baian Alps, so the people it affected were young, fit skiing enthusiasts. Who barely noticed they had it.Others have pointed to the fact that Germany has many more beds for critically ill patients than Italy. And a HELL of a lot more than the UK.Then there’s testing. For months German medics have been testing the sort of numbers the rest of the world can only dream about. I wonder, however,anyone has considered this: The Germans do well . . .  because they are German.I was once told by a professor at Rome University that: “You can have as many laws as you like in Italy. Just so long as they are not enforced.”So, when the government there first told everyone to go home and stay there, they simply carried on riding around on their Vespas and kissing everyone.It’s the same story in Britain. We were told to stay at home but because the sun was out, we all hit the park for a picnic.The Germans are dferent. You tell Wolfgang that he must wash his hands every  minutes and he will wash his hands every  minutes. You tell him to go home and he will do so, immediately.It’s probably considered racist to talk about national characteristics these days. But in these troubled times I’m going to plough on regardless and say thatwe want to survive, we’ve got to be a bit more German. And for once, do as we are told.Which I’m told is an important ­ingredient in a building project.WE keep being told that the supermarkets will be able to keep up with our demand for food. But I seriously doubt that.I was told this week that the supplier providing my farm with veg seeds had closed. And because he had no delivery drivers, he was dumping his stock.I’ve now found a replacement and I will be getting them in the ground next week. But who will harvest them in three months, when the people who normally do this kind of thing are stuck in Latvia  Students  Fat chance.To make matters worse, a lot of peppers, tomatoes, cucumbers and courgettes you buy come from Spain.And who, right now, in this locked-down country, is planting them, and packing them and taking them to the docks or the airport  Still, there is some good news.Vegetarians will be forced to abandon their idiocy and start to eat meat. Lamb looks like a good bet. Because all the restaurants and pubs are shut, and exports are tricky, prices have more than halved in the past seven days.Bloody annoying for me as a sheep farmer.

The -year-old commander knows all too well what le is like on lockdown.He spent a year and a half living in a tiny tin can in close proximity to his crew.And he has some good tips for not going stir crazy.Obviously the space station astronauts had a lot of work and experiments to do, but that did not take up all of their time. And like the rest of us, they needed to keep busy.Scott has lots of common-sense advice for coping with being cooped up.To follow us on Facebook, simply Like our Coronavirus page.Get Britains best-selling newspaper delivered to your smartphone or tablet each day - find out more.First of all, we need to have a routine. We have to make sure we get up at the same time every morning and that we get washed and dressed and make our beds. We also need a regular bedtime.Scott says you have to get outside at least once a day — we can do that on earth — while also folowing the rules.You need to schedule times to talk to family and friends and have proper meal times.Exercise is vital. Our very own spaceman, Tim Peake, trained and completed a marathon on a running machine when he was part of the crew on the Space Station.Not all of us are fit enough to run -odd miles, but we can use this time to improve stamina and energy levels. I’m still doing my exercise classes with instructor Maxine Jones on her YouTube channel, and I will be starting virtual yoga with my daughter Rosie, who is in Singapore.I was surprised to learn Scott took actual books, not ebooks, into space.But he said holding a real book in his hands meant he could become completely absorbed, and concentration was not interrupted by messages pinging on his iPad.One of the most interesting things he said was to keep a journal of these strange times.It is more than just jotting down what you got up to that day. You need to go deeper and describe your hopes, fears and state of mind, and also what you hope to achieve when this is all over.One of the things Scott valued most during his long stint in space was video calls with family and friends. And he says one of the silver linings of this crisis is time to reconnect with loved ones.I know exactly what he means. I have been spending hours in WhatsApp chats with Rosie, my best friend Joyce, who is in lockdown in Spain, and my mum in East Kilbride.We chat about everythingand it lts my spirits. Scott’s other sensible advice is to get your information from the experts — and he advises against relying on the internet.He is right. Social media is stuffed with misinformed people and mad conspiracy ­theories.I was shocked to realise how some teens don’t watch any news outlets or read newspapers. They get their “news” from Facebook.They also think they are invincible, which is why we saw those packed beaches and parks this time last week.This was partly because they were unaware of the need for “social distancing” but also because they think it won’t happen to them.But Scott’s most important message to all of us is about working together.“All people are inescapably connected and the more we can come together to solve our problems, the better off we will be.“I’ve seen humans work together to prevail over the toughest challenges imaginable, and I know we can prevail over this one,we all do our part and work together as a team.”Well, I would urge you all to listen to Scott.If we can put a man on the moon then we can beat this awful virus. It won’t be easy but I have faith in science.And as long as we obey the rules, and make some sacrices, we WILL overcome.NO matter what you think of him, it would be churlish not to wish Boris Johnson a speedy recovery.But my sympathies are with Carrie Symonds, who is due to give birth in three months. She’s in isolation at a time when she needs his support.My thoughts are with all expectant parents now, bringing babies into a world we barely recognise and unable to be together in the delivery room. It will be bittersweet for all of them.ONE part of the world untouched by Covid- is my spiritual homeland of Antarctica.I visited the great white wilderness three years ago and cannot wait to .Aside from astronauts, the men and women who man the science bases in Antarctica – particularly the station at the South Pole – are well used to being in isolation while living on top of one another.Which is exactly what most of us are doing right now.Living space is limited at the Pole, and there’s no escaping the other  human beings holed up at the station for the full Antarctic winter.It’s virtually pitch black for six months and you can’t really go outside apart from short bursts of vital scientic work.Most are in danger of becoming “toasty”, which is their description of going stir-crazy.Being cramped, isolated and without proper personal boundaries and “me time” can make you cranky, short-tempered and irritated by the smallest things.In order for us all to avoid toastiness during these strange times, I’d recommend a few rules, some of which were given to me by a hardy survivor of winter at the extreme south.Have a sanctuary, evenit is just in the toilet reading your newspaper and doing the crossword.If you are feeling at the end of your tether, don’t bottle it up.Talk about your feelings and listen to what others in the house with you are saying.You might very well be annoying them as much as they are driving you up the wall.It’s early days, and this is a marathon and not a sprint.Unlike those at the Pole, at least we can still go outside and enjoy the sunshine and the heat as well as the light.I’VE got a Star Trek version of Monopoly and I’m wonderingit is too soon to bring it out from the back of the cupboard.I’ve never actually got to the end of a game of Monopoly and I reckon this might just be the only time that will ever happen.I’m also going to start watching Game Of Thrones for the first time, which should keep me going for a couple of weeks. Any other suggestions for box sets gratefully received.I’M sure all dog owners would agree that our fantastic, loyal, loveable pets are keeping us sane right now. I don’t know what I would doI couldn’t take Angus for a walk once a day.It’s not just a chance to get out in the fresh air and do some exercise, which is good for our physical and mental health, but it’s having something that takes your mind off the current state of the world.When I’m playing with Angus I can almost forget those feelings of anxiety that creep up on all of us and simply enjoy his energy and enthusiasm.He needs to be fed and watered and taken care of, and that gives me a much-needed sense of purpose.It’s a proven fact that just having a dog in the house to cuddle boosts your well-being and cuts stress levels.I don’t know what I would do without him.IT has never been more vital for all of us to receive clear-headed analysis and news we can trust.That’s why it’s so important you continue to buy your Sun every day.There’s a free delivery offer for those unable to get to the shops and of course there’s our splendid online version.We need to be well informed about the latest, fast-moving events and have all the facts to best protect ourselves and our families.Thank you for your loyalty and, as always, for your comments and feedback.

Then suddenly, since Monday, we are not.It’s not even been a week since the new normal for all of us is to stay put.I am guessing that for most of us, it feels like twice that. For many of us, being unable to roam freely is the stuff of nightmares.Still, although it’s been a hard week, I am feeling fortunate. Others I know are really struggling, but I’m very lucky to have a house, a job and the basics in my fridge. But my goodness, it’s boring staying at home all the time, isn’t it At the moment more or less every day is the same. I get up, do conference calls, watch the news and go to bed.But I have been trying to do a few things dferently. For fear of my muscles atrophyingI have started using an exercise video.That may sound normal to you but for me, this is staggering. It’s one from the s and is really quite funny and ­dficult at the same time.I’ve also been more studious than usual and have been doing online lectures for my master’s degree.I have put in the hours with a TV show called This Is Us.And I’ve been cooking up a storm — making increasingly inventive recipes with bits and bobs from the back of the store cupboard because the idea of getting a supermarket delivery slot feels like a fantasy so I have not even bothered to try. I cook whatever my corner shop has in stock, which sadly is not a lot.I know many supermarkets are prioritising elderly and vulnerable shoppers, which is right and proper. And I really hope that the people who are hoarding and stockpiling out of fear soon realise that they don’t need to do that.To follow us on Facebook, simply Like our Coronavirus page.Friends who work in the food ­industry have repeatedly told me there is no issue with supply.Especiallypeople continue to go to their local shops, which should still be stocked — and which need their custom.I am nine days into my -day self-isolating as I am still waiting to see my dad, who is recovering from cancer.And, like many others, I’m focused on the importance of being absolutely certain I am ­infection-free before I even think of going to see him and my mum.So really, I’m just sitting it out. But gosh, it’s tedious.One of the biggest changes for me is not being able to go out or see my friends. But on Friday night we had a Skype party. We all got out a bottle of wine, and I even washed my hair before we had a laugh.We are also playing the game Psych — which is great fun and played on your mobile with your mates.It’s made me realise how many of the things I blithely took for granted as being my inalienable right have changed — literally overnight.And I don’t know whether it’s a good or bad thing that my kids aren’t home with me. I’m pretty sure my daughter has already had coronavirus but happily she seems fine now.But I obviously can’t see her other than on video phone as I am isolating. And boy, do I miss her.My son, meanwhile, is with his housemates in Buckingham. They seem fine — working out in their garden gym, making meals together and playing Xbox. In fact, it’s just another day for him.I know there are people reading this who are genuinely struggling and having a seriously hard time with being isolated, who are worried about loss of income, about elderly or vulnerable relatives, or who are stuck at home with ­dficult or even violent people.It is hard to reflect on anything when we are in the middle of it.We have to focus on getting through a day at a time knowing there will be plenty of time to learn lessons when this has passed.We’ll no doubt start from the basics, like being hyper-vigilant about which animals enter the food chain, scrupulous hand-washing and reassessing our attitude towards travel — something we’ve all taken for granted for so long.We will also focus on building the NHS back up. Just as we built nuclear deterrents to protect ourselves against war, we have to protect ourselves from the ious viruses that we now know are, increasingly, out there.Yes, the important thing is the here and now. We’ve seen unprecedented events this week alone, with the PM Boris Johnson,Health Secretary Matt Hancock and Chief Medical Officer Chris Whitty all self-isolating after either testing positive or showing symptoms of the virus.But what is vital is the long-term strategy to fight another attack like this in the future.And in the meantime, apart from feeling a bit cooped up, all in all I am pretty much doing OK with self-isolating.Apart from one thing — I can’t find any hair dye to cover my grey hair, for love nor money. Now that really is a nightmare.ASbeing stuck at home wasn’t hard enough, sports fans are having to get through this time without any football.Now that’s what I call adding insult to injury.As fans will already know, all football has been postponed until April . But behind the scenes, all football clubs, including mine, are doing whatever it takes to ensure the season finishes.I think everyone understands that our priority has to be the safety and good health of our players and the fans. So, while matches are not being played, players are doing all they can to stay fit and well so they are ready whenever it’s time to resume games.Meanwhile, the stadiums, training grounds and offices are all shut.Then, after April , we hope matches can recommence, behind closed doorsrequired.In the meantime, it’s a waiting game. So here’s hoping you’ve got some old Match Of The Day shows lined up to while away your time.ONE thing about us all having to stay at home is that it’s giving celebrities nowhere to hide in terms of what they have got to offer the world.They are on their own at home, with nothing much to do, just like us.Some – Joe Wicks teaching PE to the nation’s primary school kids every morning, Carol Vorderman holding online maths classes or Richard E Grant reading from the script of Withnail And I – are trying hard to provide the nation with useful entertainment.And then there are others. Instagram is also peppered with images of reality TV and soap stars in extremely scanty underwear.Without the props of stylists, red carpets and paparazzi shots, we see them for what they really are.Human beings, just like us.AS a week of firsts comes to a close, athletes and sports fans alike were further disappointed by the announcement that the Olympics have been postponed.Something that only a few weeks ago would have seemed unimaginable now feels, clearly, like the only sensible thing to do.Apart from the logistics involved with quarantine and uncertainty about travel restrictions, some athletes cannot train while some can, which, when the integrity of the sport is at stake, is fundamentally unfair.ANYONE  bored  With This Is Us my current favourite thing to watch, I’ve compiled a list of some other fab shows, just in case you’ve finished Succession and need some inspiration.Here goes – The Crown, Ozark, Luther, Line Of Duty, Sense, Grace And Frankie, Schitt’s Creek, Sex Education, Messiah, Spinning Out, Unbelievable and Mum.I WAS so moved by the nation overriding the old stf upper lip mentality to stand on their doorsteps to give NHS workers a round of applause on Thursday night.And then I read a tweet from a nurse saying that literally as the nation were clapping, she had received an email from her employers advising her not to travel to work in unorm or display her work ID.This is because some people have been mugged for these items and the very scant privilege – like an early supermarket slot – that they bring.Come on, people – sort it out. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

And we wholeheartedly condemn ignorant racists pointing the finger at them.But the dangerous despots at the head of the Chinese government ARE to blame — and allowing them to emerge with a propaganda win would be a monumental injustice.When the dust has settled, the West must drastically rethink its cosy relationship with President Xi Jinping and his Communist cronies.And Britain should take the lead.To follow us on Facebook, simply Like our Coronavirus page.Get Britains best-selling newspaper delivered to your smartphone or tablet each day - find out more."},{"url":null,"title":"michael gove cough television coronavirus","story":"MICHAEL Gove appeared to stled a cough during a live TV interview this morning - just days after coronavirus struck down Boris Johnson.The Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster seemed to struggle with a cough during an appearance on BBC’s Andrew Marr show.His actions sparked fears for his health in the same week Boris Johnson and the Health Secretary Matt Hancock revealed they had the virus.However, aides have now insisted he does not have a cough and was just clearing his throat.One said: He does not have symptoms.Both the Prime Minister and Mr Hancock revealed their diagnoses on Friday and announced that they would be self-isolating.Johnson said: Im self-isolating and thats entirely the right thing to do.He added that the more effectively we all comply with lockdown and self-isolation measures, the faster well bounce back.Thank you to everybody whos doing what Im doing, working from home, he said.Hancock said he would be staying at home until next Thursday.The cough came on a day Mr Gove revealed Britain had finally hit , coronavirus tests a day in its bid to beat the virus.He said: “Well, we have been increasing the number of tests and I can confirm today that the number of tests being carried out is , now and we want to increase that – , a day – and we want to increase that to , a day.“Just last week the Prime Minister authorised the new programme of testing so working with research institutes and also with companies like Boots, we are now in a position to be able to test more.”Yesterday, the PM said the situation would get worse before it gets better.In a letter being sent to households across the UK this week, the PM suggests the government will not hesitate to enforce further lockdown measuresneeded.His letter states: “It’s important for me to level with you — we know things will get worse before they get better.“But we are making the right preparations, and the more we all follow the rules, the fewer lives will be lost and the sooner le canto normal.”He added: We will not hesitate to go furtherthat is what the scientic and medical advice tells us we must do.”To follow us on Facebook, simply Like our Coronavirus page.Get Britains best-selling newspaper delivered to your smartphone or tablet each day - find out more."},{"url":null,"title":"data cap scrapped coronavirus","story":"INTERNET providers will remove data limits to boost Brits stuck at home during the coronavirus crisis.The scrapped cap comes with the nation under strict orders not to leave home.Internet service providers and mobile operators including BT EE, Openreach, Virgin Media, Sky, O and Vodafone have all agreed to the measures.They are designed to ensure all Brits have access to telecoms services during the lockdown.The removal of data caps will apply to all fixed broadband services, while the firms have agreed to offer generous packages to the most vulnerable.Digital secretary Oliver Dowden said: “It’s fantastic to see mobile and broadband providers pulling together to do their bit for the national effort by helping customers, particularly the most vulnerable, who may be struggling with bills at this dficult time.“It is essential that people stay at home to protect the NHS and save lives.

It’s not a fixed point, a date in the calendar like Easter. It is something that all of us can affect by our actions.”Mr Gove also hinted that Britain could be heading for a fresh bout of austerity once the crisis is over.He said Chancellor Rishi Sunak’s generous jobs bailout packages will mean Britain will have to go on a borrowing spree.But he insisted the Treasury is confident Britain will eventually be able to pay back the money once the nation gets back to work. And he said: “The most important thing at the moment is to save lives.During the briefing, Communities Secretary Robert Jenrick said Britain has now been placed on an “emergency footing” to get vital food and medicine to vulnerable people in lockdown.He said: “This is an unprecedented step in peace time, we haven’t done anything like this since the Second World War.”Three-quarters of a million Brits have now signed up to be NHS volunteers to help the nation through the crisis — smashing the Government’s , target.But ministers have faced growing criticisms that doctors and nurses have been left on the frontline without vital protective gear such as masks and goggles.Addressing the storm directly, Mr Jenrick said the Government “will not stop” until all hospitals and social care settings get the vital gear they need.The coronavirus crisis has swept through the heart of government, with PM Boris Johnson and Health Secretary Matt Hancock testing positive.Scottish Secretary Alister Jack is in self-isolation with symptoms.But the PM is still “firmly in charge” and running the national response via videolink from his Downing Street study, Mr Gove said.  Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Keswick is busy all year round and would normally be packed today but there is no-one around at all and we are really pleased about that.“There was a genuine sense of fear last week that people were not listening and were still visiting us.“Everyone here was terried that the virus was going to be brought into the area by people from outside desperate to get out and about because of the lockdown.“Last weekend the town was heaving and the locals were all concerned.“But through the week the message has started to sink in. It has got quieter and quieter and it’s now deserted.“Obviously there is a concern for businesses and the local economy, but for now, people know that we have got to stick together to beat this diseases.”Down by the lake, the jetties which are usual thronged with people hiring rowing boats or taking trips around the lake on skippered vessels, were silent.The main car park was cordoned off and a council van was parked across the entrance as an extra deterrent to anyone unwise enough to try and flout the restrictions.The police were out and about enforcing the lockdown in a polite but firm manner, with officers from neighbouring forces being drafted in to assist their Cumbria colleagues.At one point we were stopped by an unmarked car after an ANPR check revealed our number plate was not registered locally.The officers revealed they were stopping anyone from out of the area to check why they are in the Lakes.Anyone not on legitimate business is advised to leave and is also liable to a £ on the spot fine.Happy with our explanation that we were there to check on whether the public were respecting the lockdown, the officers allowed us on our way as we drove south from Keswick to Grasmere.The A which hugs the banks of Thirlmere is normally a busy road but we didn’t pass a single car.Dove Cottage in Grasmere, the house where Wordsworth was living in  when he wrote his famous poem ”I wandered lonely as a cloud”, is closed just like all local attractions.A member of staff who was tidying up in preparation for a y shutdown said: “It is so quiet round here at the moment you can hear the birds singing, which is good. No-one knows long it will go on for but we don’t have a choice.”Further south, Bowness on the banks of Windermere, England’s biggest lake, is always one of the Lake District’s busiest spots.Car parking spaces are like gold dust as foreign tourists, coach tours and day trippers pack the town to enjoy award-winning ice cream, boat trips on the lake and browsing in the gt shops.But yesterday, the only visitors were a couple of swans, a flock of Canada geese and some noisy seagulls.The hotels are shut with many having erected heavy bollards across their car park entrances to ram home the message.The bars, restaurants and cafes are all closed and all of the National Park car parks are shut following the row last weekend after thousands ignored the stay at home plea and flocked to the countryside.On the back of that, Cumbria Police issued their own warning that the Lake District was closed for business.Cumbria Temporary Chief Superintendent Rob OConnor said: Last weekend we saw signicant amounts of tourists travel to the Lake District, and my message is really simple, the Lake District is closed.We do not want to see people travelling to the Lakes.

School science labs donating protective goggles to frightened NHS staff complaining they’ve been thrust defenceless into the frontline against a deadly foe is the final nail in the coffin of  years of ­destructive Tory austerity which left the NHS on its knees. Ministers and advisers are braced for an inquiry exposing smugness, chaos, fatal blunders and woeful preparations at the heart of Government obsessed with Brexit triumphalism. The Covid- cataclysm has made temporary socialists of deregulators and free marketeers, Tories from Boris Johnson down converted to the value of public intervention and strong Government to save the country. Jeremy Corbyn was too much Me-Me-Me self-congratulatory in a BBC interview but Labour’s outgoing leader is on the money asserting this crisis justies his politics. December’s humiliation might never have happened had coronavirus erupted three months before rather than after the  election just as Grenfell could have toppled Theresa May seven days ahead, instead of beyond, the  poll. The political kaleidoscope is shaken again and when we’re unsure how the pieces will settle, the democratic argument is clear for another election to take instructions from the people. Johnson’s manesto is shredded. He will have no mandate for what comes next whether that is tax rises or vicious spending cuts repeating austerity’s self-defeating stupidity. Bonfires of what Conservatives call red tape, and what we know as job rights and health and safety will doubtless be considered. Tories who pretend soaring deficits and debt under Labour after  weren’t triggered by the global banking collapse won’t stop hypocrites screaming higher rises in  are due to coronavirus.  They were wrong then and right now which is a challenge for Labour’s likely next leader, a Keir Starmer hotly tipped to be crowned to little fanfare on Saturday. Starmer may be averse to a General Election next May to coincide with delayed council contests. Three Labour MPs I canvassed, smart politicians who will be in Starmer’s team, didn’t want one and are confident Tory record poll leads will drain away later when Johnson’s faults are scrutinised forensically on the other side of this apocalypse.

The shocking image comes to light after a hospital consultant became the first frontline NHS worker to die from coronavirus. Fears are fears mounting that countless lives are being put a risk by a lack of testing and protective kit. NHS England confirmed on Sunday that senior doctor Amged El-Hawrani, , died at Glenfield Hospital in Leicester after testing positive for Covid-. It comes as Boris Johnson writes to every household in the country to warn that “things will get worse before they get better”. The death toll from the outbreak rose  to , yesterday. Ear, nose and throat specialist Dr El-Harwani, who died on Saturday, is understood to have contracted the virus several weeks ago. In an emotional tribute his relatives called him “the rock of our family” who put everybody  first. NHS England described Dr El-Hawrani as the first practising hospital doctor to die of the virus. Dr Adil El Tayar, an organ transplant surgeon, , died in a London hospital last week after volunteering at an AE department in the West Midlands. An Essex GP, Dr Habib Zaidi, , died in intensive care at Southend Hospital last week after, according to his doctor daughter, “textbook symptoms” of the virus. As worrying footage of a nurse working in a coronavirus ward wearing only basic protection was passed to the Mirror, the Doctors’ Association UK said it was “deeply saddened” by Dr El-Hawrani’s death. And it urged the Government to make a priority of “protecting the lives of the le-savers”. A joint statement from its president Dr Samantha Batt-Rawden and chair Dr Rinesh Parmar said: “It is simply unacceptable that some doctors still do not have access to adequate PPE.  “This is crucial, especially for the highest-risk procedures undertaken by intensive care doctors, anaesthetists and ENT surgeons.” It is not known how Dr El-Hawrani contracted Covid-. On Sunday claims emerged that scientists predicted four years ago that the NHS would be overwhelmeda deadly virus hit the country. The Government exercise carried out by Imperial College London in , predicted an outbreak of HN flu would leave NHS unable to cope, due to a lack of PPE, and ventilators. Ministers have promised that millions of pieces of protective kit will be delivered to key workers. Communities Secretary Robert Jenrick said: “We simply cannot ask people to be on the frontline without the right protective equipment.” But footage, received by the Mirror shows an agency nurse working in a hospital wearing just a basic apron, short gloves, mask and goggles. The paramedic beside her is in a long-sleeved gown and full head cover.  An unnamed woman, who filmed the clip last Wednesday is heard saying: “This is how it is.” The hospital trust did not respond to a request for comment. Meanwhile staff at a London hospital are hiding PPE as shortages bite it is claimed. “We’re in a situation where people are having to hide them for their own staff,” said one obstetrician. Another NHS doctor said: “All my colleagues are nervous, some are going off sick because they don’t feel safe.” The head the Royal College of Nursing says about % of frontline staff have had to take time off work to self-isolate having shown symptoms. Amid the shortage of kit, four volunteers have raised £, to buy PPE. Three doctors and an architect set up the appeal and Hollywood actor James McAvoy has backed their cause, by donating £, saying: “NHS staff are heroes.” To help ease the strain on staff Labour MP Margaret Hodge has called for the Government to help set up pop-up supermarkets in hospitals to make sure they can buy food. It comes after grim stories of medics being unable to get supplies from shops emptied by panic buyers. Ministers have repeatedly pledged to “ramp up” testing – promising to start testing NHS staff this week. But the first new lab to open will initially process just  samples.  And there are concerns parts of the UK lack the necessary laboratories and staff. Doctors in Cambridge reportedly claimed tests are taking up to four days to come back, while in Hull they were said to be taking  hours. The turnaround time in London is thought to be down to  hours. Ministers have ordered .million tests following criticism last week that they had bought .million without knowing they would work. And the Government is today expected to confirm an order for thousands of ventilators. Cabinet minister Michael Gove yesterday refused to say when all NHS workers will be tested.

Each university will be restricted on how many UK and EU undergraduates it can admit in September, a government source has told the .The move - the first limit since the admission cap was lted in  - has apparently been backed by higher education leaders. British universities face losing hundreds of millions in tuition fees as students from countries hit hardest by Covid- are forced to cancel or postpone enrolments. It is understood, with UK universities set to re-open in September, the cap aims to prevent certain institutions snapping up all the domestic students and leaving less prestigious ones aposemptyapos. A policymaker involved in discussions with government and universities said this scenario is a real riskthere arenapost signicant developments. As a result of the cap, students will see their options restricted with some having already offered places taken away while others. Despite backing from the board of Universities UK on Friday, it was opposed by certain leading universities, including Russell Group members. With a decision looming in just days some institutions have raised concerns with government over potential financial woesthey canapost recruit extra UK students to cover expected international fee losses. Alistair Jarvis, chief executive of Universities UK , said student number controls by UUK board members and it was agreed further consideration of the pros and cons were needed.Though many vice-chancellors support the temporary controls as a way of avoiding a brutal recruitment season after certain universities began liberally handing out unconditional offers at the epidemic grew. A senior figure at an English university admitted there was huge panic in the sector and said a cap on numbers would be welcomed. On average, recruits from China account for , full-time students in the UK.  One applicant told theUCAS should have been frozen by the government immediately after it was announced schools would close and A-Levels be cancelled. They said: “Some universities behaved very badly.” Nick Hillman, the head of the Higher Education Policy Institute, who was previously a special adviser to the government, said a policy response is needed. “We have to protect our university sector at a time of such profound change, he said. Mr Hillman went on to say there are some who have been wanting an excuse to cap access to higher education for a long time but that when there are less jobs available education becomes more important, not less. He said the pandemic is becoming a catalyst for theto capping in opposition to every ministerial utterance for at least  years. While protecting universities that have grown substantially in recent years, a cap would see more established universities become the biggest losers, added Mr Hillman.

But within days her niece Susan Nelson, , who had no underlying health conditions, became ill, and died of suspected Covid . Now  further family members all suspect they have the virus after catching it at the funeral - including Susanaposs husband, daughter, a niece and a great-uncle. Retired sandwich shop owner Susan, from Halesowen, West Mids., even died on the same hospital ward as her aunt Shiela.For live updates throughout the day on the coronavirus pandemic visit our liveblog. Susanaposs daughter Amanda, , is just one of a suspected  family members who are showing symptoms of Covid- after going to the funeral in Yardley Wood. The NHS business support manager, currently isolating at home with her father, Robert, also suffers from Addison’s Disease. Amanda, from Halesowen said: “It was my [great] aunt’s funeral so a lot of the wider family were there. “She died back in February, but we have just had so many people contract the virus that I can only think it was from then. “We now have someone  in our family in hospital thataposs probably not going to survive it. Have you been affected by this story  Email webnews@mirror “My -year-old cousin has it, right the way up to a great uncle that is  and is showing some symptoms. “Its a whole section of us, none of us seems to have been missed out of it just yet. Itaposs a bit strange. “I would say around  family members have been displaying symptoms since going to that funeral. It’s hit young and old in our family. “Our beautul, caring mum was the centre of the family - we are a very close, large family and this has destroyed us.” Sheila Brooks, was  when she passed away on February , with the majority of the extended family attending the service on March . Susan got notably worse the following week, with the family forced into calling an ambulance. She died at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Birmingham with her husband Robert, , at her side.  Her son Carl, , who now lives in Cleckheaton, Yorks., said: “She was coughing a lot, very breathless and showing all the traditional symptoms. “She was admitted to hospital on Mondayand I spoke to the hospital staff the following day. “They said the next  hours were critical before they called me back a few hours later to say it was very close to the end and one member of the family could be with her. “Because I had none of the symptoms, I couldn’t go and my sister was too unwell battling the illness herself. “People can end up dying on their own. Fortunately, my dad Robert was able to go and be with her when she died. “She started showing serious symptoms on Thursday and being dead the early hours of the Tuesday morning shows how quickly this can escalate.  “I managed to speak to her on the phone when my dad got there and all she wanted was for me to come down. “I had my suitcase packed ready to head down, but the hospital were telling me I wasnapost allowed. “I had to tell her they wouldnapost let me and I weren’t allowed to see her. I didnapost want her to die thinking that I didnapost want to come. “We have got to beat it and we canapost have any other families to go through what we are going through at the moment. “It’s about getting the message out. Itaposs about seeing the faces of loved ones and thinking this is real.”  The family are unable to make funeral arrangements due to the government clampdown on mass gatherings. Carl, one of the only members of the family without symptoms, said: “We have been told it may have to be limited to six people, but that could change. “Itaposs the practical things as well. All of my family are isolated, so I may have to drive down to pick up the relevant forms from the hospital to register her death. “While I am doing all that, I wonapost be able to see my family, I will just have to drive back up north. “Itaposs not good and itaposs not right. I donapost blame anyone, I totally understand the reasons why it has to be this way.” Amanda and dad Robert, a retired electrical engineer, is still battling the killer bug but are “showing improvement”. She said: “I still canapost quite shake it off though. Itaposs very up and down. For me, I feel okay in the mornings but by the afternoon you feel like itaposs come back again.  “The cough is still lingering and other symptoms, but hopefully we can keep improving. Fortunately, my dad seems to be getting better but my mum obviously didnapost make it. “The last person I thought it would take would be my mum. I was worried about my dad, who has underlying health conditions.” The family are adamant that the wider public should follow the social distancing guidelines and to not do so is “madness” “The speed it acts at is phenomenal and how vicious it is canapost be underestimated,” her son Carl said “don’t be stupid and don’t risk it. “Everyone, please follow the advice. Stay home, stay safe. Anyone who thinks they are fit and healthy, that itaposs just like the cold or flu, don’t risk it.” In recognition NHS workers who tried to save their mum, the family have set up a Just Giving page with proceeds going to Queen Elizabeth Hospital Birmingham Charity. Carl explained: “In the conditions, they are working under, itaposs phenomenal. My dad described it as a living hell. “What they are facing on a day to day basis, no one truly understands or appreciates what they put into their job.  “If we can all just do something little that goes to them, that they can benefit from and just to say thank you, it would be great. My family are all grateful for the work they did. “They couldnapost save mum but they gave everything to do so and made her comfortable in the end. “Even the follow-up conversations that I have had, despite how much pressure they are under, the doctor took the time to call me back and explain things to me. “I couldnapost ask for anymore. The fundraising page has exceeded our expectations already. The generosity of people has been staggering, even in these tough times.” Amanda also echoed this, adding: “The ward that my mum died on was the same one that my aunt died on and the nursing staff instantly recognised my mum. “I spoke to one of the nurses on the ward and it felt like her heart was broken. She was really, really upset. “I just canapost imagine what they were feeling as well, it will have been awful for them too.

Officers have been stepping up patrols of parks, beaches and forestry to make sure people are not breaching restrictions.

Dozens of the players were seen at Roath Recreation Ground in Cardf before police were called to remove them and order them to go home. Officers drove onto the grass to break up the group.

In the past few weeks, health boards across the country have announced only one birthing partner will be allowed to accompany women in labour in a bid to reduce the spread of the virus. Butthat partner starts to show symptoms of the virus, somebody  may need to stand in. We are recommending that women should have one ­birthing partner with them throughout labour and birth,” director for Scotland of the Royal College of MidwivesDr Mary Ross-Davie said. For live updates throughout the day on the coronavirus pandemic visit our liveblog.    Butthey have ­symptoms of the virus, in line with national guidelines, they should be self-isolating and shouldnapost accompany women to hospital. Post-birth visitors to maternity wards, including the womanaposs partner, have also been banned and people are advised to keep their ­distance from new mums once they are discharged.  As hard as it might be, there should be no visitors at home. By all means show the baby off to the grandparents but keep it to virtual calls, Dr Ross-Davie continued. We all love cuddles and kisses with a new baby but these will have to be on hold for now. We just need to be sensible about it to keep everyone safe. Home visits by health visitors are likely to reduce and some will even be replaced by virtual consultations. The strict social distancing after birth means there could be a sharp rise in cases of postnatal depression, experts have warned. Midwives are very aware of the implications of this whole situation on postnatal mental health, said Dr Ross-Davie. This pandemic is going to bring an increased level of anxiety during pregnancy and after the baby is born, and potentially feelings of isolation due to the lack of peer and family support. Itaposs a very real risk. There is some planning going on to ensure women can access support, and we would encourage them to think about registering for virtual chatrooms perhaps with ­members of their antenatal classes or other new mums they know - and to let health visitors knowthey are experiencing these feelings.  There will be access to virtual clinics and one-to-one support. There is a huge amount going on. Weaposre looking at how other countries have coped with the pandemic and learning from that the best way to adapt the service in preparation. With an estimated , babies born in Scotland every week, RCM is recommending that midwery staff remain on maternity wards. Our advice is that midwives shouldnapost be called in to ­provide other care, Dr Ross-Davie added. We are also encouraging midwives who have retired in the last three years to sign up for an emergency register - and midwery students nearing the end of their training to extend their time in hospitals. Itaposs important to remember that midwives are also experiencing something completely new. But everyone is going through this together. Maternity services are open to care for women as we always are, through whatever is going on. We will continue to make it as positive and special an ­experience as we possibly can. Once the door to that labour room is closed, it doesnapost matter what is going on outside.

Toni Rhodes and her husband Ken revealed how their son Curtis developed a high temperature and began to seem aposagitatedapos. The concerned parents decided to bring him to AE at a local hospital on Monday when his condition failed to improve. Doctors told Toni and Ken that their newborn would have to stay in hospital for at least  hours while they carried out tests and monitored his condition. Curtis was given a swab test to seehe had coronavirus and results confirmed he had contracted the infection when they finally arrived on Thursday. Toni, who lives near Basildon, Essex, recounted their ordeal on social media and has urged other parents to seek urgent medical attentiontheir children fall ill. She said on Facebook : Can I please ask that this message is shared as much as possible so we can seek and give support to and from others who may have babies that have tested positive or have concerns for their child. Curtis did not feed for over  hours overnight on Sunday but was very agitated with a dferent cry to his usual a day or two beforehand. He was then very sleepy and not fidgeting in his sleep as he usual does. We noticed in the morning he had mottled skin and a red swollen watering eye, very slight cough and sneezing periodically, still very sleepy and not feeding.  We took him to AE lunchtime on Monday, he had a borderline temperature and fast heart rate and with everything  they assumed it was sepsis. He was put on antibiotics with bloods taken and said we were to stay in for at least  hours. He was swabbed for corona as they do for everyone that is admitted now but the results take a few days to come back. They discharged him on Wednesday after thee antibiotics injections as his observations were fine and he started to show improvements, however we then got the call Thursday since being home to say he tested positive for the virus.  We are sharing our story to give parents the reassurance that babies can and will be ok. The message is intended to be positive and to raise awareness. In an update, Toni also confirmed that she and her husband were showing symptoms of the disease but were unable to confirm this as they were not in hospital to get a test. Many people are asking how Curtis got the virus, the truth is how does anyone get it  Ken and I are showing symptoms however have not been and wonapost be tested the same as everyone  unless admitted to hospital.

Professor James Naismith, director of the Rosalind Franklin Institute at the University of Oxford, spoke out after a further  people in the UK died after being tested for Covid-, bringing the total to ,. And other academics cautioned people not to assume that because the  figure was lower than the  who died in the previous  hours, it meant the disease was under control. Prof Naismnith said: I am confident that provided we follow social distancing the increase in deaths will stop and this will be followed by a decrease in the daily numbers. It can take up to two weeks from infection to onset of symptoms.Follow all coronavirus updates on our live blog hereFor over % of people these symptoms are mild, for the much smaller number who develop the most serious illness, intensive care is needed around  days later. For those who do not recover but die, data from China suggests this takes around another four days. The tragic deaths today will be from people infected roughly a month ago. It is inevitable that there will be more tragedies for families ahead. We can reduce the final death toll only by following current Government advice. We must expect and welcome changes in Government advice as science, medicine and social science work together to learn more.  He said that  deaths were a terrible loss and added: It is true that this is less than might have been expected from exponential growth. However, daily numbers can be lowerthan expected due to random factors. It is far too early to conclude that the lower number today than yesterday is not simply due to chance. Eleanor Riley, professor of immunology and infectious disease, University of Edinburgh, said: It would be most unwise to infer any trend from a single dayaposs data. Only when the epidemic has peaked - which is some time away - and we get sustained daily reductions in new cases and then sustained daily reductions in deaths, will we know that we are beginning to get on top of the epidemic.

However, Sam has been self-isolating with his girlfriend Chloe Skerritt, , since Monday when she developed a fever and a cough. So instead, he had to make do with the views from his third floor apartment in South Woodford, Essex, as he completed the run in three hours with Chloe cheering him on. Sam said: It was going to be my first ever half-marathon and I was excited to do it, so it was devastating when it was cancelled. I had put so much training in and itaposs such a great cause I am running for, that I wanted to still do it anyway I could. I saw a video of a man in Italy who ran a full marathon on his balcony so I thought I could do a half-marathon on mine. I did a little km run on it on Tuesday and I thought well itaposs boring, but I can do it.  We have been self-isolating since Monday. Weaposre fine, but itaposs more of a precaution really. We took the decision to work from home and not go out a my mum works for the NHS and my dad has health issues so we didnapost want to risk spread anything to vulnerable people. Amateur cricket player Sam, who had never previously ran more than  miles, said he had been training hard for the half-marathon and did not want that training to go to waste. He also wanted to honour his commitment to raising money for Haven House Childrenaposs Hospice, which supports children with le-threatening or le-limiting illnesses. Sam added: Iaposve been running home from work in preparation for the event and really building up to it. Training had been going well and I was getting my speed up. I initially hoped to do it in under two hours but as the training went on I got quicker and I was probably on course to do it in less than an hour and  minutes.  I really wanted to do it for Haven House and raise as much money as possible. They are an amazing charity that believes in the best possible le for every baby and child with a le-limited or le-threatening condition. They do so much for families who live in my community and Iaposve seen the work they have done which is absolutely amazing. Theyaposve been going since  and theyaposve just put up an emergency appeal for funding. All their fundraising events have bee cancelled and their charity shops have had to close, which was a major source of their income. Sam completed the half marathon on the balcony of his third-floor apartment in three hours and  minutes. His girlfriend Chloe Skerritt, , made him a winner’s medal made from a discarded cereal box.  Speaking afterwards, Sam, from South Woodford in East London, said: “I will never in my le run on my balcony again - it’s reserved for drinking and only drinking. “I’m happy to have done it although I’m not quite sure I know why I did it. “The worst thing was that I couldn’t pick up any pace because there’s only so much room before you hit a wall or a window. “The hardest aspect of the entire run was the mental part more than physical, because it’s so hard to push yourself when you’re not making much ground. “It’s just the same short bit of balcony over and over again for over three hours. “I don’t know how many podcasts I listened to, but I listened to the Tailenders podcast and Match of the Day. “Had some great tunes on to keep me on pace, anything from McFly, to AC DC and the Foo Fighters.” The former musician said he air drums while running which also helped him keep on pace. But he nearly gave up at the halfway point as his hips and groin began to burn up.

Photographer Edward Boudreau captured candid shots of the bear just as the villagers had harvested a whale. They would cut a large portion of the whale and blubber, and drag it four miles out of town for the bears to find. This stops the bears from travelling into town to harvest and disrupting the process.  In other words, itaposs a way to stop a group of hungry bears coming towards you in a hurry.

Mr Brooks said that by the time he had reached the checkouts several people had lined up to pay for their shopping. He said: A guy said to them, aposWell done, you are doing amazing workapos and the paramedics looked emotional. He edged closer to them and said, I must pay for your shopping and then he tapped his card on the terminal. They couldnapost thank him enough. It was a nice thing to witness.

In the s, Kenya’s Meru Conservation Area was overrun with poachers, who decimated its wildle. But thanks to a partnership between the Kenya Wildle Service and Britain’s Born Free Foundation, the poaching has been stemmed. The park has been restocked with animals and there are now about  lions roaming free and giving birth to new litters of cubs. Born Free’s “Last Lions of Meru ” fightback is giving hope to Africa’s lions which are sliding towards extinction. The reserve was the setting for the  movie starring Virginia McKenna and her husband Bill Travers, who died, aged , in . It told the true story of game warden George Adamson and his we Joy who raised an orphaned lioness, Elsa, and ed her successfully to the wild. But, less than  years later, poachers were slaughtering wildle in the park north of Mount Kenya. In time, the KWS drove the poachers out and, since , Born Free has been running a monitoring programme to assess the numbers and distribution of the big cats and the threats they face. If they spot anything suspicious in the  square mile reserve, they alert the KWS rangers. Born Free also works to reduce conflict between local farmers and lions. Across the continent, lions are in desperate trouble and are thought to be extinct in more than  countries. Will Travers, who set up the Born Free Foundation  years ago with his parents, said: “Our educated guess is when the film was made, there were at least , lions across Africa. Today there are , – an % drop.  “It is entirely possible that at the turn of the last century, there were ,-plus lions across Africa.” Lions have seen much of their habitat taken over by an expanding human population desperate for farmland. This has brought them into conflict with farmers anxious to protect their families and their livestock. Mr Travers, , said he hopes to extend Born Free’s work on lions across a much wider area. He said: “Our work in Meru is a wonderful example of just how resilient our world can be and how nature will bounce backwe all work together. “Once poaching in the park was brought under control, wildle was able to re-establish itself across the many erse habitats found in this unique protected area.  “By implementing our lion monitoring project, working with local communities and schools bordering the park, educating and empowering people and highlighting the importance of wildle conservation, we have been able to encourage co-existence and promote more sustainable livelihoods that work for local communities living around Meru, and its wildle. “Starting with Meru, we must redouble our efforts to save and protect the lions of Africa now more than ever – a world without them is, quite simply, unimaginable.”  Meru is also home to a large iety of other wildle including elephants, leopard, cheetah, giraffe, hippo, primates, crocodiles, antelopes and  species of bird. Ms McKenna, , who last visited Meru last year, said: “At Born Free, we want a world where lions roam free, safe from poachers and human-wildle conflict.

It had reportedly been chartered by the government and was carrying emergency supplies to the country as it battles against the spread of coronavirus. Footage from the crash scene showed huge flames as emergency services were scrambled, reports the Daily Star. Follow all coronavirus updates on our live blog here     Thick plumes of black smoke could also be seen billowing into the air from miles around the airport. Pictures later emerged of the burnt out wreckage after firefighters got the blaze under control. The images showed the plane sat on the tarmac of the runway completely destroyed. The aircraft is reportedly owned by Lion Air – a charter service company in the Philippines, not the Indonesian commercial airline. One image circulating on social media reportedly shows officials loading boxes of medical supplies onto the plane earlier.The officials were wearing clothing labelled DOH – which stands for Department of Health. It is not yet officially knownthe medical supplies were related to the response to the coronavirus pandemic. Cases of coronavirus in Japan, where the plane was destined, have spiked in the last few days as the government held off placing the country on lockdow.

We all feel the profound impact of coronavirus not just on ourselves, but on our loved ones and our communities. I understand completely the dficulties this disruption has caused to your lives, businesses and jobs. But the action we have taken is absolutely necessary, for one very simple reason. If too many people become seriously unwell at one time, the NHS will be unable to cope. This will cost lives.

Amateur futsal player Vitor Godinho died in a hospital near Porto, Potugal, in the early hours of this morning morning after falling ill with the virus. He is understood to have suffered from psoriasis, a skin disorder that can affect the immune system, but had no major underlying health issues. The teenager’s death follows that of French schoolgirl Julie Alliot, , who was described on Friday as Europe’s youngest coronavirus fatality after she died at a Paris hospital. Tributes have been paid to the youngster who was an accomplished futsal player. Rafael, from O half an hour’s drive south of Porto, lost his fight for le after being rushed to Sao Sebastiao Hospital in nearby Santa Maria da Feira. Medics are said to have decided against transferring him to a hospital with a paediatric AE unit in Porto, Portugal’s second largest city, because of the severity of his condition. The Portuguese Football Federation paid tribute to the youngster on its website on Sunday. He played futsal, which is similar to five-a-side football and is played on a hard court, for Maceda Cultural and Recreational Centre in his hometown area. A message from its president Fernando Gomes said: “With profound consternation I am sending my condolences to the family, friends and colleagues of Vitor Rafael Bastos Godinho, a young Maceda Cultural and Recreational Centre.  “At this moment of deep pain for his loved ones, I am also sending words of comfort to the footballing family in the Aveiro region who share with us the disappearance of such a precocious talent. Well-wisher Ana Pereira Pereira said: “I am thinking about his family with a lot of sadness. An enormous hug to them. Another angel has gone to Heaven.” Raquel Filipa added: “My heart goes out to all his family and friends. “A young person with so many years ahead of him who didn’t deserve to die. “For a son to go before his parents must be one of the worst dficult things in le for his mum and dad. Rest in peace Vitor.” The teenager’s futsal club said in a statement: “This time you didn’t get past the rival, like you did so many times. “We’re devastated, lost for words. Rest in peace champion.”  Ameilia Evilasio said: “It’s so unfair. He was just a little boy. Let his soul rest in peace. Strength to his family at such a dficult time.” Vitor has been confirmed as Portugal’s youngest person with coronavirus to die so far. The girl described earlier this week as Europe’s youngest coronavirus victim, named as Julie Alliot, was first rushed to her local doctor in Longjumeau, south of Paris, on Tuesday before being transferred to the Necker Hospital in the French capital.

Nothing concrete, though, and I want to prove my fitness first before doing anything.“If the season gets extended, that might end up being a good thing for me.“There might even be time for me to play for somebody this season depending on what happens. That would be great for my fitness before heading into pre-season.”Despite the impact the coronavirus has had on le back in Scotland, Murray and his family are planning to head back to Dundee in the coming weeks with his time at Wits coming to an end.In South Africa, the virus hasn’t yet had the same effect as in Europe and the football season was only shut down last week.He admits there are worries but being back home and closer to family and friends is a draw for Murray as he plots the next move of a career that has seen him turn out for Montrose, Downfield, Tayport, Dundee Violet, Arbroath, United, Hibs and then the Dark Blues before heading for Johannesburg.CALUM WOODGER: It#s a perfect storm and, make no doubts about it, Dundee and Dundee United are right in the eye of it\" src\"https:www.eveningtelegraph fp calum-woodger-dundee-fc-dundee-united-spfl-shutdown embed # secretlKqPsPpAv\" data-secret\"lKqPsPpAv\" width\"\" \"\" frameborder\"\" marginwidth\"\" margin\"\" scrolling\"no\"He added: “There haven’t been any deaths so it is all just starting here, to be honest.“I think countries like this have learned from the ones who got it first so President Cyril Ramaphosa here is putting measures in place for prevention, hand sanitiser everywhere and things like that.“I get UK TV so I’ve been hearing all the stuff from home, get to see Boris every night, and it is worrying.“Having lived in South Africa, you are isolated at the best of times anyway so that won’t be as much a problem for people here.“You never walk anywhere for safety reasons – don’t get me wrong, it’s a great place but you have to be careful.”Murray has loved his time in South Africa but says he’s looking forward to getting back home.“I’ve missed Scottish football in some ways, not others I suppose,” he added.“The football is good over here but there’s not the passion in the stands like in Scotland.“It’s a dferent culture.

I think I was on every gym equipment website, both in the UK and abroad, and everywhere was a four-week wait.“I spoke to Gary Dempsey, our fitness coach, to try to rent a treadmill or spin bike.“Everything was sold out or rented out, so I couldn’t get anything.LEE WILKIE: It#s perfect time for Dundee United fans to look back with pride on incredible season\" src\"https:www.eveningtelegraph fp lee-wilkie-dundee-united-season-title embed # secretjFpUxvzSJ\" data-secret\"jFpUxvzSJ\" width\"\" \"\" frameborder\"\" marginwidth\"\" margin\"\" scrolling\"no\"“Thankfully, I have managed to get this bike.

Bottom of the second tier got £,.Could they not pay out the minimum to everybody right now and decide the rest later Welcome to lockdown everybody! I’ve now been working from home for over a week and getting used to it.

for the dundee clubs","story":"Ayr United captain Ross Docherty insists he’s not been surprised by how well his former team-mates have fared at Dundee and Dundee United.Declan McDaid joined the Dark Blues from the Honest Men last summer, with Lawrence Shankland and Liam Smith swapping Somerset Park for Tannadice.Shankland has notched  goals in  games for the Terrors and Scotland, while Smith and McDaid have been standouts for their clubs.Goal machine Shankland has particularly impressed Docherty.“It’s not been a surprise to me at all how well he’s done,” the -year-old midfielder said.“I had every confidence in him going up there at the start of the season because he’d done it for Ayr.“We were a decent team last season but he’s gone to Dundee United and they’re dominating the league.“If he gets a chance, he’s going to score and he’s maybe been getting a bit more service up there.“He’d dried up before the league stopped but they’d been struggling as a team.“His form has seen him get caps and a goal for Scotland which is amazing.“He knowshe performs he’s going to get an opportunity.“There’s been a shortage of strikers, obviously, but you can’t take it away from Lawrence.“Boys can look at him and take confidence and encouragement, even though they might not get a Scotland cap playing in the Championship.“It’s unexpected and a bit out there but,you’re going to perform well over a period of time, there’s chances out there to better yourself.”And Doc puts a large portion of Shankland’s improvement down to the -year-old getting himself into shape mentally as well as physically after joining Ayr.The former Livingston and Airdrie man added: “With any striker when they’re going through a period of good form then it’s got to be about having confidence.“That comes from doing well and what started that off was when he came in at Ayr.“He was maybe a wee bit unfit having not done much over the summer before signing for us and he was unfit the season before – he’d be the first to admit that.“His head wasn’t right so it was a number of things but he come in, got as fit as he could and he’s just in a better space.“He was like a dferent guy to the one I played against before and, once you get that, the confidence and the ability he has makes him unstoppable in the league at times.“I’m fairly close to him and he’s a bubbly character but it’s a quiet confidence.“He wouldn’t be bragging to anyone about anything or in anyone’s face.“He knows he’s good enough and that’s probably what a lot of good players miss in this league.“He’s one where,he misses a chance, he knows he’s going to go and score the next one.”Although a dferent character, Docherty believes Smith is almost as important to the Tangerines as Shankland.“I’m not surprised he’s been one of United’s most consistent players because he was the same last season at Ayr.“He came in and flew under the radar but, with two or three months to go in the season, people were starting to say ‘he’s been amazing for us’.“He did it the whole season but he sometimes goes unnoticed but that’s probably because he is such a quiet boy.“He’s a steady Eddy and he and Lawrence link up well.“They did it at Ayr but when you look at us compared to what Dundee United have in terms of budget this season I’m not surprised they’ve gone and done it again.”Docherty does admit, though, that McDaid’s transformation into a left wing-back under James McPake at Dens Park was unexpected.“I’ve seen recently they’ve been playing a -- so he’s almost been playing wing-back,” he added.“I spoke to him and, obviously, as a winger you never really want to be playing there so he was kind of laughing about it!“At the end of the day, though, it shows that he has that side of his game and will benefit him in the long run.“If people maybe two years ago, and I was probably one of them, had thought that Declan McDaid would be playing wing-back they’d have laughed.“He wasn’t as good defensively but now you can see he’s really improved there.“Whenever we’ve played them or I’ve seen them on the telly he’s been one of their best players this season.“It’s brilliant for him, the same as Lawrence and Liam, that boys from Ayr can go to these other clubs and really perform.”"},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2020/03/DNic_Whorterbank_Signs-7-846x564.jpg ","title":"whorter

If the project needs more money to actually get it built we need to know how much, so that appropriate funding can be sought.What is causing the project to take years to come to fruition The potential for help by the £ million Tarbert and Lochgilphead Regeneration Fund in  was dashed when councillors instead decided that improvements to road junctions, streets, a cycle track and indoor bowling were more important, and allocated a staggering £, to feasibility studies for these projects alone, this is before any work is actually done, you understand.That is a great deal of money for feasibility studies and design works.Let us be realistic # in nine long years the community has gone from the initial excited buzz about a skate park to finally managing to purchase a plot of land upon which to build it in early . From there it seems the project has not been able to move.In the meantime the youngsters who worked so hard to give momentum to the project appear to have given up hope and are now probably giving thought to employment prospects rather than having fun.It is a sad state of affairs.But rather than giving up hope, let us reignite this campaign for our children to have the dream of a skate park in Lochgilphead whilst they are still young enough to enjoy it.Nick MacIneskar, TayvallichSir,With regard to your story in last week#s Argyllshire Advertiser #Inveraray seawall in need of attention#, would it be possible to contact BEAR Scotland and ask themthey could also create an access point to the shore Possibly at the bus stop at Barn Brae. Thanks very much.Marion McIntosh, InveraraySir,I should like to make an appeal to all MPs, MSPs, councillors and all lawmakers that in  they make no new laws.At the beginning of this new decade they should improve the laws they already passed. I would even like for them to go further and reduce the number of laws that are in existence.Now please don’t get me wrong, I am not against all laws. What I fear is that instead of addressing the issues which are negative to iniduals and society, legislators believing that by extending what are regarded as crimes changes society for the better. Their belief is wrong.We know that parking on pavements is wrong #upskirting# is horrying smoking in a car in which they are children is unacceptable dropping litter is shameful driving through a red light is dangerous.What we need is the range of social and cultural influences that help us feel that we should behave in a positive way. In the s, s and s the majority of people regularly attended churches and religious organisations. In these environments people developed feelings of what was right and wrong. Positive behaviour was also developed by participating in the extensions of these organisations through activities in young mother groups women#s guilds, choirs, and religious celebrations. These helped develop positive moral compass in people.Equally, most children and young people went to youth organisations such as the Girl Guides, Scouts, the BBs, army and naval cadets. Even into the s local authorities ran youth clubs and had excellent people called #youth leaders#. No more. #We cannot afford them# is the call of the day. Without them the honourable behaviour of society will continue to deteriorate.So my plea to politicians is simple # stop making us all criminals by passing more and more laws and start supporting and encouraging agencies, groups and people who indirectly and directly instil in iniduals behaviour of which all can be proud.Finlay CraigCoveSir,There is all the hoo-ha at the moment over the lesser royals deciding its going to be a better le that beckons from opting out from royal duties # perhaps wanting a less stressful, more normal, le for themselves and their family as ordinary people away from the media hype and national newspapers.It was lovely, however, to see in the same week front page on the local paper a real regional award for a less well-known commoner.An MBE given for services to the local youth community, making this two great awards for Lochgilphead in recent years and showing that local strong ladies in Mid Argyll do have what it takes.Hard work and true Scottish grit and determination in their hearts for the area and community. More of the same meritorious awards for the ordinary people of Scotland please.Credit to all editors and staff for their outstanding journalism given over the years in all of Scotlands progressive, thriving local papers.Stephen Jones, Oban"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column january 31 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsEver since it was #temporarily# closed to new admissions around two years ago, there has been the suspicion that plans were afoot to close Knapdale Ward completely.The HSCP claims to have consulted widely on the future of the ward, yet patients# relatives, front-line nurses and medical professionals say they were never asked for their views.

So how did Britain look before human interventions  Dense forest  or open woodland Research now favours the latter.Plants and animals evolved in equilibrium for thousands of years before humans impacted the landscape. Essential to this balance were ‘keynote species’ including aurochs , bison and tarpan . By grazing, these animals trampled and eroded soils, dispersed seeds and redistributed nutrients, thereby keeping the forest open. This in turn encouraged growth of large trees while also creating numerous habitats and microenvironments for a wonderful ersity of plants and smaller animals.Now this bioersity is severely threatened by modern monocultures , and massive quantities of pesticides, fungicides, fertilisers and #weed# killers. It is no wonder that insect numbers have plummeted, many bird species are endangered and wild-flower meadows have virtually vanished. So could we recreate this natural order on unproductive land and save our wildle For Isabella Tree and her husband Charlie Burrell the answer is a resounding #yes#. In her book #Wilding#, Tree describes #wilding# their , acre farm at Knepp, West Sussex, that had been unproductive for years.They introduced longhorn cattle, Exmore ponies, deer and pigs but otherwise left well alone. Within months they saw a dference # most scrub was cleared, producing an explosion of plant and animal species. And where grazers were deterred by spiny or unpalatable plants, oaks emerged that will eventually form an open woodland.But Knepp is isolated. More rewilding sites are needed with wildle corridors between them to support the populations and genetic ersity essential for long-term survival.Surely parts of Argyll are ideal for rewilding. We already have beavers creating new waterways to support aquatic species – now how about some large grazers to open up the landscape and perhaps one day recreate the ancient Celtic rainforest "},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column february 7 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsDog walkers on the banks of the Crinan Canal need to take collective responsibility for lting their canine companions# mess.There is no excuse for leaving it lying for others to tread in, push a pram through or meet while cutting grass.The bins are there, so use them.We wish Rhona Love all the best in her shooting career.

As we stood about on deck while the dishes were being washed a boy from one of the motor boats passed in his dinghy. He was wearing blue shorts and red stockings which brought from the Pilot the remark: #In Brodickyou don’t wear red stockings you might just as well be in Lamlash.#All but the Skipper and Mate went ashore on Centre Island for a stroll. The Major was still completely paralysed in his hind quarters but he was full of spirit and when the Bosun held up his hind legshe galloped along. It was a quiet peaceful evening with a very light northerly breeze but it was distinctly chilly and there was a magnicentsomewhat lurid sunset. The shore party back aboard the Bosun took the Tar off in the dinghy and they landed on Eilean na Beithe and while the former explored the island the latter played on a shingly shore – it was long after dark when they ed.At half past ten we began to turn in and, as always on the first evening, this was a longer business then usual as pillows and blankets had to be allocated and pillowslips put on but by a quarter past eleven we were all in bed and shortly after that a light shower pattered on the deck. The problem of what to do with the Doctor’s mattress was solved by the Pilot double banking his bunk. We were all very glad to have had such a good day for the start.It was noticed that voices were still coming from the ladies’ cabin when the last of us in the main cabin fell asleep.The Tanky brought an innovation to the Fulmar # #Quickies# # a patent washing gadget that saved precious water.We had a dead quiet night with, as far as any of us knew, no rain but the forecast was not good, promising north to north-east winds, force  to  with frequent heavy showers. The glass had continued its steady drop. When we turned out, a light but cold north wind was blowing from a well broken up sky.We had a breakfast of bacon and eggs then the Bosun took the Major ashore for his walk. The latter was possibly a little better and was able to take a few steps on the deck, but ashore on the rough ground could do nothing. While they were ashore the big motor boat with the red-stockinged boy left after very nearly going ashore on Seil Island while getting his anchor aboard.At twenty past ten we were away under engine, but as soon as we were outside the sails went up to the north-easterly breeze and we set off for the Sound of Mull. There was no sign of the swell that is usually met south of Kerrera and we got along quite well, but we could not point any higher than a mile or so south of Loch Don. The Pilot went below and brewed a welcome cup of tea which warmed us up, then we took a tack right up to the south coast of Kerrera and had a close up view of Gylen Castle and the Skipper waxed historical.Putting about again we passed close south of the Potlid Island, but when we were about halfway across to Loch Don the wind died and the strong ebb began to force us south and about the same time the rain came on.The engine was started and we headed up for Duart, but our progress was pitully slow, and indeed at one period we but barely held our ground. The Lady Rock and Lismore Lighthouse seemed never to get any nearer closing. When the engine had run an hour we waited for the first sign of the old familiar falter but none came and we began to hope a cure for its stopping had been effected by replacing the HT coil.This change was a despairing effort made because it was the only thing we had not tried, though all the pundits declare it could not possibly be the cause. The engine would either go or not go, they said, and it would never startthe coil was defective. We got one scare when it staggered for a moment, but the Bosun, who was at the tiller at the time, said we had just passed though a big mass of floating seaweed and may have got some round our propeller.As we were to prove later the cure had been found and the engine ran impeccably all the cruise and the Skipper had a lot of unkind thoughts about all the many professional motor experts who had caused him a great deal of trouble, not a little acute anxiety and more than considerable expense through their failure to diagnose a not very obscure disease.As we came up to the Black Memorial Tower Leonora crossed our bows making for Oban and another yachtpassed close by south bound under engine though by this time quite a reasonable and, for then, favourable breeze was blowing from the north-east and our sails were drawing.We learnt later that the owner’s we would not allow a sail to be set under any conditions as long as she was aboard – a pity, we thought, as she certainly was a lovely job and we felt it would have been betterthe we had decided to stay ashore.At Duart we stopped the engine and were able to make good progress, but the rain got heavier and heavier and our sandwich lunch was taken below in relays. Then at about three with the turn of the tide the wind died completely and the engine was started again. Near the Grey Rocks we saw St Roma coming south under power so we altered course to intercept her then at slow speed turned back the way we had come for a few hundred yards while we exchanged news.We heard a thoroughly bad forecast at mid-day, the wind had gone, the rain was stotting in the glassy sea, and, though the glass had come back only a fraction, we decided to call it a day so, with the Bosun the only dissentient, made for Loch Aline. As we turned inshore at Ardtornish we saw Seewolf to the north of us, becalmed but heading south, and guessed she would be joining us later. Coming in, when between Morven Pier and the Ferry Pier, the Skipper held too close to the west shore and the bottom showed up suddenly far too clearly for our peace of mind and a quick sheer out was necessary.Through the narrows we turned to starboard and anchored at half past four in Kyle Bay in a flat calm and the rain coming down heavier than ever. Gratefully we realised that it was not quite as bitterly cold as it had been out in the Sound.Seewolf came in shortly after going very slowly and Hamish Lawrence called over that he had run a big end and was on his way to Oban for repairs and to hand over to brother Alec and his family. Soon after that we were joined by a small motor boat, Saguenay, flying a blue ensign which, in view of her size, the Skipper was sure she was not entitled to do and then a little later, while we were warming up with some coffee, Lindisfarne arrived and anchored close beside us with Guy Clephane in his usual tremendousform – he’s a proper marvel is Guy.Hamish Lawrence came across in his dinghy and came aboard for a gin and while he was there Guy called over inviting Tanky and the Pilot across to Lindisfarne then sent the Pilot back to Fulmar to fetch the Bosun. Hamish gone, the Skipper began to put nine inch tacklines into our line of flags as we had discovered at Rothesay at the Royal Clyde Centenary Regatta that without them our line was about fteen feet too short and we wanted them to be right for the Queen’s visit to Tobermory.When the Pilot came back he and the Bosun got the tents up as the rain was by then torrential.We had a supper of sausages and beans and while the dishes were being done the Bosun took the Major ashore. He was walking a little bettervery slowly, but there was, unfortunately, no concrete results from his exercise.At nine o’clock we went in two loads across to Seewolf and were offered drinks OR tea, but the Skipper insisted on both. We were, however, not allowed any biscuits with our tea as to have them would have meant opening a new box and broaching Alec Lawrence’s stores. The Tanky had not wanted anything but tea, but Hamish had given her a good strong gin which she tried to hide on a shelf behind her and it was only got rid of when the Pilot took it off her hands and quickly put it to its proper use. The Bosun was drinking beer and when he opened up the tin a goodly portion of it bubbled onto the fitted carpet in the cabin.On board Seewolf were, besides the two paid hands, Hamish’s mother and his two sisters. The old lady, well over eighty, was in grand form and waxed eloquent on #The old days# and the greatness of #Belshaft#. Also on board was a great big collie who was obviously petted and spoilt beyond measure and he behaved more like a lap dog than the great big clumsy creature he was.It was half past eleven before we went back to Fulmar all in one load with little enough freeboard for the dinghy considering the conditions. There was a nasty little lop on the water, the northerly wind was bitterly cold, and the rain was as heavy as ever. As quickly as possible we got below and into our warm bunks, not even the Bosun wasting any time about it, though he did read for some time after all the rest were sound asleep."},{"url":null,"title":"bobcast podcast episode 10 nessie and the lost golf balls","story":"The Oban TimesUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsWelcome to Episode  of the Oban Time#s BOBcast.Charting Bob#s progress  and discussing lots of things golfare  presenters Stephen Day, George Graham, Martin Laing and Keith McIntyre.

As part of this project the fund provided MACPool with seven aqua cycles and training from Hydrorider.Arriving early to take photogaphs of the others giving these bikes a go, any sense of nervousness was set aside as I watched healthcare professionals and fitness and well-being enthusiasts laugh and chat through their shot.After some quick adjustments to the bikes June, from our advertising department, and I were raring to go.Partially submerged, the feeling of being weightless combined with the resistance of the water as we began peddling was initially a bit odd. As we got used to the feeling, we started to speed things up, pretending we were racing the rest of our group to The Cairnbaan for a gin and tonic.Finding our rhythm, instructor Kathryn Craig began to lead us through arm exercises. Our co-ordination was put to the test as we carried on cycling while doing simple arm movements that felt more impactive due to the water resistance. Then for the real challenge # floating off the back of the bike while continuing to pedal – not an easy taskyou are short-legged but a workout that feels like it is doing you the power of good.For me aqua cycling is everything I hoped it would be – a fun, impactiveand enjoyable way of exercising. And I could still walk after it!With no aches and pains the next day and still smiling, I signed up for some of the classes.Classes y in intensity and are currently running on Tuesdays from .-.pm, Wednesday evenings from .-.pm and Saturdays from  .-.am.

Editor Andrew McQuarrie grabbed a torch, pulled on his big-boy trousers and joined the funhellipIt was .pm on a Saturday night and I was trying to communicate with a supernatural beingusing a pair of copper rods.Having done as instructed and asked the tools a simple lsquoYes Norsquo question, I was slightly dismayed to see the rods stubbornly remaining still, the spirit apparently refusing to play ball.Sheila, an employee of UK Ghost Nights, appeared quite perplexed as her eyes darted between me and the rods.ldquoAre you a sceptic  she asked, a faint edge of suspicion laced in her voice.I admitted that I was indeed a sceptic, but one who was more than willing to be converted into a true believer.Happy with this answer, Sheila ushered me into a corner that was, she said, known to be particularly popular with spirits.ldquoAre we in Melrose  I asked the rods, willing them to show even the smallest hint of movement.But after a full minute of tense observation, it was plain to see the equipment would not co-operate.An hour earlier, when the ghost experts were delivering their briefing, they had promised the  paying customers that ldquonothing is fabricated on the tours.The insinuation, it seemed to me, was that this would likely not be a night of high drama and theatrics.Nevertheless, I couldnrsquot help but feel a bit disappointed that my opening bid to converse with the dead had fallen distinctly flat.And over the next four hours, so it would prove, my luck would not change much.Yet, as I wandered the portrait-lined corridors of the George  Abbotsford Hotel, trying to channel my inner Bill Murray, some of the people to whom I spoke offered compelling tales.Few were as gripping as those delivered by Dawn Barrett - owner of the hotel for the last  months - and her cooking team.Among the unusual goings-on noted by Mrs Barrett, for instance, were lights turning on and off on their own, furniture moving around, footsteps at all hours and even the feeling of her hair being brushed.Asked for her views on the supernatural, Mrs Barrett said: ldquoI definitely believe - Irsquove seen and heard too much now.It was Mrs Barrett herself who contacted UK Ghost Nights in the first place, with the aim of getting to the root of what makes the hotel tick.ldquoI want to know why they [spirits] are here. I donrsquot understand how they can put lights on and off. I just want to understand it more, she said.Head chef Kailee Reidie, , spoke of an alarming encounter with a spirit who has come to be known as John, supposedly a grouchy ex-chef.As Kailee turned on the fryer one evening, while she was alone in the kitchen, her hair was pulled back so sharply that she was thrown into the table behind her, banging her head.ldquoAs soon as I turned my back on him [John], thatrsquos when it happened, recalled Kailee, going on to explain her emotions at the time.ldquoI was in shock because I knew he [John] was there, but Irsquom not a big believer in ghostshellip Irsquove never seen John - itrsquos just a feeling.Just a feeling. Well, there was certainly a sense of foreboding in some areas of the building - not least the cellar and the attic.In one of the attic rooms, we indulged in an activity called the lsquohuman pendulumrsquo. This entails three people standing in a row, with the person in the middle acting as the spiritrsquos means of communication.When the spirit is asked a Yes No question, the piggy in the middle is expected to rock forwards for a lsquoYesrsquo and backwards for a lsquoNorsquo - a movement being directed by the answering spirit.One by one, the customers lined up to participate in this creepy experiment, watched by the rest of the room with a mixture of excitement and dread.Time and again, the spiritrsquos presence was well felt. In fact, there turned out to be a number of obliging spirits, each surprisingly keen to answer questions including, lsquoDo you have childrenrsquo  and lsquoAre you happy with us being herersquo As I watched this circus unfold, I was praying Irsquod be able to endure the entire episode as an observer, a witness to the craziness.Not so much because I was scared - although I was a little, I must admit - but more because I knew what would happen.,params: .pushldquoAndrew, would you like to have a shot in the middle What followed was several minutes of embarrassment for everyone.Because of course I didnrsquot move. Not even an inch. And the change in atmosphere was so marked that I genuinely wonderedmy trousers had somehow dropped to my ankles without my noticing.Thankfully, my clothes had remained bound to my body, but any faith I might have had in the ghost-hunting process was sliding away fast.As the tour continued, taking in several other locations promising ldquohigh activity, it became increasingly dficult to muster the energy to stay alert, with the clock ticking into the wee small hours.That said, there was one incident which aroused a certain degree of puzzlement - a maglite which appeared to flash when certain questions were posed.Admittedly, that was a curious development. But still not enough to push me into the camp of believers.The more I dwelt on the nightrsquos events, however, the more I came to realise the deeper signicance of it all.Before the tour, UK Ghost Nights founder Lisa Tedstill had made sure I was aware of the crucial equipment to bring.ldquoAll you need is a torch and a sense of humour, she said, going on to lay her finger on the true essence of the affair.ldquoWe donrsquot guarantee there will be any paranormal activity - anyone who does that is a charlatan.ldquoBut we can guarantee everybody will have a very fun experience.And, indeed, while I may have left the George  Abbotsford that night without a firmer belief in ghosts, I certainly ed home with a smile."},{"url":null,"title":"council-powers-handed-chief-meetings-scrapped","story":"PLANS to hand Scottish Borders Councilchief Tracey Logan delegated control of decision-making are expected to be rubber-stamped this week.It comes hot on the heels of Prime Minister Boris Johnsonrsquos instruction that everyone in the UK should spend most of their time at home in order to counter the coronavirus outbreak.But on Thursday , in an unprecedented move, proposals to temporarily delegate the local authorityrsquos decision-making responsibility to the Chief Executive will be passed.Council meetings in Newtown St Boswells will be cancelled until September , with the exception of vital committee meetings which will be done through video-conferencing.SBC chief legal officer Nuala McKinlay stated: ldquoAs the virus makes a wider impact on public le, Scottish Borders Council must consider how to respond.\"In taking any decision to protect health by limiting social contact, it must also ensure processes are in place to enable it to continue to make urgent decisions.ldquoIn order to allow decisions to be made, it is proposed that all those decision-making s of council which can lawfully be delegated, be delegated to the chief executive to be made in consultation with members and relevant senior officers.It is also proposed that any committee meetings which do need to take place between now and October will be held via remote video links.Ms McKinlay added: ldquoThe Local Government in Scotland Act  allows a local authority to y that process and conduct a meeting by other ways.

Shersquos right, of course. We need such stories just now.My response was: ldquoYes, we all need to make our own version of Stone Soup.My youngest daughter overheard me. ldquoYuck, I donrsquot want that, I want porridge for breakfast like usual, she said.I reassured her and reminded her of the story. Itrsquos an old tale Irsquove shared in these pages before. It has many versions and I base the story in a land when there is a famine and people have very little food on which to survive, and so understandably people keep what little they have for their own use.But then a wise traveller fills his pot with water and begins to boil it over a fire. Then he adds a stone. People get curious and ask: ldquoWhat are you making  The traveller replies: ldquoStone soup.ldquoStone soup  Never heard of that.ldquoOh, itrsquos delicious and very filling.ldquoCould I try some ldquoOf course, but it would taste betteryou had something to add to it, says the traveller.And so as the story unfolds, each person adds a little to the pot, which means in the end the soup really is delicious and filling, and there is enough for all, because everyone has shared the little they have.But before they eat, the traveller does one last thing ndash takes out the stone!My daughter remembered the story and was reassured stone soup wasnrsquot on the breakfast menu. But I think the storyrsquos meaning has deeper signicance than just the sharing of food. Itrsquos also about the sharing of ourselves, and how adding a little bit of who we are can transform the pot of community.In the midst of all the fear and panic around us just now, this is what is happening. People are helping out, checking on neighbours and thinking how their own behaviour can affect others who are more vulnerable.And in all this, our mental wellbeing is as important as our physical health. Irsquom reminded of something my motherrsquos partner once told me. His name was Harry. He was originally from Holland and in his childhood he lived through the horric Dutch famine of -.He said: ldquoWe survived on rotten potato soup, tulip bulbs and a joke a day. Sometimes the jokes were as rotten as the potatoes but just as important!We need to smile, laugh and feel connected, especially in dficult times. We can all begin our own metaphorical stone soup and invite others to contribute and share.For example, many of my fellow storytellers are arranging online storytelling sessions. I will be telling stories online for the schools I currently work with and Irsquom happy to do likewise for any other organisation or group ndash once my six-year-old has taught me how the technology works!There are local musicians playing online gigs, people sharing recipes, visiting older family members outside their windows, writing letters and telephoning people for a chat the list goes on. One idea can lead to another, and soon a new community pot is made!Every contribution, no matter how seemingly small, can make a big dference to that pot. And in so doing, it will challenge that sense of despair and powerlessness that so many of us feel right now.So the question should be: Whatrsquos your thing  How can you safely share it  Whatrsquos your amusing or uplting story or your talent  Think about it and letrsquos share, for others, as well as ourselves.And so in the spirit of this, here is my wee contribution for this week itrsquos a funny wee tale passed onto me, so I claim no credit or originality for it. It was told to me by an Irish friend, but Irsquove adapted it slightly.There was this van driver called George who got a job delivering monkeys to the zoo. Unfortunately, his van broke down and while waiting for the mechanic the monkeys began to get restless.Then another van driver called Archie pulled up and askedhe could help.ldquoIrsquom late for my delivery. If I give you pound, will you take these monkeys to the zoo  asked George.ldquoSure, said Archie.So Archie took the monkeys away in his van.George waited for the mechanic and finally his van was repaired. He then set off for the zoo to make sure the monkeys were delivered successfully.But to his surprise, he saw Archie walking along the street with the monkeys!George called out to him: ldquoWhat are you doing  I gave you pound to take the monkeys to the zoo!Archie called back: ldquoI did, but we got a group discount, I have some money left, so now Irsquom taking them to the cinema!"},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus-residents-urged-keep-helping-east-lothian-foodbank","story":"The foodbank, based in Tranent, provides food parcels to vulnerable members of the community.Candace Higgins, foodbank director, said the situation was changing ldquohour by hour, adding: ldquoWe are still operating as normal but certain protocols have been put in place when delivering food parcels.Volunteers making deliveries are now simply knocking on doors or ringing bells, rather than waiting for doors to be opened to them.

It was so strange not being able to give each other a hug, as we have always done over the past  years of our friendship.I chose a walk in which I hoped we would meet nobody , and we walked two metres apart. Despite our plan not to talk about the virus, we inevitably ended up doing just that, although not all the time.The walk took us to the site of the old Byres Kirk, just beyond Ormiston. As hoped, it was deserted, and so we entered.The eeriness of current events affected my behaviour. I walked around with my friend, carefully ensuring I touched nothing. The original kirk built here in  is long gone. It replaced an even older kirk, the remains of which are hidden in private woodland next to nearby Ormiston Hall not far from this site.The first kirk at Byres was eventually demolished and replaced by a neo-gothic building in the s. But after the opening of a new church in Ormiston in the s, Byres Kirk was finally abandoned and eventually demolished in the s.But the graves remain, including war graves, and there is also a headstone erected by Isabella Burns, sister of the famous poet, to the memory of her children.It was this headstone I had come to see. Isabella was the youngest sister of Robert Burns and she lived in Ormiston and Tranent for a while. In  she was widowed, with nine children, three girls and six boys. She set up a village school to help make ends meet.Itrsquos dficult to imagine what her le must have been like, but I think the fact she was part of Robert Burnsrsquo immediate family may have given her a status and a degree of respect most women were denied.I found the stone and was intrigued by it. Two of Isabellarsquos children are mentioned one of them, Edward, died at the age of  in China.ldquoChina  I said out loud to myself, wondering what he was doing there. I saw the date of his death: November , .Then it dawned on me: the Opium Wars! He must have been a soldier. I quickly Googled it on my phone and sure enough he was serving in a regiment there.I stood for a moment, thinking about the story behind this scant piece of information. The Opium Wars are not usually a prominent part of our history curriculum, although they should be. The British state went to war with China to safeguard the ability of British traders to sell opium to the Chinese, which resulted in  million addicts there. Itrsquos a dark part of our imperial history, and the fact that a nephew of Robert Burns ended up dead in China defending state-sponsored drug smuggling by Britain seemed horribly ironic and sad. But it also gave me a sense of the connectedness we all have. The decisions people make, especially those in power, affect the lives of others in ways we will never know or predict.The memorial headstone also had a later inscription which recorded the death of Isabella herself. She lived until she was  and died in . She isnrsquot buried in this graveyard, however, as she spent the last years of her le in Ayrshire and was laid to rest in Alloway Kirkyard.Such a web of le and connection, now mostly long forgotten, revealed by this one memorial stone.As I left, I noticed the trees: oak, sycamore, beech and yew. They seemed to grow out of lost human memory, asthey were now s of forgotten stories.On ourjourney to the car, we passed another memorial stone, this time to the Polish soldiers who had been based in Ormiston Hall in the s during the war. This too is now a time of memory fading, but not forgotten, as the flowers someone left revealed.We had succeeded in a walk seeing almost nobody, except a passing cyclist at the end. Next time we go on such a walk, spring will have arrived undisturbed by human footprints. Keeping people safe must be the priority.Although it was an unusually sombre walk, we found time to laugh and see the funny side of things too. We have to live le, make the best of our time, and the times, we have.And when we can once again regularly venture into naturersquos wonders, what an extra special gt it will seem."},{"url":null,"title":"sleep-boost-prestonpans-youngster-charity-dad-supported-lends-hand","story":"Murray Scott, , liveswith broadcaster dad Mark,  mum Laura, , a supply classroom assistant at The Hub at Sandersonrsquos Wynd Primary School and sister Sophie, seven, a pupil at Prestonpans Primary School.Murray, who attends The Hub in Tranent, has a partially deleted chromosome which affects his development and brain.The condition also affects Murrayrsquos spine and hips he is unable to walk or talk, is doubly incontinent and is tube fed.Murray also has epilepsy and reduced vision, and for the first eight years of his le was unable to sleep through the night.Mark said: ldquoHe was born with it ndash itrsquos a chromosome disorder which neither of us [mum and dad] carries.ldquoHe would have been  months when we got the diagnosis ndash at that point he was one of  [sufferers] in the world.Murray is described by his family as a ldquoreally happy, content wee boy, and ldquoreally good natured.

At a crucial time in the survival of the language, graduates have helped create a Gaelic speaking workforce that now holds key posts across a wide range of sectors in Scotland.Sabhal Mograver Ostaig is one of the key partners in fulfilling the governmentrsquos objectives in the National Gaelic Plan, which aims to increase the number of people speaking the language and accelerate the growth of Gaelic.Many people are keen to learn more about the language because of its rich culture and the college provides a wide range of short courses in Gaelic language, song and traditional music. Ceilidhs, workshops, conversation circles and music sessions all create an encouraging atmosphere that bring together students from  countries across five continents.As a modern, innovative college, Sabhal Mograver Ostaig has excellent learning resources on campus including an exceptional library collection, residential student accommodation, broadcast and recording facilities and a Gaelic medium childcare facility on site.

Those who commit themselves to months alone at sea in the name of le-changing moments, philanthropy and legacies.It was in  that The Sunday Times announced the award of a trophy, The Golden Globe, for the first person to sail single-handed and non-stop around the world. The event was the first organised, non-stop race around the world for iniduals. Those attempting to make the journey had little understanding of how the experience would pan out or how their minds would cope with a year in isolation.The only sailor to complete and therefore win this first feat was Sir Robin Knox-Johnston, who crossed the finish line after  days alone at sea. Knox-Johnston once said: ldquoYou donrsquot really knowyour brain will stay sane. Your sense of humour is absolutely essential.Now a sailing legend, Knox-Johnston founded the famed Clipper Yacht Race, an event he started so that everyone who wanted it ldquocould have the opportunity to experience the challenge and sheer exhilaration of ocean racing.Sir Robin spoke on the current pandemic on his Twitter feed stating: ldquoBack from the Philippines, the crews now home and the boats sitting for the next - months by which time we hope this virus will be history.\"Now in self-imposed isolation for which my past has trained me perfectly. Look after yourselves everyone.A physical challenge on the surface, ocean racing is fundamentally a mental marathon. An endurance test for the mind to adapt in an ever-changing and high-risk environment.As the power and effect of the pandemic takes hold of the world, the constant change of climate and influx of data leads for new adaptions every day. This is an environment not dissimilar to the challenges faced by iniduals who take on these solo excursions.As a marine marketing agency, Gordon Ritchie, director of GRM Marketing, continues: ldquoDealing with offshore yacht racing and rowing can bring out the best in you. All of the small teams or iniduals are normal people doing extraordinary things.\"They are all well planned and determined. They all have a complete resolve to overcome any challenge placed in front of them and are determined to get to the start line ... that can be just as dficult as getting to the finish line where the risk lies mainly with the team or inidual.GRM is no stranger to supporting sailors and rowers making their way to the start line ready to embark on psychological journeys of self-isolation out at sea.The Talisker Whisky Atlantic Challenge is a -mile rowing race beginning in La Gomera in the Canary Islands and ending in Nelsonrsquos Harbour, Antigua. The race can take anything from a record-breaking  days to four, back-breaking months.This year, GRM supported two teams in this race named \"The Worldrsquos Toughest Row\", BROAR as they made their way to the start line and HMS Oardacious in PR during their final stages. In December, team HMS Oardacious became the fastest serving military team to cross the Atlantic and raised nearly pound, to provide mental health and wellbeing support to their submarine community for The Royal Navy and Royal Marines Charity. The charity aims to support personnel, veterans and families as they overcome challenges faced during and after service.Following the impact of the pandemic, mental health has arrived back at the forefront of many online and government discussions. With businesses facing collapse, iniduals facing job losses and with millions now confined to their homes, this pandemic is predicted to move from a physical crisis to a mental one.The anticipation of lockdown and self-isolation has been the anxiety-inducing issue facing iniduals worldwide as we adapt to this new normal. It will take a period of adjustment, but as in all situations and challenges we adapt, and can in time prosper.As serving submariners in the Royal Navy, HMS Oardacious shared their unique insight on self-isolation when embarking on the Talisker Atlantic Challenge.Lieutenant Hugo Mitchell-Heggs explained: ldquoAs a Royal Navy submariner we are well versed with spending extended periods of time deployed, isolated from society, our loved ones and what most would consider home comforts.He continued: ldquoSettling into a routine and being creative is fundamental to onersquos own wellbeing. Itrsquos never easy settling into a new pattern, and even for submariners, the first week at sea is often the most challenging.\"We also observed this on our ocean row, adapting to each other and our teamrsquos dynamic, to our new diet, safety culture and challenging environment. Twenty-foot waves and gale-force winds from day one was challenging, but with the right mindset we adapted and found ways to not just survive but also thrive.\"The benefits of a routine, and building things to look forward to in your day are a fundamental tactic for maintaining motivation and positivity while self-isolating.\"He said the value of a routine was that it \"provides structure to the working day, to the week and to the whole deployment patrol which can often go on for months on end\".\"Nutrition, exercise and mental stimulation are fundamental to thriving. During the ocean crossing, physical stimulation was aplentybut keeping our mental stimulation took being both creative and adaptable: audiobooks, podcasts, Christmas day karaokeand most importantly, conversation with our crew mates ndash whether it was jokes, banter or a lsquodeep and meaningfulrsquo while rowing under a moonlit sky.Upon speaking to Mitchell-Heggs and taking time to reflect, it becomes clear that in this period of crisis, we as a society have found great dficulty in the removal of the freedom to see those that we look forward to seeing, or the cancellation of events we look forward to experiencing. Holidays were the first to go, then events and gigs, now seeing friends and loved ones. What we now need to do is to find things in a simple day routine to look forward to.Your evening meal, your FaceTime to a friend, your weekly trip to the grocery store. Like the submariners who look forward to their short slot in the gym, or their two-minute shower, happiness, contentment and in the extreme, sanity, are found in the simplest of tasks. The tasks we, on a day-to-day, take advantage of being able to do.Nicola Sturgeon explains of these unprecedented restrictions ldquole shouldnrsquot feel normal right now. Soyour le still feels entirely normal, ask yourselfyou are doing the right things. Every time you think about meeting up with, or coming into physical contact with other people, ask yourselfit is entirely necessary\".What also becomes apparent when discussing isolation and its mental challenges are the importance of the snippets of communication and information that keep spirits up when iniduals are miles from the coast or deep beneath the sea.Finding a source of creativity, communicating, staying active is key to survival, as is remaining positive and having a laugh.Though being at sea adds in a whole number of dangers, the general population today faces saying goodbye to their loved ones with no foreseeable end in sight. The concept of self-isolation, a once-unfamiliar term to the masses, has now become every inidualrsquos reality.In the coming months, we will see the effects of this new \"self-isolation\" and begin to understand the trials that sailors, rowers and explorers endure when taking on challenges that disconnect them physically from the outside world.Gordon Ritchie continues: ldquoIn the light of the Covid- outbreak we should consider that we are now at the start line and all we have to do is complete the challenge and get to the finish line.\"The common outcome is that everyone will have gained a lot from the journey, and be in a much better place when the champagne is uncorked.In this time, it is worthwhile to challenge yourself, try something new, learn something, donrsquot stagnate.\"If we can do it isolated in the middle of an ocean, anyone can do it from the luxurious comfort of their homes and with that constant connectivity, muses Lieutenant Mitchell-Heggs.How to beat isolation, by Sir Robin Knox-Johnston\"Isolation can be incredibly frustrating. But it does not have to be.\"People ask how did I manage  days alone at sea, but the answer is that I was constantly busy. I had a boat to sail, navigate , maintain, steer, plus feed myself. But in that lies the answer, create a project to focus the mind and pass the time.\"If you are a yachtsman, you can learn and practice your knots, or how to throw a line ashore. If you are a landsman, well those knots are always useful.\"Bear in mind I had no one to talk with. No communications at all for most of the time, so I had to think of things that would keep me mentally stimulated. I took to learning poetry. We have wonderful poetry in the English language, but anything that makes the mind work is good.\"Now many of us are staying at home with time on our hands, we could put the time to good use. It might amuse children as well.\"Knots are something many of us use daily so why not practice them, and learn a few new ones  It will keep those skills you have learned fresh for when you can get outside and for my Clipper Race Crew ndash when you re-join your boats next year.\"You have probably seen lines thrown from a boat that donrsquot cover the distance, or get tangled on their way. I suggest you go out into the garden with a rope and practice to develop this skill. A quick tip is to make two coils, not too large, and throw the smaller one allowing the larger one to unravel as the first one extends.\"Isolation is something we are going to have to get used to for the next few weeks. I had  days of it, but I had plenty to do during that period which made the time pass reasonably quickly. So there is the answer. Create a project to fill the time.\"I cannot get over to my boats where there is always something to do, so the garden furniture is getting sanded and re-painted and then I will have to face up to the long put-off job of sorting out everything in my Man Cave, apart from sorting out our new Clipper Race schedule, of course.\""},{"url":null,"title":"snp-mps-foreign-secretarys-incompetence-cost-abandoned-scots-lives","story":"SNP MPs Alyn Smith and Stewart McDonald have lashed out at the minister and the Foreign and Commonwealth Officeafter receiving hundreds of emails and calls from their constituents who cannot get home.Years of budget cuts and no comprehensive plan has left the UK Government playing catch-up with other countries such as Denmark, Germany, Ireland and Israel in its attempts to repatriate, the MPs claim.:Dont bring your virus here, Gringos: Scots stuck abroad face escalating tensions as they wait for help to get homeThey are now calling for the army to be used to bring people home, and sayswt action is not taken it could cost lives as the coronavirus pandemic worsens.Speaking to The Herald on Sunday, Stewart McDonald challenged Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab to ldquopull his finger out, while berating airlines trying to ldquomake a fast buck out of abandoned tourists.The Glasgow South MP said: ldquoDominic Raab is showing that he is way out of his depth and it is our constituents who are paying the price for it.ldquoForeign Office Officials advising Members of Parliament to tell their constituents to crowd-fund or try and raise bank loans in order to get home safely during a global health pandemic is about as contemptible as you can get.ldquoThe Foreign Secretary needs to pull his finger out and start a global effort to bring our citizens home.ldquoPeople are being left with little or no money, are running out of critical medicine and in some cases are being left with no accommodation in the country they are visiting.ldquoThe airline industry, many of whom are doing their best to raise a fast buck and want to charge people eye-watering amounts tohome, are proving useless and ought to be ashamed of the way they are trying to extort travellers for money during a global health crisis.McDonald, the SNPrsquos Defence spokesman added that Raab should be using the Ministry of Defenceldquoto ensure that the armed forces ndash logistically well prepared around the world ndash start non-combatant evacuation operations for UK citizens and dual nationals stranded abroad.Should the MoD be utilised in the effort, no additional legislation would be needed as there are already measures in place for non-combatant evacuations.The MP said: ldquoDominic Raabrsquos dither and delay has the potential to cost lives. He needs to pull his finger out and act now.Alyn Smith, MP for Stirling, wrote to Raab on Friday after numerous desperate Scots contacted him for help.He has now accused the Foreign Office of ldquocompletely failing Scots, and said the UKrsquos attempt at repatriation has been woeful in comparison to other countries.The SNPrsquos foreign affairs spokesman said he was ldquofurious at the lack of action to bring people back home, adding: \"Enough is enough, the UK has let our constituents down.ldquoThis has simply not been taken seriously and the FCO is clearly not coping.:Iain Macwhirter on coronavirus: this crisis could bring a Great Depression, not socialism\"The FCO has borne the brunt of years of budget cuts and this sorry state of affairs is the result, I know many FCO officials share my frustration that they are trying to achieve miracles but are overwhelmed.ldquoWeve heard great tell of the broad shoulders of the UK. Well theres plenty of Scots stuck abroad right now who have been comprehensively let down.ldquoIt reflects particularly badly when contrasted with other countries.Smith said the images of hundreds of commercial planes grounded at airports, and staff being put on furlough leave, has made it even more galling for the thousands of Scots stuck abroad.He said: ldquoIt is obvious that there is capacity to organise evacuation flights, just a lack of political will.\"This is not just that people are being inconvenienced, it is an emergency.ldquoI, like many MPs, have heard heartbreaking stories over the last few weeks of people who are stuck having tried every option to get home but have been let down by airlines of people running out of medicine, or money having been let down by their insurance company as well.\"The state needs to step in. We have seen welcome action in some isolated cases but there needs to be a comprehensive plan to get out people home.

In the city itrsquos easy to clock up miles on foot without even noticing, simply going about daily le. In the country, much of what you do requires a car or bus. Unless you have a dog ndash and a great many people round here do ndash it would be possible to live in the lap of hills, heath and woodlands without stepping beyond the garden gate in good weather and the front door in bad. This friend can go for months without getting her crampons on.Yet it is hard resist the call of the wild. On fine weekdays, as I sit at my desk, I hear the villagersquos retirees clumping past in their hiking boots, leaving base for an attempt on the nearby peaks, or merely a gentle stroll along the riverbank. Hoolet has more than its fair share of Munro-baggers, lean folk with the legs of grasshoppers and enough puff to inflate a hot-air balloon. There are so many dedicated walkers, in fact, that it probably partly explains why theyrsquove chosen to live here. Whatever the starting point, there are enough paths and trails to carry you across the borderlands and deep into Northumberland without using a drop of petrol.Another of my northern chums ndash she works on farms but still has the face of an English rose ndash has been planning a visit with her pony. She hopes to ride through Roxburghshire to Lindisfarne, a journey of  or  miles. As she BBs her way south, she requires not just bed, bacon and scrambled eggs but a basket for her sheep dog and grazing for her packhorse.Few things are more frustrating than not being able to stretch your legs because yoursquore working, knowing that others are out there having fun. My husband is often one of them, ing bright-eyed, invigorated, and caked in mud. He could feature in a detergent ad, though moleskins and scratchy socks coated in a rich chocolatey goo are not as photogenic as grubby football strips or toddlers drenched in spaghetti sauce.When I do get out, however, there is nothing quite like it. I can either walk up the back garden and out of the gate through the sheep field towards the lower slopes of the hills, or head into the village until I reach the woods. The first route takes me past cherry trees that in summer are laden with fruit, dangling from every branch assomeone has gone overboard decorating the Christmas tree. Itrsquos no wonder the place is alive with birds, who can gorge themselves on a daily replenished source of fruit, nuts, seeds, and the insects that nibble among them. With the squirrels getting back up to speed after winter, competition will soon heat up.One of our bird feeders fell out of the apple tree last week, thanks, I suspect, to a swinging squirrel that chases off the finches and blue tits whenever it swarms up the tree trunk. I watched the other morning as it dangled upside down from the summerhouse roof, desperate to find a way into the new feeder wersquove hung there, specially designed to keep it out. So far itrsquos showing far more interest than the birds. Who knows, maybe it willwith wire-cutters Up in the woods I once followed a squirrel that ran ahead of me for half a mile, turning to peer over its shoulder every few seconds asto make sure I was keeping up. Occasionally Irsquove come across roe deer, who take a startled look before leaping away like show jumpers. These woods are my favourite part of the walk, beech masts crunching underfoot, and thick drts of leaves hiding treacherous roots and holes. Thanks to the abundance of larches and pines, I sometimes catch the scent of the aftershave my father used to wear. And, even when rain is thundering, the canopy is so dense that in here it is dry.Itrsquos another world when you emerge from cover and start climbing. Leaf mould gives way to gorse and heather and a rutted track. We once met a man leading his horse as he bent double poring over the ground. He was retracing the route where, at some point, he had dropped his car keys. We took his number in case we came upon them, but yoursquod need a metal detector out here to have any chance. Scree and boulders, waist-high bracken and swamps of moss could swallow anything pocket-sized for the rest of eternity.By this point itrsquos high enough to catch a breeze, even on virtually windless days. Out on the hilltops themselves it can blow so hard that not just untethered hats are in danger but even sunglasses can go flying. Yet blustery or calm, sodden or sunny, the view from the summit stops time in its tracks.Spread out below is a peaceful landscape of fields and trees, sheep and cattle, and the occasional dawdling car. The hazy blue Cheviot hills fade into the distance, snow still clinging. In one direction lies the nearest town, dinky as Lego. In the other the horizon disappears much as it has for centuries. On my favourite peak, in fact, there is evidence of bronze age settlement, the trace of ancient forebears right beneath our feet.Itrsquos a reminder that, geology apart, what you see from up here is a largely manmade picture, the product of aeons of habitation and cultivation. Despite, or perhaps because of, that, getting a larkrsquos eye view is a great leveller. This vantage point invites you to think of those who came before, and those who are to follow. It also heightens respect for those creatures working ceaselessly to survive, never knowing what tomorrow holds. The sense of smallness and transience this provokes is oddly reassuring."},{"url":null,"title":"four-walls-isolation-diary-ally-mclaws","story":"Since then hersquos had his left lung removed at the Golden Jubilee Hospital in Clydebank but the cancer remains active ... last week he received his first treatment of two separate chemotherapy drugs alongside an immunotherapy drug treatment.Today the first of his regular Sunday columns begins as he stays tightly locked up in isolation in his Ayrshire home with all the complications and side-effects of chemo treatment and low immunity, as we face up to the escalating threat and challenges of ldquothe virus.Between These Four WallsLEADING crisis communications for the NHS when Glasgow Airport was ldquofire-bombed in  by terrorists seems childrsquos play compared to whatrsquos happening today ... even though one of the bombers was a doctor working at Paisleyrsquos Royal Alexandra Hospital.Leading comms for the NHS in Greater Glasgow during the  HN swine flu pandemic seems altogether more relevant.There was worldwide concern. The first death outside of America was in Scotland. In fact, it was at Paisleyrsquos Royal Alexandra Hospital ndash a young woman who had recently given birth. Eventually the pandemic would officially claim  Scottish lives. Few doubt the real figure was actually much higher.Fear gripped the UK ndash and Scotland in particular ndash as public health colleagues were thrown into round-the-clock emergency mode with dedicated flu jab vaccine clinics hurriedly set up to keep potential carriers of the virus away from GP surgeries and other health facilities normally used for the flu jab.There was a shortage of the vaccine and there was a clamour to get protected ndash there was also huge concern over the lack of knowledge about how to best use and deploy PPE . The emergency departments of our hospitals were revealed as wanting in their ability to prepare and deliver fit-for-purpose pandemic handling strategies. Ambulance crews complained of exposure without appropriate PPE.Eventually it all calmed down and went away, and public attention moved to fresh topics. The daily norm of short-termism, political sparring for short-term gain and the creation of headlines that momentarily seem hugely important regained pole position as the stale staple diet of Scotland, the UK, Europe, and the world.But in the world of public health protection the experts knew nothing had really changed. That our brushes with avian flu in  and swine flu in were just tasters of what would inevitably come to bite our proverbial butts.I remember one of the most respected public health consultants in Scotland ndash Dr Syed Ahmed ndash addressing health board seminars and presenting with absolute certainty the evidence that predicted a far more signicant influenza pandemic would strike ndash notbut when ndash and that the death toll would be enormous.The scientic evidence was overwhelming, and he and other experts at the World Health Organisation and public health epidemiologists around the world were in absolutely no doubt it would happen ndash ldquothis year, next year, in a few years ... we donrsquot know which year but we do know it will happen.Now, with time to reflect on things past and present, I sit in my converted garage office and wonder how it is that so many people in power, so many policymakers and scientists, influential iniduals and organisations, could have ignored such stark evidence. I wonder how they focused so much on Brexit and income tax levels, and how many immigrant entry points should be given to fruit pickers wanting to enter the UK ... when such matters as preparation for a pandemic were sidelined, and climate change given but a glancing nod from the worldrsquos most powerful nations and leaders.Irsquom not angry. Irsquom too old for that. I am disappointed but I am also hopeful ndash truly hopeful ndash that after this crisis has passed there will be a new order of priority and a new beginning for a post-Covid generation to re-order the world.My own mortality remains a concern and I am openly afraid of the risk of leaving my sanctuary in a few days to attend a clinic where I must give blood prior to attending my second treatment session for chemo and immunotherapy at the local Crosshouse Hospital, just outside Kilmarnock.I keep myself sane by posting a ldquodaily smile story on my Facebook page, on Twitter and on LinkedIn. My wonderful children and my equally loving stepchildren and grandkids keep my spirits up with phone calls, message bag drops at the door, a wave in the window. My amazing we Laura nourishes my heart and soul with kindness and care.I have cancer at probably the worst time imaginable but I am so very lucky.

Residents and guests will enjoy flawless service and first-class leisure facilities, it promised.Said to hold the prospect of creating more than , jobs and injecting millions in the local economy, locals may well have been forgiven for thinking gWest was set to propel the village of Blackford on to the global golf map.But despite the course being designed by leading Scottish golf architect David McLay-Kidd ndash whose courses include the Castle Course at St Andrews ndash and completed in , gWestrsquos greens have been played by only a handful of golfers.Now, after being shrouded in mystery for years, a member of the fabulously rich al-Tajir family has broken the silence to suggest the Scottish independence debate and Brexit turmoil are behind the resort being ldquobunkered.Speaking on BBC podcast The Patch, Mohsin al-Tajir, son of Highland Spring owner Mahdi Mohammed Al Tajir ndash whose fortune is estimated to be at least pound. billion ndash laid blame for what seems to be a decision to mothball the resort, on political issues.ldquoAt the moment Brexit has come along, Scotlandrsquos screaming for independence and the next phase of gWest is another pound, pound, poundm, and as a family wersquore not willing to put that sort of money inwe donrsquot know what the future is, he said.ldquoIf tomorrow Scotland got independence and they decided to turn it into a tax haven like Monaco, wersquod be the first there to put the money in. In fact, wersquod put three or fourcourses in and build another two hotels, he added.ldquoBut the way we are today where it looks like taxation is going to go up, the local councils and local villages are going to control everything around them ... maybe itrsquos not the place I need to put my money. There are better places to put it.Along with his comments about the gWest site was a suggestion that complaints and objections to an extension to the Highland Spring business had had a detrimental impact on the familyrsquos view of the area.ldquoItrsquos like they have this thing they donrsquot like to see successful people, he added. ldquoTheyrsquod much rather hear that he has gone bankrupt rather than he has made money or become big.ldquoWhen we built the extension to Highland Spring, the amount of people that objected ... I was feeding your family for past  years, why would you object  he added. ldquoWhy are you objecting, itrsquos your livelihood for Godrsquos sake.The comments have stung locals in the village of Blackford, which sits at the heart of the Al Tajir familyrsquos estate, and who have watched the area change dramatically.It is claimed that since the golf coursersquos construction, once familiar rights of way are no longer as accessible as they once were.There have been whispered complaints about over-zealous security guards, bulls seemingly deliberately put in fields to deter walkers, and a sense that the land is ldquoout of bounds.ldquoWe have core paths and assorted rights of way across the land but they donrsquot want members of the public going anywhere near it, said one local resident, who asked not to be named. ldquoThere are gates butyou try to walk through, yoursquoll be challenged by a security guard. He will say you have no right to be there, that it could be dangerous.ldquoIf you are building a resort with multi-million-pound homes, you donrsquot want a core path running outside the houses.ldquoIt feels like itrsquos them and us.According to Iain Paton of Blackford Community Council, the ldquoghost golf course has left people wondering what its purpose is,it doesnrsquot have any players.ldquoPeople are mystied, he said. ldquoIt is curious that therersquos a golf club that seems well-maintained but hasnrsquot been used.ldquoThere are rights of way across it, but when people last year tried to exercise their right to cross, they were apparently being chased off.ldquoThere was a security guy there ndash I think lsquointimidatingrsquo is a good word for it.ldquoItrsquos not like the course is surrounded by wire fencing, or that people arenrsquot able to go on it at all. It just not exactly welcoming.Plans for the resort were well under way when the global markets crashed in . That crisis is thought to have led to the vision being reviewed. However, by , plots at the gWest resort were being marketed for sale and businesses offered the chance to play the course.However, political uncertainty caused first by the independence referendum and then Brexit is now said to have put off international investors and led to the development being mothballed.However, local Perthshire and Kinross councillor for Strathallan, Tom Gray, wonderstherersquos another, even harder problem to solve that may be a factor. ldquoThe climate here isnrsquot the best to place for a resort, not unless you want to go fishing or get wet, he says. ldquoThis is Blackford, itrsquos not St Andrews where they can probably play golf all year round. I think yoursquoll find lots of puddles on a course around here.ldquoClimate change is definitely having an impact here. Even in my letime Irsquove seen huge changes. Agriculture has changed ndash this used to be mixed arable and stock rearing area. Now itrsquos too wet for crops.ldquoThere was surprise at how ambitious the plans were for the site. The sums being spent were very large. That took people by surprise. Blackford was never a huge destination. It was just a stopping-off point on the A.For golfers who dream of the next challenge, gWest must feel so close, yet so far away.One of the few people to have struck a ball there is Al Tajir himself. Speaking on the podcast, he said: ldquoI have played gWest  or  times. Itrsquos dferent, itrsquos a modern course. Anything hard, I donrsquot like.As to the future, perhaps all is not lost for golfers hoping to challenge their swing at Scotlandrsquos ldquoghost golf club.ldquoEventually when the economy picks up in Scotland and we can see what is happening in the future, we will develop it properly, he added."},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus-can-help-make-things-little-better","story":"What a week! Its good to have the opportunity to sit back and try to make some sense of it all from a volunteering perspective.First and foremost the clapping hands applause for our NHS was a wonderful recognition that they are on the frontline and wersquore with them. You could say that the applause summed up the massive groundswell of mutual support that has heartened us all in the middle of this awful plague. Volunteering at its heart is the friendly coming together of people, to make a positive contribution. Wersquove all seen this in abundant examples of community spirit, and very challenging it is to do this along with social distancing.How wonderful for us to experience the giving nature of all our citizens and realise that we do have a society based on relationships and looking out for each other. Part of this, of course, is to keep in mind our ldquoDuty of Care. Protecting our selves, ensuring that we donrsquot put anyone in unnecessary risk, and being disciplined about the key aim of staying at home and helping the NHS to cope with the demand to save lives.The UK Government captured the zeitgeist of our willingness to help and the extraordinary ,-plus registration of NHS volunteers for England and Wales only. However, Irsquom a believer in a time of crisis that you need directive leadership, ldquocommand and control. This requires clarity about whatrsquos needed where, and when. While itrsquos heart-warming to see this supply side so keen, whatrsquos the actual demand for peoplersquos service Scotland has taken a more measured approach and has been using the head as well as the heart.From next week readyscotland.org will provide a starting point for anyone that wants to volunteer.This will be a coordinated effort to signpost you to where the needs are now, and also to give the option to get involved at dferent phases of this crisis.Therersquos whatrsquos needed now, with the role of the countryrsquos network of Resilience Partnerships, including local neighbourhood Resilience Hubs where these are in place. Therersquos a mobilisation under way, and I hope to witness a lot more of these hubs over time. Community action is core to this, and East Ayrshire Council and my old boss Fiona Lees is a great example of this.Then therersquos the period of the greatest strain on the NHS and the prospect of directed volunteer assistance for the frontline. Driving, collections, ward support, feeding patients, and doing whatever is necessary under the command of the NHS and the standards required. The British Red Cross will be playing an expert and vital role in matching NHS need to volunteers, and this will be clearly communicated on the Ready Scotland web site.Irsquove been listening to Professor John Ashton, the public heath expert from Liverpool. He said that we can assist the NHS in a major way by helping get patients back home quickly, and this will need home care, from workers and community volunteering, including basic nursing skills. Has our ldquoDuty of Care now dramatically extended into the moral sphere of caring for each other in ways we havenrsquot been thinking about, and is it less about not doing harm and more about generating wellbeing for us all Once we get through this, we then need to focus on recovery. There has not been the same attention paid to this because wersquore caught up with our immediate challenges. However, the greatest potential of volunteering will be at the recovery stage. Most of the countryrsquos volunteers, along with the workforce, are at home just now.Irsquom talking to people about what it might be like at the other end. About regaining our volunteers and associational le. About getting for instance all the walking groups re-started. Health walks. Talking about how wersquore faring and generating the whole spectrum of volunteering le through mutual support, formal service, and civic engagement and campaigning.The Covid- crisis has been likened to a war. At the end of the Second World War the new expectations of women, troops and citizens led to a transformation in society, including the establishment of the NHS itself.

We couldnrsquot run as we normally did, but we knew there were people out there who would need help, and some of the people we see live with dementia.ldquoSending out packs of fruit and veg just wouldnrsquot work for us as the recipients might not be able to cook for themselves. So we have had volunteers cooking in the centre ndash anything from spaghetti bolognese to curries and soups.\"Our volunteers who would normally help in the centre are now out driving their vans, and they themselves are over .Working during such strained times doesnrsquot come without its risks given how fast coronavirus can spread with the numbers of those infected in the UK rising daily, and it means strict measures are in place.ldquoEverything has to be done safely. When we deliver the food supplies we leave it at the door. There cannot be any face-to-face dealings now both for our volunteers and the people we are going to. We have to stay healthy in order to be able to run our facilities for as long we are allowed to. We donrsquot knowthere might come a time when we have to close.As has been widely seen across Scotland, people have been only too willing to offer help.ldquoWe have had some people offering to volunteer, which is wonderful and well-meaning, but we have to maintain a familiar bond with the people we see and we couldnrsquot just send someone new in. At this time we are catering for more than  families, and that ranges from elderly people who normally come through the door to vulnerable families who have been put in touch with us.

We already have a link-up with Arnold Clark who service our vans, but one of the members of staff was with us in the kitchen helping to make meals.While families are split apart, some just streets away, during this nationwide lockdown, others are a few hundred miles away.Mrs Quinn added: ldquoWe have had calls from relatives of people living down south who canrsquot travel up to see their family. They just want to know that there loved one is getting something to eat. And we will do that for as long as we can.While Heart of Scotstoun is an existing group which has adapted, other groups have sprung up in direct response to the coronavirus.One Facebook group in Edinburgh is trying to connect people in a time of need.Torben Hutchings set up Facebook group Coronavirus Volunteering Edinburgh just over a week ago and has now helped to put in place a connections page.He said: ldquoOur page is all about helping people get the right information and access to information they need right now. It is not about the group giving the advice, but we thought there was a way we could put people in touch with those who could.ldquoMarkus Ronde, Yuchen Shang, Daniel Connell and myself have been working on it, and it has really grown in the past few days to the extent we even have subgroups for specic issues such as access and disability, mental health, entertainment and welfare and, most importantly, the Local Group Locator which links people who are nearby.\"We also set up a survey and a database that volunteers could sign up to, which would allow charities to get in touch with volunteers based on their postcode.ldquoHandling the information of what could be a very large number of people was not something we took lightly, and we had to pause slightly and take stock to prevent setting up a system that might be abused or expose volunteers to undue liability or stress.ldquoWithin a couple of days all social media elements were up and running and working well, and groups were continuing to pop out of the woodwork and connect in to our set up.The group has also had to adapt and respond as advice and guidance changed.Mr Hutchings added: ldquoEdinburgh is a big city and following the declaration of a UK-wide lockdown, we are going to ask people in these groups to limit their inidual volunteering activities to their immediate areas even as close as stairwells and streets. We canrsquot really have people running from one end of town to another when this is all about helping to stop the spread of the virus.Another group which is serving its community is Kinross Kindness in Perth and Kinross and they are thinking outside the box and have even held a virtual coffee morning to bring people together.Founder Tim Mart got the balling rolling and already they have dozens of people in the community offering to help.Mr Mart said: ldquoOur aim is to create a support network of incredible humans to help those needing to or thinking about self-isolation. That through kindness and compassion, they can do so in confidence and in knowing that their community is here to support them.ldquoWe have more than  protecting vulnerable groupschecked volunteers of all ages supporting with phones, pick ups and deliveries. We just held our first virtual community coffee morning with music from the amazing Gillian Strachan, a worker at the local youth group KYTHE ndash Kinross-shire Youth Enterprise.ldquoThe over-arching response from the vulnerable groups in the community has been a feeling of reassurance and confidence that Kinross Kindness exists.ldquoWe also raised pound as part as a slush fund for those that cannot afford essentials at this time.ldquoAlong with the many collections and deliveries we have undertaken, one of the interesting stories this week has been supporting a woman in Canada to arrange shopping for her  year-old grandparents in the Kinross-shire community who have been unable to leave their property.Volunteer Scotland, the body national body for volunteering, said they have seen traffic to their website increase along with the number of inquiries.Alan Stevenson, IT  Communications Manager, Volunteer Scotland, said: \"Wersquore seeing a spike in demand for people looking to volunteer at this time.

There is, after all, very little to be cheery about when writing about war, famine, pestilence or disease day in, week out ndash the current pandemic being a point in case.That said,you really want to see a misery guts, then look no further than the foreign correspondent unable to dash around the world covering the stories he did up until recently.My long-suffering we, who has grown accustomed, one might even say welcoming, of my often prolonged absences these past many years, has taken to ascribing another epithet to me given my current enforced hiatus.The Victor Meldrew of international reporting, she calls me, adding a new chapter to the imaginary ldquoVictor Diaries she is writing as I daily fit the role of the archetypal grumpy old man from the sitcom One Foot In The Grave. Yesterday saw two new chapters ndash ldquoVictor does pasta and ldquoVictor hates Jeremy Vine.Speaking, however, of real writers, it was the great William Howard Russell, an Irish reporter with The Times, who covered the Crimean War in the s who is often considered as having been one of the first modern war or foreign correspondents. It was also Russell who described those within our profession as a ldquoluckless tribe.Our species, he concluded, verges on the obsessively curious and is part nomad, voyeur and masochist. We are also, he observed, iniably resourceful, prone to being selfish loners and almost always cunning and pushy.Irsquod like to disagree with Russellrsquos character take but I canrsquot. In many respects hersquos bang on the money. Whatrsquos more, so many of these distinguishing traits are ideal in the time of Covid-. Call them war correspondent survival instincts or coping mechanisms.Certainly, from a voyeurrsquos perspective, it means one never tires of watching from my flat window the battles between seagulls and pigeons that now appear to have taken over the streets of Glasgowrsquos Merchant City where we live.The selfish loner bit too comes in especially handy when yoursquore stashed away indoors alongside your ton of bog roll and bottles of gin. Then therersquos the cunning and pushy bit, which is particularly handy during those once-a-day forays out into the no manrsquos land of the pandemic to requisition said bog roll and bottles of gin. Where things do get tough though, and the foreign correspondentrsquos guile and resourcefulness are just not enough, is in making sure that nomadic and storytelling desire is fulfilled.Like the best pub raconteurs you see, foreign correspondents, like most reporters, love the power of the yarn and instinctively know that the quirky or human detail which says ldquoI was there is what makes stories come alive for the audience.All of which got me thinking in these times of self-confinement about the many wonderful places, inspiring people and bizarre experiences Irsquove encountered during almost  years of journeying to locations most people would avoid for good reason.Such adventures, of course, always begin with a journey, something which after the best part of four decades on the hoof I never thought of myself pining for ever again until these self-isolating, self-distancing days.Isolation and distance, after all, are near meaningless to the foreign correspondent. The world of international news coverage is no respecter of standing still, mileage, time or circumstance.I recall once, while on the last days of a holiday in Spain in , getting news of the sudden eruption of a war between Israel and the paramilitary forces of Hezbollah in Lebanon. Within hours of getting home from holiday and with an alternative set of bags packed, complete with body armour and helmet, I headed off almost immediately.Given that Beirut airport was shut down because of Israeli bombing, the journey ended up being somewhat circuitous. Early on, colleagues already in Lebanon had warned me that the banks and ATMs in Beirut were closed and that I should bring all the money I needed for the duration of my stay.Having been in Spain just prior to my departure for the Middle East, including a day trip to Morocco, I had over the course of a week withdrawn cash from ATMs in Tangier, Tara in Spain, Glasgow, London, Vienna, and Damascus in Syria before arriving in Beirut to a telephone call from a rather concerned representative of my bank.ldquoEven by your standards, Mr Pratt, this activity seems quite unusual, he observed, before pausing briefly and asking only half jokingly ndash ldquoAre you on the run So many of such journeys over the years, often to the remotest places, have been memorable and iniably involve flying.Flying, remember that  Already it seems like and age since I last stepped aboard a plane, not that I ever imagined missing air travel. Early in my career I confess to being a little anxious about flying, but later I grew to love it despite some of the crazier moments.Moments like that time in the Democratic Republic of Congowhen I went to cover a story on the legal and illegal gold mining trade that flourishes in some of the remotest bush and jungle territory in this vast resource rich country.For weeks I found myself in the hands of two bush pilots ndash Chris ldquoPeppersteak Laidler and Paddy Hyndman. For the best part of seven years, Laidler and Hyndman had worked as bush pilots flying in and out of one of the continentrsquos most politically volatile areas ndash the Great Lakes region that straddles Uganda, Rwanda and the vastness of northeastern Congo.In that time, Laidler had picked up ndash along with a few furrows on his brow ndash the Peppersteak nickname, because as Hyndman pointed out, it doesnrsquot matter what kind of restaurant he goes to, Thai, Italian or Indian, itrsquos always the same order ndash pepper steak.Young, modern men these aviators might be. But despite their occasional penchant while airborne for listening on their iPods to The Killers, there still seemed something of a pioneering streak in their nature more in tune with the values of a bygone age. A time in history when enormous risk-taking was par for the course in exploring places like Africa, and shrugged off with insouciance and black humour only those confident enough in their own resourcefulness were able to muster.Indeed, many of the pilots I met in Congo might have come from the pages of books like Wind, Sand And Stars by the French writer and aviator-adventurer, Antoine de Saint-Exupery.Northeastern Congo has always looked and felt like the setting for a Boyrsquos Own tale of derring-do. At some of the bigger airstrip towns like Bukavu and Goma, on the banks of Lake Kivu, the runways are flanked by ancient Dakotas and Antonov biplanes of the type any locations researcher for Raiders Of The Lost Ark would have died for.And speaking of Indian Jones-type moments, I all too vividly recall one take-off when a wall of jungle came hurtling towards us at a terrying speed. Not for the first time I could feel myself willing the plane into the air. ldquoUp, up, I heard the voice inside my head saying, as my body involuntarily bobbed up and down in the seat like a demented African meerkat.It wasnrsquot just the roughness of the rutted dirt runway that was making me bounce. It was the desperate psychological urge to help propel our take-off safely over the trees into the humid air that hung like a saturated canopy above the rainforest.Having cleared the tops with barely feet to spare, the aircraft suddenly banked so steeply that the horizon became virtually vertical and I felt my stomach lurch as gravity tugged at my insides. Just as I was reassuring myself that the worst was almost over, the fuselage door at the back of the plane suddenly flew open, sending a deafening blast of air into the cabin. So powerful was it, that the heavy industrial harnesses used to hold the cargo of highly inflammable fuel drums we were carrying on board fluttered like celebratory bunting.Next to me, our only ldquoofficial passenger ndash a Congolese gold mining engineer ndash was anything but celebratory. Having clamped his hands instinctively to the armrests of his seat, his eyes were full of fear and looked ready to pop out of his head.Glancing anxiously towards the cockpit, it slowly dawned on me that the planersquos co-pilot, Paddy Hyndman, was actually gesturing at us to try and shut the hatch through which the Congolese jungle could be seen sweeping past a few hundred feet below.He had to be kidding. Already this was all getting a bit too Indiana Jones for my liking. Shamefully, I decide to remain seated and watched as my indomitable cameraman colleague, buffeted by the wind, edged his way back up the aircraft, before getting his shoulder behind the door and heaving it shut. Not surprisingly, the experience was enough to leave lesser mortals like my fellow passengers and me on the edge of mental meltdown. For Chris and Paddy, however, who sat grinning in the cockpit, it was all just another day at the office.Right now itrsquos adventures like this that I yearn for, well sort of. Just as I miss the travel and freedom to move as we all do, so too do I miss engaging with myriad characters, soldiers, refugees, warlords, aid workers, and perhaps most importantly of all, ordinary civilians from around the world.Itrsquos strangely reassuring right now to think of all those people and places Irsquove encountered over the years. The remarkable indigenous Embera people of the rainforests of Colombia, for example, who I spent time with in their remote communities flanking the Rio Andagueda or ldquoRiver of Butterflies as it is known. For them, isolation is something they desire. Nothing makes them happier than being away from the destructive intrusion of an outside world that brings with it the illegal mining that threatens a way of le close to nature they have nurtured for centuries.ldquoWhen we remember our ancestors, we can see the future, one Embera man told me when asked what he thought the years ahead held for his people. There is a lesson there for us all in these strange times.Like so many people in remote and often dficult places, the hospitality of the Embera was a joy to behold. Hospitality and humour, these are the qualities I think most about just now when Irsquom reflecting on my travels. I once recall ndash for a joke ndash having my photograph taken alongside a village chief in South Sudan. He was the tallest man Irsquod ever seen and made the average basketball player look diminutive.Short as I am, even standing next to him on a wall the best part of two feet high, he still towered above me. The hilarity of the entire village, especially the children, was infectious and left us all in bouts of uncontrollable laughter. It was a simple but marvellously wonderful instant of common humanity.Over the years Irsquove talked with voodoo priests and artists in Haiti, danced the gazumba with young Angolans in a basement bar in Huambo, and been caught trying to illegally cross the Pakistan-Afghanistan border, disguised as a woman dressed in a burka and sandals complete with painted toenails.Irsquove eaten sheep brain masala in a ldquorestaurant in the Khyber bazaar and guzzled beer through a gas-mask nozzle at an ldquoApocalypse Party in a Tel Aviv nightclub, as Iraqi missiles fell on the city. These are the rich, warming and sublimely odd experiences that for the moment I miss.I still have that gas mask, which only makes an occasional appearance now when I want to play the role of ldquoalien and terry the children of visiting friends and relations. Come to think of it, though, now might be a good time to wear it while making those occasional forays for the bog roll and bottles of gin.Yes, folks, what you have just been reading has not been my usual look at the world. But I still remain that ldquointernational man of misery,only because like so many of us Irsquom missing the rich ersity of the world we so took for granted. I canrsquot wait to get back on the road.Yours sincerely hellip a frustrated foreign correspondent."},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus-scotland-help-people-useful-numbers-stay-safe","story":"Follow Government advice to protect yourselves and others ndash stay at home unless essential to leave.You should only leave the house for one of four reasons:If you need medical help for any reason, do not go to places like a GP surgery, pharmacy or hospital.If you have symptoms of coronavirus , use the  coronavirus service.If you need help or advice not related to coronavirus::Coronavirus: seven video games to play during lockdownAge Scotland www.ageuk.org.uk scotlandTelephone Age Scotland Helpline   Health guidance for pregnant women and maternity professionals looking after them has been produced by the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists.www.rcog.org.uk en guidelines-research-services guidelines coronavirus-pregnancy covid--virus-infection-and-pregnancy Guidance is also available as part of the general QA on the NHS Inform website www.nhsinform.scot illnesses-and-conditions infections-and-poisoning coronavirus-covid-#common-questionsDisability Information Scotland runs a helpline and hosts useful information.www.disabilityscot.org.uk Citizens Advice Scotland www.citizensadvice.org.uk scotland health coronavirus-what-it-means-for-you Skills Development Scotland www.citizensadvice.org.uk scotland health coronavirus-what-it-means-for-you The Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Service hwww.acas.org.uk adviceStepChange www.stepchange.org debt-info debt-and-coronavirus.aspxNational Debtline www.nationaldebtline.org EW factsheets Pages coronavirus-advice-and-support help-and-advice.aspxSamaritans Scotland offers a -hour Freephone helpline plus an email support service www.samaritans.org  or call on  Check the Scottish Association for Mental Health www.samh.org.ukHelp and advice, including about funding, is available from SCVOrsquos Covid- Third Sector Information Hub.scvo.org.uk support coronavirusThe Scottish Commission for People with Learning Disabilities provides links to useful easy-read resources on Coronavirus www.scld.org.uk Enable Scotland offers support for people with learning disabilities as well as a helpline www.enable.org.uk coronavirus-information Alzheimers Scotland www.alzscot.org living-with-dementia getting-support -hour-freephone-dementia-helplinehelpline@alzscot.org ndash   There are other ways you can contribute to the national response to coronavirus.

An investment would have increased our capacity to do something, austerity did the opposite, needlessly squeezing public spending and destroying countless jobs in the supply chain, leading to a decade of economic stagnation.It is vital to realise that when the Government grasped the scale of the crisis, pound billion was made available. This was not money saved up for a rainy day, it was money simply created to allow the Government to redirect the economy to a dferent path. If we need another billion pounds or another trillion, it can also be made. When the economy s to running at full capacity, we can choose to pay for it through some combination of lower spending and higher taxes and higher inflation. But not until then.

One of the inconvenient truths emerging about the disease is the number of very valuable health care workers who have become seriously infected with the disease whilst trying to aid their patients.This brings me to ponder the future method of providing health care for this type of epidemic given its sheer scale. We must therefore keep those presenting with new diseases away from our general hospitals.Would it not be possible to start designing and constructing large-scale isolation and treatment and control units with one huge central floor area ward to accommodate the very ill  All support systems would be bolt-on external units. They could be built and left in readiness.Specically, all attendant medical staff would work in the ward by using self-contained non-cumbersome support suits with additional plug-in ports for remote air supplythey were required to stay on station for an extended period. Upon leaving the area all would go through a dry or wet cleaning room before disrobing. All equipment should be reusable after drying and sterilisation.The North Sea designers for saturation ing, I feel sure, could provide valuable input to the methodology to support current medical standards and the extreme sports clothing designers likewise.Hopefully we will get through this crisis relatively unscathed, but lets be prepared the next time.Archie Burleigh, Skelmorlie.THERE are media reports on a daily basis of the statistics relating to the incidence of coronavirus in a number of countries. These relate mainly to those countries with a well-developed healthcare system: China, Italy, Spain, France, Germany, and, now, the United States.It is recognised that even in those countries where some testing can be conducted, there will be ying degrees of under-reporting.There is less reported information from other countries such as Greece, many in Latin American, Turkey, Scandinavia and the Balkans.Turkey, Italy and Greece have the additional problem of providing shelter to large numbers of refugees.As far as Africa is concerned, only South Africa has recently figured in the news.In many countries there is a huge disparity between the \"haves\" and the \"have-nots\", with the latter greatly outnumbering the former. The possible spread of the virus among those with little access to healthcare must be a terrying prospect. Intensive care units, protective clothing, ventilators  No chance. Social distancing in the crowded cities of India would seem impossible.Many aid agencies must be greatly concerned about the likelihood of financial support becoming much reduced as inidual contributors and governments struggle to support those in need closer to home. Most charity shops are now closed.Fortunately, there have been examples of kindness and neighbourliness extended to those in need of assistance. As the outbreak continues, there is a risk of this support wearing thin and there will be a need to remind ourselves that \"our neighbour\" extends beyond those in our immediate vicinity.Malcolm Allan, Bishopbriggs.LAST Friday I decided to avail myself of the generous offer, by Sainsburys, of the -am shopping hour for older people. So off I went to our store in Kelso wondering what would be happening.I have to say that I was greatly impressed by the organisation of the event, where staff conducted it all with friendliness and tact.

This is current affairs, brought to you by coronavirus. Video conferencing is Britainrsquos growth industry. People who hitherto thought Zoom was a synonym for speed are busily sending meeting ID codes to colleagues and friends.And just when Skype seemed rather passeacute, it is on every political  show in the country, as the presenters we are so used to seeing surrounded by people are suddenly surrounded by screens. Yesterdayrsquos Ridge on Sunday, Sophie Ridgersquos Sky News show, which is proving to be a more-than-competitive rival to Andrew Marr on the Beeb, was a tour de force of remote contributions. With the clocks having moved forward, as we blearily pressed  on the Sky remote we were faced with Michael Gove, the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, who had also stood in for our coronavirus-positive Prime Minister Boris Johnson at Fridays daily Government press conference.My first reflection was to wonder what the odds would have been, four years ago when Mr Gove torpedoed Mr Johnsonrsquos Tory leadership campaign, of the former being the latterrsquos right-hand-man at a time of national crisis. As usual, though, Mr Gove was in complete charge of his brief as he delivered the incredibly serious and dficult message that there is no fixed end date to the lockdown.Big hitter though Gove is, he was followed on Ridge by the biggest hitter of my adult le - former Prime Minister Tony Blair. Customarily, Mr Blair did what the country still seldom gives him credit for he answered the questions he was asked fairly and reasonably, giving his experience of how governments around the world handle crises.The public mood of co-operation - the lsquoall in this togetherrsquo spirit which has characterised the last fortnight in particular - was brought to a halt by Labour leadership contender Rebecca Long-Bailey who, following the lead of her mentor Jeremy Corbyn, has struggled to join in the national group hug. The sky-high approval ratings for both Mr Johnson and the Tory party, which sailed over  per cent in a poll on Friday, will not persuade them to sht their strategy.Over on BBC, Mr Marr broadcast his show from the BBC newsroom rather than his usual studio which, in addition to the absence of guests, was another visual display of the dference coronavirus is making to broadcasting. After Mr Gove made his second appearance of the morning to close the show, attention turned to Gordon Brewerrsquos Politics Scotland, which opened with Scotlandrsquos new national hero, Jason Leitch.Dr Leitch, Scotlandrsquos favourite dentist, already has a CBE but it is as likely that hersquoll have a knighthood by this time next year as it was unlikely four years ago that Michael Gove would now be Borisrsquos number two. I cannot name a Scottish news and current affairs show which Dr Leitch has not been on in the last week, and his easy manner together with his straight and simple answers will become an example of good practice for companies like mine which perform a media training service.Mr Brewerrsquos shows, of which I have often been a part in the studio, are usually characterised by meticulous positioning of guests and himself in order to keep everyone out of shot during the remote interviews on screen. Yesterdayrsquos was simpler, with Mr Brewer fixed in position as all three guests appeared from their living rooms.Dr Leitch has been a busy boy. He has appeared regularly on BBC Scotlandrsquos The Nine, a show whose well-documented problems stem, in my opinion, from scheduling rather than quality.That news was offset, somewhat, by the excellent show last Thursday where Rona Dougall took viewersrsquo questions directly to First Minister Nicola Sturgeon, cominglive from Bute House.ITVrsquos Wednesday night Peston show is surviving, although only without the studio presence of its eponymous host Robert. Hearing Anushka Asthana open the show by saying ldquoRobert Peston is in quarantine was a rather eerie opening to a show whose magazine-style formatmakes it particularly dependent on having guests in the studio.Political TV addicts and contributors like me, and I believe the producers of the shows, should use this as a time for reflection. Those producers who insist on guests being in the studio are right to a large degree. Last weekrsquos shows are far the poorer for the presenters being in solitary confinement.That is not to say there is no place for so-called \"down the line\" appearances. Depending on the segment, being out of the studio can work better. It is a balance, which some understand more than others.However there is much more we could think about during this time of reflection to improve our political output. We suffer from a basic problem that our studios are in the wrong place producing political television while marooned  miles from the Scottish Parliament.So, for starters, Irsquod like to see BBC Scotland and STV make more use of their Edinburgh studios, perhaps on Tuesdays and Wednesdays, when politicians are always in Edinburgh. This, at a stroke, would ensure that, in a post-coronavirus environment, presenters and contributors really can be all in it together.Andy Maciver is Director of Message Matters"},{"url":null,"title":"mark-smith-conversation-yes-campaigner-points-one-way","story":"The reason Irsquom saying all of this now is because of a conversation I had recently with a Yes campaigner. Yoursquoll know him: Alan Bissett. Hersquos a novelist, performer, and famous Falkirkian, and he was one of the leading figures of the  campaign and one of its most passionate agitators. Alan and I were talking to each other because of the plansto mark the th anniversary of the Declaration of Arbroath, but the turn the conversation took was surprising. It didnrsquot go how you would expect.The thing is that, for a while now, a lot of Scots who lean towards the Union have felt like wersquore living in an age of conflict, and that the  referendum was partly ndash no, largely ndash to blame for that. But evenyou disagree with that premise, or the cause, you might still agree about where we are now: Yes versus No, Leave versus Remain, Salmond versus Sturgeon, the human race versus Covid-. Even the attempt to control the coronavirus is described in terms of conflict ndash we are at war, they say we are fighting an invisible enemy.But whattherersquos a dferent way of framing this and a new way forward  When we had our chat, Alan Bissett told me he was just as much a supporter of Yes in  as he was in . The No vote was a disaster, he said, and Scots find themselves trapped and buffeted without any control of their political destiny. Independence needs to happen sooner rather than later, he said. Itrsquos an emergency.But itrsquos what Alan told me next that was really interesting because I think lots of Scots feel the same way, eventheir actual views havenrsquot shted much. What Alan said was that, for him, a lot of the heat had gone out of the argument since . In the old days, he said, he wouldrsquove gone on the attack, but hersquos better now at listening to people with dferent views, and has more respect for them. He still argues the case for Yes, but he does it with less of an edge in his voice.Why has this happened  Itrsquos because Alanrsquos been mixing with dferent people. In , he was living in Glasgow and working in the arts and most of the people he socialised with were Yes supporters. But he has since moved to the country and lives in a small village where he comes into contact with a more erse range of opinion. Down the pubthere are going to be lots of unionists and this fact has changed the way Alan approaches things.The lessons Alan has taken away from it all are interesting. Herersquos what he said to me: ldquoIrsquom talking to guys who might have very dferent opinions to me andyou start being too forthright about it, theyrsquore going to tell you to f*** off. Theyrsquoll probably see you as some a******* who comes into the pub and spouts off about Scottish independence. I canrsquot be that person. It doesnrsquot work. So itrsquos made me a better communicator and more reflective when it comes to politics. Irsquove got better at listening.Of course this doesnrsquot apply to everyone ndash just look at Twitter. The opinion poll at the weekend suggesting a big election win for the SNP next year also makes another independence referendum more likely, which will surely get the blood boiling just as much as it did in . But even so, for a lot of people, the passage of time, or a change of scene in Alanrsquos case, or the spread of an invisible virus, has made the debate feel much less aggressive than it was, and we should try to go with that. We should try to learn something from the moment of calm that some of us are feeling.I think Alan has already, and I hope I have too. One of the subjects we talked about was identity and how important it is to both sides of the argument over the constitution in Scotland. Alan said he was more aware, and respectful, of the fact that many Scots feel British and want to remain British. Itrsquos their identity, and the same works the other way round for Scottish nationalists: they feel attached to their identity and, letrsquos face it, even those who decry identity politics have an identity. We should all recognise and respect those facts.We can also do what Alan has done and pull back a little from the swing and punch of Yes and No. A good first step would be to come off Twitter, which Alan has already done ndash Twitter is merely fuel to the fury and is not the place for nuance or respect. We could also ndash when wersquore allowed to ndash socialise with a much more erse range of people, which Alan has also done. If yoursquore a Yes voter, make sure that your first post-Covid coffee is with a No voter and vice versa for unionists. And donrsquot just wait for them to stop talking so you can make your point. Listen.I appreciate some people will think all of this is naiumlve, but a more respectful conversation is more likely to produce a settled will that we can all go along with in the end and thatrsquos what we need. Obviously, Alan Bissett hopes the settled will is going to be for independence I hope itrsquos for the Union. But itrsquos more likely to be a broad agreement or a settled consensusit comes from a long, respectful, reflective conversation rather than a political punch-up. If we listen to each other and slowly move in one direction, itrsquos more likely to last. If we respect each other, we will respect the result. Irsquom going to try to remember that when I come out of isolation."},{"url":null,"title":"https:wwworcadiancouk  \n","story":"March ,  at : pmThe restrictions currently in place to combat against the spread of COVID- could remain in place until June.

Like the whole of the UK we are struggling to get PPE , so it is tricky,# he added.On stock levels, following earlier panic buying in the UK, he said that fresh food lines have fully recovered, whereas the full supply of items such as household cleaners, toilet roll, pasta and cereals are taking a little longer to fully recover, although they are still coming through the supply chain in more limited numbers, and should be fully recovered in around two weeks.Mr Tennant said that the store is now employing around  extra staff to handle the extra workload, which has been welcomed in the community, with so many other businesses having to shut down due to restrictions.On opening hours changes, he said that the store was now open am-pm Monday-Saturday, am-pm Sunday.However, he had taken the decision to open am-am on Sunday, Tuesday and Thursday mornings for NHS and care workers only, and am-am Monday, Wednesday and Friday for vulnerable people and the elderly.He said that this would be the case for the foreseeable future as the lockdown restrictions continue.The Orcadian Facebook page also features a pinned post showcasing numerous local shops around the islands, all of which are doing a fantastic job rallying to support folk at this unprecedented time of need. copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

And some concern has been voiced that the payments are not due to begin until June.One person worried about the future is Julie Leith, who started a cleaning business Shetland Cleaning Crew four years ago. Her sister Tracey joined the enterprise last year. Four people work for the business altogether.Despite the uncertainty, she is determined to hang on, despite having had to suspend work because of the lockdown. She is also anxious to protect her clients and her two young daughters.“Things are kind of tricky at the moment. They’ve come out with a package saying they will help, but as far as I’m aware it’ll not be available until June,# she said.“I was relieved there was going to be something in place, but by June I don’t kenI’ll still be able to trade. It’s very up in the air at the moment.”Coronavirus Disease  Graphic. Ms Leith said she was unable to work because most of her clients were senior citizens, “and I’m not classed as an essential worker”.“I’ve had to down tools to protect all of my elderly clients, and the lasses.”She has noticed a certain irony in having to cancel cleaning jobs at a time when cleaning is considered to be important in order to hold the virus off.“Once the lockdown had come everybody said ‘wait until the lockdown is over’ and we’ll reschedule the clean. Weirdly, the cleaning has dried up and that’s most important.”Ms Leith said she was avoiding news bulletins after becoming so concerned about the pandemic. But she said she was determined to hold on until June when her business may get the support it needs from the government.“I’m positive we will,” she said. “There are some days where I think we won’t, but I’m trying to stay positive.”Meanwhile a taxi driver, who did not wish to be named, said he had been able to secure Universal Credit, which he believed that would cover rent and council tax, but very little . His business, he said, had been able to stay open “but it is really what you might call bread and milk money”.The driver added he was not hopeful about the new support being offered, and added he had taken out a finance package on a new car in January, before adding the economic downfall could not have happened at a worse time.Painter and decorator Fearghas Noblett was dwelling on the positives. His work has disappeared but he said he believed he and his we Myra could could survive until June when he will hopefully qualy for a share of the government support.“It’s a relief that something is in place and compared to a lot of countries we are very, very fortunate to be living in such a democratic time that the government will think of doing that,” he said.He added he had stopped working despite being initially tempted to carry on.“I was told that the police have details of everybody’s vehicles and are monitoring those people who would be tempted to go out and work.“Initially I was. It’s like you feel part of the French Resistance # you’ve got to keep on doing what you do.“It was ambiguous, where they were saying ‘ you can’t work from home you need to go to work,’ but the goalposts changed quite rapidly.“We can’t be seen to just be carrying on because that’s quite a selfish thing to do.“From my point of view it would definitely be wrong for me to sneak around and think I could work..”He said he believed he could get by until June.“We have other income, Myra’s working. It’s not disastrous for us. When this is all blown over I’ve still got a job to go to.”Mr Carmichael welcomed the announcement, but indicated they could have gone further.“MPs of all parties have been highlighting the lack of support for self-employed people for some days and I am glad that the government is starting to catch up,” he said.“As I put it to the Prime Minister on Wednesday, self-employed people are not looking for special treatment but for equal treatment with employed people. The measures today seem to go some way towards that.“There are, however, still large gaps in the support for self-employed people. The wait until June will be extremely challenging for many, especially with the reluctance of many banks to offer bridging loans currently.“Tourism, which makes up such a vital part of the local economy in the isles, is obviously highly seasonal and yet this is not recognised in the Chancellor’s plan.“Three months of government support based on an ‘annual average’ will not paper over the financial hole faced by those who rely on the usual summer trade to cover them through the rest of the year.” raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"wilma named as shetland wool week patron ","story":"This years Shetland Wool Week patron Wilma Malcolmson.The Shetland Wool Week patron for this year was named today as knitwear designer Wilma Malcolmson, who is internationally renowned for her skilfully blended Fair Isle knitwear.The much-anticipated annual hat pattern, which is now synonymous with the launch of the patron, has also been released. This year’s official hat, designed by her, is called #Katie’s Kep#.The wool week organisers said they were delighted to have Mrs Malcolmson as this year’s patron. She was a key player in the local knitting community, a wool week and Shetland Peerie Makker tutor, and also one of Shetland’s most influential and innovative designers.She has lived in Shetland all her le and, like many others who grew up in the isles, has knitted from childhood. Originally from Garderhouse on the West Side, she later moved to Cunningsburgh where she lived with her late husband Leonard.She established her business, Shetland Designer, in  and during that time she has seen her creations reach all four corners of the world.Mrs Malcolmson said: “I am touched and honoured to be this year’s patron. Wool week is a wonderful event that helps to bring people, not just knitters, from all around the world together.#To me, the festival represents a time of friendship, of learning from each other and an appreciation of our islands and way of le as it celebrates old and new by putting traditional patterns and techniques on equal terms with new, innovative ones.#The hat is the common bond for us all and I am delighted to have been asked to design it and become part of the wool week story.“My hat ‘Katie’s Kep’ is named after my mother Katie. It includes the patterns that she taught me when I was a peerie lass because they were her favourites. She belonged to that large group of professional knitters, without whom our Shetland colour work and lace heritage might not have been as alive and vibrant as it is today. This is my tribute to all the known and unknown designer artists of Shetland throughout the centuries.”On her love of knitting, Mrs Malcolmson said: “My mother instilled in me an interest in patterns and colours, from her I learned the importance of contrast and ‘blending’. Colour inspiration is all around us in Shetland – you only need to look at the rugged landscape, seashores the ever-changing skies to find shades that work together.”She has created four very dferent colourways for the hat using yarn from Jamieson’s of Shetland, Jamieson and Smith, Uradale Yarns and Shetland Handspun.Each company has prepared yarn kits and are available to take back orders online, but are currently unable to guarantee specic delivery dates. Customers are urged to keep an eye on the respective websites for updates.The organisers said: “We are always thrilled to announce the new patron and hat, and perhaps even more so this year. Throughout this ongoing global crisis we have received many requests urging us to release the hat pattern and we are pleased to be able to make it available, as always, as a free download from our Shetland Wool Week website.#We hope it will bring some welcome light relief and focus as well as a sense of connection for all our supporters.”#Katie#s Kep# – this year#s official wool week hat.Mrs Malcolmson added: #I really do feel that this is in the interest of knitters. Under these strange times we are living in there are so many knitters around the world taking comfort from their work and enjoying their knitting when they are self-isolating.#Knitting has been so important to Shetland all through the years. When I grew up the knitters around me were knitting to help the economy, to put food on the table. It wasn#t a hobby at that time.#The th Shetland Wool Week is due to run from th September and already a huge amount of effort has gone into preparing for the event. However, in light of the coronavirus pandemic, the event remains under review.• An extensive question and answer interview with Mrs Malcolmson is available to read via the Shetland Wool Week newsletter and website.

More centres will open in the coming days, with at least one Covid- centre in each Trust area.Minister Swann said: “Primary Care Covid- Centres are an essential part of the fight against this virus. To ensure vital GP services can be maintained throughout the coming weeks and months, it is absolutely critical that those who show symptoms are separated from the patients with non Covid- related conditions. “Covid- centres are not testing facilities and are only for patients who are very unwell, are suspected of having Covid- and require medical attention. Patients will not be able to report directly to these centres without being referred by their GP or Out of Hours provider.“Whilst the centres will help to free up GP services to deal with the Covid- pandemic, it is vital we balance this with the need for primary care services to continue with the minimum of disruption.”Patients attending these centres will receive appropriate treatment, assessment and,necessary, onward referral to hospital.Dr Tom Black, Chair of the BMA in Northern Ireland, is among the GPs working at the new Primary Care Covid- Centre at Altnagelvin. He said: “GPs have organised themselves very quickly and there has been a huge amount of work done between the Department of Health, the Health and Social Care Board, Trusts and GP Federations to provide the community with these Covid- centres.“This method of GPs working in the middle ground is vital to protect hospital services for patients with the greatest need. I have no doubt that this work will save lives.”Concluding, the Health Minister said: “I want to pay tribute to the vision, rapid action and commitment shown by our primary care doctors. Without hesitation, they have risen to meet this unprecedented challenge. On behalf of everyone in our community I want to thank them for the hugely important work they are doing.“We must all now do our part to support these healthcare professionals in the fight to stop the spread of this virus.

So let’s see , with the benefit of close-on  years of experience, we can see how the spirit of Are Wee Country might be redeployed in the time of coronavirus.HYGIENE vw, px\"  Troubles washing protocols for handling weapons and explosives should be resumed. A y bath and hair wash are not necessary because while gunpowder residue in your hair was always a problem, coronavirus in your hair is not. Scrub the hands thoroughly with hot soap and water, but remember, it is no longer necessary to pay particular attention to your shooting arm and hand. Both require equal attention. If you’ve kept your balaclava it could be the best decision you’ve made since you said yes to the Northern Bank job. Since hand-to-face contamination is a principle spreader of the virus, your balaclava will go a long way to keep you safe. And as face masks are dficult to access, the thick wool of the balaclava makes an excellent makesht virus filter.SOCIAL DISTANCINGIt’s reported that the car parks at Tyrella beach, Helen’s Bay and Murlough Bay were packed to overflowing at the weekend, with some tourist attractions experiencing record footfall. Although the advice is that people should remain two metres apart, crowds have been assembling in the face of the growing Covid- threat. Retired senior RUC and British army figures with long experience of, ah, public order have been employed as consultants to advise the forces of law and order on how best to deploy the Spirit of Northern Ireland during times of public non-compliance. Water cannon deployed most recently at Woodvale during the Camp Twaddell national emergency are available and ready to go with a : water-bleach ratio. Baton charges are being rehearsed at the PSNI training centre at Garnerville with officers wearing hazmat suits instead of riot gear and with temperature gauges on the end of their batons. Plastic bullets are an option but will only be used as a final resort in order not to put to too much pressure on morgues and paediatric intensive care units.STOP AND QUESTION vw, px\"  Is this your car, sir  The glory days of #Northern Ireland#If you’re on your way to the shop, out for your one walk per day, oryou’re an essential worker en route to or from your job you may be stopped and questioned by the police – or even later by the British army, depending on how the crisis pans out. If you are under the age of  and you are in your car and you are asked ‘Is this your car, sir madam ’ do not be surprised. Do not offer a humorous response . Comply with all requests and be sure to keep your hands in sight at all time. If you are stopped on the street, please note that when asked your date of birth, Catholics are still legally entitled to say ‘Over ’, although you should be aware that this is highly likely to signicantly en your stop period. Those out walking or driving while Irish should be aware that some names may lead to certain complications in your dealings with the RUC – sorry, PSNI – and the British army. Again, younger people should consult with parents grandparents on how to address this tricky problem, butthey advise you to pretend you’re called Norman or Pamela, be aware that society has changed considerably in the quarter of a century-plus since the ceasefires and you are probably best placed to pick your own non-Irish name. Please note thatthe crisis persists into the annual poppy perioda poppy in your lapel or a sticky one on your windscreen will do wonders to smooth your journey.Andyou’re on your way to or from Derry when you’re stopped, remember – you work in Drumahoe."},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus northern ireland councils shut most facilities in bid to halt spread of virus","story":"The newly refurbished Childrens play part in Ormeau Park PACEMAKER BELFAST   FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappThe newly refurbished Childrens play part in Ormeau Park PACEMAKER BELFAST  Ralph HewittMarch   : AMFacebookTwitterEmailThe Belfasthas created a guide to what public spaces are open and closed across Northern Ireland - as measures are taken to prevent the spread of Covid-.For regular updates on what has been closed by your council, visit their websites.Antrim and Newtownabbey Borough Council: Green spaces remain open but car parks at park facilities are now closed.

The device being left outside a home in the Lagmore Grove area.Police attended the scene around pm and sealed the area off while the device was dealt with.Due to the coronavirus health crisis the occupant and their neighbours were advised not to leave their homes, but instead to remain at the back of their properties while Army Technical Officers made the device safe. The device was taken away for further examination and police said it contained component parts which, had the device been detonated, would have made it viable..Police are working to establish a motive and the circumstances surrounding the incident, and identy who is responsible.  Lord Mayor of Belfast Daniel Baker asked anyone with information about the incident to contact police. This was a senseless act and shows little regard for the community, our key workers, emergency services and health workers, the local Sinn Fein councillor said. “I appeal for anyone on any information to bring it forward to the PSNI.Councillor Baker said the incident was particularly unwelcome as communities are dealing with the coronavirus outbreak“These reckless actions are in stark contrast to the efforts of workers carrying out essential work, he said.“Those responsible offer nothing only disrupting the efforts of our emergency services to help those in most need at this time of crisis.Our key workers are already under immense pressure as they work whilst the rest of us remain home in our battle against COVID-.”PSNI Chief Inspector Gary Reid said those responsible have no respect, or regard, for the valuable police resources that were erted away from other community priorities. It beggars belief, that given the unprecedented challenges we, as a Police Service, face in relation to the Covid- pandemic that there are still reckless iniduals out there determined to put the lives of others at risk as they did last night in Lagmore Grove, he said. This is already a stressful and worrying time for people so,ever there was a time for this type of senseless activity to stop, it is now.“I am appealing to anyone who has any information which can lead us to those responsible to please call us on , and quote reference number  of    or Crimestoppers   .

You have that dark humour.In the book Joanne talks about her pregnancy with Hannah, which was fraught with dficulty as doctors thought she may miscarry again, due to an incompetent cervix.Terriedof losing her baby, she was put in six months of bed rest during the winter of .Their beautul daughter Hannah was eventually born safe and well, following a caesarean section.I had to have a section because she was breach from  weeks, recalls Joanne.The consultant told me thats what saved her from going the same way as Jacob.They said she was standing up in my womb holding on to my ribs.Joanne got pregnant again but the pregnancy was ectopic, a potentially le-threatening complication where the baby grows outside the womb.The baby couldnt survive and the couple were told there was no option but to end the pregnancy.The operation didnt go to plan and Joanne had to have one of her fallopiantubes removed and two blood transfusions.After I came back from surgery I was in recovery for hours and when my mammy saw me she got very emotional.She said I know you want to give Hannah a sibling but you are my child and Hannah needs her motherI said right Lawrence, Im not trying any more. We have to draw a line under it.It killed me.I could still have another baby, but I know mentally that I couldnt cope.Throughout her pregnancies Joanne had been keeping diaries of everything that happened.Ive always written, she says. Even before this book I always joked that I was nursing until I decided what to write about.I wrote a diary after Jacob and I still have it. I suppose its like the mood diaries we use in work so people can see they are getting better.I made a diary of my pregnancy with Hannah and then after she was born I was content and I thought this is great, Im finally a mammy.I loved being in that mammy role and all the funny stuff that happened and I decided I really should keep a diary of all this.Joanne sent her diary to friends who were living in America and Australia as a way of keeping in touch and gradually built up the confidence to show some work colleagues too.One girl at work has a sister who is a blogger The Red Duchess, and she told me I should share it as a blog.I had it all on my computer to show Hannah when she is older anyway so I did it and I thought sure this is lovely.It wasnt until she was forced to take three months off work after breaking her shoulder that Joanne started thinking about turning the blog into a book.She contacted local authors Claire Allan and Felicity McCall for advice and they gave her the confidence to approach a number of publishers.Despite receiving positive feedback, Joanne found the process a bit overwhelmingand decided to shelve the plans for a book to concentrate on her career.Around this time a promotion came up at work and Lawrence encouraged her to go for it.I thought it would be a wee challenge but I was sick nearly every day when I was studying for the interview, she admits.Doubts would pop into my head like well, you were s*** at pregnancy and stuff.I did the interview and it was horrendous. Afterwards I cried so much and I knew it wasnt right.I was always grand at interviews and I never let it get to me. But I was just so low and couldnt get past it.The post came up again and I thoughtI went to the doctors and got something to settle me for the interview I might have a chance.When I went to GP surgery there must have a pregnancy clinic going on and there were pregnant woman everywhere and I felt so emotional.Joanne was seen by a young doctor and explained why she was there, but after reading her notes and listening to her story the doctor told her she didnt think the job interview was the problem.She said Youve had  years of trauma trying to get pregnantShe said Joanne, youre a nurse - youve just bottled this up and done most of this yourself and this interviewhas just tipped you over the edge.Joanne got treatment for her anxiety and kept writing to help her process her feelings and also record all the happy moments with Lawrence and Hannah and her stepson Dylan.Last year, Joanne heard about Jude Morrow, a Derry man with autism who had self-published a book about parenting his son.Judes book was a huge success and climbing up the Amazon best sellers list, so she got in touch to see what he thought about hers.He was hugely encouraging and told her to self-publish,advising her to spend a little money getting a cover designed for the book and to have it professionally edited.Joanne says self-publishing was a journey into unchartered waters, but she had the help of her dad and her self appointed PA Harry McGarvey.Just last week Joanne finally got her hands on the first copy of her book Memoirs of a Mad Mammy, but it was a bittersweet moment because she couldnt share it with Harry who was self-isolating due to the threat of the coronavirus.I left it on the garden wall for him and he was up at the window giving me air hugs, says Joanne.Copies of Memoirs of a Mad Mammy can be pre-ordered now on Amazon.It is also available on Kindle and will be available to buy at Little Acorns bookshop in Derry. googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

I want to commend the community led volunteer responses that are mobilising right across the City and District. Its heartening to see so many people come forward to assist the wellbeing of their neighbours and communities during this time. These services will come under increasing pressure in the coming months so I want to ask that everyone who is fit to do so considers offering their helpthey can.This is a rapidly changing situation and as a Council will continue to be proactive and to work with all our partner agencies and organisations to support local people and ensure they have the information, services and assistance they need to stay safe, well and adequately provided for through the very challenging times ahead.At the meeting members discussed the possible delivery mechanisms for the effective allocation of resources, as well as the governance and coordination required to support the local community and voluntary sector.It was agreed that Council would advance with the necessary governance arrangements in place to deliver annually agreed support to these services. This will include committing funds to support service level agreements and an extension of the community venues funds which have been in place for the last three years to ensure core costs will be in place to continue services.Council officers will contact impacted groups directly with letters of offer and advance payments as quickly as possible.An additional joint funding package is also being developed with the Department for Communities to support the continuation of the advice tribunal service, increasing telephone capacity and extending working hours. Council is hopeful that this investment will be confirmed shortly.During the meeting Council members paid tribute to local service providers Advice North West, Dove House and Resource Centre Derry and the work they are doing reaching out to the community under growing pressure, and stressed the importance of stepping up assistance at this stage.Councillors strongly welcomed these and other measures put forward, and agreed to further review demands on services and to lobby government for the necessary financial support to maintain and strengthen community services as needed to respond to the ongoing COVID emergency.A spokesperson for the three local service providers welcomed the news, saying: We are delighted that these resources are being made available. Demand has been unprecedented and our staff have been working around the clock to meet the needs of local people who are naturally very concerned for the welfare of themselves and loved ones at this time.We will channel this support into the effective delivery of services and supporting our staff throughout this crisis.The full report from todays meeting is available to view now athttps:bit.ly xnnvv googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Minister Mallon said: “Just yesterday I confirmed MOT test centres would no longer be carrying out tests and that all vehicles eligible would be issued with a temporary exemption certicate . However, this could not be applied to four year old cars and taxis due to legal requirements. “I am pleased to confirm that following signicant work by my officials, I am now able to put arrangements in place to ensure four year old cars can get back on the road,given the ongoing health advice, the journey to be made is essential. googletag.cmd.push “From tomorrow, four year old cars will be given a TEC for six months from the date that their MOT test should have been due. This will allow the vehicle to be taxed and driven on the road. Issuing the certicates will take some time but the exemption will automatically apply from the due date. “The PSNI has agreed to our request that given these exceptional circumstances, where PSNI detects a vehicle without a valid MOT certicate, it will in suitable cases, exercise its discretion under the law, in circumstances where there is no identied risk to public safety. It is important that drivers realise that they are responsible under the law for the roadworthiness of their vehicle at all times.” googletag.cmd.push The Minister continued that she and officials are continuing to urgently explore options to support taxis at this dficult time. “For taxis which require PSV tests, new regulation and legislation needs to be put in place to allow the legal issuing of Temporary Exemption Certicates and,despite best efforts, this is taking longer to resolve. However, I want to reassure taxi drivers that we are working urgently on options to help them at this dficult time. I recognise the taxi industry is being hard hit by this public health and economic crisis. I also am working with Executive colleagues and pushing hard for more support from the UK Government for the self-employed. Protecting drivers and the public from the serious impact of COVID- is my priority.” Alastair Ross, Head of Public Policy for Northern Ireland at the Association of British Insurers, said: “Insurers recognise that this is worrying time for everyone and will take a pragmatic view. They will not penalise customers for something that is entirely out of their control and where motorists with an MOT exemption certicate request a quote, they will not be prejudiced by their lack of a valid MOT certicate. This applies regardless of whether they wish to renew with their existing insurance provider or are looking to take out a policy with a dferent insurer. “Insurers do, however, expect that motorists comply with their legal obligation to keep their vehicle in a roadworthy conditionthey are driving it. Those affected by the ongoing MOT testing suspension should continue to service their vehicle and carry out basic checks such as looking out for brake wear, ensuring that all lights are working and that windscreen liquid and oil are at the correct levels.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Rosemarie and Sean Lynn from Dungiven tied the knot in a simple ceremony at St Columba’s Church, Long Tower after their original date fell victim to Covid-. The couple were married last Tuesday evening at :pm, just hours before government regulations banned weddings were due to be introduced. Rosemarie told the County Derry Post they were determined to go ahead with the ceremony. She said: “We got engaged in November and decided we’d get married on the th of April this year. googletag.cmd.push “A few weeks ago, our venue rang and said with coronavirus, they weren’t going to be open. “It was important for us to get married and have family and friends back at the house, so we brought it forward to Saturday the th of March.”  Boris Johnson and the British government had other ideas, however, and Monday’s announcement that weddings were banned left the couple ‘numb’. Things changed when Sean and Rosemarie rang their driver to inform him of the developments. “Brian, our limousine driver and he said: ‘Why don’t you ring the council and see what they can do ’ “So I rang and said we had the papers, we were getting married in the church and the priest was willing to marry us, but we needed the go-ahead from the council. She said to leave it with her. googletag.cmd.push “I was praying to St Anthony when the lady from the council rang back and said we had the go-ahead until  o’clock that night to get married.” The short time frame became even tighter as Rosemarie’s fianceacute Sean finished a sht as an emergency medical technician with the Ambulance Service. “Rosemarie rang and said: you’d better come home quickly because we’re getting married tonight,” said Sean. “I rang the duty control manager and was shocked when they gave the go-ahead for special circumstances. “I had to come home, lt the wean, scrub up quickly and get into the chapel. Of course, she was  minutes late.” Denied the luxury of time that most brides have to prepare for their wedding, Rosemarie was forced to improvise. She said: “I got ready, did my own nails, my own make-up, put the fake tan on, did the whole thing myself. “I had a wee dress I got last year that I just loved. It wasn’t even meant to be for a wedding, I just bought it because I liked it. “It felt like I was in a film. I wasn’t nervous, I was excited, but it was almost an out-of-body experience.” The couple’s faith was central to their decision-making, and both were delighted with the simple ceremony. Sean said: “I’m over the moon, I really am. “The big day would have been great to have, but the sacrament between me, her and God was the main thing.” “The ceremony was beautul,” said Rosemarie. “It was the two of us, the priest, two witnesses and Sean’s wee boy and we all had to stand six feet apart and sit six feet apart in the limousine because of the regulations. Although the couple were able to celebrate with a few drinks at Sean’s house, the honeymoon is on hold as he helps battle the threat of Covid-. He said: “We have a few days to spend together and keep le simple. I’m going out to C every day, so I’m glad for a few hours of something positive.” Rosemarie is hugely proud of her husband’s role. She said: “He’ll be back out in a few days saving lives, that’s what he loves to do. “He always was that kind of person who cares for people, and that’s what it’s all about now.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Letrsquos look out for each other in these turbulent times.Cllr McMurray mdash who spoke ahead of Mondayrsquos ban on access to Tyrella beach mdash said that last weekend he had been ldquoinundated with messages and calls regarding the number of people attending local forest parks.ldquoUnfortunately, it appears that the general population is not adhering to the advice in relation to social distancing and I would suggest that they are nearly treating this crisis as a national holiday.I will be reviewing access to our forest parks with party leaders and senior management team, he said.ldquoWe have been pushing a lot of advice and guidance with regard to the need for social distancing but it is not resting with the population. It is so dficult to balance the need to allow people the space to walk to protect mental and health and well-being, but we ask that the public refer to guidelines set out by public health officials to do so safely.Cllr Lewis said the closure of leisure centres, play areas, council-owned facilities and schools across this district had been done for peoplersquos safety.ldquoI appeal to people to recognise why these areas are closed, he continued. ldquoPlay parks and sporting facilities should not be used. It is imperative that we recognise and accept the seriousness of this illness. It simply cannot be business as usual, we must heed all relevant medical advice.Cllr Lewis added: ldquoThis is for our own safety, while also protecting the integrity of our health service and those vital, dedicated experienced staff who support it. Newry, Mourne and Down Council has taken extreme measures and please respect these steps. This isnrsquot a holiday and itrsquos not a jolly. We are protecting le.Cllr Gallagher said it was vital that everyone in the community ensures that social isolation is adhered to, highlighting the need to reduce the risk.He added: ldquoThe elderly and those with predisposed health conditions need to keep their distance and follow public health guidelines. Remain at homepossible and get someone to do your shopping. Family units are important. People must not allow others into their home and visits that are not essential must stopCllr Howell said that last week the Education Minister finally declared that schools would close to help prevent the spread of COVID-, highlighting the huge responsibility on parents to ensure that not just children are safe, but so are those they are in contact with.She added: ldquoUnfortunately, some young people think that this is the start of their summer holidays and they are free to continue with no worries or concerns. I am appealing to parents to inform their children about social distancing and the importance of adhering to the public health guidelines.ldquoIf your teenager goes out can you be confident that they will observe the required social distancing of two metres  Many of them donrsquot have the willpower to practice what is being advised.ldquoAs a parent I know only too well how hard it is to keep teenagers from going out, but we need to set the example to our children. If these social distancing rules are not adhered to, they will come home and unknowingly pass the virus to others, perhaps family members with underlying health issues or aged grandparents..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/25th March 2020 Pretend.jpg","title":"‘Pretend cough’ over credit union worker  ","story":"POLICE will be contacted after a saver in Downpatrick Credit Union ldquopretend coughed at a staff member last week during the coronavirus outbreak, it has been revealed.Mary Cullen, chair of Downpatrick Credit Union, warned that it was now operating a ldquozero tolerance policy as incidents of verbal abuse to staff increased during reduced opening hours.She said the credit union, which is situated in Market Street, had been inundated with messages of support after she posted a warning post on Facebook last Friday where she asked members to respect everyonersquos boundaries regarding social distancing and to accept the new reduced hours cover.She said a member of the public verbally abused a member of staff before ldquopretend coughing at them.ldquoThis particular incident is not acceptable and going forward, unfortunately, Members who cannot be courteous to our staff will not be served, said Mary in her post.ldquoWe are in a very dangerous time and are doing the best that we can. We are very lucky to have an amazing team at DCU, letrsquos appreciate and respect them as they try to continue to provide a service to members.ldquoThe support for my staff has been phenomenal.

If people did go out, they were advised to keep two metres apart.Council officials say the latest closures are part of the organisationrsquos ongoing coronavirus response and that the decision will be reviewed on an ongoing basis in line with Public Health Agencyguidance.Last week, council officials had decided to keep Tyrella beach and Delamont Country Park open and had agreed to waive the entrance fee to both facilities. But there was a dramatic U-turn on Monday when these two popular facilities also went into lockdown.Across the district a range of community events have been cancelled with last Sundayrsquos horse race meeting at Downpatrick taking place behind closed doors, with spectators locked out.The local authority want people to obey self-distancing requirements with its decision to close Tyrella beach and Delamont Country Park further evidence of its concern about people spreading the virus.It is clear that both facilities have now been placed in the ldquohigh risk category alongside the districtrsquos leisure and community centres. Local politicians say that their key priority is to protect the public and staff.The closure of Tyrella and Delamont comes after Sundayrsquos sunshine brought people out in their hundreds to ious locations across the district, despite government advice not to engage in mass gatherings.beachAnyone in Newcastle town centre last Sunday could have been forgiven for thinking that it was Easter, while nearby Murlough beach was crammed with visitors.It was a similar scene in Ballyhornan and along other parts of the Lecale coastline, including Kilclief and Killard.Rowallane councillor Kathryn Owens said she fully supported the decision to close Tyrella beach and Delamont Country Park.She said: ldquoI totally support this decision. It may not be popular, but sometimes we need to take the tough decisions.ldquoUnfortunately, after the droves of people went to local parks and forests on Sunday, it appears people still arenrsquot taking the coronavirus issue seriously and are clearly flouting PHA guidelines.Cllr Owens added: ldquoThis is not a decision that Newry, Mourne and Down Council wanted to take as we had hoped that common sense may have prevailed. It was a decision we were forced to take and we must do all we can to stop the spread of this disease..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/25th March 2020 C Diary.jpg","title":"From the pages of the Down Recorder%2C March 25%2C 1980  ","story":"DOWNPATRICK mdash Downpatrickrsquos Grand Cinema is to re-open in September, six years after it closed its doors.Workmen will move in shortly to give the cinema a pound, facelt and when the picture house is re-opened, it should be able to compete with the best in Ireland.That is the aim of Mr Harley Breen, the owner of the cinema, who this week outlined the work which needs to be completed before the curtain opens.ldquoWork is expected to take around six months and will involve completely refurbishing the inside of the cinema, Mr Breen explained.ldquoWe will be taking out all the seating and replacing it with a new type of seating, the most exclusive available.

Her previous experience had been restricted to cars, tractors and Land Rovers, but she was always keen on tackling something bigger.ldquoBeing so fond of driving, it was only natural that I would take such a job. Lorries were out of the question, as drivers often have to load their vehicles, so when I say the advert for bus drivers I thought I would apply, said Noelene.ldquoI never thought it possible that they would accept me, so it was a pleasant surprise when I was offered the chance to attend the Ulsterbus training school.

He wrote: ldquoSo I turned with all my heart to the Lord My God...He protected me and he consoled me as a Father for his son...There is no other God...The Lord God said through the prophet, lsquoCall on me in the day of distress and I will set you free and you will glory mersquo.They said this is a reminder that ldquoGod truly is our shield in the stre.

As anyone who has been to sub Saharan Africa will know, the health systems cannot cope with disease and poverty in normal times, and certainly won’t be able to do sothe pandemic takes hold.But amidst all the gloom it is good to retain perspective and to be aware of glimmers of hope.The death toll in the UK as a whole will probably rise by a magnitude of hundreds more fatalities each day in the coming week.When that happens the clamour for further factory closures and restrictions will grow ever louder.But some statistics suggest the present trajectory of ultimate deaths might lead to the UK outcome being at the lower end ofprojections, which range from , deaths to ,. Some models even have the UK coming in well under , deaths and closer to annual seasonal flu deaths.The NHS, while under immense pressure, particularly in the capital, is not yet as hard hit as some experts had feared at this stage.Coronavirus has clearly penetrated Europe and America to a large extent. This might sound like further bad news but might not beit is evidence that a much larger number of people than we realise are already infected, with perhaps a lower percentage death toll than the % that had been expected.The former health secretary Jeremy Hunt recently suggested there might be , infections for each reported death .Using this rule of thumb, the UK is already approaching a million infections. It might even have several million cases. Anecdotal evidence for widespread infection is strong.Consider the famous people known to have it. There are not that many famous people —look up at the top of the opposite page: every day newspapers run such daily lists of famous people’s birthdays. Most of us have become familiar with the famous people who share our own birthday. Some are names we know well, but often there are names on the list we do not know.Most people will know on average at most seven or eight names a day, which suggests that we all have in our head perhaps , famous names .Yet already a notable number of that small pool of people is infected.Even before Boris Johnson and Prince Charles got Covid-, the list of famous names who have it was getting ever bigger and included Prince Albert II of Monaco, the EU leader Michel Barnier, the actors Tom Hanks, Idris Elba, Arsenal coach Mikel Arteta,model Linda Lusardi, GMTV star Fiona Phillips, among others.Celebrities such as this are a random group of people: there is no obvious reason why they would be more likely to get it than others.Similarly most of us know, personally, a relatively small number of people, probably measured in the hundreds rather than thousands , yet more and more of us know someone who has it. I know of five such people .In addition to people we know who have it, there will be others we know who do but of whose infection we have not yet learned of, and others still we know who are symptomless and do not know themselves.So it is not at all hard to believe that at least % of the population on these islands already has itand perhaps many times that number.That the NHS is coping at this stage is an encouraging indicator of outcomes .Last night for an update I talked to a local expert, Dr Alan Stout, chair of the GP Committee of BMA for NI, who wrote for us recently on the importance of not moving too early on things such as school closures. He said: “The projection is that every hospital and ICU bed in two weeks time will be full. “The speed of the spread is slower than we initially feared, which we think is due to the restrictions that have been introduced, so there is no room whatsoever for complacency. “What people do know will dictate where we are one or two weeks from now.”So lockdowns remain essential. But they are causing vast economic damage that will ruin lives around the world and while we must guard against complacency in this crisis, we must also be ready to begin to relax restrictions at the first moment data suggests it is safe to do so.• Ben Lowryis News Letter deputy editor"},{"url":null,"title":"postponed historic passion play goes back vow made  ","story":"Closure of churches shows the shallowness of evangelicalism and the lack of interest in the public worship of GodNI Coronavirus Lockdown -  COVID- deaths across UK in  hours is biggest number of fatalities since crisis began two weeks ago.NewsLatestTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessEducationHealthOpinionPeopleRead ThisSportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportWhats OnThings To DoArts and EntertainmentNightleRetroLestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensCoronavirusNewsOpinionColumnistsPostponed historic Passion Play goes back to a vow made in Almost lost in the current barrage of closures, cancellations and postponements in every sphere of le, an announcement on March  resonated with the poignant irony of history.By The RoamerThursday, th March , : pm\"\"Jesus Christ and John.  Performance of the Oberammergau Passion Play : Freelance“The nd Oberammergau Passion Play will be postponed due to the current situation caused by the corona pandemic.”In the Baian district of Germany, beside the Ammer River and framed by the Ammergau Alps, Oberammergau is a small town known for its woodcarvings, its NATO School and its internationally renowned -yearly Passion Play.The organisers of the Passion Play summarised the historical signicance of the postponement, explaining that the event “goes back to a vow made in . At that time, the people of Oberammergau vowed to perform the suffering, death and resurrection of Christ,no one died of the plague anymore.Engraving depicting the Passion Play in  : Freelance \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

Therefore the plans to perform the Passion Play in  are currently beginning.”Held in the ‘decimal year’I attended a performance in , one of the most vivid and moving experiences of my letime, and indeed, I had toyed with the thought of ing this year.There would have been  performancesstarting in mid-May with an expected , visitors from around the globe paying between € to € for a ticket.The enormous production has been running since  except for two cancellations and a postponement.Crucixion scene in the Passion Play in  : FreelanceNearly half of the , residents of today’s Oberammergau are involved with the show - actors, musicians, front of house, backstage and looking after the horses, sheep, goats, cows and doves that add to the often intensely dramatic scenes.The other half of the townsfolk run the restaurants, shops, hotels, BBs and farmsteads where many of the visitors stay,they’re lucky.The nearest accommodation I could get in  was St. Anton am Arlberg in the Austrian Tirol.Participants in the production must have been born in Oberammergau or have lived there for  years.Oberammergau on the River Ammer in  : FreelanceIt’s not unusual for up to four generations of the same family to be taking part in the same run of plays, which can involve around  children on stage at the same time.In the th century, passion plays were held in many parts of Europe, often performed on carts in the street.They re-enacted Christ’s last days, from his entry into Jerusalem to his trial, crucixion, resurrection and ascension.In the bigger and more elaborate productions, when scene one ended the cart trundled off to another part of the town or city and scene two arrived, and so on!They were the ‘poor man’s Bible’ enabling even the most illiterate become familiar with Bible stories.But Oberammergau’s is the only play with its origins in a collective vow to God which has run, almost without a break, for approaching four centuries. This unique double-accolade brought the town a UNESCO World Heritage award.It’s quite likely that passion plays were already common events but a document in Oberammergau’s archives records “the first decades of the th century went by in peaceful calm…but then followed the Thirty Years’ War with all its hardships from  until . As early as , infectious diseases spread in Baia. This village was spared by dutul vigilance until the church festival in , when a man brought the plague into the village.”More than  local folk died and almost every family lost loved ones.“Faced with the great distress that the terrible illness inflicted upon the population,” the archive continues, “the leaders of the community came together and pledged to hold a passion tragedy once every ten years. From this day forward, not a single person perished, even though a great number of them still showed signs of the plague”.They made the pledge in  and the Passion Play was first performed at Pentecost in , on a wooden stage that some say was built on plague-victims’ graves near the church.Surviving documentation from the  production shows that the play ran ‘completed smoothly’ with seating provided ‘for spectators standing close by.’From  the date of the performance was changed to the beginning of each decade, by which time folk were coming from all over Germany to see substantial productions.Paint and painters for the  show’s scenery cost  guilders, ‘the gentlemen trumpeters’ got two guilders and  guilders went ‘to the actors for drink’!There was no performance in  when Maximilian III’s Clerical Council banned all passion plays and when another threat loomed in the s the so-called ‘mad’ King Ludwig II of Baia protected it from those who wanted to close down the ‘harmful’ passion plays. Following WWI the play was postponed until , and there was a special th anniversary show in  attended by Adolf Hitler.There were no performances in  during WWII, just the second cancellation…until now.Plans to perform the Passion Play in  are already under way, for over  five-hour shows, several thousand participants, a -strong orchestra and a -strong choir.\"\" for the newsletterKeep up with the latest news and views from Belfast News LetterSign Up Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-bEjcJn boXdXt\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-fOICqy kfiVLF\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-bEjcJn boXdXt\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-fOICqy kfiVLF\"This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us onExploreNewsSportIrish League FootballWhats OnLestyleFarming LeMore from the News LetterAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryLocal GuideReader ShopUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter\" fill\"#ea\"©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-bYSBpT sc-elJkPf kHpvMx\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policy Sign in\"Edit AccountSign OutSubscribeNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessEducationHealthPeopleRead ThisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"SportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoNightleRetroLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"LestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessCoronavirusFollow us \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

Michael said: “People think, the music is dark and intense, they’re going to be really dark and intense.The band’s original line-up of Michael, Andy and Fyfe \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues. Please try again later.Submitting...“The most messed-up people I find are people in pop music. A lot of them are horrible twisted people with weird agendas and they become quite damaged iniduals. Then they go on stage everything is rosy.“It’s really the old cliche – never judge a book by its cover. With us the lyrics are kind of twisted, but there’s a big, dark sense of humour there.“We let off steam when we go on stage and jump up and down for  minutes. You tend to be pretty chilled afterwards.”When the band first got together in  lead singer and guitarist Andy Cairns was a pupil at Ballyclare High. Michael, who attended Larne Grammar with Fyfe Ewing , wasn’t present for the band’s first recording though he was there in spirit.On the front cover of metal magazine Kerrang! in He said: “Fyfe and I were in the same English class and would have traded records. He was in a band, I was in a band. “His band and Andy’s band had played a gig at Jordanstown Uni. They had more in common than they did with their own bands. “They did a demo together. I was there in spirit because Andy didn’t have a bass guitar so Fyfe asked me and I lent Andy my bass. Andy played it on the first demo.” Michael soon joined to play his own bass and things clicked from the start: “Our first gig was at Giro’s supporting Decadence Within. It went down really well, I was flabbergasted. “We weren’t trying to be U or Guns N’ Roses – those were the two big musical things at that time in , . I don’t mind U and I quite like Guns N’ Roses but we had our own little thing going on.“You kind of gravitated towards anyone who liked something that wasn’t Bryan Adams at school. In Larne where I grew up the metallers hung out with the goths, the goths hung out with the indie kids and you heard Joy Division, The Dead Kennedys and Slayer. We clung together as musical outsiders.”The friendship between Michael and Andy has extended more than  years: “I think I was  or  when Andy and I first met. When the first album came out I’d just turned . I’ll be  later this month.“One thing we did find quite early on is that we tend to be huffers. We got that out of our system. If you don’t like something you say then, you don’t leave it for six months and have a meltdown in the middle of eastern Europe.“There’s a lot of rock and rolls myths and stereotypes out there that people love. One of them I think which is not correct is that you need to have creative tension in a band. Maybe that’s works for one or two albums, but that burns itself out really quickly.“It’s really great working together as part of the band, what I get out of it is quite special, I think I’m very lucky.”Michael contrasted the crazy intensity when the band shared a house together in Belfast’s Holylandswith the situation now where they all live in dferent parts of the UK.He said: “I think there was one time me and Andy worked out over an -months period we’d been within  metres of each other every day with the exception of Christmas Day.“Now I live in Larne, Andy lives in Cambridge and Neilour drummer lives in Derby. When we meet up there’s lots of interesting stories and dferent experiences to share rather than walk down the main street in Larne going, ‘oh there’s the lads’.”On Fyfe, his original bandmate who left in , he said: “I haven’t spoken to him since he left. We have friends in common. He’s doing alright I believe. He moved to Brighton, he’s been there  years now. He’s had very little involvement in the music business.“It’s a real pity because he was such a great drummer, it’s just he couldn’t really get on with the lestyle. Somewhere down the line we’ll meet again.”Family man with attic of collectablesLast year Michael contributed a recipe to a celebrity cookbook to support his nephew Matthew who had been diagnosed with acute myeloid leukaemia.Michael said: “Matthew is doing well. The family is getting things back on track. It was a big thing, he’s still a bit traumatised as you’d expect but he’s doing well.”Of family le at home in Larne he said: “My we works full time soI’m at home I’m daddy day care. The only downside is when I’m away, I’m away   so there’s a whole dferent set of challenges for my we who’s an absolute saint.”Askedhis children, aged nine and five, were excited about their dad being in an band, he said: “They saw us at a big festival in Europe which was great because they were at the side of the stage and they were able to see , people from the other side. “They’re quite blasé about their dad being in a band. They’re not into music that much, they’re more into games, football and karate.”Michael went on to discuss some of the Therapy  treasure trovecontained in his attic: “I’ve got Fyfe’s original snare drum that he used on Babyteeth, the basses that I used on Troublegum. I’ve got a lot of the flyers, posters, tour passes and recordings and audio stuff I’ve kept over the years. The attic is a disaster area.”In the early days of Therapy  a pair of denim dungarees were Michael’s stagewear of choice. Askedstill had them, he said: “I actually do. I’m quite pleased that I’d still fit into them but I never wear them.“When we did the Troublegum shows a while ago there were some bets that they’d turn up again, but it didn’t happen for whatever reason. But never say never – right now I don’t think the world is ready for that.”Michael explained that there were in fact two pairs of his trademark dungarees, one of them he referred to as ‘the good pair’ then immediately burst out laughing.“Can you imagine denim dungarees after three weeks of touring ” he said. “It’s hard to find a -hour laundrette when you’re on the road. They were crunchy. I’m surprised they’re still in one piece.”Dates cancelled due to pandemicTherapy  have had to cancel some European tour dates later this month because of the coronavirus.Michael said: “We’ve had to cancel where the crowds would have been above ,, some of the big festivals we were really looking forward to. As it stands we’re still planning to play some of the smaller shows unless told otherwise. “It’s something that you just can’t account for. Gigs sometimes have to be cancelled because of illness or injury but this is beyond the band’s control. It’s a bit of a headmelt.”Touring major European cities is a far cry from the band’s gigging schedule in : “When we started there was the Warzone Collective in Belfast and Hope Promotions in Dublin. They worked in conjunction and would bring hardcore punk bands over like Fugazi and Concrete Sox. “We knew the Warzone people and that led to us being invited down to Dublin to play with the likes of Babes In Toyland. “They’d rent rooms above pubs for gigs, in Belfast they used the Art College and the Conor Hall. “We were quite lucky to get in at that DIY stage.”It’s okay not to be okayMuch is currently being done to raise awareness and funds for musicians suffering from mental health issues, particularly through Aware NI, PIPS and Help Musicians. As a band Therapy  have been tuned into the struggle from day one with many of Andy’s lyrics exploring the pressures that weigh on the human mind.Michael said: “It’s something that we’re all very aware of and very sympathetic towards. Being a young male in Northern Ireland there’s a bit of a ‘come on, man up’ vibe. That has been very damaging for a couple of generations now.“There is a rock and roll myth that everyone’s an all-singing, all-dancing, all-fighting gunslinger – you roll into town decimate it and move on. It’s not really like that.“I don’t think anyone hasn’t been touched by themselves or someone  who has had a mental health issue.“It’s such a fragile thing. It’s right there, there just seems not to be the widespread acknowledgement that it exists and for treatment. It’s so underfunded. It’s a real tragedy.”He added: “We’ve always had a lot of empathy, we take people as they are, we don’t have the answers, but we do try to let people know that it’s okay to not be okay. “Just talk about it, talk to your friends, talk to someone, reach out. Thankfully that stigma is moving away.“We’ve always been celebrating the outsiders – be yourself, do you own thing, what makes you happy, self preservation, looking after yourself.”Michael continued: “It’s one of these rock and roll myths that people want their musicians to be messed up and die young and leave a pretty corpse. “None of us subscribe to that at all.“We like to have a good time when we’re on tour, but doing it for so long there’s a massive element of self preservation.“It’s about doing a good gig. People don’t come and see you againyou’re stood there looking bored or hungover. It’s not pleasant for anyone – the player or the watcher.“We all feel a big responsibility to put on a good show. There’s people who have seen us  plus times.“We want every show to be as goodnot better than the last time. You make a rod for your own back with that.”• Therapy  will play the Limelight on September  to celebrate the band’s th anniversary• To coincide with the ‘So Much for the  Year Plan’ tour the band re-recorded  of their UK Top  hits in Abbey Road with producer Chris Sheldon, who produced the original Troublegum album.

As the rain lashed down pretty much all day Friday and the wind did too much howling and yowling for my liking, we went to bed and then awoke to roads that looked like rivers between Sully and Barry and fields resembling lakes in Dinas Powys.My son and I played lsquospot the tops of the treesrsquo as we drove a erted route to get to his football match on Saturday morning and discussed climate change and the power of nature atas we drove through sun, hail, wind, and rain to get him to his match.The third weekend of storms has taken its toll. It feels tiring and worrying to be soaked once more.But it occurred to me as we left the house early and crawled along with other erted drivers that just a few miles up the road in Pontypridd and indeed in other parts of Wales and across the UK, people are witnessing their homes and business, their lives, being washed away and so as irritated and fed up as I may have been, I scrabbled for perspective.Perspective is a tough one. There will always be someone worse off and someone better off and whilst you can sympathise and empathise and seek to understand, you can only really know your own lived experience.But this is in part why I am so interested in the news, because in dealing with, embracing, enduring, revelling in my own le, I appreciate that window on the world to open my mind, teach me things and remind me that there are others in similar, same, better and much worse situations than me. It doesnrsquot stop a flooded road being frustrating, but it does remind me that in the midst of chuntering and muttering, because I do indulge in a chunter and mutter, thatpossible, it is important to take a moment to think about a world outside ourselves and our immediate surrounds.It can feel depressing. It is easy to feel powerless. But I do believe that as citizens in a democracy, it is important to have an idea about what is going on becausewe always turn a blind eye, eventually I fear, we might stop seeing anything at all. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

The aim is that these virtues help to form them.With such a vast space at its disposal, the school ensures that children are given a rich and versatile experience.In the orchard, pupils pick fruit from pear, apple, plum, and damson trees which they use in cooking lessons during the autumn.They also grow  dferent kinds of fruit, salad, and vegetables in a polytunnel.Earlier this year, St Josephrsquos Primary was awarded a gold award in the UNICEF Rights Respecting School programme.The award is granted to schools which show a commitment to promoting childrenrsquos rights and raising awareness of these amongst young people.It recognises efforts to place the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child at the heart of a schoolrsquos policies and practice.ldquoAlongside our work on rights is the fact that we want our children to be aware of their responsibilities, said Mr Rein.ldquoYes, they have rights to be heard, but they also have a responsibility to listen to others.St Josephrsquos was the first school in Wales to develop a pupil parliament.Every child is a member of the parliament, and elected representatives from eight student groups form a cabinet which has decision-making powers.ldquoThe school parliament is a vehicle for the pupils to have a voice, so they can decide how the school can be a better place, how the local community can improve, and how we can help the UN to achieve their global goals, continued Mr Rein.ldquoSo the children are looking inward ndash at themselves and how the school environment can improve ndash and looking outward at how we can develop better links with the parishes and the areas of Penarth and Dinas Powys.ldquoOur Eco Ministry has been involved in a project to tidy beaches and pick up plastic, and our Healthy Schools and School Mission team have given food to local foodbanks.St Josephrsquos Primary is one of  innovation schools which have been chosen to contribute to the Welsh Governmentrsquos new curriculum framework, which will be rolled out to every school in Wales by . As part of the new framework, schools are required to design their own curriculum based upon the needs of specic learners, rather than adhering to a national learning program.St Josephrsquos curriculum is lsquoresearch-ledrsquo, meaning it is based on findings in child development and cognitive science.Teachers have undertaken training on how childrenrsquos bodies and minds develop, and lessons have been designed to enhance pupilsrsquo personal, social, and physical development.Mr Rein said: ldquoWe want our children to develop physically in terms of their gross motor skills, their fine motor skills, and their locomotion skills.ldquoWe have apparatus on which they can hang, climb, and swing, to build up their core strength.Mr Rein called the schoolrsquos curriculum lsquoreally ambitions.rsquoldquoWe are one of sixteen innovation schools in Wales helping to implement the new curriculum and develop special projects to do with the curriculum, he said.ldquoWe have taken that on by focusing on a knowledge-rich curriculum, so that we develop childrenrsquos knowledge, skills, and give them fantastic experiences.ldquoWe have taken good, rich materials from lots of dferent places, and developed some of our own, which we have implemented to a high standard.ldquoBehaviour in the school is exemplary partly because we have spent a long time asking what good teachers do.ldquoWe practice together as staff, so our teachers are working at a high level using a very well-researched curriculum.In last yearrsquos maths reasoning test,  per cent of pupils at St Josephrsquos scored higher than the national average, and  per cent of pupils scored above average in the National Reading TestldquoWersquore extremely proud of our achievements at St Josephrsquos, said Mr Rein.ldquoEverything we do is based on the best available research and is designed to help each inidual child thrive.The schoolrsquos curriculum has recently been praised by cabinet member for education and regeneration, Councillor Lis Burnett, who said St Josephrsquos had done a lsquobrilliant job.rsquoShe said: ldquoThe new Curriculum for Wales is inspiring schools to take a more holistic approach toward learning.ldquoIt encourages them to focus more on how and why the curriculum is being delivered, rather than delivering specic content and academic results.ldquoSt Josephrsquos have done a brilliant job in helping craft this approach, and in turn have seen their own curriculum and learning practices blossom. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It will cut planned capital spending to pound million from a budget of pound million and will work to grow online.MS said in a statement: \"Whilst we remain confident that the post-crisis future of the business and our transformation programme remains as strong as ever, trading over the next nine to  months in our clothing and home and international businesses is likely to be severely impacted.\"As a result, it is not possible to provide meaningful guidance on future earnings, although we are taking every step to secure future value for shareholders, colleagues and suppliers.\"The chairman of Wetherspoon has said that a decline in sales was accelerated when prime minister Boris Johnson told people to stay away from pubs.After rising in previous weeks, sales fell by . per cent in the week to March  and the slowdown has picked up further since the Prime Ministers statement, Tim Martin said.It came as the business reported profit before tax rose  per cent to pound. million in the half-year to January  on revenue of pound million.Health secretary Matt Hancock has warned that coronavirus will keep spreading as long as people continue to socialise.Speaking on talkRadio, Mr Hancock said: \"If you stay at home you are saving lives.\"I know, of course, this is a more dangerous disease for older people but not exclusively, some young people get it too.\"But, more importantly, the more that people continue to go out and continue to socialise, the more it will spread and the longer were going to have to keep these measures in place.\"So, were urging people to follow the public health advice.In the emergency Bill thats in front of Parliament right now, we are taking the powers to be able to enforce these measures, so we can make it happen by lawwe need to.\"Id rather not do that and the evidence so far is that the vast majority of people are following the advice, are doing what is sensible and right.\"The company said it was cancelling its interim idend, which had been p a year earlier.Mr Martin said: \"It is obviously very dficult to predict, in these circumstances, how events will unfold in future weeks and months, but we now anticipate profits being below market expectations, so long as the current health scare continues.\"As a result of this uncertainty, it is impossible to provide realistic guidance on our performance in the remainder of the financial year.\"The company has decided to delay most capital projects and to reduce expenditure, where possible, including the cancellation of the interim idend.\"As a result of these actions, combined with the Governments proposals on business rates relief and credit guarantee facilities, the company believes it has sufficient liquidity to maintain operations at a substantially lower level of sales.\"Nicola Sturgeon has urged anyone who left the medical profession in the past three years to consider ing to help the fight against coronavirus.Sharing a plea from Scotlands chief nursing officer Fiona McQueen, the First minister tweeted: \"Scotlands NHS needs our help to meet the #coronavirus challenge.\"Mr Hancock said some retired medics whoto work in the NHS to fight the coronavirus will be able to come \"straight back in\".Asked on the BBCs Breakfast programme when workers couldto the NHS, he said: \"Well, over the next couple of weeks because for some theyll have very recently left and they can come straight back in, their annual trainings been up-to-date and they can just restart.\"Imagineyouve left at Christmas, for instance, you can restart straight away. For others who have been out for a little bit longer, they may need more of a refresher because, of course, its vital that we keep people safe, thats the whole point of the NHS.\"So the letter will go out today, well then be engaging inidually with all those who respond and I very much hope that many, many thousands will respond.\"From those Ive talked to, I think people can see just how important this is. The training will happen for those who need it over the next couple of weeks, at the same time well allocate people to a hospital near them because theres a logistical exercise here as well.\"Mr Hancock suggested that tougher measures could have to be brought inpeople do not follow the Governments advice.He told the BBCs Breakfast programme: \"What I can say is thatpeople follow the advice, stay home which saves lives andthey keep apart from others, more than two metres, more than six foot, then we can tackle this and we can turn the tide.\"The scientists advise that we can turn the tide in  weekspeople follow the advice.\"If people dont follow the advice, then itll be longer and we might have to bring more and tougher measures.\"He added: \"We have brought these measures in earlier than Italy did in terms of where theyre up to with the number of cases.\"But were absolutely clear thatwe need to, we have the powers, in fact weve got a Bill in front of Parliament now to strengthen those powers further.\"But I think its far betterpeople follow the advice.\"The FTSE  has risen by more than five per cent in early trading as travel companies jump out ahead after a bruising few weeks for the sector sparked by the Covid- pandemic.Intercontinental Hotels jumped by about a fth despite revealing that demand for rooms was the worst it had ever seen, as markets opened on Friday.EasyJet also rose by around  per cent and cruise operator Carnival jumped by around . per cent.Meanwhile, the price of a barrel of Brent crude oil joined the rally, rising five per cent to . dollarsafter a massive fall earlier in the week.Shadow chancellor John McDonnell has warned about the prospect of a recessionpeople do not receive their wages.Labour has urged the Government to ensure the salaries of workers are protected as businesses lose trade during the coronavirus pandemic.He told the BBCs Breakfast programme: \"We need the Government now to act to protect people to keep them in their jobs.\"In that way, what well be able to do is ensure people have an income coming in, their job will be protected, but we prevent the second wave of a recession hitting uswere not careful.\"Becausepeople lose their jobs, they dont have their wages, demand collapses in the economy and then you really do have a recession.\"The lesson from past crises like these is act fast and act big, so thats why were saying the Government should step in and say to employers, well cover  per cent of your wages, you keep people in work.\"Demand for a room at Intercontinental Hotels has reached its lowest point in history, the group said, as the travel industry continues to be battered by the coronavirus pandemic.The business revealed that it would be cutting costs, eliminating its idend and reducing salaries in a bid to save cash.However, shares in the group, which have been badly hit in recent months, jumped by around  per cent on market open in London as investors reacted positively to the companys proposals.Chief executive Keith Barr said: \"Demand for hotels is currently at the lowest levels weve ever seen.Intercontinental Hotel Group has a robust business model and the measures we are announcing today to reduce costs and preserve cash give us the capacity to manage the business through this unique environment and to support our owners during this incredibly dficult time.\"These were not easy choices and we are mindful of the impact these decisions will have on our colleagues and shareholders.\"However, we believe that these are essential to ensuring that we come out of this as strong as we possibly can and ready to capitalise on what remains an industry with excellent long-term growth potential.\"Geoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders , said the list of key workers to whom schools will remain open is \"perhaps more extensive than we might have expected\".He said: \"Realistically, theywill need to identy these children by lunchtime.\"Mr Barton added: \"We already know from the trajectory of this that were not going to have many staff.\"We have to be careful that the message to parents is not business as usual.\"Matt Hancock said that a communication will be sent to around . million people who are classed as vulnerable to set out specic action for them to take.The Health secretary told Sky News: \"The first thing were going to do is set out exactly what conditions that applies to.\"We expect about . million people to then get a communication from the NHS to say that they are part of this and what they need to do.\"Many of these people have pre-existing health conditions and so will be very worried right now, and I understand that, and theyll need very specic sets of action - for instance, how do you go about still getting your chemoyou have cancer whilst also social-distancing \"If you have cancer its particularly important to stay away from other people, but you also of course have got to keep going with your chemotherapy.\"He added: \"These are some of the most dficult and challenging cases so well be getting in contact with them, butpeople think that they are on this list and dont receive a communication from the NHS, then they also need to get in contact.\"So that is under way, the money was announced for it yesterday.\"A combination of money to the NHS and money to councils because theyve got a very big part to play in keeping people safe.\"ASCL general secretary Geoff Barton said schools will have first worked to identy vulnerable children, as they will know who they are, and will then be looking at the \"key worker\" category.He said the ASCL is telling members: \"You have to do your best to negotiate the key workers list. Youre doing this to a tight timescale, and what you offer children on Monday may be dferent to what you offer next Wednesday.\"Mr Barton said that initially, schools will be doing all they can so that pupils who need to can still turn up to their own school after the weekend.In the longer term, there will be more strategic planning of school provision, he added.Paul Whiteman, general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers , said: \"The Government has made clear that every child who can be safely cared for at home should be. And their advice makes clear too that this applies to children of key workers.\"For the vast majority of children and young people, school buildings will close tonight and not reopen for the foreseeable future.\"Taking up a place at school during this time of wider closure is the offer of last resort, for the minority of key workers, who have no alternative.\"School leaders have many questions that remain unanswered about how this will work in practice. We will continue to work with the Government throughout the day to provide greater clarity to schools to enable this reduced offer to be up and running as soon as possible.\"Dr Mary Bousted, joint general secretary of the National Education Union, added her voice to calls from school leaders urging parents to only send their children in as a last resort.She said: \"This is a very long list and could result in some schools having the majority of pupils attending. This will not achieve the goal of slowing the spread of the virus.\"So it is vitally important that parents follow government advice to keep their children at home, wherever possible. Schools can only accommodate a limited number of children and the fewer children making the journey to school, and the fewer children in educational settings, the lower the risk that the virus can spread.\"The competition watchdog has launched a taskforce to tackle businesses looking to exploit the coronavirus outbreak to take advantage of customers.The Competition and Markets Authoritysaid the outbreak has prompted concerns that people could be exploited by companies \"charging excessive prices or making misleading claims about their products\".It said it has already contacted traders and s over excessive pricing of hand sanitiser as part of its efforts.Andrea Coscelli, the CMAs chief executive, said: \"This is obviously a time when we all have to behave responsibly to protect our fellow citizens, and particularly those who are most vulnerable.\"We urge retailers to behave responsibly in the exceptional circumstances of the Covid- outbreak.\"Butthey do not, our taskforce is monitoring market developments to enable us to intervene as quickly as possible.\"We have a range of options at our disposal, from warnings to enforcement action to seeking emergency powers.\"The ceremonial of the Changing of the Guard at Buckingham Palace, St Jamess Palace and Windsor Castle is being postponed until further notice \"in line with Government advice to avoid mass gatherings\", Buckingham Palace has announced.The palace said in a statement that the situation would be \"reviewed on an ongoing basis, with a view to restarting when appropriate\". article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief.
