It reminded me of a meeting I had as Defence Secretary in the Elysee Palace in Paris, which I described in my book, Rising Tides.I was talking with a senior member of the French government about how we had won the Cold War not just because of our military and economic superiority, but because we also had a moral superiority and belief in our values.I asked why we had been so willing to use the word ‘better’ – democracy was better than dictatorship, freedom better than oppression, capitalism better than communism – but were so afraid to use it now.Surely, in relation to fundamentalist Islamism, the subject of the day, our ways are better – better to have religious tolerance than violently imposed orthodoxy, to have a concept of universal human rights, societies in which women play an equal role? The answer was depressing: ‘I don’t think we can really say “better” nowadays,’ I was told, ‘only “different”.’If this is what we believe, we are in deep trouble. Has the concept of moral equivalence become so prevalent it has diminished our belief in what has made us who we are?If we do not believe our values are better and worth defending, why should anyone else listen to us?We need more ‘better’ and less ‘different’, otherwise we risk losing the battle of ideas and ideals. We don’t simply have a different world view to Russia or China, we have a better view. It’s time we all believed, or we face a very difficult future.The Rt Hon Dr Liam Fox MP is former Defence and International Trade Secretary.

Staff working on that route had believed their job was “as safe as a house,” he said.Mr O’Donoghue said he believed the move from the company was an attempt to “get rid of unionised staff”.Protests were held at a number of ports on Friday, including Larne, over the decision to sack staff, with trade unions calling for a boycott of the company.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"union says 60 irish employees among the 800 crew sacked by p o ferries","story":"An aerial view shows P\u0026O vessels Norbank (left) and Norbay moored in Liverpool. Photograph: Getty At least 60 employees who lost their jobs when P\u0026ampO Ferries sacked them on Thursday are from Ireland, their trade union has stated. Maritime union, Nautilus International, official Mickey Smyth said he estimated that 25 workers from the Republic and 35 from the North are among the 800 who were dismissed without notice on Thursday. Most work on the European Causeway vessel which sails between Larne and Cairnryan. The workers affected were employed by a hiring agency in Jersey and are subject to UK law. Mr Smyth said the workers on the P\u0026ampO Ferries ferry between Liverpool and Dublin are not affected as they are employed under Dutch law. The company said its services between Liverpool and Dublin resumed on SaturdayThe Dublin-Liverpool route is serviced by two roll-on, roll-off passenger and freight ships, the Bermuda-flagged Norbay and the Dutch-flagged Norbank.The Norbank left Dublin Port at 7.30am on Saturday morning for a scheduled sailing and is due back from Liverpool on Saturday. “The Dutch obviously have different employment laws and they are protected. It is not part of the dispute. The other vessels are chartered vessels which are impacted,” he said. Mr Smyth said he hoped the Irish Government would intervene to persuade P\u0026ampO Ferries to change its mind. The British government has said it is unhappy with the decision and is investigating the legalities of it. Mr Smyth added that he felt the actions of P\u0026ampO Ferries copied the example of Irish Ferries which sacked 543 workers and replaced them with cheaper foreign workers. P\u0026ampO Ferries terminated the employment by conference call on Thursday. They are being replaced by cheaper agency staff. The decision has caused outrage among unions and politicians in the UK and there have been calls for the boycott of the ferry company. P\u0026ampO Ferries, which transports passengers and freight, operates four routes: Dover to Calais Hull to Rotterdam Liverpool to Dublin and Cairnryan to Larne. It has 2,200 employees remaining in the UK and began operating ferries in the 1960s.In a letter to staff Mr Hebblethwaite said P\u0026ampO Ferries was losing £100 million a year and had to change its business model. The Norbank is crewed by Dutch officers and Filipino crew.Nautilus general secretary Mark Dickinson expressed the union’s anger at this move by the company, and warned there was a clear threat to public safety posed by agency crew.“Clearly, we are outraged by this suggestion. We call on the public to boycott P\u0026ampO Ferries and to not travel with this shameful business,” he said.“We ask the government to act in support of loyal UK seafarers, and we demand to know how its vessels can run with agency crew who are unfamiliar with the vessel.” His union tweeted: “P\u0026ampO chief executive Peter Hebblethwaite reckons the Liverpool-Dublin route will restart today. Nautilus demands to know how the vessels can run with agency crew unfamiliar with the ship? The government must urgently inspect the vessel and make its report public.”Liverpool West Derby MP Ian Byrne tweeted: “I’m sure the good folk of Liverpool and Dublin will boycott this scab vessel if it restarts today.

Photograph: Stefan RousseauPA WireBritish Labour party leader Keir Starmer has called for a relationship between Britain and Ireland based on equal respect that acknowledges both governments’ roles as co-guarantors of the Belfast Agreement rather than simply consultees.He said the relationship had been dominated by Brexit in recent years but it had a rich and long history that was bigger than the current dispute over the Northern Ireland protocol.“And I felt they were some of the most uplifting years in my working life because there was so much progress going on, so much change going on. You could feel it, you could see it, you could sense it when you were there.

Other speakers included Trade Union Congress (TUC) general secretary Frances O’Grady, Labour MP Conor McGinn, who chairs Westminster All-Party Parliamentary Group on the Irish in Britain and Adrian O’Neill, Ireland’s ambassador to Britain.Mr O’Neill said that this year’s St Patrick’s Day events in London had been conceived as a celebratory return to personal contact after two years of the coronavirus pandemic but they had been overshadowed by the war in Ukraine.“To some extent, we have to kind of dial it down a little bit or at least recognise that while we are enjoying this opportunity to meet in person and celebrate all the things that we really cherish, our democracy, our human rights, our independence, sovereignty, all of those core values that they are absolutely now being trampled on in Ukraine,” he said.“In Ireland, we’re working very, very closely with the UK, with the US with like-minded partners in the Security Council of the UN, within the EU, the Human Rights Council in Geneva, the International Criminal Court, using all the mechanisms at our disposal to isolate and increase pressure on Putin and his regime.”"},{"url":null,"title":"inside politics lionel barber on putin and how the west should deal with him","story":"As Russia’s brutal assault on Ukraine enters its fourth week, with little sign of an outcome, the question of what an endgame of this war might look like is increasingly the subject of international debate.

Russell Brand, formerly known for stand-up comedy, hosting reality shows and making incendiary phone calls about granddaughters of Fawlty Towers actors, can now be found posting ‘truth-seeking’ daily videos and weekly podcasts to some 10m people across YouTube and Instagram. Recent episodes include ‘You’ve Been LIED To About Why Ukraine War Began’ ‘Can We REALLY Trust Vaccine Fact-Checkers??!’, and ‘Trump was RIGHT About Clinton \u0026amp Russia Collusion!!’. It’s all a far cry from the man three times named ‘S------ of the Year’ by The Sun.The charismatic Brand, who became ubiquitous in the mid-Noughties, has harnessed his popularity into virtual populism, his ‘anti-partisan’ videos winning millions of fans across both Left and Right. The 15-minute posts usually begin with thanks to “awakened beings” for joining the “journey to truth” he has defended both Putin and Trump, decries billionaires, and wants to root out racism. Brand detests authority – mass media and the Government being the primary evils – and wants revolution. So much so that he wrote a book of that name in 2014 (from the country pile of his then-girlfriend, heiress Jemima Khan).Seemingly modelling himself on Joe Rogan – the controversial US podcasting phenom who followed the stand-up to reality presenter to populist pundit pipeline to become one of the most powerful figures in American media – Brand promises to “say the unsayable”, earning himself a loyal, and large, following. The 46-year-old says he is not there to flout conspiracy theories, but to ask questions and “create new narratives” – a similar defence employed by Rogan, who in January found himself at the centre of a scandal after being accused of peddling Covid mistruths.One episode of the Joe Rogan Experience, which has 11m listeners, resulted in a letter from more than 270 doctors slamming the programme as a “menace to public health”. Neil Young and Joni Mitchell told Spotify, the platform on which his podcast is streamed, that it had to ditch Rogan or their back catalogues Rogan won out. The brouhaha only solidified the status that the podcasting behemoths now wield – which is good news for brand Brand.There are major differences in their approaches, however. While both are martial arts fans keen to host isive figures – Rogan’s include ex-NRA leader and Sandy Hook-denier Alex Jones, academic Jordan Peterson and Gavin McInnes, founder of the far-Right Proud Boys group – the US presenter’s hours-long conversations belie a genuine desire to find what makes his interviewees tick. Brand is a different beast, his videos a stream of verbal ablutions that begin with a plea for viewers to buy tickets to his live tour (his T-shirts bearing anti-Government slogans sell for £25.99). ‘Stay Free’ is splashed across merch from tea towels to phone cases and mugs, the latter of which also features his face. His site promises that “grants using money generated by this endeavour” will be made, though no further details are provided.Brand – an avowed anti-capitalist with a net worth over £10m, according to Spear’s – was criticised for his 2017 book Recovery: Freedom from Our Addictions, which some said was a for-profit version of the 12-step programme used for alcohol and drug addicts (which is available for free). “The point is that you don’t profit from the 12 steps,” says an insider who knew Brand as his star was rising that is “really frowned upon”. But he’s “very funny, he’s very charming,” she admits. “When I was with him, I felt like I was the only person in the world.”It is this “incredible ability to make people feel as though he’s talking just to them” that has supercharged his online success. “This is what it feels like to be part of a conversation,” he tells viewers in a video posted this week: “to be heard, to be seen.”Henry Jeffreys saw that appeal up close in 2007, when working as a publicist for My Booky Wook – Brand’s sex and drink-fuelled memoir. “People loved him,” he recalls of Brand’s effusive chats with old ladies and security guards. Back then, Brand was a household name, thanks to hosting E4’s spin-off show Big Brother’s Big Mouth, appearing in Hollywood films from Forgetting Sarah Marshall to Get Him to the Greek, and tabloid-documented liaisons with Kate Moss, Sadie Frost, Geri Halliwell (and many, many more).By the middle of the last decade, Brand had interviewed Holocaust-denier David Icke on multiple occasions and, in 2015, invited the would-be Labour leader Ed Miliband on his YouTube show, The Trews (a portmanteau of True News), so great was his appeal among young voters deemed to be by politicians. Brand, at the time, was not registered to vote.“There are particular iniduals within the anti-vaccine world who are amenable to pro-Russian propaganda,” according to Imran Ahmed, executive director of the Center for Countering Digital Hate, who notes that there is also crossover among supporters of QAnon (the group who believed Trump was fighting a cabal of Satan-worshipping paedophiles across the government, media and corporate worlds). Rather than these groups fading with Covid, experts warn that the same mindset – dismissing the prevailing logic so as to deny the status quo, no matter the evidence – will merely be transferred to other crises.This has also led to hybrid conspiracies: such as that the US has long had a secret, illegitimate bioweapons lab in Ukraine, which now works with bat-borne coronavirus samples, which Russia is simply attempting to destroy.Brand never clearly nails down his own views, “discussing” conspiracies, so as to skirt accusations of being a conspiracist. He is helped somewhat by those who still associate him with his cheeky Noughties screen persona and former marriage to pop star Katy Perry, as well as his quest for wellness – the subject of another of his YouTube channels – and faithful practise of yoga and veganism, all of which obfuscate possible sightings of tin foil hats.He is currently touring the UK with ‘The 33’, which consists of three segments – his back story, the hypocrisy of the Government during the pandemic, and a meditation with the crowd. An Instagram post from Monday’s show in Sheffield features him clasping the hands of an audience member, as others watch on in wonder at what Brand called “a magical meeting of souls”.Rogan’s brand remains more steak and dumbbells than spinach and savasanas. But the pair share a great deal: both are “funny and fearless”, says listener Jon Miltimore, 42, who appreciates their ability to “talk intelligently about complex ideas and provocative ideas” these are men who aren’t “afraid to poke at those sacred cows, and to question authority”.They share mutual affection, too. “You’ve emerged authentically,” Rogan told his British counterpart during a marathon three-and-a-half-hour episode of his podcast in 2019. “This is who you really are… you found yourself.”Brand – who posted videos of support over Rogan’s Spotify debacle earlier this year – also cited him in his 2019 book, Mentors, in a nod to his “influence and impact.” With a net worth of around £92m, Rogan is still around 10 times bigger than Brand – but with his YouTube subscribers climbing by a million in a month, that gap may yet be closing.My Booky Wook was a bestseller My Conspiracy Wiracy is looking like a dead cert.More from NewsRussia-Ukraine latest news: Mariupol art school bombed with 400 civilians sheltering insideSpring Equinox 2022: Fairies, cherry blossom trees and why you should visit StonehengeBoris Johnson frustrated with Rishi Sunak over ‘resistance’ to new nuclear power plantsBritish Summer Time 2022: How Chris Martin\u0026#39s great-great-grandfather ensured our clocks go forwardWhen will free Covid lateral flow tests come to an end in the UK?More from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"britain has opened arms need","story":"The first phase opened on Friday for visa applications from Ukrainians who have named people willing to sponsor them, and we are working at pace to expand the scheme to organisations, including charities, businesses and faith groups. This is in addition to the Ukraine Family Scheme I set up earlier this month to allow those in Ukraine with family already settled in the UK to be reunited with them here, with the right to work and free access to whatever services they may need. We have granted 8,600 visas through that scheme so far – each offering an opportunity for security in the UK. And we have made changes to the visa process, so Ukrainians with a valid passport no longer have to attend in-person appointments to submit fingerprints or facial verification before coming to the UK, ensuring people can come here as quickly as possible.We want Ukrainian refugees to thrive here, just like the people we have welcomed from Syria, Hong Kong, and Afghanistan. They will have access to public services, from the NHS and specialist mental health services to education and benefits. This is backed up by extra government funding for local authorities. And despite the misinformation being peddled by some, the Government has not set a cap on the number of Ukrainians who can be helped through our schemes.Our human instinct to provide immediate help for as many people as possible has nonetheless had to be balanced with my main responsibility – the security of our nation. The processes that we have put in place follow the advice of our intelligence and security services. They mean we can help Ukrainians in need, without making our country less safe.We cannot afford to forget that in very recent history agents of the Russian state have sought to commit murder on British soil and that a Russian-sourced chemical weapon deployed in the UK resulted in the death of a British citizen. It would be a dereliction of the Government’s duty if lax controls on those entering the country without documentation were to result in an influx of agents working for the Putin regime.The British public can be reassured that concerns about security will always be in mind while we work to ensure that our operational processes are as agile and flexible as possible for the vulnerable people we are helping.The UK has always been a place of sanctuary which stands for freedom and democracy, and against barbarism and tyranny.More from NewsRussia-Ukraine latest news: Mariupol \u0026#39destroyed and wiped off the face of the earth\u0026#39 Spring Equinox 2022: Fairies, cherry blossom trees and why you should visit StonehengeBoris Johnson frustrated with Rishi Sunak over ‘resistance’ to new nuclear power plantsBritish Summer Time 2022: How Chris Martin\u0026#39s great-great-grandfather ensured our clocks go forwardWhen will free Covid lateral flow tests come to an end in the UK?More from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"exclusive nazanin zaghari ratcliffe spends first days reunited","story":"Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe and her family spent their first days together in Britain staying at a government-owned grace-and-favour mansion in the Buckinghamshire countryside, The  can reveal.The British-Iranian national, who was imprisoned in Tehran for nearly six years until her release this week, was driven from RAF Brize Norton in the early hours of Thursday morning to Dorneywood, a country home historically used by Chancellors of the Exchequer.She stayed there until Saturday morning with her husband Richard and daughter Gabriella, and was pictured on Friday making pizzas with them in the house’s large professional kitchen.Dorneywood is an 18th-century Georgian property donated to the National Trust in 1947 by Lord Courtauld-Thomson, a British businessman who had previously used it to house officers from the allied air forces.It sits in 215 acres of parkland and woodland, and boasts a swimming pool, conservatory and croquet lawn famously used by the house’s former occupant, John Prescott.Generally, the house has been used by Chancellors of the Exchequer, but the Prime Minister can choose to allow any member of the Government to use it. In recent years it has been used by Philip Hammond, Sajid Javid and Rishi Sunak.Like Chequers, the Prime Minister’s grace-and-favour home, and Chevening, which is usually used by the Foreign Secretary, the house is managed by a trust overseen by peers, aristocrats and heritage experts.Government departments can request use of the house from the trust, which was this week snapped up by the Foreign Office, who designated it as a “safe house” for Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe and her family.The family were sworn to secrecy on the location of the property in an attempt to allow them to reunite in peace, outside of the glare of the media.Broadcasters positioned a camera outside their London house for two days after Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe’s return to the UK in the hope of picturing their return home.On Friday Mr Ratcliffe tweeted that his wife and daughter were making pizzas in the kitchen, accompanied by a photograph at Dorneywood that was quickly copied by Tulip Siddiq, a Labour MP who has been campaigning for his wife’s release.The  understands he was later contacted by Foreign Office officials who asked him to delete it because they were concerned it would allow their location to be identified.Mr Ratcliffe has been prolific in the British media since his wife’s imprisonment in Iran in April 2016, after she was accused of training journalists in the country - a claim he has always denied.He has completed two hunger strikes since her internment in an attempt to persuade ministers to do more to secure her release.The Iranian regime finally agreed to allow her to leave the country this week, after Liz Truss, the Foreign Secretary, negotiated a deal involving the UK repaying a decades-old debt of £400million.Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe was accompanied by Anoosheh Ashoori, 66, a fellow British-Iranian national imprisoned by the regime in 2017.As Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe disembarked from her jet at RAF Brize Norton in the early hours of Thursday morning, seven-year-old Gabriella was heard to exclaim: “Mummy!” Mr Ratcliffe told reporters that the trio were “looking forward to a new life”.You can\u0027t get back the time that\u0027s gone,” he said.“That\u0027s a fact. But we live in the future.Ms Truss tweeted on their return to the UK: “Delighted that Nazanin and Anoosheh have landed safely in the UK and are reunited with their families and loved ones.

Parents and children begged to be killed together. One mother spent her last moments breastfeeding her baby. The child was hurled, still alive, into the mass of corpses, and she leapt after it. They were among the 33,761 civilians murdered that day.I’m sorry: I know that last paragraph wasn’t easy to read. Believe me, it wasn’t much fun to write. But I want to put Ukraine’s present agonies into their full, horrific context. Between 1933 and 1945, Ukraine had the highest mortality rate on Earth. Again and again, its people suffered indiscriminate slaughter at the hands of the authorities: the liquidation of the kulaks, the campaigns against supposed Polish and Ukrainian nationalists, the starvation of Soviet and German POWs, the Einsatzgruppen massacres, the NKVD executions, the reprisal killings.We think of the First and Second World Wars as uniquely destructive but, in the longer view, they were terrifyingly typical. Yes, in terms of absolute numbers killed, the Second World War heads the league. But that is because there were more human beings on the planet than in ancient or mediaeval times. As a proportion of the global population, earlier conflicts, from the Mongol conquests to the Taiping Rebellion were more lethal.His findings are counterintuitive and, in my experience, many people refuse flat-out to believe them. We are attuned to bad news. We are far more aware of the fighting in Ukraine than of the absence of fighting in Vietnam or former Yugoslavia. Yet Pinker’s statistics are unanswerable.What makes the current atrocities stand out is the same thing that makes the Holodomor and the Holocaust stand out, namely their proximity to us in time. We struggle to imagine how Mongol raids must have been experienced by medieval villagers. But when we look at pictures of mid-twentieth century Kyiv, we see people who used telephones, took photographs, drove to work wearing suits. What was true of the victims was also true of the perpetrators.Historically, though, there was nothing unique about those abominations. From the rise of the first city-states in Egypt, Mesopotamia and China, human relations were characterised by conquest and slavery. Despotic emperors would seize territory, slaughter the men and enslave the women and children, muscle-power being, in those days, the most valuable resource. The gulags and the concentration camps were a grisly twentieth century refinement but the principle of working captured populations to death, or of condemning entire groups on grounds of ethnicity, is as old as civilization.Consider, to pluck an example at random, the Biblical Dinah, the daughter of Jacob, after whom the Babi Yar survivor was ultimately named. Her story is told in Genesis 34. She was abducted and raped by Shechem the son of Hamor the Hivite, who then asked her family for permission to marry her. Jacob agreed on condition that the men of Shechem\u0027s tribe accepted circumcision. The Hivites duly performed the rite. But while they were still “sore” from their circumcision, Jacob’s sons “came upon the city boldly and slew all the males”.The story strikes modern readers as shocking, but it is we who are the exception. For almost all human history, few would have thought Jacob’s behaviour reprehensible. The oldest ethic was “my tribe good, your tribe bad”. Our contemporary objections to the story would have been subordinated to the fiercer imperative of vendetta.Could we be returning to that older ethic? We might dismiss Putin as an outlier. But can we be certain that he is not also an augur? It might seem a trivial thing, but look at how quickly we have extended our quarrel with Putin to all Russians. An orchestra in Montreal cancels a Russian pianist, despite his opposition to the invasion Tchaikovsky is dropped from programmes Russian paintings are removed from exhibitions. My tribe good, your tribe bad.These cancellations are happening in a culture newly primed to categorise and condemn. We damn institutions for some ancient benefaction. We stop publishing authors because of opinions that had nothing to do with their work. We teach identity politics, encouraging people to believe that they have grievances or obligations purely on grounds of their physiognomy.Can we still rely on Pinker’s thesis, derived ultimately from the Australian philosopher Peter Singer, of expanding moral circles? The publication of his book in 2011 was followed by the Syrian war – another enormity in which Putin had a bloody hand – which reversed some of some of the graphs showing declining violence. The second decade of this century saw the global trend towards law-based democracy thrown into reverse. The lockdowns revealed a terrifying appetite for authoritarian rule, even in traditionally liberal societies. Perhaps we have passed the uplands and are back in the shadows.Yet there are signs of hope. Ukraine’s war is, in effect, a struggle for Western values. Ukrainians want their politicians to be servants, not masters. They want free elections, secure property rights and impartial courts. These things are recent constructions but they have plainly not lost their inspirational force, their ability to engender heroism. So far, most Western societies have also rallied to the defence of their values. Putin’s aggression against a country that offered him no threat has jolted even the far-Right Continental parties out of their grotesque admiration for him.Still, are we clear about what it is we are defending? Do we continue to believe that iniduals trump groups and that laws must be general, equal and certain? Or are we sliding into our own version of collectivism, where group rights are what count, where we are treated differently according to our physical characteristics, and where the greatest achievement of the West – the dissemination of science, law, and the Enlightenment – is regarded as contemptible imperialism?There is obviously a difference between identity politics and genocide. But it is, if you think about it, a difference of degree. The surest defence against massacres and collective punishments is to instill the counter-intuitive idea of liberty.More from NewsRussia-Ukraine latest news: Mariupol art school bombed with 400 civilians sheltering insideSpring Equinox 2022: Fairies, cherry blossom trees and why you should visit StonehengeBoris Johnson frustrated with Rishi Sunak over ‘resistance’ to new nuclear power plantsBritish Summer Time 2022: How Chris Martin\u0026#39s great-great-grandfather ensured our clocks go forwardWhen will free Covid lateral flow tests come to an end in the UK?More from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"resurrecting iran nuclear deal would epic mistake","story":"In 2018, President Trump withdrew the United States from the agreement, blaming Iran’s hostage taking, its continued missile development and its active support for groups such as the Houthis, who precipitated and exacerbated the bloody conflict in Yemen. When Iran refused to sign an agreement covering these issues, tighter US sanctions saw the Iranian currency go into free fall, a massive flight of capital from the country, and a deep recession follow.Iran has been an active and consistent supporter of Palestinian terrorist organisations, including Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ) and Hamas. Lebanese Hezbollah remains Iran’s primary terrorist proxy with the group’s secretary-general, Hassan Nasrallah, proudly boasting that “Hezbollah gets its money and arms from Iran, and as long as Iran has money, so does Hezbollah.”The implications of lifting sanctions on Iran are crystal-clear. It is through such proxies that Iran targets Israel and Israeli interests and gives effect to the long-standing hatred of Iran’s leader, Ayatollah Khamenei, for the very existence of the Israeli state.When the original agreement was being drawn up, negotiators concluded that in order to make progress, they would have to isolate the nuclear deal from the other areas of concern. Abandoning the original aim of preventing Iran from developing a nuclear bomb, they eventually watered-down their ambitions and agreed to simply delay it.Constraints on enrichment capabilities were designed to lengthen the time it would take Iran to produce enough weapons-grade uranium for a single bomb to at least one year for the first 10 years of the agreement. The effect was simply to hand the crisis to succeeding governments further down the line.Today, Iran has the largest and most erse ballistic missile arsenal in the Middle East, with most coming from foreign sources, especially North Korea. It is the only country to have developed a 1,200-mile missile without first having a nuclear weapons capability. The implication is blindingly obvious. Iran has unveiled 10 new ballistic missiles and three new satellite launch vehicles (SLVs) since 2015, while in his first budget, the new President, Ebrahim Raisi, earmarked almost £200 million for ballistic missile projects.All of this comes at a time when Western governments are desperate to find a replacement source for Russian fossil fuels. It would be complete folly if, in trying to escape from our dependency on Putin’s oil and gas, we were to end up funding the development of another nuclear state whose political stability, human-rights record and disregard for international law is at least as bad as Russia.More from NewsRussia-Ukraine latest news: Mariupol art school bombed with 400 civilians sheltering insideSpring Equinox 2022: Fairies, cherry blossom trees and why you should visit StonehengeBoris Johnson frustrated with Rishi Sunak over ‘resistance’ to new nuclear power plantsBritish Summer Time 2022: How Chris Martin\u0026#39s great-great-grandfather ensured our clocks go forwardWhen will free Covid lateral flow tests come to an end in the UK?More from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"tony sewell deserves praise not censure","story":"Agency, inidual and community responsibility, and equality of opportunity are the principles that Sewell has championed for decades. Back in 2008, he questioned a study by the University of Warwick that concluded that institutional racism is to blame for the underachievement of Black Caribbean children in British schools, concluding that we should demand higher expectations of black children rather than viewing them as perpetual victims. Through his work with Generating Genius, he has applied this idea in practice, supporting hundreds of ethnic minority children from challenging backgrounds into high-achieving careers in STEM.Indeed, when the report was published last year, Labour MP for Norwich Clive Lewis reacted by tweeting a photo of a Ku Klux Klan member in front of a burning cross, seemingly comparing Sewell and his co-authors to the KKK. More recently, Sewell revealed that the University of Nottingham had withdrawn its offer to award him an honorary degree.Of course anyone is entitled to disagree with Sewell’s findings. But in attempting to discredit and smear the man himself – a man who has expanded and harnessed the potential of young ethnic minority Brits – his critics have done nothing but debase the national conversation.

If we brought these rocks and we split them open and we found a fossil, that would be so exciting. We could definitely have the first discovery of life on Mars happening in the UK.”Nasa’s Perseverance rover has already started drilling rock cores at the site of an ancient lake on Mars, a spot that experts think holds the best chance of finding fossils.The cores will be collected in a few years by the European Space Agency\u0027s Sample Fetch Rover, which is currently in development at Airbus in Stevenage.The samples will be loaded on to a rocket and fired up to orbit, where they will be scooped up by another spacecraft, and eventually set down in the Utah desert in the US in 2031.“This is the first time we are bringing back a piece of a whole other world,” added Dr Irshad.“We know that we’re highly unlikely to find life on the surface, but we’re drilling down to get core samples. Mars lost its atmosphere billions of years ago so any life would have been driven beneath the surface and that’s where we will find evidence of it, if it exists.“Currently there is no facility which can house these samples or carry out the necessary scientific analysis and keep them physically safe.“We won’t be able to just hop back to Mars and replace it if something goes wrong, this is going to be the most valuable material on the planet. Luckily we’ve got some of the best facilities in the world on the doorstep.”The facility is likely to be built at the 700-acre Harwell Science and Innovation Campus in Oxfordshire, home to more than 200 space, energy and quantum groups, including the Diamond Light Source and ISIS Neutron and Muon Source, which can investigate the structure and properties of materials in minute detail.The University of Leicester has already developed a super-secure lab, known as a double-walled isolator, which has two layers of bullet-proof glass, where samples can be entirely manipulated by robotic arms, to avoid contamination by humans.Once the samples have been analysed, the team wants to recreate Martian soil - or regolith - to test whether it is possible to 3D print blocks with which astronauts could build habitats.Dr Emma Johnson, principal project manager at RAL Space, said: “This facility must be fully operational by the time Mars samples are returned to Earth in 2031.“This means we have a window of opportunity to work with the planetary science community to design the best facility for curating and analysing these precious materials. This study enables us to move forward and work towards making this new facility a reality.Justin Byrne, Airbus UK’s head of space science and Earth observation, added: “It would be great to see the UK develop a dedicated research facility for samples from Mars and beyond.“The UK is already a global leader in space robotics and to build on this with a centre for sample analysis is a natural next step.”More from NewsRussia-Ukraine latest news: Mariupol art school bombed with 400 civilians sheltering insideSpring Equinox 2022: Fairies, cherry blossom trees and why you should visit StonehengeBoris Johnson frustrated with Rishi Sunak over ‘resistance’ to new nuclear power plantsBritish Summer Time 2022: How Chris Martin\u0026#39s great-great-grandfather ensured our clocks go forwardWhen will free Covid lateral flow tests come to an end in the UK?More from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"west putting mercy hostile nuclear powers","story":"If you happened to catch the moment when Russia’s ambassador to the UN, Vasily Nebenzya described the bombing of civilian targets in Ukraine as fiction invented by a western disinformation campaign, you may have been tempted to laugh. Not because the actual events we witness on our television screens every day are remotely funny, but because the audacity of this man’s insistence was so ridiculous as to constitute a kind of comic relief.There has been much speculation about whether Putin himself is technically mad or just the latest in a historic line of murderous dictators whose actions are rational in their own terms. But it is equally important to determine whether his agents at home and abroad are party to what must be either psychosis or pure evil. Are they, in other words, enthusiastically complicit with whatever this is – or just trapped in what has become too big a lie to unwind?The West needs to make a working decision on this as a matter of urgency because it is the key to how the war must be handled. So far the political leadership on our side has decided that for the moment at least, it is impossible to know the definitive answer. That is why the West’s strategy for reacting to the crisis, for all its celebrated unity and vigorous resolve, lacks any sense of a clear ultimate objective.What exactly are we aiming for here apart from an immediate end to the criminal invasion of a sovereign country? If the leaders of the western nations, who are so enthusiastically unanimous in their support for Ukraine, do not know what they are dealing with (lunatics or cold-blooded murderers?), how are they supposed to calibrate the effectiveness of their own moves?While it might be hard to deny the sense and obvious conscientiousness of this observation, what was the point of stating it so unequivocally at precisely this point? Was the US president (who apparently said this spontaneously and without consultation, to a television interviewer) running on the assumption that Putin is so mentally unstable that he might press the nuclear button at any opportunity? Or was he betting that Putin is perfectly rational and would therefore be shamed in the eyes of the world by this display of moral responsibility from the West?The philosophy of nuclear weapons as a deterrent always rested on the principle that they could be used. If this threat is voluntarily surrendered at the outset of any conflict then their deterrence value evaporates. But more importantly, the existence of them in the hands of another country prevents (according to the Biden doctrine) even a conventional military response to its actions, however vile they are.In other words, we are declaring ourselves helpless in the face of any onslaught from any nuclear power, and the fact that we also possess such weapons counts for nothing. We might as well go for unilateral nuclear disarmament and admit that we are at the mercy of any country that has such weapons: however immoral its actions are, we will never act against it. Lesson to the nations of the world: get and keep your own nuclear arsenal and you will become invulnerable.Not in the short term, they won’t. Putin himself (and his personal wealth) will be untouched for the foreseeable future – and to a man who has anointed himself  of the national soul, it is his own survival that matters. As for the rest of the damage, Russia has lived through such catastrophic times before.When the Soviet Union was a global pariah, its people endured material hardships and a degree of cultural isolation that had become unthinkable in western Europe. It had a fictitious economy built on a valueless currency and a closed society that perpetuated an absurd myth of national triumph. Not so different from today. You think Putin can’t get away with this for long? Stalin got away with it for 30 years. Of course, fashions change in the style of tyrannical rule. Putin’s mass celebration of the seizing of Crimea last Friday – with a football stadium of cheering supporters – looked less like Hitler at Nuremberg than a Trump rally in Texas.More from NewsRussia-Ukraine latest news: Mariupol art school bombed with 400 civilians sheltering insideSpring Equinox 2022: Fairies, cherry blossom trees and why you should visit StonehengeBoris Johnson frustrated with Rishi Sunak over ‘resistance’ to new nuclear power plantsBritish Summer Time 2022: How Chris Martin\u0026#39s great-great-grandfather ensured our clocks go forwardWhen will free Covid lateral flow tests come to an end in the UK?More from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"hero mp rosena allin khan","story":"Exclusive: Hero MP Rosena Allin-Khan helps family shot by Russian vehicle in UkraineDr Rosena Allin-Khan went to Ukraine to train  doctors treating injured civilians - her eighth humanitarian trip since becoming a Labour MP for Tooting in Russians opened fire on the family.

Dr Rosena Allin-Khan, Labour MP for Tooting, went to Lviv with NGO MedGlobal as they delivered  crates of urgent supplies.Her eighth humanitarian trip since becoming an MP in , the main mission was to train  doctors from across the country in treating civilians caught in the Russian attack.

Get all the latest news sent to your inbox.for the free Mirror newsletter Rosena said soldiers had fired a rocket at their cars then “opened fire on them as they screamed for them to stop”.The boys’ grandmother had died in the attack. Rosena added: “She had multiple wounds, she’d been shot in her liver. She’d have bled out tragically in a very agonising death.” Rosena, who also worked as an AE doctor on the Covid front line in the UK, said: “Because my expertise for the last  years has been humanitarian medicine, I specialise in that sort of work in war zones and disaster settings.“Our key focus was to meet with doctors, in person and virtually, from all over Ukraine. The pleas from these doctors and the people at the health ministry were desperate.” The day before they left for Ukraine, Russian shells had targeted a Mariupol maternity hospital. Rosena said: “Nothing was off-limits. It’s savage. “The feeling was of pure panic – that hospital healthcare facilities, and doctors and nurses, were going to be targeted. And the big fear that ultimately there would be chemical weapon use.” As well as those wanting guidance “on the right kind of tourniquet to use in the field”, she said those they trained ranged from psychiatrists dealing with trauma to family doctors wanting to know what to do “when the children come in choking to death”.  Other insights came directly from war zone experience, such as moving patients from a hospital’s top floors down to the relative safety of the basement, and where best to put sandbags. Just a couple of days later, some of those she had taught were among hundreds taken hostage by Russian troops in another hospital in Mariupol. She said: “It was harrowing. It was evident the Syrian playbook was being used.” Rosena became a humanitarian doctor “to give a voice to the voiceless”.  She said: “It’s a privilege to have a  to share the experiences of those who’ve gone through unimaginable trauma. “The scene I won’t forget was at the Polish border – and little kids holding their teddy bears. “I’ve got two young children and I thought, ‘It could easily be them’.

Mr Byrne said: “Shamefully, we have a system that means a private renter has more than a one in  chance of living in a home that could kill or seriously harm them or their children. “Let that fact sink in - how can this be allowed to continue  We must remind ourselves that it is , not . “During the height of the pandemic, renters were trapped in unsafe housing while the Prime Minister was apparently picking out new wallpaper.”  The government is consulting on a national landlord register, but has yet to make any firm commitment to introducing one. MPs said this week they felt this would help make landlords more accountable and spark a crackdown on unsafe living conditions in private homes. One in five private homes currently don’t meet the government’s decent homes standard. And the debate heard that a category one hazard - which could cause death or serious injury - was identied in a shocking % of private lets.  MPs told how babies’ cots have become infested with cockroaches and ants and pregnant women have been advised their damp houses could seriously harm their unborn babies. In another case, a young mum living in a mould ridden flat had no heating or hot water for  months. The government promised to scrap no fault evictions in  - currently permitted under section  of the housing act - but has repeatedly stalled on bringing forward legislation. Since then, , families have been forced to leave their homes, despite having done nothing wrong. Some have ended up living in caravans or budget hotels.A ban is expected to be included in the forthcoming renters’ reform bill - but it remains unclear when this will come to parliament. Mr Byrne cited research from Citizens Advice which found private tenants who complained about disrepair were % more likely to receive an eviction notice. He said: “Many renters are fearful of evictionsthey raise complaints, because they cannot afford to move house in the middle of this appalling cost of living crisis. “My constituent told me, ‘Section  takes the humanity out of the situation and that’s precisely the problem. We are human and lives are being carelessly destroyed.’ “The power imbalance means that the mental pressures facing renters are built into this broken system. “New legislation must have real teeth and be enforceable. “A renters reform bill must end no-fault evictions and create a national landlord register and licensing scheme to improve accountability and ensure that legal standards are met.” Shadow solicitor general Ellie Reeves spoke of a constituent in Lewisham West and Penge with serious health problems who’d been devastated by a no fault eviction. She said: “She wrote to me stating that the whole experience had pushed her to the verge of suicide. “I know it is dficult to hear, but policy decisions have a very real effect on the hardest hit.” Tory MP Eddie Hughes, parliamentary under secretary for levelling up, housing and communities, told the debate: “We have ambitious plans to create a vibrant private rented sector that is safe, healthy and fit for purpose. I share others’ determination to address these problems.” Polly Neate, Chief Executive of Shelter, said: “We’re grateful to Ian Byrne MP for calling this important parliamentary debate. “Renters are being held back by the nightmare conditions they’re stuck living in.“From the horror stories MPs shared in parliament, it’s clear this is happening in constituencies across the country. “Every day our emergency helpline hears from tenants who are paying through the nose to live in mouldy, cramped and dangerous homes. “Far too many are too scared to complain for fear they’ll be evicted. The broken private rental system is taking a huge toll on tenants’ health, education and le chances. “From the renter who was hospitalised because of dangerous conditions through to the mum who was kicked out of her home for complaining about mould taking over her baby’s cot. “Enough is enough.

And she claimed Vladimir Putin could exploit refugee flows to send agents to Britain.In her keynote speech, she said: Iaposve been asked why couldnapost we suspend security checks on people escaping Putinaposs war  Times of conflict, my friends, emphasises our need to remain watchful. I know from the briefings I receive from the intelligence and security services that instability around the world brings with it greater threats.  Only four years ago the Russian military intelligence services used a chemical weapon on British soil. She went on: The truth is that a very small number of people can wreak utter havoc. Russia has a history of covert hostile activity.And Iaposm afraid it is naive and misguided to think that only men can be covert operatives, or that refugee flows could not be subject to some form of exploitation.  Ms Patel went on: There are those who would come to our country, to this country, who mean us harm and who plot to strike at our very way of le. The processes that we have put in place closely follow the advice of our intelligence and security services. They mean we can help Ukrainians in need without making our country less safe. It comes as the Home Office said , visas had been granted under the family scheme for Ukrainians fleeing the war by pm on Friday. Ms Patel added: State threats and terrorism take many forms. They also thrive on indference and appeasement and now we are seeing them bolstered by new types of targeted biological, chemical, cyber warfare, ransomware and online threats. Our duty is to safeguard our countryaposs interests and we will never take our eye off the ball when it comes to the safety and security of our country. Education Secretary Nadhim Zahawi said , places had been created in schools for children fleeing Ukraine and virtual lessons created during the coronavirus pandemic had been translated into Ukrainian. Levelling Up Secretary Michael Gove confirmed more than , households had now offered to house Ukrainian refugees, the majority of whom have made their way to Poland.

Mr Sunak added: “Together we protected over one million Scottish jobs, provided loans and grants to almost , Scottish businesses and delivered £. billion in additional funding for Scotland’s public services.” SNP MSP Rona Mackay said: In the middle of a crushing cost of living crisis the man who holds the purse strings thinks itaposs appropriate to devote just two minutes of his time to his own Scottish party conference.In a speech stuffed with shameless self-praise, Sunak provided not a single word of comfort or hope to thousands of hard-pressed Scottish families facing increasing financial uncertainty. This speech was nothing short of insulting and perfectly demonstrates Westminster Tory disdain for the people of Scotland. He also addressed the future: “We must chart a new course together one that delivers greater opportunity in every region and every community. “That is why this UK Government is committed to levelling up, and we are already taking action.“At the Budget, I announced £ million for  Scottish projects from Whithorn to Inverness as part of our Levelling Up and Community Ownership funds.“£ million for the British Business Bank to help small and medium sized Scottish businesses to grow and access to the £. billion Global Britain Investment Fund to secure international investment into Scotland.

The inspector found that the standard of cleaning to the structure and equipment was very poor.It received the lowest score out of a possible five, and SurreyLive has obtained a copy of the report from Reigate and Banstead Borough Council.There were deposits of grease, grime, and food debris [that] were evident everywhere according to the environmental health officer, who added: The overall conditions seen can only be described as appalling and presents a serious risk of contamination to food.The inspector also suggested that it is apparent that an acceptable standard of cleaning has not taken place for some considerable time. There are simply too many examples to detail inidually. A heavily soiled toilet brush was also found by the hygiene inspector.  Some of the other most damning food hygiene findings include:Staff need a refresher training to at least level two food hygiene. No labels were attached to pre-prepared items and raw products, so there was no way to tell what the product was, when it was prepared or its use-by date.There was widespread clutter and disused equipment and general housekeeping in the kitchen was poor. The officer said this not only prevents effective cleaning, but encourages pests. The restaurant was asked in its previous Inspection Report on July ,  to reinstate a lobby between the staff toilet, kitchen and food storage areas in three weeksapos time.

Things got so bad she had to take sleeping tablets given to her by her doctorTracy Snodgrass and her family have had to endure the infestation Image: Daily Record WSByRuth SuterGraeme Murray:,  Mar |commentsA family have been terrorised by rats for almost eight months. Mum Tracy Snodgrass, and her son and daughter have suffered a vermin infestation after they first appeared in August last year. The -year-old was horried by the mice and rats her Glasgow home and feared they would appear in her bed at night. It caused her to be prescribed sleeping pills by her doctor as she could not fall asleep. Images have emerged of her home covered in rodent droppings which also saw the rodents leave mess on her mattresses and inside shoes. It shows a dead rat caught on a sticky mat trap in her daughteraposs bedroom., others show dead found by the family.  She was forced to move her family into her parents home despite paying more than £ in rent and council tax for the flat.Tracy, who is mum to Pamela, , and Mason, , told the Daily Record : The situation has been so traumatising to a point that when I killed a rat in my house seven months ago, I havenapost been back since.It was in my daughteraposs bedroom and in my bedroom before I caught it with a sticky mat. The traps just werenapost working. One night, I was on my phone in bed and a rat came running out behind my bedroom unit, I screamed the house down. I really am petried of them. Iaposm so terried of them. I have been so stressed to a point where I couldnapost sleep or eat. I had to get sleeping tablets from the doctor. We found droppings on the mattresses all the time, so they were obviously crawling all over the beds when we werenapost there. When I was there I was trying to spend as much time out of the house as I possibly could because I was so terried, I was that tormented.  It has been so traumatising to the point where I lock myself in a room. I have become really down from it all - Iaposm paying rent on a flat I canapost live in. Reidvale Housing Associationsay they are aware of issues with rats and have also discovered evidence of mice. They have sent pest control teams to Traceyaposs address on numerous occasions to try to take helm of the issue. Despite laying down traps and poison, as well as filling holes in the walls and floors, Tracey says the problem still remains and thinks the infestation is now in the walls and under the floorboards. She added: It makes no dference. The traps never once caught any rats - theyaposre actually still lying in my house from three months ago. The poison was only put down in my daughteraposs bedroom and it doesnapost seem to be steering them away. Iaposm at a witaposs end with it all, it has been awful.

Days ago more than  per cent of Mirror readers said they believe the Russian president is capable of unleashing a nuclear attack on the West. And with good reason, considering the despot himself has made veiled threats about unprecedented consequences of European or US involvement in his illegal war in Ukraine.Opposition politicians within Russia itself have also warned Putin is crazy enough to push the button and could destroy the world. For survival expert Yara Ghrewati, , a London-based Bushcraft instructor, Brits wouldnapost stand much of a chancehe did. She said: “If there was a nuke we are all screwed, but don’t write that.Speaking with MyLondon while demonstrating her skills in Frylands Wood, near Croydon, she said three people have asked her this week what to keep in a bug out bag . Yara, from Hounslow, says repping is less about hoarding baked beans in a bunker and more about arming yourself with knowledge for when the “s*** hits the fan”. Yara explains: “I would literally get in my car and bomb it west. If people want to go somewhere everyone would be scrambling at the same time, the key is to prep in advance before that happens.Look at the bog roll situation, people were clobbering each other over the head over some bog roll.” When coronavirus lockdowns hit, Brits rushed to make sure they could wipe their bums and eat spaghetti.She continues: “Can you imaginefood stopped coming in  If you empower yourself with these skills you become less dependent on others. You can take care of yourself, you don’t need to reach out for higher powers to save you, and will they ” Yara, who admits she has a disdain for the government and technology, said: “People have forgotten how to tie knots.“If you shut off Google Maps, can you navigate , she asked.She told MyLondon her mantra is: “How do you know the bomb won’t land on your shed ” Yara wants people to become less dependent on their phones, and more comfortable using their hands.  She says she often plays out a scenario in her head in which everything she is used to or ever needs is gone in an instant. Yara even admits she already has plans to meet friends at secret coordinates, although will not admit where. When I askshe has ever done a dry run she says no. The -year-old depends on knowledge rather than equipment because she predicts each survival situation will be unique.“Shelter, fire, water, and food are the top priorities,” she says. “Three weeks without food, three days without water, and three minutes without oxygen, and that’s not set in stone. I probably couldn’t last a week without food because I like to eat.”In the event of a nuclear bomb and the radiation that accompanies it, Yara says it would be best to plonk yourself in a hemp field.This method is one used by the Soviet Union following the Chernobyl disaster. Authorities sowed hemp around the site to absorb radioactive toxicity in the soil.When askedshe worries about being attacked, Yara points out sheaposs a woman living in London. In that respect things wonapost change. Still she admits she has her machete, kne, or sentimental parang she picked up on her travels. These are all tools which will allow her to create and solve problems, and yes, defend herself. The self-described flexitarian said she could shoot a rabbit with her bow and arrow, or her slingshot. She said in a survival situation - deer, squirrel, rabbit, wood pigeon, pheasant, and rodents, are all on the menu.  She said its best to avoid foxes and badgers because they carry rabies. “Any vegetarians are going to have a really tough time,” she adds. Yara picked up the bug for survivalism as a -year-old travelling through Indonesia. She described her formative time with the Mentawai-Siberut tribe, and also hanging out with Papua New Guineans who informed her human tastes like bacon. She recalled the Uruguayan Air Force Flight  crash which forced survivors to eat fellow passengers. Yara seems like she wouldnapost hesitateher le depended on it. She explains, in a survival situation there are three types of people. The leaders who are self-sufficient, the followers who need guidance, and then the panicky ones who are going to kill someone or cause an accident. She continues: “You want to get away from them. They are going to pull the leboat down. You can’t help everyone, it’s tough, especially in the city. You are not going to be able to grab hundreds of people. You just grab what you can, your child, one loved one, and be on your way.” Yara imagines the preppers who worry more about buying themselves three months of tinned food will be the ones “rummaging through dustbins” while she makes her way to higher ground. She scoffed at preppers with aposall the gear and no ideaapos. Instead, she focuses on indigenous knowledge. When asked who her hero is, she says: “Ray Mears is great because he acquires the knowledge of indigenous people. When everything happens and there’s a big kaboom, who will be the people that carry on  It will be the people who live in traditional ways and are dependent on nature. The knowledge they have is huge and something we really need to tap into more. Yara first packed the boot of her car last year after she saw the rush for supplies brought on by lockdown - it made her wary of food shortages. But, she tells me sheaposs been prepping much longer. She started packing supplies when war broke out in Syria over  years ago, but really her dream and when I will feel fully prepped is when she has her own land.I keep trying to bring the conversation back to the specics of a nuclear strike, but really I think we both know itaposs a thankless scenario. Russia reportedly has a ,mph hypersonic nuke missile, with a modern warhead it would mean total annihilation in minutes. Sadly the devastation is closer to Yara’s heart than she reveals.The next day she says: “I forgot to mention… I guess it’s valid. My family originates from Syria, though I am London born. My family out there had to evacuate Syria during the war. I’m tired of politicians getting away with illegal wars and creating suffering amongst the people. I believe that all war propaganda, war machines, any bombs and nuclear weapons should be illegal and not exist. They only cause destruction and death. That way people wouldn’t have to live their lives in fear and prep for the worst case scenario.” Yara seems to feel the pain of war more than most, and so prepping for the worst is not a bad idea. Though the likelihood of a strike on London is low, it is her independence that serves as the greatest lesson for Londoners: It’s not like you read a book and bam you get it - it’s a letime of knowledge.

In her early days as a royal, the Duchess was understandably a lot more reserved and cautious - never veering too far away from husband Prince William.However, according to a body language expert, Kateaposs shyness bears striking resemblance to another member of the royal family when she was in the spotlight - her late mother-in-law Princess Diana. For more of the news you care about, straight to your inbox, sign up for one of our daily newsletters here.Darren Stanton told Marie Claire magazine: Kate was arguably more reserved when she was first thrown into the spotlight several years ago.She behaved in a similar way Princess Diana did when she first got engaged to Prince Charles. Kate would always stay very close to William and continuously look towards him to seek his approval and reassurance.  Stanton said itaposs very clear Kate is now less reliant on William while out in public, and can often be seen maintaining a subtle distance from her husband to prove sheaposs more than capable of doing it on her own. In the past, Kate could be seen positioning her hands in front of her, which is another self-reassuring gesture which signies feelings of anxiousness. But, these days, the Duchess is regularly seen making what is known as open palm gestures, which signies confidence, openness, genuineness and honesty. The dference in how she holds her hands during engagements suggest that she has grown into the large shoes that come with being an established member of the Royal Family, Stanton concluded.Do you have a story to share  We want to hear all about it.

Later this year Scotland Yard will bring Operation Grange - which was launched four years after Maddie went missing - to a close. The decision to do so will raise questions about whether prime suspect Christian Brueckner will be charged with her disappearance.A source the Sun : “There are currently no plans to take the inquiry any further.“The end of the road for Operation Grange is now in sight. The team’s work is expected to be completed by autumn.”  As much as detectives will not continue to actively investigate, the case file could be reopenedthere are any further breakthroughs. Current funding for Operation Grand ends at the end of this month. A request for more money was recently submitted to the Home Office and it would take the operation until the end of September. In total, the cost of the operation will be around £million. Last year now outgoing Met commissioner Dame Cressida Dick said Operation Grange would continue until there was nothing left to probe.  Interest in the case was reignited in  when a German police investigation into Brueckner came to light. The -year-old is behind bars for offences including the  rape of a US widow in Praia da Luz – where Madeleine vanished two years later. German prosecutors said they have “concrete” evidence against him – and he is their only suspect in Madeleine’s case. But they also fear Breuckner has committed at least five other sex crimes, including the rape of an Irish woman, who was attacked in her Portuguese apartment in . Madeleine, three, vanished from an Algarve apartment in  while on holiday with her twin siblings and parents Kate and Gerry, of Rothley, Leics.In , Brueckner shared a string of sick messages with an undertaker, including some about snatching and imprisoning a toddler. The investigation into Brueckner is being led by German and Portuguese authorities, while the Met has been taking a background role. As of last summer German Police were only investigating Brueckner over the case. Last year they named Brueckner as the prime suspect in Madeleineaposs disappearance after phone records placed him in the resort on the night she vanished. The paedophile has accused prosecutors of bringing “shame” to the German legal system by making “scandalous” statements against him. In recent years the Grange team has been whittled down from  officers to just four detectives working under Det Chief Inspector Mark Cranwell. The McCanns are said to be aware that the Metaposs investigation is coming to a close. They have vowed that they will never stop looking for Maddie and may do so with money raised for Madeline’s Fund: Leaving No Stone Unturned. The fund currently has more than £, after liabilities.Follow MirrorFacebookTwitterMORE ON Madeleine MccannCressida DickScotland YardHome OfficeCrime\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The supermarket worker and entrepreneur, from Hampshire, said one day he came across an advert for JustPark on social media and decided to give it a go. He says it’s possible to make over £ every month especiallyyou live in a city or near a tourist attraction.He told Express : ”If you have a space in a bustling place, such as central London, with costly car parks, or near an airport or tourist attraction, you can earn a lot more than you wouldyou rented out your space in a suburban location. “These days, with bills on the rise, every penny counts so that extra money might pay for extra groceries, perhaps a treat, such as a cinema trip, or maybe a few drinks at the local pub, or a takeaway, that otherwise, you may not have been able to afford.” Al says that he knows not everyone has a parking space and instead he recommends market research as it pays around £ per hour. The blogger explains: “There are many ways you can earn a few extra pounds, my favourites are taking part in market research projects, as you could earn up to £ an hour.  “I’ve also made extra money by working for food delivery companies which currently aren’t as profitable, due to the cost of fuel, but are still profit makers. “You could take on a lodger, rent out your garden to campers, rent your house out to photographers or film-makers or earn extra cash by picking fruit when in season. “Oryou have a skill such as graphic design you could offer your services through online s such as Fiverr.” Al also shares tips for saving money such as taking advantage of yellow sticker bargains to save up to  per cent on the normal selling price. He said: “Competition for the bargains is fierce, so they can’t be relied on to always save you money on your groceries, but when you do get some deals, they can save you some money, and by making sure you make good use of what you have found, you can stretch your food budget.

They included chef Claudia Lawrence who vanished  years ago this week.But the investigation has been stopped by Wiltshire Police, which has battled a series of budget cuts.The ex-detective superintendent who investigated Halliwell called the move “shocking”. Steve Fulcher said: “Halliwell murdered other people without any shadow of a doubt. “It’s incumbent on a police force to pursue an investigation into a known murderer and serial killer using the material that I gathered back in the day.“That includes  items of ­women’s underwear as part of a trophy collection.” His anger was echoed by missing Claudia’s mum Joan, from Malton, North Yorks. She said: “I’m horried, absolutely devastated. It is well known Halliwell is thought to be connected to so many more cases to close the investigation is appalling.” Halliwell, , is serving le for killing sex worker Becky Godden-Edwards, , and office worker Sian O’Callaghan, , who he abducted in Swindon.In  we revealed the existence of a cold-case review – codenamed Operation Major. But last night the force confirmed: “Wiltshire Police are not currently investigating any offences alleged to have been committed by Halliwell. Operation Major is not a live investigation.”Mr Fulcher – portrayed by Martin Freeman in an ITV drama about the case – fears Halliwell could be one of Britain’s worst serial killers.The cabbie was convicted of Sian’s murder in  and jailed for le. He sexually assaulted, strangled and stabbed her in a forest after she got into his taxi outside a nightclub.  During his arrest, Halliwell also told Mr Fulcher, now , about an earlier killing he had carried out and offered to show him the body. His admission took police to the remains of Becky, who had disappeared from the same town in . The head, hands and feet were never recovered and her mother Karen believes the monster kept them as trophies. Halliwell was sent down for her murder in , when a judge described him as “both calculating and devious”. But, between confession and conviction, Fulcher quit the police after a court ruled his actions during the arrest were wrong. It was decided that the detective had broken rules by failing to caution Halliwell. In  Wiltshire allocated just £, to Operation Major. It was led by Det Supt Jeremy Carter. The force refused to saythey have made any arrests or taken a single statement.

Joanne’s mother, Doreen Soulsby, wrote to Mr Raab and convinced him to use his personal powers to block a parole board decision for the first time. “It’s such a relief. All the effort and campaigning has been really worthwhile in the end, she told Chronicle Live.I donapost think anyone would believe that a killer like Ling would ever be considered to be moved to an open prison. I want him locked up for le. “He was only  when he murdered my daughter. He has had no chance to socialise or have relationships with women. I cannot believe he won’t pose a risk to womenhe went to an open prison. “He will come up before the parole board again, I am sure and I will have to face that when it happens. For the time being, though, I am relieved and delighted. Farm labourer Ling was jailed for le in  and told he would serve at least  years behind bars, after he raped and murdered Ms Tulip, carved crosses and swastikas into her body and set fire to it.He has applied for parole four times since then and during his latest hearing, in February, the board refused his request for release but backed a move to an open prison. A Ministry of Justice spokesperson said: “The Deputy Prime Minister has rejected Steven Ling’s move to open conditions in the interest of public protection.” Mr Raab intervened in the Ling case after deciding that a justice secretary should personally rule on the transfer of high-risk offenders to open prisons rather than leave it to officials. It came after serial sex offender Paul Robson, also jailed for le, absconded from an open prison in Lincolnshire last month, just weeks after being moved from a secure jail.In her letter, Mrs Soulsby warned Mr Raab about the disturbing findings of a forensic scientist in the National Crime Faculty Unit who profiled Ling shortly after the murder. He was found to be a “piquerist” who “has a sexual interest in penetrating the skin with sharp objects”. Mrs Soulsby wrote: “What he did came out of his own head and was he not insane. Lingaposs head was wired in a way that when he came up against Joanneaposs fight against him he sadistically raped and murdered her and did terrible things to her body both before and after death. He is only  years of age now and has missed  years of his young le being in prison. Because of this,he were released even in to open prison, he would target women even on day release, socialise with them, and his sexual appetite having been restrained in prison, would take over his control of the situation and would be a danger to women. You cannot apostestapos a prisoneraposs readiness like Ling in open conditions for any potentialinto the community in future for fear another young woman being attacked and murdered in the same way as my daughter Joanne.

It is hard to comprehend the torment she has endured since she was arrested on trumped-up charges by the Iranian authorities. Twice she went on hunger strike. Her health suffered. She lost two appeals and had her sentenced increased. Many would have been broken by this adversity but Nazanin’s spirit never faltered. It was matched only by the love, tenacity and dedication of her husband Richard who campaigned tirelessly for her release. They did not deserve to be the pawns in a diplomatic power game between London and Tehran. Nor did they deserve to be let down by Boris Johnson whose blundering prompted Iran to level fresh charges against her. This story was not destined to have a happy ending. The fact that it does is a testament to their resilience and devotion to each other.  No more delays Vladimir Putin’s brutal invasion has created the worst humanitarian disaster in Europe since the Second World War. Almost three million Ukrainians have been forced to leave their homes as they seek sanctuary from the Russian bombardment. That number is set to rise as more people flee the besieged cities in Eastern Ukraine. They are in desperate need of food, clothes and a place to live. The tens of thousands of people who have signed up to the Homes for Ukraine scheme shows that households across Britain are ready to help. The only thing standing in their way is the Government’s delay in carrying out checks. Now is the time for compassion, not cold-hearted box ticking and foot dragging.

After Morag was given to the animal charityaposs Worcester and Mid Worcestershire branch by her previous owner, the RSPCA was inundated with adoption offers from all over the world.An appeal was sent out by staff at the charity and it saw a social media post being shared over , times to help find her special retirement home.

Ned Cotton, who manages the rehoming centre, said: “We were absolutely overwhelmed by the response to our appeal for a retirement home for Morag. “Offers of homes came in from Michigan, Florida, Texas and Pennsylvania as well as Australia and Japan. “People also sent in gts and toys and we were so touched with all the messages we received wishing her well. “We never thought for one moment that her story would take off like it did, but a -year-old cat looking for a retirement home to live out the remainder of her days seemed to resonate with people and we were inundated with interest and offers of homes for her.“We’re delighted that she’s found a wonderful home to call her own and we know she’s going to be thoroughly pampered and much loved there, just as she deserves.” The branch has already found homes for seven elderly cats with a combined age of  this year - Violet , Joy , Angel , Holly , Teddyand siblings Barbara and Bernard . Claire Wood from the branch, said: “We rehomed seven senior cats last month alone and we’re incredibly grateful to the adopters who welcomed them into their lives.

We all feel tired occasionally but ongoing issues with getting some shuteye can cause an increased risk of heart and kidney disease, high blood pressure and strokes. So how do you know when it’s appropriate, and necessary, to see a doctor about fatigue or other sleep related issues  Itaposs World Sleep Day, anditaposs been a while since you got a restful night because of your sleep habits, it might be time to seek medical help, says the Daily Record.Here, GPs share five signs and five symptoms to never ignore.  Heavy snoringIt might seem harmless but heavy snoring might be a sign of sleep apnoea.“This is an often-missed cause of poor sleep, responsible for chronic tiredness during the day, and even road traffic accidentssufferers fall asleep at the wheel,” says GP Dr Claire Morrison, a medical advisor for MedExpress . “It’s caused by the throat repeatedly closing off during sleep, making oxygen levels fall, and resulting in frequent waking. It’s most common in those who are overweight and who have a thick neck.”  Other signs include waking with a dry mouth and or headache, and feeling very tired and irritable during the day, she says.Or your partner might notice long pauses between breaths when you’re asleep, and then a gasping or choking sound when breathing resumes. While mild cases don’t always need to be treated, in extreme cases sleep apnoea can be dangerous – the NHS notes a higher chance of having a stroke and a serious accident caused by tiredness.Extreme tiredness all the time It could be a sign of anaemia, says Dr Ross Perry, a GP and medical director of Cosmedics . “Other symptoms [of anaemia] include a lack of energy, pale looking skin, headache, dizziness, light headedness, cold hands and feet and brittle nails.” Extreme tiredness can also be a key sign of undiagnosed or insufficiently treated thyroid disease, he adds. The condition occurs as a result of a decrease in thyroid hormone production. “You may sleep more than usual but still feel completely exhausted. At times, you may fall asleep during the day or very quickly at night. In the morning, you may find it dficult to get out of bed.  “Extreme tiredness [also] could be a symptom of coeliac disease, and for some, it may be the only symptom,” says Perry. “The gut damage caused by coeliac disease results in poorer absorption of essential food nutrients involved in energy metabolism, including iron, folic acid and vitamin B.” Restless legs This is a nervous system condition associated with an uncomfortable “tingling or fizzing sensation” in the legs, eased only by moving the legs constantly, says Morrison. “It tends to be worse in the evenings and at night, sometimes making it impossible to sleep properly. It can affect the arms too.”It’s thought to be caused by a lack of the dopamine chemical in the brain, she explains, and it can be triggered by a number of underlying causes – so it’s important to work out what. It may be come about during pregnancy or happen without any obvious reason at any age, though women are twice as likely as men to develop it and it’s also more common in middle age. However, restless legs may also be triggered by “iron deficiency, kidney impairment, diabetes, under-active thyroid, fibromyalgia or Parkinson’s disease”.“Drugs which aggravate the condition include anti-histamines, anti-sickness medication, and anti-depressants, so do tell your doctor about your symptoms before being prescribed anything,” Morrison says. A complete loss of interest in sex “[For men] testosterone deficiency is another common problem associated with tiredness and one of the trademark symptoms of low testosterone in men is chronic fatigue – the type of tiredness that doesn’t improve after rest,” explains Perry.  It can be part of the normal ageing process – testosterone levels are likely to decrease in all men with age , so interest in sex may decline slightly too. “However, it’s not normal for testosterone levels to get so low that fatigue impacts daily activities or for there to be a complete loss of interest in sex, so do visit your GP,” he adds. Mental health concerns affecting sleep It goes without saying that it’s worth chatting to your GPyou’re struggling, but many mental health conditions can cause dficulty sleeping, so it’s not uncommon for issues to come to light at night. “There is a close link between sleep and mental health, and poor sleep can aggravate mental illness, so it’s very important to address sleep problems early on,” says Morrison. “Mental health problems that commonly affect sleep include depression, anxiety, stress, panic disorder, post traumatic stress disorder, and obsessive compulsive disorder, for example.” Signs of mental illness include low mood, excessive worrying, tearfulness, irritability, low self esteem, lack of motivation, inability to concentrate, intrusive thoughts, loss of pleasure in le, poor appetite, and or binge-eating, she adds. “You may benefit from talking therapy such as ‘cognitive behavioural therapy’, and or medication, but make sure your doctor knows about the insomnia, as some anti-depressants can help promote sleep, whereas others may make it worse and are best avoidedpossible.” Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON NHSInsomniaPrescriptionsSleep\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Households in Canton, Cardf received a letter this week requesting a £ annual service fee to maintain Riverside Park. The letter was sent to every property on The Mill estate which is home to around  flats and houses.It claims that each address will not be paying more than  th of the cost of the park, reports WalesOnline. Andthere there were  payments of £, this would equate to £,. The park, which opened in July , consists of a simple wooden climbing frame, a picnic table, a bench and two bins.  Residents at The Mill entered into a service charge agreement for maintenance of the estate when they completed on their purchase. But many property owners said they were not consulted about the addition of the park, nor the service cost that would come with it. A letter sent to residents at the time reads: The service charge year shall run for a period of  months from  April in every year. We are notying you of the estimated Service Charge, which is £.for the period covering  April  to  March  in relation to your property. Please note that this is an estimate only of the service charge payable this service charge year.  Ben Jordan owns his property in The Mill and has lived there for over two years. He said: Weaposve just received another letter where we are going to get a £-a-year fee for a park somewhere, which I have never seen, apparently, itaposs just a little wooden frame by the river. And that letter has gone to every property, which is  properties, so thataposs £, a year to maintain one wooden frame. He said it felt like the developer was trying to take advantage and hope people might not notice because of all the other rising costs. Mr Jordan said: This was the first I had heard about it, the only reason I know about the park at all is the letter telling me about it.Iaposve gone and found out more about it and itaposs one little climbing frame, I donapost know why that costs £, a year to maintain. Iaposm , I work from home, I live alone, I have no reason to use the park. I know I will never use it. I have no need for a small climbing frame. EvenI did have kids, itaposs not a very good one anyway.  Fellow householder Josh Jenkins said: I knew that there was a park there, but in terms of it being our responsibility to fund or look after it, this is the first I have heard of it. When we were going through the process of moving in, we were told there would be a service charge but we were told it would be going specically to a company called aposGround Solutionsapos and they would be doing the grounds maintenance of the entire estate. A spokesperson for Tirion Group said: The requirement for the Riverside Park was determined as part of the planning consent for the development of The Mill.  It was considered by Cardf City Council and all other stakeholders that the provision would benefit the community now and in the future. It added: The service charge is an estimate and made up of certain regular costsand also provisions for the longer term maintenance and upkeep of the whole of the Riverside Park and amenities.

Mr Headley - who taught Design and Technology at the school between  and  - is said to have asked the kids to keep these discussion confidential, according to an employment tribunal published on March .Jo Doyle - a deputy head of the community school - unearthed Mr Headleyaposs YouTube channel, where he openly promoted discriminatory views against LGBTQ+ people and other ethnicities, MyLondon reportsBeing an openly gay woman, Ms Doyle said she found the content particularly hurtful. Among the statements made on Mr Headleyaposs YouTube channel are: Jews, Scribes and Pharisees are of the devil,What is found in the DNA of Satan, like your LGBT, like your antichrist.  Ms Doyle wrote in her report: To see a member of staff saying derogatory, isive and hateful things about LGBT and Christian community on a public  distressed, upset and saddened me I am comfortable with who I am, but I am more concerned with the effect these views might have on younger members of staff, students and families. There are some very vulnerable boys and young staff who may be exploring their sexuality and questioning it and it is important that they are not judged or made to feel that they are evil. Mr Headleyaposs YouTube channel currently contains  videos dating back a few years, where he can regularly been seen proselytising his views. He has just a few thousand followers. His early videos were filmed in the DT classroom he taught from, where he could be seen wearing the school logo sitting in front of a noticeboard which included pictures of staff members.  Another deputy head teacher, Emma Hobbs, discovered the videos and asked him to stop filming on school premises as she was concerned they would appear affiliated to the school. However she did not watch the video in full. It was only when Ms Doyle watched the videos further that Mr Headleyaposs conduct become officially flagged. Mr Headley was sacked on July ,  after a  with the school governors, but he bought forward a claim that he was wrongly dismissed. The employment tribunal report published this month says Mr Headley was not wrongly dismissed as his views do, as the school claimed, go against the schoolaposs values of inclusivity. The report reads: We accept that it would be dficultnot impossible to promote values of plurality and openness to students when it was known that a senior teacher publicly denounced LGBTQ+ people, Jews and Catholics as being evil or the descendants or followers of Satan. There was evidence, which we accepted, that there were a number of openly gay students at the school. We find that there were reasonable grounds for finding that students were aware of the channel. The investigators in the case pointed to Thank you cards written by pupils addressed to Mr Headley, which did reference them subscribing to his YouTube channel. The report adds: [Mr Headley] has made public statements over a number of years. We accept that the cumulative effect of those statements is such that it seriously damaged the employment relationship. In his attempts to claim unlawful dismissal, Mr Headley argued he was teaching flat Earth theory to teach students perspective. He brought a claim that his dismissal was an act of unlawful direct discrimination because of his religious beliefs To this end, the employment judge wrote: We conclude that the treatment of the claimant was not because of religion or belief. The reasons for the dismissal are in our view entirely [separate] from the beliefs themselves and are solely because those beliefs were manested in a manner entirely inconsistent with [Mr Headleyaposs] position as a senior teacher at a multicultural secondary school. Had he chosen to express himself in other terms the outcome might have been very dferent. The school was entitled to conclude that its own interests in promoting pluralism and the welfare of its students were a sufficient reason for restricting the claimantaposs rights to manest his religious beliefs and or express his opinions in public in the manner that he did. He must bear responsibility for the way he has chosen to express himself.

The birds have not be been allowed outdoors since November over fears of avian flu outbreaks.Any eggs that will be sold in shops will have to have a sticker or label on it saying they are barn eggs - which is to explain they have been produced by hens housed indoors. There were more than  reported outbreaks of avian flu this winter in England as officials said it was the largest-ever outbreak of avian flu”. The UK government had ordered that birds reared for meat and eggs need to be kept indoors since November to reduce the risk of outbreaks.  This means that because they have been indoors for so long the birdsapos eggs can no longer be labelled free-range. This rule applies to all birds. Farmers were hoping the government were going to lt the housing order next week but after more avian flu outbreaks it is remaining in place. Suffolk-based egg producer Daniel Brown, who has more than , free-range hens, says they are coping well indoors. He told the: We’ve given them extra things in the shed-like hay and grit to give them things to peck at and keep them amused.”“A chicken won’t be bothered about not going outside in December and January, but when it’s nice in May they’ll want to be out late into the evening.He says he hopes the order is lted once the weather starts to warm up.for our daily newsletter to keep up to date with all the essential information atwww.mirror email .Avian flu outbreaks have spread across Europe overwinter as France is trialling a potential vaccine. However, it has proven tricky because of the numerous strains. Some countries have banned importing poultry meat from countries that vaccinate birds. A spokesperson for the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said: “The -week grace period we allowed for free-range eggs has now been exceeded, and eggs must now be marketed as ‘barn eggs’. We have worked closely with the sector and retailers to implement these changes as smoothly as possible.”  The British Retail Consortium said supermarkets would be providing signage to explain the change to consumers, but “when the current measures are lted, eggs will go back to being free-range”. Aimee Mahony, the National Farmers’ Union’s chief poultry adviser, said: “Shoppers may notice dferent labels on egg packs explaining the eggs have been laid by hens temporarily housed to protect their health and welfare. “Once the risk levels have reduced and the housing measures have been lted by Defra, birds will be able to go outside again.” The Mirror contacted Defra for a comment.

The UK saw the hottest day of the year so far on Saturday, when temperatures peaked at °C in the village of Kinlochewe in northern Scotland.The Met Office said it will be breezier and colder today, with cloudy conditions in parts of the South West, but the mercury levels will begin rising again next week.According to the forecaster, London will see clear skies and top temperatures of around °C on Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday. BBC forecaster Chris Fawkes said the weather “is going to get a lot, lot warmer” next week. “As the southerly winds continue to push northwards through Tuesday and Wednesday, those temperatures are going to surge signicantly, he said. “Tuesday - a fine day with some sunshine - maybe a few isolated showers developing through the afternoon but most of you will have a dry day though. “Temperatures will reach a high of °C in London, °C in Glasgow and °C in Belfast.  “The fine weather with prolonged spells of Spring sunshine, for many of us will last for much of the weekend, with temperatures on the warm side for the time of year.” Met Office meteorologist Dan Stroud said Sunday will be cooler, with top temperatures of around °C in the south of England. He added: “High pressure continues to dominate into the new working week, with fair amounts of cloud and temperatures increasing during the course of the week.”  It comes after weather forecaster Jim Dale told the Express that next month temperatures are expected to reach °C - the Met Office’s threshold for a heatwave.I wouldn’t be surprised to see °C, °C, °C in the middle of April,” he said. “Longer-term, given what’s happening globally in terms of the temperature profiles in the southern hemisphere and what’s also happening in the United States, I would not be surprisedwe started to see some big highlights - in whichever direction it goes, either cold or hot. Five-day forecastSunday: Most parts dry with good spells of sunshine. Cloudier at times over East Anglia and far southeast England where a little showery rain is possible. Breezy and colder than today. Monday to Wednesday: Chance of a few isolated showers, otherwise widely fine and dry with plenty of sunshine after some early mist and fog.

Home at last. It is ­impossible to imagine the ­emotional roller coaster that the Ratclfe family have been riding for the past six years.But watching Nazanin stepping off that plane on to British soil was a moment of joy for the whole country. How the tears flowed when we saw her wrapped in Richard and Gabriella’s arms, and that gorgeous selfie of their first spring stroll amid the daffodils and sunshine.But Richard and Nazanin are under no illusions about the ­journey that lies ahead. They can’t just slip back into their old lives. They need to get to know each other again.And former hostage Terry Waite has warned Nazanin that being ­released is like coming up from the seabed – you have to take it gently to avoid the deadly bends. But they will get there. Because, as the remarkable Richard explained: “We want to be a normal ­family again and stop being a moment in ­history.” Amid the joy, his words were a heartbreaking reminder. A reminder of the millions of other mums, dads and children who also yearn for normality. The Ukrainian families torn apart in this dark and terrying moment of ­history. No wonder so many big-hearted Brits want to open their doors and offer them the comforts of home. And it is shocking that the Government could not get its act together sooner to set up a practical resettlement scheme.  But while ,-plus people have now registered to take in refugees, many will be woefully unprepared for the ­practical and emotional ups and downs that lie ahead. While others – and we must be honest about this – will be unsafe, unscrupulous or utterly unsuitable. So it is right that ­anyone hosting ­families with ­children should ­undergo enhanced security checks. And that charities, church groups and all involved in the matching process should remind hosts of the huge responsibility involved – and that there are other ways to help our Ukrainian friends. But most volunteers will, I’m sure, be fully committed to the task, ready to offer refuge and respite from the horror of Putin’s atrocities. They just shouldn’t expect their new house guests to really “make ­themselves at home.” Because home is where the heart is, and theirs are still in Ukraine. And no matter how long this cruel war wages they will ache to be back with their families. Home. Home at last.

We were going to walk the town but after we saw what little it had to offer besides a steep walk down the hill to get there and the , we decided we would pass and wait for the Cotswolds, she said, oblivious to the fact she was already in one of the most famous parts of the Cotswolds.

So, he thought heaposd try it with his girlfriend of four years. She told him that there was only one thing she would change - how anxious he is so that he wouldnapost suffer anymore. But when she asked him what he would change about her, he didnapost hold back. For more of the news you care about, straight to your inbox, sign up for one of our daily newsletters here. I told her I would like her to have her old body back, meaning before the pandemic when she was more muscular and a little bit thinner, he said. Also, I told her she could be less hairy in some areas like her face and arms and I wish her hair was more cared for. I wouldn’t change anything fundamental about her appearance, maybe make her legs a little bit thinner but all my requests are very much achievable with a little effort. Unsurprisingly, she was devastated to hear what he really thought of her. She didn’t seem to appreciate my comments, her expression changed and she locked herself in her room without saying anything, he said. We slept on dferent beds and the next day she told me something very hurtful. She said aposI don’t think that your appearance is perfect either, there are some issues but I love you enough not to pester you about them.aposWhen he asked her what she meant, she told him how she wished he followed her skincare advice to get rid of his acne and how he should exercise with her more. But, he wasnapost too happy to hear this. I told her the dference is that I was honest and she lied. She didn’t say anything but it was obvious that she had been crying the whole night. She went to her sister’s house and hasn’t been responding to my messages. He concluded his post by asking whether he was in the wrong for being honest, and furious Reddit users were quick to put him in his place. One person said: There is honesty, and then there is brutal honesty. I am going to be brutally honest with you. You had someone who loved and accepted you for the [a**hole] you are. Now it looks like you donapost. I hope she dumps your hateful self so you can find that perfect body. Another wrote: You saw a trend on TikTok of two people accepting each other and decided to use it as a way to nitpick your GFaposs appearance. A third commented: That’s the killer. He claims his requests are achievable with aposa little effortapos, but she works out and he doesn’t. What    I canapost. Someone  put: The fact that you got your feelings hurt when your gf made a comment about your body is a double standard. Don’t comment on her bodyyou didn’t want your body commented on. He later revealed that they had broken up in an updated comment, where he said: I get it, I’m the a**hole. I called and profusely apologised but she said she would think of my comments every time I look at her and it’s something she can’t just forget.

Earlier this week Russian media outlet Pravda reported that three mercenaries from the Tennessee National Guard were killed while fighting in Ukraine. The newspaper identied the Americans by name and gave military ranks for each of them, citing information from pro-Russian militia in Ukraineaposs Donetsk. The report even offered an intricate explanation for how the three were identied, using items from a backpack near the remains of one of the militants -- including a Tennessee state flag. The US National Guard has since responded to the claims, saying that the reporting by Pravda is patently .  “The three soldiers identied in the article are either current or former members of the Tennessee National Guard,” a spokesperson for the Office of the Tennessee Adjutant General. “They are accounted for, safe and not, as the article headline erroneously states, US mercenaries killed in Donetsk People’s Republic.” The National Guard has said that the three US soldiers were the focus of reports because they had been featured on an American military website following a  mission. Four years ago they were among  soldiers deployed to Ukraine as part of a training mission. All members of the Tennessee National Guard ed safely to their home state in  after a successful mission, the military organisation claimed. A U.S. official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said two of the men were still in the Tennessee National Guard and in Tennessee. The other man had left the service was but was alive and accounted for -- and not in Ukraine, the official said Last Sunday Russia attacked the main base where, prior to Joe Bidenaposs pullout, the U.S. military had long trained Ukrainian forces.It fired air-launched cruise missiles from Russian airspace at the Yavoriv International Centre for Peacekeeping and Security. The base is located just  miles from the Polish border. Like the other Nato members, the US has offered military and humanitarian aid to Ukraine, but has not sent soldiers. It is feared that doing so could trigger a wider conflict or a nuclear weapons response from Russia.

If he survives, heaposs going to have to become Chinaaposs colony at this point. Thataposs the only way heaposs going to get the financial support he needs to survive. And itaposs not a sure thing that the Chinese are going to want to do that. Itaposs a really bad situation. It is in their interest, provided the war doesnapost go nuclear.  I think the Chinese would love to try and get as much of a foothold in Russia as possible - and they see trillions of dollars in resources. They see a Russian military that they would love to go in and take all the technology and add it to their own. And thataposs what they did when the Soviet Union collapsed, and that is why China is the superpower that it is now. They bought as much as they could from what was left of the Soviet Union and now the US and its allies are facing a Chinese military that has taken all that best Soviet equipment and upgraded it. So they would love to follow that blueprint again. Mr Kazianis said the Chinese leaders would also have to consider the reputational damage that would come from partnering with Russia. They donapost seem to care what anybody  thinks, they probably donapost care what their own people think,” he said. “It depends on how far this war goes. According to the United Nations,  civilians had been killed and , had been wounded in Ukraine by March , while more than . million refugees have fled the country.

Yesterday three Russian cosmonauts arrived at the International Space Station wearing the colours of the Ukrainian flag.The Soyuz capsule carrying Commander Oleg Artemyev as well as Denis Matveev and Sergey Korsakov docked at the orbiting  three hours after take off.In a twist, the new arrivals were all wearing the distinctive yellow and blue colours associated with the country Vladimir Putinaposs forces invaded last month. On Saturday afternoon Dmitry Olegovich Rogozin, director general of national space agency Roscosmos since  and a former deputy prime minister, claimed the outfits had nothing to do with Ukraine.  Sometimes yellow simply means yellow, he tweeted in Russians. If the Bandera geeks think that because of them we will change our colour tastes, repaint the Vostochny launch complex in gray-brown-crimson, the coat of arms of MSTU Bauman in orangeUnder no circumstances will we force cosmonaut graduates of Bauman University not to wear the colours of the coat of arms of their alma mater, then they are deeply mistaken.  Rogozin was referring to Stepan Bandera in his tweet, a Ukrainian far-right terrorist who died sixty years ago. In a live-streamed news conference from the ISS on Friday, veteran cosmonaut Oleg Artemyev, the mission commander, was asked about the suits. Every crew picks a colour that looks dferent. It was our turn to pick a colour, he said.The truth is, we had accumulated a lot of yellow fabric, so we needed to use it up. Thataposs why we had to wear yellow flight suits. Roscosmosapos press service said on its Telegram channel Sometimes yellow is just yellow. The flight suits of the new crew are made in the colours of the emblem of the Bauman Moscow State Technical University, which all three cosmonauts graduated from.... To see the Ukrainian flag everywhere and in everything is crazy.Several veteran astronauts read the choice of suit as less of a coincidence than a nod to Ukraine, which was invaded by Russia on February . Three Russian cosmonauts who just docked with the ISS arrive in Ukrainian yellow! former NASA astronaut Scott Kelly, who flew a yearlong mission on the space station with cosmonaut Mikhail Kornienko from March  to March , tweeted in Russian and English. Terry Virts, a NASA astronaut and former Space Station visitor, tweeted: Wow. Just wow. Well done. За экипаж! None of the three newly arrived cosmonauts hails from Ukraine. Artemyev was born in present-day Latvia, Matveev is from St. Petersburg and Korsakov was born in what is now Kyrgyzstan.

While it is uncleartheyaposre yet being used in Ukraine, itaposs not just tanks and guns at their disposal, the Daily Star report. Amid the tragic death toll of the on-going war, we have already seen the Russian military roll out some fearsome high-tech weapons. From thermobaric missiles to aposdecoyapos darts, President Vladimir Putin will seemingly stop at nothing to flex his military muscle.Russia has been quietly working on high-tech suits for some years - and could be preparing to introduce even more of them to the conflict. The Russian army has previously trialled aposactive poweredapos exoskeletons which can be strapped to soldiers to give them lethal cyborg powers. The electric suits are designed to augment and enhance troops. They can help soldiers carry much heavier loads and can even give machine guns deadly accuracy over long-distances.Oleg Faustov, from Russian Army defence contractor TsNiiTochMash, said the suits will make ordinary human servicemen far more lethal. He said: We have already held trials for the prototype of the active exoskeleton.  It really enhances a serviceman’s physical abilities. “For example, the tester was able to shoot from a machine-gun only with one hand and accurately hit targets.” The suits could theoretically change the face of warfare – turning men into part-machines, with the accuracy to match a computer. If deployed in the conflict with Ukraine, the suits could make Russian soldiers a real danger as the war with Ukraine shows no sign of stopping. The Russian military is reportedly firing decoy missiles into populated areas of Ukraine to try and bamboozle the Ukrainian military.According to US security officials, Moscow is using fake dart-shaped missiles for the first time in the conflict, which is now in its nd day.They believe the decoys are the reason why Ukraineaposs air defence systems have found it so tricky to stop Russiaaposs short-range ballistic missiles which have reportedly been used on civilians in hospitals and bomb shelters in Kyiv and Kharkiv.Since the start of Putinaposs invasion, images have circulated on social media of the dart-shaped munitions which many people initially thought were cluster bombs or miniature weapons.

However, a new iant has emerged and cases are up by %British Prime Minister Boris Johnson Image: REUTERSopinionByPaul Routledge:,  Mar Updated:,  Mar |comments For weeks, the politicians were very quiet about Covid, pretending it’s gone away.Then ministers suddenly got busy, lting all travel restrictions from today. We’re now in a free-for-all. Fingers crossed, because it’s a gamble with the nation’s health and the lives of the vulnerable. No mandatory masks on planes, trains and buses, or in schools or shops. That sounds correct, but the abolition of official rules brings confusion and uncertainty. In this do-it-yourself pandemic policy, who knows how to behave Boris Johnson, who uses the Ukraine war as a covering for his face , wants us to believe it’s all over. It isn’t. Driven by the super-infectious Omicron BA iant, new cases are up by %. There are , in hospital, with  on ventilators. Deaths on Wednesday numbered , bringing the seven-day total to . Protection gained by booster jabs is fast disappearing, and we’re still waiting for the vital fourth dose. It may come soon for the over s and vulnerable, but not until later in the year for the general population. With a hundred deaths being recorded every day, this feels like Covid complacency.And the Government is dragging its feet over the independent pandemic inquiry. It’s unlikely to take evidence before the winter – and not report until at least two years.This deliberate delay takes the verdict on the Great Tory Pandemic Bungle until well after the general election, thereby letting Boris Johnson off the hook. I don’t know about Covid being endemic, but we are being asked to live with endemic political corruption. *********** In , King James I described smoking tobacco as loathsome to the eye, hateful to the nose, harmful to the brain and dangerous to the lungs.

Pally Peter, in those days a Brussels bureaucrat, flattered oily Oleg as “not only wealthy but well-read, and voraciously interested in a constellation of social and economic ideas, as well as Russia’s future.” I’ll say.

The annual event is a project from the United Nations in the hope of finding a happier, more compassionate world in one currently polluted by crisis, fear and hate. The campaign is coordinated by Action For Happiness, a not-for-profit movement that is made up of people from  countries. International Day of Happiness describes the purpose of its mission as boosting wellbeing. “With our world facing unprecedented challenges, wellbeing matters more than ever. “When we choose to take action to help others, they benefit, we benefit and we set an example of kindness that can ripple out into the world too.” The organisation says that the world has moved forward and views have changed - economic growth isnapost the only thing that matters any more. Instead ‘progress’ can now also be measured through increasing human happiness and wellbeing. The history of the International Day of Happiness  In , the UN general assembly made happiness a ‘fundamental human goal’ and adopted it as a formal resolution. It called for “a more inclusive, equitable and balanced approach to economic growth that promotes the happiness and well-being of all peoples”. The following year, in , the inaugural UN Conference on Happiness established a fixed date for the day - it was observed officially for the first time the following year, in . March  has been deemed the official date for the annual event, with all of the  member countries of UN approving the idea and agreeing that more should be done to prioritise happiness. The day centres on a belief that “we are a social species and we thrive when we’re closely connected to others”. Co-founder and Director of Action for Happiness, Dr Mark Williamson, said in : “This International Day of Happiness is more than just a fun celebration, it also reminds us all that the world is a better place when we connect with and care about the people around us.” In the past, events have focused on dferent ways of looking at happiness. In , the campaign focused on reclaiming personal happiness as opposed to the commercial image of happiness we all get blasted with on a daily basis. To do this, the campaign asked people to share their images of what makes them happy - by sharing pictures of peoples’ authentic happiness, it was hoped that people can get closer to it once again. Ways to help with International Day of Happiness The International Day of Happiness’s official page has suggested things people can do to help the cause and, hopefully, spread some happiness. They say you can share positive messages: “Spread ideas that promote peace, kindness and understanding, online and in real le.” Connect with people: “Reach out to people who you know are connected to a crisis and offer your care and support.” Give directly: “Donate to causes working on the front line of a crisis or find a way to help with local efforts.” How are you celebrating International Day of Happiness  Let us know in the comments below Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON United NationsBritish economy\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

They say: He has no deep conversations with almost anyone, and limited contact even with his children - not only his [adult] daughters but also his [undisclosed] children with [Olympic gold medal winning gymnast, ] Alina Kabaeva”.  The source is a Telegram channel supposedly linked to an ex-Kremlin intelligence insider who claims to retain close links to those in Putin’s circle. While initially it was dismissed as unreliable, lately briefings attributed to Western intelligence have echoed its assertions over Putin’s supposed health issues. In a recent post, the channel General SVR said that senior political figures “were warned on behalf of the president that, perhaps in the near future, they will participate in practising evacuation in case of a nuclear war. “All who were contacted with this warning were seriously surprised and concerned about this initiative by the President.  “But all, without exception, confirmed their readiness to participate.“The general mental state of Vladimir Putin has recently caused alarm among people in the presidentaposs inner circle.”Repeating earlier claims about his alleged condition - previously dismissed by the Kremlin - the post said: “When Vladimir Putin, who suffers from oncology, Parkinsonaposs disease and schizoaffective disorder, invites members of the government and the heads of the State Duma and the Federation Council [the lower and upper houses of parliament] to take part in preparing for evacuation in case of a nuclear war …it becomes not fun at all”.  The only person who might trigger Armageddon is Putin, said the account. It names ex-president Dmitry Medvedev, who now has a security role, along with the speakers of the two houses of parliament - Vyacheslav Volodin and Valentina Matviyenko - as among those allegedly told there would be a drill for nuclear war. A schizoaffective disorder is a mental health condition including schizophrenia symptoms, for example, hallucinations or delusions, and mood issues like depression or mania. The channel today claimed Russia had logged the death toll as , including , service personnel.The rest were from private military armies - or mercenaries, backing the Kremlin and supposedly deployed in Ukraine. Russia has not given its estimated death toll in Ukraine for more than two weeks. Earlier reports have said Putin had moved unidentied members of his immediate family either to a luxury mountain villa in neutral Switzerland or to a hi-tech underground bunker in the Altai Mountains of Siberia.  Political scientist Valery Solovey, , linked to the Telegram channel, said earlier this month: “In fact, it is not a bunker, but a whole underground city, equipped with the latest science and technology.” He warned: “I hope this means something to you  “That the President sends his family to this bunker.” He did not identy Putin’s family members but previously alleged Kabaeva is his secret spouse, and Russia’s hidden first lady.  “This is his real family, and Alina is capable of influencing his decisions,” he said last year. A former professor at Moscow State Institute of International Relations- a training ground for future top diplomats and spies - Solovey’s home was recently searched and he was quizzed for eight hours. The channel has also claimed that Putin and defence minister Sergei Shoigu - in charge of the faltering military invasion of Ukraine - attended a shamanic ritual in Siberia which involved the sacrice of a black wolf in a rite to improve the president’s health.  It said: A piece of white fabric was soaked with the wolfaposs blood and burned. They allegedly saw a black raven in the smoke that circled for a long time. For some reason, this sign was explained to Putin as a great success.” Quizzed over his claims that Putin had a serious illness, strongly denied by the Kremlin, Solovey said: “I do not use the expression aposterminally illapos and I have never used it. “I use a euphemism: personal circumstances of compelling force.” Putin has two adult daughters Dr Maria Vorontsova, , a geneticist, and Katerina, , a high-kicking ‘rock’n’roll’ dancer-turned-mathematician. He is also reported to have a daughter Luiza Rozova, an -year-old heiress also known as Elizaveta Krivonogikh, from a previous relationship with cleaner-turned-multimillionaire Svetlana Krivonogikh, , now a part-owner of a major Russian bank.  Unconfirmed rumours denied by the Kremlin said he has children with Kabaeva. An element of Russian plans for a nuclear war is a fleet of “flying Kremlins” - Ilyushin Il- Maxdomes, on permanent standby. These “doomsday” planes are seen as ageing and due to be replaced by adapted Ilyushin -M’s allowing the Russian leader to control troops and missiles during an atomic catastrophe. However, the ultramodern bunker in the sky is not believed to be ready yet.

The sight of the Ukranian people desperately seeking safety in neighbouring countries evokes scenes in Europe from the Second World War, as Hitler#s forces advanced, and later refugee crises sparked by the more recent Balkan conflict.As reported in this edition the women, children and elderly are heading in one direction # while the young men, and no doubt plenty of women too, are going the opposite way to defend their country from Putin.In the midst of such suffering and bravery, it is heartening to hear of so many Argyll folk joining a huge Europe-wide effort to help those forced to flee their homes.We would encourage our readers to support this cause in whatever way you can.

From Knapdale, they headed up the west coast, sailing to Lewis and Harris before arriving at their final destination, Iona.Covering almost , miles in the series, they visit places of worship, from pagan stones to an early Christian cave and a contemporary mosque and Sikh temple. The journey tests the pilgrims not just spiritually, but physically too.TV celeb and comedian Scarlett Moffatt, , said: #At school, I spent a lot of time just reading books and on my own and so that’s how I got into faith really. It just felt calming. There’s almost a stigma attached to sort of being religious.#Whenever I would tell my friends, they’d laugh and I’d be like, #why is that funny # I believe in God, there has to be something that started all this.#I would describe myself as Christian, but not a strict Christian.

I’ve looked forward to this date since we entered and it’s what I’ve been working towards. My aim is to defend my gold,possible, but I want to see how well I can do and give him [his dad] a good run for his money.“I’ve made a few changes to my training, my bike and my run style slightly so we’ll see how that all pays off, but I love racing at Oulton Park, it’s a really nice track, a lovely atmosphere, it should be a really good day of racing.”Preparing to defend his M- British title, Leahn added: “This time around it’s at the beginning of the year so it’s going to be interesting, especially as the fields are much deeper this year which is great because that’s what it should be for a British Championships. But I’m going there to try and defend my title, I’ve got a taste for it now after last year and then it’s building up to the Worlds and Europeans later in the year.”Reflecting on the moment they shared on the podium together, Leahn said: “It was such a proud moment to see Dylan on the podium and to be able to share it with him made it even more special.“You are focused on your own race and your own effort, and it can be hard to work out who is in which age group when you’re racing, so until you cross the line you never really know where you’ve placed.“So, to find out I had won and then to see Dylan crossing the line to win his age group was a really nice feeling, especially having seen all the training and hard work he put in last year. It was a nice surprise to be driving home with two gold medals in the car.”.removeLast year’s championships was Dylan’s first standard distance duathlon and his first experience of a British Championships.“I had raced at Oulton Park earlier in the summer, so I knew the track and I really enjoyed racing there,” Dylan said. “I felt a lot more confident in October than at the race in June, but it was a whole new experience for me because it was across a distance I had never raced before.“It was a lot of unknowns, a lot of guess work, but it was an amazing feeling to cross the line and to be told you’re British champion. To be able to stand on the podium with my dad was amazing.”Last year saw Leahn claim world bronze at the World Triathlon Duathlon Championships in Spain. Later this year he will be back in Spain for the European Standard Distance Duathlon Championships in September, when he will be joined on the GB Age-Group Team by Dylan for the first time.“I’ve had the opportunity to travel and compete in dferent places and meet so many dferent people at races who I genuinely call friends, and now seeing the development and progression of Dylan within the sport is fantastic,” Leahn said.“When Dylan was youngerI was doing a long run, he would cycle alongside me and then at the weekend we would both run. Now we’ll do sessions together, we train together after Dylan comes home from school or at the weekend, and we also compete against each other at cross country. I’m so proud of him to see how he’s come from someone who used to follow me around on the bike to now I’m following him, and that’s purely down to his own effort and determination.

I’d also point out that Scotland’s chief medical officer has said that data shows that some older people are beginning to adapt their behaviour by reducing their contacts slightly, while their use of face coverings is also up. But older and disabled people require other people to protect them, which means that those others should be wearing face coverings – it is not necessarily for your own benefit but for the benefit of those around you who may be much more vulnerable, who you may not be able to identy just by sight.“I do think that a cautious approach at this point in time is probably the right approach, particularly to allow those of us who are more vulnerable to be safer in going about their lives.”"},{"url":null,"title":"leader february 25 2022","story":"This week#s publication of the report on the follow-up visit to Campbeltown Grammar School makes welcome reading.While there are still some areas to address, the positive impact of Sam Stewart#s appointment as acting head teacher is clear to see, with the school now under much stronger leadership.This, in turn, appears to have incentivised the rest of the staff and pupils and increased the community#s confidence in the school.The school is at the heart of our community and we hope all interested parties will maintain the positive momentum as the school works towards addressing its remaining issues.As we said last week when news of The Machrihanish Distillery broke, we#re sure there are plenty of opportunities for distilleries in a town which was once the whisky capital of the world.Springbank, Glengyle and Glen Scotia contribute a lot to the community, not just in terms of the economy, and we hope the owners of these two new distilleries,their plans come to fruition, will bring similar benefit.What an exciting time to call Campbeltown home."},{"url":null,"title":"leader march 4 2022","story":"Ukraine may be fighting one of the biggest and most powerful countries on earth, but it has the strength of the world behind it.The conflict has been described as a #David versus Goliath# war, with Ukraine battling to hold off the armies of its vast neighbour.Despite everything the country is going through, Ukraine#s leaders, military personnel and civilians have proved themselves to be tenacious, resilient, brave – and humorous!Videos showing Ukrainian soldiers dancing to pop music have gone viral on social media, with their ability to live in the moment earning them fans around the globe.Just last year, Ukraine celebrated  years of independence and now its sovereignty is being threatened in the worst way.The preservation of human le should come before all , and any military intervention by NATO countries would undoubtedly increase the death toll exponentially by turning the situation into a global conflict.Will the rest of the continent sit back indefinitely and do nothing but send weapons and impose sanctions while a European country battles for its existence "},{"url":null,"title":"letters march 4 2022","story":"We have recently moved to Carradale, and are loving it!I wrote this poem in praise of our new home.Carradale, O Carradale,Room to stretch, peace to workThe south might say it’s grim up northMay our days be long and all spent hereI urge you alltired and stressedThe story’s just startingTo quote a French poet, Charles Baudelaire,Best wishes.Living in a Campbeltown flat, one up from the street, with only one flat above using the same toilet waste downpipe, I was amazed tohome to find a previous #deposit# still in my toilet.My attempt to clear and flush caused the toilet basin to fill to the brim with #dirty# water etcetera and white paper.The emergency plumbers were called and two good men arrived but efforts to clear the toilet basin in the flat failed.At ground level outside, they effected an entry into the said downpipe and pulled out unpleasant #deposits# and many many wet wipes – which I do not use.They claimed to have previously attended similarly choked toilets with wet wipes.

Also standing by was the steamer Brora, which was bund for Belfast.The conditions were so bad from the point of view of visibility that the leboat had to receive bearings from the Brora and other ships by means of the Aldis signal lamps while ships’ searchlights assisted them in getting into position.

However, from time to time, for the vast majority of human societies its a sad reality that they would rather not think about, but sometimes tolerate.I do know too, as is abundantly clear in these dficult days that many people do not want to think through the consequences of the carnage of war. That’s a perfectly understandable reaction that I have some sympathy with, but only some.On Thursday evening I saw on TV, in common with millions of others, four or was it five tiny new-born babies. They were gasping, gurgling and thrashing as new-born do, but they were doing it in a basement in a war torn city. Horrying as that was, for me, as an anti-nuclear activist, worse was to come. I watched in horror as Thursday’s QuestionTime audience on BBC full of media-induced guilt and media-induced confusion continued in large numbers to entertain the potentially disastrous option of a no-fly zone over Ukraine.For those who still think my anti nuclear position is merely a subset of an alternative lestyle choice I suggest you consider what other, more establishment voices have to say.The Royal United Services Instituteis as establishment as it gets.On its open source section of its website is an article “A no fly zone would be ineffective, dangerous and a gt to Putin”. I commend to all of you who think that “rolling the iron dice” is a risk worth taking, though bear in mind that this time they are radioactive, with potentially a dferent species ending type of carnage.Bill Ramsay, Glasgow.RUSSIANS NEED TO HEAR THE TRUTHTHE biggest problem about the war in Ukraine is that it could happen again.Vladimir Putin’s ludicrous demand for the demilitarisation of Ukraine reflects a real need: demilitarisation of Russian state media and their straitjacket of lies. Most Russian people believe a fantasy world of Russia confronted by enemies waiting to strike.Russians do not need conquests. They need freedom to hear the truth. They would never elect a criminal like Putin again.The keys to the future are a working democracy and freedom of expression in Russia. Russia would be on its way to integration in Europe, to the immense benefit of Russians. Tim Cox, Bern, Switzerland.OUR SAFETY IS STURGEON’S DAY JOBIF the conflict in Ukraine escalates to nuclear war, then Scotland will be on the front line, yet Bob MacDougallthinks the most important elected politician in Scotland should stay quiet and concentrate on her “day job”. I would have thought the safety of Scots was her day job. Equally quaint is Alexander McKay’s nightmarish ramblingsthat the Scottish Government is “going helter-skelter …to shut down, or shut off all our own … gas and oil”. This will be Scotland’s gas and oil resources whose licensing and extraction is, and has been, entirely controlled from south of the Border for the last  years, but whose le span can now only be measured in a few decades. Scotland is a major exporter of energy in the form of gas, oil, with substantial and expanding amounts of electricity going to the UK and European grid. Scotland has no industrial interest in nuclear power, so it would be more enterprising to develop commercial tidal power, or green hydrogen production, and be cheaperto revive the proposed interconnector between Scotland and Norway, so that the complementary exchange of their vast renewable energy would be of benefit to them both.GR Weir, Ochiltree.NORTH SEA OIL WILL NOT SAVE USYOUR report on the Scottish Greens conference quoted Patrick Harvie as saying “war cannot justy more oil and gas production” . Crude coming out of the ground has not suddenly become more expensive to extract and refine. Demand falls as price rises, so price is reduced to increase demand, as the crude can’t be stored. Very soon the price at the pumps will be back to normal.Malcolm Parkin, Kinross.SAY NO TO ANY SAUDI DEALLAST Sunday Mohammed Bin Salman executed  men, in the largest mass execution in Saudi Arabia’s history. This is a brutal and shocking moment. Boris Johnson visited Saudi Arabia this week to beg for Saudi Arabian oil to replace Russian gas. We cannot show our revulsion for Vladimir Putin’s atrocities by rewarding those of Mohammed Bin Salman. I fear for the lives of every person on death row in Saudi Arabia  especially Abdullah al-Howaiti who was just  when he was arrested and tortured for a crime he couldn’t have committed, and Mohammed al-Faraj. who was arrested and tortured when he was just  for so-called “crimes” including going to his uncle’s funeral.Mr Johnson should refuse to buy oil from Saudi Arabia. We cannot be thinking of striking a new trade deal with a country that has just killed  people and that could murder many more at any point. Mohammed Bin Salman is making a statement. He thinks he can act with impunity. He thinks the world will stand by while he orders the murder of so many men, and publicly announces it. Mr Johnson must not trade oil for blood in our name.B McKenna, Dumbarton.NO INDEPENDENCE WITHIN THE EUTAOISEACH Michael Martin has told the Dublin parliament that the government “cannot” bring down diesel fuel prices, as they would like to do, “because of EU regulations”.This is one of the countries often put forward by the SNP as being “normal” and “independent” and “free”.

Although not responsible for the building, Glasgow City Council took the decision to order the evacuation for public safety reasons.  However, work was already due to get under way before then and the structure, which dates back to the s and was once a training centre for Church of Scotland ministers, was already covered in scaffolding to allow for essential work to go ahead after previous reports found stresses with stonework and that full refurbishment was required. Planning permission for refurbishment work was granted in December .And in January  police were called to the tower after crumbling stonework came crashing down on the pavement below.Residents were told they could be out of their homes for two to three months and as it reaches the halfway they are looking for answers.Dr Clayton, of the Park Action Group, said: “We were told movement sensors placed in one of the Towers had been triggered and the Tower was in danger of uncontrolled collapse.“The council says the building still poses a risk to le but will not release any engineering reports or provide any plan of action for its stabilisation or controlled dismantling.”Dr Clayton said residents have found it impossible to get back into their homes to assess any flood damage after the storm weekend.He added: “I need licences and permits for my daily job and others might need access for medicine for their children, but the council has been strong-armed about access. We still don’t have an update on what two to three months means.“We are extremely concerned and are running into insurance issues as our homes have not be occupied for more than  days andthat tower does fall down and we are not insured then who is liable  We have this huge sword of Damocles or Trinity hanging over us.“We want to know what is the plan of work and when will it be deemed safe to get back into our homes.”Read more: Revealed: Glasgow equal pay row strike dates are confirmedFellow resident and music producer Keith McIvor, of Optimo Music, said his livelihood is affected as his studio is in his home.Mr McIvor, who has worked with artists including Franz Ferdinand and the Manic Street Preachers, said: “After two years of not being able to work due to the pandemic, I now face continued uncertainty due to having no access at all to my music collection or studio equipment, both of which are essential for me to be able to work. I need to get my work out as my financial is desperate post pandemic I have a letime collection of records which are my livelihood. If the tower is so dangerous, then take it down.”  A Glasgow City Council spokesman said they had communicated regularly with residents affected by the exclusion zone around this dangerous building, but while the Trinity Tower is considered a dangerous building, as it currently is, the council is required to protect wider public safety by restricting access to the building.The spokesman added: “It should be understood that the timescale of two to three was given by the owners’ contractor once they had confirmed the scale and nature of the works they would have to carry out to make the building safe. We relayed this information to affected residents, and continue to work with the contractors to ensure people canhome as quickly as possible. Residents have absolutely been givenaccess to collect essential items, and again it should be noted that more regular visits are not feasible given the great increase in risk that this would entail.“The condition and maintenance of the Trinity tower is a matter for the owners of that building, and repair work instructed by them was already underway when our Building Standards team was alerted by their contractors, who were concerned about its condition.”A spokeswoman speaking on behalf of the design team, which includes the owners of the tower and their surveyors, told The Herald all media was being handled by the council as they had put a cordon in place.The spokeswoman declined to comment any further on the nature of repairs being carried out and how long this was likely to take."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/13591558.jpg?type=article-full","title":"15-ways-help-butterflies-bees-garden","story":"The good news is that there’s something we can do to help them.“Gardeners,” Goulson says, “can help by making their garden more insect friendly. Avoid pesticides, grow some pollinator friendly flowers , dig a pond, make a compost heap, mow less and soon your garden will be buzzing with le. If every gardener did this it would make a huge dference for wildle – our cities, towns and villages could soon be teeming with le.”Here are  ways you can do this.Choose blooms that attract pollinatorsThe more iety, the better. Bees and hoverflies love members of the daisy, carrot, rose and mint families. If you’re thinking about sowing plants and herbs for the summer, consider, allium, aquilegia, borage, catmint, columbine, delphinium, foxglove, globe-thistle, lavender, nasturtium, oregano, poppy, snapdragon, sweet pea, thyme, verbena viper’s bugloss. Double flowers can make it dficult for insects to access pollen and nectar – so plant single flowers.Provide a water stationBees get thirsty, so it’s good, particularly during the warm, dry summer months, to provide them with a source of water. Bird baths can work well, allowing bees to balance on the ledge of the rim as they drink. Add pebbles on which the bees can stand. Even a water bowl piled with marbles and pebbles can work.Butterflies don’t need a water bowl as they get what they need from nectar. However, they do need places to “puddle” in what is effectively wet soil, from which they get minerals. To make a puddle take a bowl or pan and scatter a layer of soil. Place rocks or pebbles throughout, for the butterflies to land on, then scatter cut pieces of sponge throughout the soil. These must be kept wet and will release water into the soil.Learn to love your weedsA recent study found that plants that we classy as weeds are actually more popular with pollinators than some of the wildflower mixes that are increasingly popular. Ragwort and two ieties of thistle, species which are officially classed as injurious under the  Weeds Act, are hugely popular with bees and other insects. The study found that the abundance and ersity of pollinators visiting these plants was, on average, double that seen for the wildflowers recommended by the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs.Comma butterfly on a thistleCreate a mini-meadowResearchers at the University of Sussex, with the help of citizen scientists, have shown that even a space of just four square metres is enough to provide a rich habitat for pollinators and support bioersity. Wildflower mini-meadows were created in gardens and allotments, using commercially available seed-mixes. The the team, led by Professor Dave Goulson, found \"in the year following seed-sowing, mini-meadows were supporting on average  percent more bumblebees compared to control plots where no wildflowers had been sown. These resource rich habitats also attracted  percent more solitary bees, and  percent more solitary wasps.\"Give your mower a breakThe pressure may be on for a neat lawn but resist. Long grass gives pollinators shelter and a place to feed. If you can’t bear to let your whole garden grow untamed like this, consider dedicating a strip or patch to long grass and wildflowers. Allow lawn weeds to flower before you remove or cut them. Nature Scot points out, “Weeds have had a bad name. A good example is the much maligned dandelion. If you can avoid cutting your grass until mid-April, after the dandelions have flowered but before they set seed, they will provide an important source of food for all types of pollinators.”Ditch the pesticidesOne of the key things you can do for pollinators is to stop all use of pesticides, which have played a major role in the collapse of insect populations across the world. France banned all use of synthetic pesticides in public spaces in , and garden use from . Many experts, including Dave Goulson, who launched a petition last year, believe the UK should follow. Goulson said, “We don’t need them in our gardens... If we link up private gardens with flower-filled road verges and roundabouts, city parks, cemeteries and so on, that’s potentially a network of insect-friendly habitats. It would be a huge step in the right direction.”Natural alternatives include companion planting, “soft” chemicals like soap and stinging nettles, and inviting pest predators like ladybirds into your garden. One of the problems with buying ready-grown plants is that you can’t be sure what pesticide has been used on them. Grow them from seed in order to keep your garden pesticide free.Make your garden insect-friendly even in winterGrow winter-flowering hardy pollinating plants to give honeybees, which don’t hibernate, something to forage, should their food run out. The blooms will colour-up your garden even in the winter months, while providing food for both honeybees and insects that emerge early from hibernation. Choose shrubs like hellebores, willows, mahonias and winter-flowering clematis. Or try lungwort, the favourite plant of the hairy-footed flower bee, or crocuses, grape hyacinths and snowdrops.\" alt\"HeraldScotland: A crocus with a bumblebee covered in pollen grains \" class\"editor-image\"Connect up a B-LineBugle Scotland is a project to create a map of what are called B-lines, which are corridors and fragments of pollinator-friendly land, with the aim to ultimately join them up and create routes for bees. It may just be that your garden can be part of a B-Line or that you could team up with neighbours to help create one, or seethere are other ways of getting involved in your neighbourhood.Bee-friend your herbsWhether in a window box, container or bed, herbs are not only great for your kitchen, many of them are beloved by bees. Marjoram, thyme, chives, sage and rosemary, are more familiar pollinator-friendly herbs. But, says a Friends of the Earth guide to help bees, you could also strike out and try something more adventurous, “Angelica, with its nectar-rich flowers, will attract plenty of early bees and other pollinators, and unlike many other herbs, can thrive in partial shade. Fennel is rich in nectar and pollen, and will attract a iety of solitary bees.”Snoop on the neighbours’ beesLearn from the bees and butterflies themselves. A tip from Friends of the Earth is, “Peek over the garden fence or at your neighbour’s window boxes to see which plants are doing well, and which ones the bees like to visit.If you like the look of any of them ask your neighbour what they are or take a picture and have a look online.”Let your ivy growIvy is a top pollinator food in autumn. When a lot of other flowers have died off, it’s still going, producing its yellow-green blooms, there for the late-flying butterflies like the red admiral or the comma, by social wasps and by honeybees. Don’t cut it back until after flowering.Red admiral on ivy Choose flowers that butterflies loveMost obvious of these is buddleia, also known as the butterfly bush, but there are many others, including verbena bonariensis, lavender and marjoram. Butterflies like warmth, so choose sunny, sheltered spots for nectar plants.Try to provide flowers right through the butterfly season. Spring flowers are vital for butterflies coming out of hibernation and autumn flowers help butterflies build up their reserves for winter.Painted ladies on buddleia Don’t forget the hoverfliesThe great thing about hoverflies is that the adults are pollinators, but their larvae are predators of aphids and other unwanted garden visitors. It’s like inviting in the pest control.Unlike honeybees and bumblebees which have tongues which allow them to access nectar, most hoverflies have simple mouthparts, which means that the nectar of some flowers, particularly tubular blooms, are inaccessible to them. Choose open flowers like apple blossom, single-flower dahlias, Michaelmas daisies and marsh marigolds, or umbellers, like fennel or wild carrot.Make a bee houseApproximately  species of solitary bees are known in the UK. Some build their nests underground, others do so in naturally occurring cavities, in cracks in stones or holes in wood. It’s the latter that you can invite to come and stay in a bee house. Such constructions are usually boxes, fixed to a fence or wall, more than a metre from the ground, and filled with either wooden blocks or logs with holes drilled into them or bamboo stems. Instructions for how to do this can be found on many wildle websites, including the Woodland Trust and Friends of the Earth. Nature Scot notes, “In Scotland, the red mason beeis the most likely occupier of bee houses.” Remember caterpillars need food too.The following plants are particular good to feed them... blackthorn, buckthorn, holly, oak, broom, garlic mustard, nasturtium, nettle, sorrel, thistles. Butterfly Conservation offers an advice leaflet which suggests, “Grow nasturtiums to lure large and small white caterpillars away from the brassicas” and notes, “stinging nettles are a favourite of the comma and red admiral.”"},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/13591806.jpg?type=article-full","title":"queen-20k-lift-fitted-security-upgraded-balmorals-craigowan-lodge","story":"It comes after the monarch spent most of the past two years based at Windsor Castle, with reports suggesting she will never again live at Buckingham Palace.According to reports in The Sun, a new “wheelchair-friendly” lt, security gate, state-of-the-art intercom system and a string of new CCTV cameras are due to be installed at Craigowan Lodge in Aberdeenshire.The -year-old Queen, who typically stays at the lodge twice a year – every April and for two weeks in summer, has been left needing a walking stick following recent health scares.The Queen has been using a walking stick A Balmoral insider said: “For many years we have thought it would be the perfect place for the Queen to spend more time when she’s older.

The conservative former top prosecutor, whose single five-year term begins on May , said the location and design of the Blue House have fed criticisms that South Korean presidents are cut off from the public and wield excessive power.At the Blue House, offices for presidential advisers and other officials, as well as the press room, are not in the same building where the president works.At a televised news conference on Sunday, Mr Yoon said he will move the presidential office to the Defence Ministry compound in central Seoul and that he will begin his term there.He said Defence Ministry officials will be moved to the Joint Chiefs of Staffbuilding at the compound, and JCS staff will transfer in phases to a war command centre near Seoul.Mr Yoon said a massive public park will be established near the new presidential office and ordinary citizens will be able to look at his office from there at a close distance. He said he also plans to establish a press centre at the new presidential office and meet journalists there frequently.According to Mr Yoon’s plans, the current Blue House will be open to the public as a park on his inauguration day. He said he will collect public opinions to determine the name of the new presidential office.Critics of his plan have said other tasks require more urgent attention, such as surging Covid cases, the North Korean nuclear threat, and erse economic woes. They also say the relocation could inconvenience the public and require excessive spending. vw,vw,px, px\"People watch a TV screen showing the live broadcast of Yoon Suk Yeol as he outlined his relocation plans Outgoing liberal President Moon Jae-in had earlier also promised to move out of the Blue House but cancelled the plans after failing to find a site for the new office.Mr Yoon said he is aware of concerns about the relocation, but saidhe starts his term at the Blue House, which critics have called “a symbol of imperial power”, it will become harder to move out of it.“I know relocating the presidential office isn’t an easy thing,” he said. “ButI back down on a promise with the people again, no other future president would attempt to do it.“I’ve made this decision for the future of the country.”Mr Yoon said the relocation will cost about  billion South Korean won ."},{"url":null,"title":"marshland-blaze-rspb-reserve-extinguished  \n","story":"Data ed from the Piano meterActive meterExpired callback event.As a subscriber, you are shown % less display advertising when reading our articles.Those ads you do see are predominantly from local businesses promoting local services.

Instead of a smooth and slippery surface, high friction surfacing creates thousands of tiny contact points, known as a micro-texture.

The comments were made as the UFU launched its annual schools’ competition. Open to all playgroups, nursery, primary, and special schools, this year’s theme relates to the UFU’s food and farming education resource “Dig in!”, which encourages pupils to learn more about food, farming, and the countryside. UFU deputy president, David Brown said, “This year’s schools competition theme ‘Dig in! to food, farming and the environment’ provides an opportunity for teachers to start the discussion in the classroom about the importance of food and farming in NI, allowing pupils to learn more about how farmers work hard to produce the delicious, high-quality produce on our tables, and their contribution to shaping our landscape in NI, which everyone enjoys. “Climate change has been the front runner in NI this year and our farmers play an essential role in combating the global issue, as they are a key part of the solution. The schools competition helps pupils to enhance their understanding of how farmers create dferent environments in NI which support our economy, rural communities, tourism and recreation.” Mr Brown says every year the competition judges are impressed by the number, standard and creativity of entries for the schools’ competition. “We would encourage all nursery, playgroups, primary and special schools to participate in what is a very worthwhile competition. It’s a great opportunity to express their creativity while learning about one of the most important sectors in NI as they will discover the importance of local food production,” he said. The UFU is pleased to have competition sponsor Asda on board for another year with a range of prizes available for the lucky winners. Joe McDonald, Asda NI corporate affairs manager said, “Asda is a proud sponsor of the school’s competition. It is great to see competition entries grow year upon year, especially with the introduction of a dferentiating foundation category last year - the standard is superb. It is vital to create an awareness of where our produce comes from, and this competition is a great opportunity to do so - educating children on the ‘farm to fork’ story.” Now in its eleventh year, BOIOFW is the perfect partner for the schools’ competition. As part of the prize, the winner of each category receives free transport for their class to the nearest participating BOIOFW farm, and all competition entries will be on display throughout the weekend. Mr Brown says schools don’t need to be competition winners in order to visit real, working farms. “This free event showcases NI’s world-class ‘farm to fork’ journey and reconnects consumers with our farmers, the primary food producers.The weekend underlines the importance of supporting local producers to benefit the rural community and wider economy in NI. BOIOFW is taking place on Saturday  and Sunday  June, and I would certainly encourage all schools to consider organising a trip to a local participating farm on the schools’ day, Friday  June,” said the UFU deputy president. Entry forms have been sent electronically to all playgroups, nursery, primary and special schools. Schools’ competition templates are available by visitingwww.ufuni.org.The closing date for entries is Friday  April .

But with Baby Carrie, there was nothing. There was just a void.“That’s why I was so keen from early on to give her an identity to ensure she didn’t get lost, anonymised or forgotten about.“When someone is murdered, there’s always a family member saying ‘we want justice’, but for baby Carrie there was nobody,” he said.“We became her advocates, her surrogate family — it felt very personal. If we stopped trying, then who  was going to do it ”There’s a clear a sense of unfinished business when Mr McComb — a Carryduff native himself — talks about her. “Do I have regrets  Absolutely,” he said.“We worked really hard but this one just always seemed to elude us.“I do carry that one around as a bit of a burden.”Mr McComb told how he grew up playing with his brothers and friends in the area where the baby’s body was discovered on March .“The Duck Walk was a place that children of my age and generation instantly recognise,” he said.“How did someone know to go there  You’d need local knowledge. It was an unusual place to go.“Because I was from Carryduff, it began to feel that little bit more personal due to my connections to the village.”Before being disposed of at the Duck Walk, experts believe that Carrie had been buried in a garden or flowerbed.Weeks later, her body was subsequently removed and placed in a bin bag until she was later found by four young children.Brothers Raymond and Ryan Waddell, aged  and , had been playing along with Danielle Cltonand Rachel Mills , near the sports complex when they caught sight of something.According to The Detail website, closer inspection revealed it to be the umbilical cord — hanging out from a bin bag lying in undergrowth.One of the boys shook the plastic bag with his shoe.Initially, some of children thought it was a doll, although Danielle — who opened the bag — told the investigative website that she “knew straight away it was a baby”.When the Belfastcontacted Danielle, she would only say that it was “something I’m still dealing with  years on”.The inquest into Carrie’s death took place in February .A post-mortem examination ruled that the little girl had been born alive, weighing ,g , and she had “a good growth of darkish hair”.The autopsy report said her wounds were “consistent with having been made by a bladed weapon such as a kne” — seven on the scalp, one to the centre of her forehead, one on the right side of her chest, another on the outer side of the right hip, a stab wound on the left thigh and an incision just above the knee.Around cm of umbilical cord was still attached to her abdomen. Its free end was ragged and had not been tied.Coroner John Leckey determined her death “was due to a severe head injury caused either by blows to the head with a hard, blunt object or by the head having been struck against a hard surface”.He added that “there was evidence of multiple stab wounds”.The then state pathologist, Professor Jack Crane, said the nature of the stab wounds “indicates some degree of hesitation”.There was little doubt that Carrie had been born healthy.“The forensic and pathological examination showed that her lungs had expanded so she had breathed independently of mum,” said Mr McComb.“She was a perfect newborn, but shortly afterwards she was killed in a iety of ways.“She had  stab wounds, but none of them would have been fatal. The most serious had punctured her ribcage and had gone into one of her lungs — but it was not the cause of death.”Mr McComb has always thought “there was another pair of hands” involved.“I’ve never accused Carrie’s mum of killing her,” he said.“That’s because of the sequencing of when baby Carrie was born and murdered almost immediately.“Assuming she was born via a natural birth, would the mother have had the physical energy, let alone the mental acuity, to kill the baby “It pushes the theory towards another person.”When asked why Carrie was initially buried, Mr McComb said to understand that “you have to understand how she was conceived”.“We don’t know the circumstances,” he said.“Whether this was an unwanted child in its simplest terms or a child that was brought about because of sexual offending, a rape, or incest, a child born in circumstances that the family would be ashamed of “We simply don’t know. But there was something in the circumstances of her birth that said this child is not wanted and this child cannot live.”In the months after Carrie’s death, there were multiple appeals issued by the PSNI for the mother to come forward.The DNA of around , local women aged between  and  was tested and over , people were interviewed by officers.BBC’s Crimewatch programme highlighted the case and included an image of what Carrie might have looked like as an older baby.Detectives contacted GPs, maternity units, midwives, social services, community psychiatric nurses, hospitals and others including the Samaritans, Nexus, NSPCC and Brook Advisory Clinic.Enquiries were also conducted in the UK and the Republic.Mr McComb said he thought he was coming close to solving what happened “several times”.Between  and  women were directly approached and were ruled out being Carrie’s mother.“With the exception of the Inga Maria Hauser investigation, baby Carrie was the largest DNA screening we’d done,” he said.“We narrowed it down to residents in Carryduff aged between  and .“The vast majority of people were very supportive of this incredibly complex operation.”Despite the passage of years and the absence of answers, Mr McComb still believes this case will be solved.“Those are  years that the mother has missed,” he said.“There may be circumstances that the mother thinks she’s glad of that — because the child was born out of wedlock or rape or whatever that might be — but there’s still that really emotional bond to children in those circumstances.”A inter-denominational service for baby Carrie was held at a funeral parlour on Belfast’s Ravenhill Road on August .Church of Ireland clergyman Rev John Auchmuty said the little girl had suffered a terrible end to her all-too-short le.He declined our invitation to talk about it, but at the time he said: “Through no fault of baby Carrie’s, she was denied the right to le.”The children who found her body were also there to say their personal farewells and they walked behind the tiny white coffin carried from the service by detective sergeant Lindsay McNair, who was part of the police investigation team.She was buried at Knockbreda Cemetery.The inscription on the headstone reads: “Baby Carrie —known only to God.”Which isn’t strictly true at least one person knows who she is, and has continued to elude justice.Perhaps surprisingly, Mr McComb thinks it’s “absolutely possible” for something like this to happen again.“How many people spend their days face down on a phone, tablet or computer ” he said.“When we did house-to-house enquiries in ... people were already saying ‘I come into my house, I close the curtains, I don’t bother with anybody and I don’t know what’s going on outside my door’.“It’s more likely that that’s happening now because nobody is looking at their friends or neighbours they’re looking at their devices.”Now,  years on from what happened, he has a special message for the child’s mother.“All I would say to mum is that,you’re still there, this was still your daughter,” he said.“She will be your daughter until you pass on. History will always know that she was your daughter.“She lies in a grave with a name that we gave her, that may not be a name that you want her to have — so there’s still that opportunity for you to tell us your story.“There’s still time for you to claim back your daughter who may have been taken from you beyond your control... just to be able to do the honest, decent thing.“We never made a judgement on her circumstances, or on her guilt or innocence, we always said it was likely to be another pair of hands and I hold that to this day.“Mum still has the opportunity to say, ‘I want to claim my daughter’”.Little Carrie is at peace, but so many others clearly aren’t.Related topicsPolice Service of Northern IrelandMore On Police Service of Northern IrelandAnimal cruelty cop John Fleming was in line for promotionInga Maria: ‘Handful of people’ can unlock tragic case, says top copPSNI launch fresh appeal on th anniversary of murder of ‘Baby Carrie’Man arrested on suspicion of fraud over ‘uncompleted construction jobs’ after arriving at Belfast airport released on bail PremiumFionola MeredithOpinionPeter Tatchell is right, prosecuting Co Down anti-gay preacher will only aid his odious crusadeMost ReadBeautully finished Malone semi-detached is spacious and perfect for a modern familySam McBrideOpinionMystery about quiet hardening of the Irish Sea border – and who ordered itBaby Carrie: ‘Someone knows what happened, it’s not too late to do the right thing’Council refuses landlord licence for student house for first time in Belfast after complaints of anti-social behaviourGail WalkerOpinionAirbrushing of Trimble in US a reminder to unionists of their true place on island of IrelandTop Videos wearing flight suits in yellow and blue colours that match the Ukrainian flag \"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph news world-news bfb .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_cedcb-ddcd-fd-ade-bafdbf_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news world-news bfb .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_cedcb-ddcd-fd-ade-bafdbf_ w\" data-sizes\"auto\"   wearing flight suits in yellow and blue colours that match the Ukrainian flag \"PlayRussian cosmonauts wear Ukraine colours to International Space StationPlayVideo: Billy Connolly - Terrorist Attack At Glasgow AirportPlayVideo: Two-year-old Belfast girl shouts at her mum for laughing as she tries to sing a song from FrozenLatest Northern IrelandSuzanne BreenOpinionThe DUP’s failings are Sinn Fein’s biggest strength in the upcoming Stormont electionAbuse victim died of Covid- before Belfast paedophile faced justicePaul McKenna: Grieving widow tells of her last moments with DJ husbandAnimal cruelty cop John Fleming was in line for promotionLiam BeckettOpinionReal Cltonville and Coleraine fans were let down by bigoted few at League Cup FinalLatestMarshland blaze at RSPB reserve extinguishedCelebrities join friends and family at funeral of Shane WarneSurrogate babies wait out war in makesht bomb shelterMariupol art school used as bomb shelter destroyed in Russian attack, locals saySouth Korea’s new president to move office to central Seoul,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Credit: Gareth FullerJohn BreslinMarch   : PMFacebookTwitterEmailFreight operators and passengers were scrambling on Thursday night to switch plans following the sudden mass sacking of  PO Ferries employees, including dozens of skilled crew operating the Larne-Cairnryan route.The company announced the action via a video message, then sent private security staff — some wearing body armour and balaclavas, and carrying stun guns and handcuffs — to remove staff from the European Causeway docked in Larne.Sailings on the route are now suspended for at least five days and possibly a week, prompting concern over a serious disruption to the supply chain.Around  lorries use the route daily, many of them carrying perishable goods on what is the shortest Irish Sea crossing.Captains, engineers, electricians and other skilled deck and engine staff were sacked on Thursday, including around  operating the ferries between Scotland and here.They were immediately replaced by cheaper agency staff, unions said. Other workers, mostly hospitality and already employed through agencies, remained on board.Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up Read MoreThey have treated us all like c**p, says -year PO veteranMargaret Canning:OpinionPO Ferries: Operator of busy link with Scotland recorded £.m profit in , but other factors at play hereWhile PO was silent on Thursday night on why the services are suspended, it is believed the new crew needs to be trained up and may require the green light from maritime regulators to sail.Fears were growing among the approximately  to  Port of Larne ground staff employed directly by PO.East Antrim MLA John Stewart said they had heard nothing from the company as events unfolded quickly on Thursday, adding that the crew members were “treated despicably”.PO, owned by Dubai-headquartered conglomerate DP World since , said it had to take the action because the company was not “viable” after posting losses of £m in the last financial year.The sackings came two years after , staff were made redundant at the same time investors were paid a £m idend, which the company said it was legally obliged to disburse.“Our survival is dependent on making swt and signicant changes now. Without these changes there is no future for PO Ferries,” the company said.“These circumstances have resulted in a very dficult but necessary decision, which was only taken after seriously considering all the available options.”Unions representing the seafarers told members to stay on board, but those stepping off the ship said they had little choice but to leave after being confronted by the security staff and warned they were trespassing, and that the redundancy package would be withdrawnthey did not do so.Local politicians reacted with shock at the developments. It also caught industry insiders completely by surprise.East Antrim MP Sammy Wilson, who spoke with chief executive Peter Hebblethwaite, said he was assured the jobs of ground staff at Larne were secure, but added he was “appalled” at the treatment of the seafarers.“The way in which staff were removed from the ships is totally unacceptable and is not how any employer should treat their employees,” Mr Wilson said.“Despite operating purely between UK ports, PO will now be paying Third World wages to their crew.“This raises serious concerns about the company’s morality.”Immediate clarication is needed over the future of Larne Harbour, East Antrim Alliance MLA Stewart Dickson said.“Given PO owns Larne Harbour, urgent questions now need asked as to the potentially vast impact locally,” Mr Dickson said.Passengers, hauliers and cargo are being redirected to Stena Line ferries, with the company saying it is trying to accommodate but is extremely busy. It confirmed it was trying to accommodate those booked on the PO ferries between Scotland and Northern Ireland.“Most freight companies have accounts with all ferry operators and they are doing what they normally do during periods of disruptions and move via alternative routes operators where space is available,” Stena Line said.Logistics UK, the trade body for freight transport, warned there will be disruption but that those in the business of moving goods were flexible and used to quickly switching methods, either using other ferries or,needs be, air transport.But Seamus Leheny of the organisation said: “This has just come out of the blue... really shocked the industry.”Rail, Maritime and Transportunion general secretary Mick Lynch said: “We are seeking urgent legal action and are again calling for the Government to take action to stop what is fast turning into one of the most shameful acts in the history of British industrial relations.”Tom Long of law firm Shakespeare Martineau said: “PO’s decision to fire  staff with immediate effect appears to contravene the requirements needed for a normal mass redundancy.”Related topicsJohn StewartAlliance PartyStewart DicksonMore On John StewartJohn Traynor, Ballycastle man who died in Carrickfergus work accident, ‘a very, very popular inidual’Birth Mothers, which represents mother and baby homes victims, urges Stormont to act on ’s recommendations PremiumSuzanne BreenOpinionProtocol meeting: Stormont ide is clear in discussions with EC vice presidentDoug Beattie includes Mike Nesbitt and John Stewart in UUP spokespeople changesDoug Beattie includes Robbie Butler and Andy Allen in UUP leadership team Most ReadBeautully finished Malone semi-detached is spacious and perfect for a modern familySam McBrideOpinionMystery about quiet hardening of the Irish Sea border – and who ordered itBaby Carrie: ‘Someone knows what happened, it’s not too late to do the right thing’Council refuses landlord licence for student house for first time in Belfast after complaints of anti-social behaviourGail WalkerOpinionAirbrushing of Trimble in US a reminder to unionists of their true place on island of IrelandTop Videos wearing flight suits in yellow and blue colours that match the Ukrainian flag \"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph news world-news bfb .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_cedcb-ddcd-fd-ade-bafdbf_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news world-news bfb .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_cedcb-ddcd-fd-ade-bafdbf_ w\" data-sizes\"auto\"   wearing flight suits in yellow and blue colours that match the Ukrainian flag \"PlayRussian cosmonauts wear Ukraine colours to International Space StationPlayVideo: Billy Connolly - Terrorist Attack At Glasgow AirportPlayVideo: Two-year-old Belfast girl shouts at her mum for laughing as she tries to sing a song from FrozenLatest Northern IrelandSuzanne BreenOpinionThe DUP’s failings are Sinn Fein’s biggest strength in the upcoming Stormont electionAbuse victim died of Covid- before Belfast paedophile faced justicePaul McKenna: Grieving widow tells of her last moments with DJ husbandAnimal cruelty cop John Fleming was in line for promotionLiam BeckettOpinionReal Cltonville and Coleraine fans were let down by bigoted few at League Cup FinalLatestMarshland blaze at RSPB reserve extinguishedCelebrities join friends and family at funeral of Shane WarneSurrogate babies wait out war in makesht bomb shelterMariupol art school used as bomb shelter destroyed in Russian attack, locals saySouth Korea’s new president to move office to central Seoul,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The Soviet flags were taken down on December , . Below, the aftermath of Russian airstrikes in Kyiv. Credit: Alain-Pierre Hovasse Getty ImagesMarch   : AMFacebookTwitterEmailYekaterinburg is miles away from everywhere. Boris Yeltsin’s hometown and the site of the executions of the Tsar Nikolai II and his family by the Bolsheviks in , it has hosted some key moments in Russian and Soviet history.I spent a couple of days there during the  World Cup, and ahead of the Peru France game, I spoke to Tanya from Sevastopol, who was working as a volunteer. Sevastopol is on the Crimean Peninsula, about ,km from Yekaterinburg which is located where Europe meets Asia.During our brief conversation, she declared that Crimea was most certainly not Ukraine, in case there was any doubt. I hadn’t asked, and anyway I’d heard it all before.Over  years ago, when I started studying Russian in Trinity College, one of my teachers ruefully recounted the story of how former Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev had given Ukraine the present of ‘Crimea’, which sits in Ukrainian territory on the Black Sea.Sure, what’s a peninsula with access to the Black Sea between friends when we’re all part of the Soviet Union Quite a lot when that Union breaks up.For those wonderingthe pronunciation and spelling of Kyiv are new inventions, that same teacher, whose lack of English gave our beginners’ Russian a run for its money, always referred to the city as ‘Keev’ and never pronounced it ‘Kee-yev’ as it was spelt in Russian.

The word ‘na’ is normally applied to general areas, for instance ‘the west’, ‘the north’ — and was never used for any other Soviet republic. The issue moved the newly-formed country to appeal to Russia in  to abandon this practice and only use the more logical “v Ukraine”. It didn’t work. Of course, in English, ‘The Ukraine’ was almost universal and, given how loaded ‘the north’ is when applied to Northern Ireland, it should not be a surprise that many English-speaking Ukrainians objected. It’s taken over  years of independence and a terrying war to finally get the penny — and the definite article — to drop in this part of the world.It was a dizzying era in eastern Europe — we took our Christmas holidays in December  as students of the USSR. When we ed the USSR no longer existed. The end of the Cold War opened up all kinds of possibilities, especially as we were required to spend months in Russia as part of our degree course.By the time I travelled over in , the loopholes which allowed previous foreign students to live comfortably had been locked shut and instead new rules were made that introduced higher prices for foreigners, regardless of income. Instead of living like Tsars, we had to work for a living.I hilariously found myself managing a western-owned Moscow courier company for a couple of months. The salary was basic, which matched my basic ability to manage my ‘team’ of couriers. The staff lived by the old Soviet mantra that they’d pretend to workwe pretended to pay them.In my defence, it’s not easy trying to manage any kind of delivery service in a strange metropolis where many street names had been changed from their communist-era titles.I was only ever stopped and asked for my papers once. ‘Dokumenty!’ hissed a poorly-dressed, obviously bored, conscript. A poorly-dressed student myself, his face dropped as he saw me lt the European passport out of my pocket. “I’m so, so sorry,” he said. “I thought you looked Ukrainian.”I never thought it betrayed any deep, underlying suspicion of the emerging state but was more likely just one desperate kid spotting a chance to get a few smokes off a scared foreigner. In a phonetic quirk, speaking Russian with an Irish accent was more likely to see you mistaken for a native of one of the Baltic republics.Ukrainian independence happened almost by accident and was only ever begrudgingly accepted in Moscow which always viewed it as within Russia’s ‘sphere of influence’. Even the Americans tended to agree.Russia without Ukraine was a very dferent country. After all, Khrushchev and his successor Leonid Brezhnev were Ukrainian, as were many of the USSR’s apparatchiki-in-chief. Catching out Ukrainians was not high on the priority list for law enforcement agencies of mid-s Moscow. Instead, you were more likely to see traders from the Caucasus, or what had been Soviet Central Asia stopped by police. Despite their Soviet passports, these ‘foreigners’ looked dferent and became easy targets — and not just for the police.Ukrainians don’t look dferent and, as you can hear from their president’s speeches, they don’t sound particularly dferent either.Russian troops will be coming up against people who in their minds look just like them, have very similar day-to-day lives and speak their language.Soldiers from Soviet Central Asia were used in sizable numbers when the Afghanistan invasion — or as Moscow called it, the ‘intervention’ — began in , but that policy changed swtly, in part due to fears the soldiers were fraternising with and getting too close to the enemy.For all the control Vladimir Putin has, the people speak openly, whether you’re a foreigner or not. You only have to open the door of a taxi and the driver will tell you everything that’s wrong with the world, especially Russia. I’d barely taken my seat on the way to Yekaterinburg airport when the Ford Fiesta driver launched into a tirade about how crazy it was that his city had managed to get to host games.He reeled off a whole host of reasons from the unpredictable weather, to the smog, the dirt and dozens of dferent sources of pollution in the area which made it about as unhealthy a place to stay, let alone play football.Not every city has a street called ‘Asbestos Lane’.While clearing out some old college junk recently, I came across a slip of paper with the name and address of a Russian who I shared accommodation with in Moscow in the late s.He swore rather than spoke Russian and had a Cockney accent after a stint in London with an Irish landlady.I’d forgotten his surname, so was delighted that I could make out his -year-old scrawl. I looked him up and got quite the shock to see him pictured on manoeuvres around Moscow as a high-ranking government official. I put off trying to track him down. Let’s face it, a western journalist contacting a Russian government official should probably go through certain channels, but I was still sure it could be done, some time.It looks like I’ll have to wait.Eoin Brannigan is editor-in-chief of Belfastand Sunday LeRelated topicsUkraineMost ReadBeautully finished Malone semi-detached is spacious and perfect for a modern familySam McBrideOpinionMystery about quiet hardening of the Irish Sea border – and who ordered itBaby Carrie: ‘Someone knows what happened, it’s not too late to do the right thing’Council refuses landlord licence for student house for first time in Belfast after complaints of anti-social behaviourGail WalkerOpinionAirbrushing of Trimble in US a reminder to unionists of their true place on island of IrelandTop Videos wearing flight suits in yellow and blue colours that match the Ukrainian flag \"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph news world-news bfb .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_cedcb-ddcd-fd-ade-bafdbf_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news world-news bfb .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_cedcb-ddcd-fd-ade-bafdbf_ w\" data-sizes\"auto\"   wearing flight suits in yellow and blue colours that match the Ukrainian flag \"PlayRussian cosmonauts wear Ukraine colours to International Space StationPlayVideo: Billy Connolly - Terrorist Attack At Glasgow AirportPlayVideo: Two-year-old Belfast girl shouts at her mum for laughing as she tries to sing a song from FrozenLatest WorldSurrogate babies wait out war in makesht bomb shelterMariupol art school used as bomb shelter destroyed in Russian attack, locals saySouth Korea’s new president to move office to central SeoulPrivate funeral held for cricketing legend Shane WarneIvan LittleOpinionMarina Ovsyannikova: Russian journalist’s on-air protest against war in Ukraine a brave moveLatestMarshland blaze at RSPB reserve extinguishedCelebrities join friends and family at funeral of Shane WarneSurrogate babies wait out war in makesht bomb shelterMariupol art school used as bomb shelter destroyed in Russian attack, locals saySouth Korea’s new president to move office to central Seoul,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

plans for a major walking trail which passes through Down District have received a pound, boost.A key component of the planned Columban Way is to develop ldquopilgrimage walking such as that found at Spainrsquos Camino de Santiago and at many other trails across Europe, with the trail highlighting Northern Irelandrsquos ancient heritage, including major Neolithic and early Christian sites along the way.It has been confirmed that a pound, grant has made available by the David Cross Foundation to produce a business case with costings to identy and develop the Columban Way from Dundrum to the Saint Patrickrsquos Centre in Downpatrick and from there to Comber by repurposing and upgrading sections of the former Ulster Way which was abandoned in the s.St Columbanus was one of the best-known of hundreds of Irish monks following in the footsteps of Saint Patrick in bringing Christianity, literacy and learning to Central and Northern Europe in the sixth century.Downpatrick councillor Cadogan Enright mdash who is an enthusiastic supporter of the new trail mdash said ii took St Columbanus  years to complete the journey from Bangor to Bobbio in Italy and he travelled more than , miles, mostly on foot.He is leading the local aspect of the project alongside Charlie Reid from Bangor, with both writing extensively on walks around Ireland and are committee members of Friends of Columbanus. They are supported by Duane Fitzsimons, from Ardglass, who is a walking trails expert.ldquoThe Columban Way forms part of the wider European lsquoVia Columbanirsquo heritage trail supported and promoted by the Council of Europe. It traces the route from Mount Leinster to Bangor through eight European countries to Bobbio in Italy, explained Cllr Enright.ldquoIt is instructive to see how rapidly other countries have rolled out sections of the trail since  and the th anniversary of Columbanus. Switzerland, Italy, France, Germany and the Low Countries have demonstrated the ability to deliver that we can learn from locally.Cllr Enright praised the support of Ards and North Down Council which has already delivered  miles of walk as far south as Comber.ldquoThis -mile section of trail is designed to encourage more people to learn about the history of North Down and Ards, including the impact the area had in a European context through the links with Columbanus, he explained.ldquoOur big challenge will be to engage with Newry Mourne and Down Council to deal with their huge gaps in the Saint Patrickrsquos and Ulster Ways.

But that could be about to change.Last year, the estimated repair bill for the clock, whose interior mechanism was removed over three decades ago and placed in storage, was in the region of pound,.Many are concerned to see the historic landmark falling into continued disrepair, but hopeful that it can be restored to be enjoyed for generations to come, reinforcing its connection with the villagersquos industrial past.Shrigley was founded by the Martin family, who came from Pott Shrigley in Cheshire in  and who owned the spinning factory in the village.The factory was powered by water supplied from the nearby Clea Lough and while the mill mdash which is reported to have employed  people at one time mdash has long gone, the clock tower erected by the people of Shrigley in  in honour of the Martin family remains.Now there is fresh hope that it can be restored to its former glory.Strangford MLAs Michelle McIlveen and Harry Harvey, who have been campaigning for the clockrsquos restoration, are also hopeful that progress can be made.Welcoming the recent developments, they hope plans to acquire the clock and restore it to its former glory will prove successful.The MLAs said Housing Executive chief executive Grainia Long made it clear last year that the huge cost of repairing the historic clock was something the organisation was not willing to meet at the time.The housing chief said at a time when it was experiencing a signicant funding shortfall for investment in tenantsrsquo homes, it was not be appropriate to use income derived from rents to fund the considerable costs that would be required to undertake a full restoration of the Shrigley clock.Ms McIlveen and Mr Harvey then raised the issue with Stormont communities minister Deirdre Hargey, who has overall responsibility for the Historical Environment Division.They detailed the clockrsquos history and its local signicance, explaining that it is one of the last remaining pieces of Victorian architecture in Shrigley.The MLAs said it was ldquounacceptable that an old clock of such important signicance and splendour should be allowed to fall into such a sad state of disrepair.ldquoWe urged the communities minister to take the necessary steps to prevent this important listed monument from further deterioration and urged her to consider a partnership approach with ious interested bodies, explained Ms McIlveen.ldquoI am pleased that the Housing Executive is now in discussions with an interested local party regarding a proposed feasibility study to consider options and prepare design concepts for the area that would involve the acquisition and restoration of the historic monument.Ms McIlveen said discussions are ongoing and that she and Mr Harvey have made clear to the government department and Housing Executive their desire that these discussions should be centred on the interests of the Shirley community, with the outcome safeguarding the future of the cherished monument..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"Council set to review museum joint curator restructure role  ","story":"THE controversial decision to restructure the districtrsquos museum services is to be reviewed.Newry, Mourne and Down Councilrsquos decision to appoint a joint curator to oversee museum services in Downpatrick and Newry mdash which was taken without consulting local councillors mdash is to be reviewed by the local authorityrsquos Audit Committee.The newly appointed curator will be based in Newry, a move which has angered a number of councillors and highly respected organisations, including the Friends of the Down County Museum.Council officials have been accused of downgrading the status of the Downpatrick museum with stinging criticism continuing of the decision to have one curator in charge of the local authorityrsquos two museums.Council officials insist they are ldquofully committed to the continuous improvement and development of both museums and that updated staffing structures for both ldquoprovides an unparalleled opportunity to build in this work.The restructuring process has been referred to the Audit Committee by Downpatrick councillor Gareth Sharvin, who is disappointed that despite signicant opposition to the move, the new joint curator is already in post.He wants the process which led to the councilrsquos decision to be reviewed, with the referral coming on the back of an update on the new staffing structure recently provided in secret to members of the local authorityrsquos Strategy, Policy and Resources Committee.Cllr Sharvin said while the press and public were prevented from hearing the update, he understands that the new curator will be based in Newry and shared across both museum sites.He continued: ldquoThe new staff structure is seen as an activity under the so-called scheme of delegation that enables the councilrsquos senior management team to conduct the change without the need to consult or inform any stakeholders in the process.ldquoThe new staff structure is currently being implemented and cannot be subject to change, as the roles have been offered out. We are told this is an operational matter that councillors are not involved in.Cllr Sharvin says he is disappointed to have to confirm that the new staff structure will be implemented at Down County Museum, which means it will have no permanent curator in the building.ldquoGiven the lack of information around the new roles and how the existing complement of skills are being integrated into the new museum structure, it can only raise concern as no one outside the senior management team have the information and understanding of how the fantastic services provided in Downpatrick will continue to be offered and delivered, he continued.ldquoThe campaign by the Friends of the Museum and the many groups associated with the Down County Museum was very much focused on the skills needed to run the museum and offer the excellent experience many hundreds of thousands of people have enjoyed over the years.Cllr Sharvin insists that a strategic review should have been undertaken first to understand the vision for the museum services in the district, design a plan around that vision and identy the staffing structure needed to support it.ldquoWhat has happened in this case, is that the staff structure is being implemented and a strategic review being held afterwards. The strategic review could easily identy that a dferent staffing structure is needed as opposed to the one being implemented now, he continued.ldquoI want to see the Down County Museum grow in size, reputation and service offerings. When you research the top  museums in Northern Ireland on Which Museum, the Downpatrick museum is placed th compared to Newry which is st.ldquoSimilarly on TripAdvisor, the Downpatrick museum is listed th, with Newry in th place. This shows a clear dference in status for each museum and where the councilrsquos main museum asset is.Councillor Sharvin explained he has referred the museum process and procedure to the councilrsquos Audit Committee for a number of reasons, even though he accepts the review will have no signicance in relation to the staffing structure as that will continue.However, he said the move will ensure that ldquolessons are learnt for any future changes and the Downpatrick museum is protected and respected.Cllr Sharvin explained the role of the audit committee is to review internal procedures and that is what he has asked to be examined.ldquoThere is no clear one approach when it comes to restructuring in council and the review of the procedures undertaken in this case will help the organisation identy were gaps are, what risks have been identied and the improvements that need to be implemented, he said.Cllr Sharvin said he has asked for a timeline of the start and completion of the strategic review being implemented and how key stakeholders such as the Friends of the Museum will be consulted as part of the process.He added: ldquoThe strategic review is now the focus of the campaign to ensure that the Down County Museum is not downgraded in any way. I will be approaching the strategic review with the sense of growth in visitor numbers, educational outreach, advertising campaigns, collection and exhibition offerings and the wider service offerings..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"Dawn launches debut novel  ","story":"THE debut novel by a local childrenrsquos writer is already one of the top selling books in its age category on Amazon.Felicity Flipflops is the work of Dawn Gelston, a teacher living in Dubai but who has strong links with Drumaness and Teconnaught.She is the daughter of Paul and Maura Gelston and sister to Shona, Aisling, Janine and Paul.Aimed at children aged  to  years old, the book tells the story of mental well-being, adventure, and friendship by a young girl named Felicity.Dawn explained: ldquoAs teachers, we encourage children to believe in themselves and to work hard and dream big.

","story":"NEWRY, Mourne and Down Council has been urged to do all it can to quickly deliver Newcastlersquos new multi-million pound leisure complex.The appeal was issued by the local authorityrsquos chairwoman, Cathy Mason, following a recent meeting she had with senior council directors who provided her with a progress report.A detailed report on building the eagerly-awaited pound leisure centre is expected to be completed shortly, with senior council officials working with consultants to develop an outline business case which is designed to pave the way for construction work to start.The rear of the existing Newcastle Centre and the outdoor Tropicana swimming pool are to be bulldozed to make way for the new town centre leisure complex which will feature an indoor leisure pool which includes three  metre swimming lanes and a dedicated heated play pool for children.The new leisure facility will also feature an ultra-modern gymnasium and once demolition work has been completed, the new complex will be bolted on to the side of the existing centre.Redeveloping the existing Newcastle Centre has been ruled out due to the scale of the costs involved and itrsquos understood that the planned new-build will be larger than the current centre which is a listed building, posing major problems for the council in transforming it into an energy efficient facility which meets current building regulations and standards.Cllr Mason described confirmation of plans for new leisure facilities in Newcastle as ldquowelcome news and is delighted that the development plans are in the final stages of development.ldquoThese new local amenities will be of great benefit to local residents, their families and tourists alike, she said, confirming that the proposes new complex will feature a new leisure pool and state of the art gym facilities.ldquoFor too long, people of Newcastle have had to put up with these substandard facilities, the chairwoman continued. ldquoThe plans highlighted safety concerns with the old part of the building which is to be demolished as it simply isnrsquot fit for purpose.Cllr Mason said she hopes to see the finalised plans and formal site approval in the coming months so that contractors can start working on the project as soon as possible.ldquoIt is essential that the council moves in a timely manner to ensure this project comes to fruition so that Newcastle residents can access these new facilities as soon as possible, said the chairwoman.ldquoSinn Feacutein will continue to do all it can to ensure these much-needed leisure facilities are delivered and I will continue to stand up for rural families across South Down to deliver these essential services right in the heart of communities.Last week, formal planning approval to bulldoze the rear extension of the existing Newcastle Centre and the adjoining Tropicana swimming pool was agreed by the local authorityrsquos Planning Committee.Detailed work has already been carried out at the town centre site, including geotechnical surveys which examined ground conditions to provide architects and designers with key information ahead of construction work getting underway.While no detailed

club has been formed in Downpatrick.Known as Quoile Angling Club, the organisation is holding its inaugural meeting this Friday night at Murphyrsquos Bar in the town at pm, with an open invitation extended to anyone who would like to attend.The club was formed in response to the growing interest in course angling at the river and with coronavirus restrictions largely gone, anglers have joined forces to form the new club and aim to encourage greater involvement in angling, particularly for coarse fish in the lower reaches of the River Quoile.The picturesque river is home to rudd, roach, hybrids, bream, pike, and eels.The new club is hoping to run a few competitions and, in the future, provide coaching courses for young anglers.A key concern for the new club is addressing the current state of the fishery which runs from the below the Belfast Road bridge to the Steamboat quay.The aim is to engage with a raft of statutory agencies to raise the profile of the river and its angling potential, alongside improved access for anglers and visitors.While there has been signicant investment over recent years and additional upgrades in the pipeline, the anglers will hope this paves the way for greater emphasis on the Quoile area as a recreational and tourism asset.Anglers say the Quoile basin is a designated nature reserve and, as such, there are ious regulations which govern its usage, with those who fish along its banks keen to maintain the waterwayrsquos biological ersity and general appearance, ensuring it is an asset everyone can enjoy.At the clubrsquos inaugural meeting this Friday evening, members will adopt a constitution and select a new management committee.

He was inch-perfect through the morningrsquos slippery conditions, quickly building up a sizeable advantage and catching his rivals on the hop.This continued his fine form after the local driver also won the opening stages.In the space of two stages, he had amassed a lead of more than  seconds ndash a huge margin on the single venue event.From there, he managed his lead and with the sun shining, Greer powered home in his Citroen C to eventually win by . seconds and claim another maximum points haul in his bid for this yearrsquos championship spoils.ldquoIt was a brilliant day, said Greer.ldquoThe car was faultless and was really well suited to the event. We kept it clean and everything went to plan.In the battle for second overall, Derek McGarrity and Graham Henderson held an early second in their Skoda until a stage two overshoot cost them around ten seconds.Aaron McLaughlin and Darren Curran also hit trouble with a puncture and a broken rim, while Darren Gass and Sam Hutchinson were already out of contention after they spun and stalled on stage one.That left McGarrity and McLaughlin battling for the runner-up spot. McLaughlin quickly recovered from his puncture and moved into second after stage three. McGarrity tried hard to fight back but in the drying conditions, McLaughlin had the edge in his Fiesta WRC.He was really enjoying himself and an attempt to secure the fastest time on the final stage saw him come to within one-tenth of a second of rally winner Greer.ldquoHersquos a machine, said McLaughlin.ldquoI was really hoping for a fastest stage time. I just wish we had started the day as good as we finished it.Derek McGarrity and Graham Henderson had to be content with third overall in their Skoda. Their stage two overshoot potentially cost them a position but they still secured an armful of points for their McGrady Insurance NI Championship campaign.ldquoIt was a silly mistake on the second stage, said McGarrity.ldquoThen we had a small misfire on the last stage but it is what it is.Joe McGonigle and Ciaran Geaney clipped a bale and damaged the front wing of their Fiesta on stage two but they survived to tell the tale.Seventh after the test, they climbed back up the order to secure fourth overall ahead of Joe and Ashleen Hegarty, who were lucky to escape a high-speed spin on stage four.ldquoWe were using new tyres and the car broke away from me at high speed, explained Hegarty.ldquoWe went over a few trackside tyres and ended up on the grass.Darren Gass and Sam Hutchinson would have been in the mix too but they took a wrong route on stage five and were handed a stage maximum. Instead, Michael McGarrity and Damien Garvey were overjoyed to claim sixth overall in their Fiesta.They lost time when a boost pipe came adrt and also struggled with some brakingissues during the closing miles but were full of smiles at the finish.Also in a Fiesta, David Kelly and Dean OrsquoSullivan finished seventh ahead of Mark Massey and Alistair Wyllie.Massey was lucky to escape with some superficial bodywork damage after a stage five altercation with some trackside stage furniture so a top eight finish was a good result for the crew.Emma McKinstry and Kenny Hull lost time with some intercom issues but finished ninth while Robert Erwin and Andrew Wilson completed the top ten and secured the two-wheel-drive honours in the process.In the two-wheel-drive category, a titanic battle developed between a number of crews. James and Heather Kennedy were quickest out of the blocks, closely followed by Andrew White and Paul Hughes.Then White lost ground with an overshoot, leaving Kennedy to fend off a challenge from Robert Erwin and Andrew Wilson.As the track conditions improved, Erwin started to pile the pressure on the Kennedys who were suffering with a down-on-power engine.The chasing Toyota MR crew moved in front after the fth test and another strong run over the final stage sealed the category win as well as tenth overall.James and Heather Kennedy had to settle for second on this occasion as well as th overall, with Matthew McGaffin and Ryan Lowry coming home third in class.The McGrady Insurance NI Rally Championship now has a two-month break before the Maiden City Stages on May .In the interim period, a rally social night is being held at the Millbrook Lodge Hotel on Friday, March .

In  it was decided to move both date and venue to have the best chance of fitting in with Covid- restrictions.While the event at Bishopscourt Racing Circuit last June was well received, many were glad to see the race brought back to its origins as a road race taking in the iconic sites of East Downrsquos home town.Months of planning go into a race and this year was no exception. The EDAC race committee had an A and B routes on file in case of flooding on the Quoile towpath.They had worked with and through Covid- restrictions, secured road licences and Athletics NI permits, and employed professionals for timing, first aid and traffic management among others.The club rallied members and friends of the club to marshal the roads, man the water station and prepare the post race food tables.The race committee were out at am on Sunday to finalise the cones and signage when news broke that a fallen tree had brought down a power line directly impacting the planned route.East Down AC volunteers were straight into action. They were at the scene in minutes and had even a tree surgeon on speed dial, but they could not gain access.They were determined not to cancel and set about re-routing the race. This is not as simple as it may seem. With a traffic management plan to take into account and new sections to measure as well as the clock ticking, there was a lot of pressure.The wind and rain didnrsquot help and mindful of the wellbeing of runners, a delayed start was not even considered.With some sharp thinking and speedy manoeuvres a new route was hurriedly drawn up.Having advised the athletes that it was no longer a measured K, the start team herded them on to the start line in Ballydugan Estate and the hooter went only a minute or two behind schedule.With a huge sigh of relief Mags Mathieson, the official starter, waved the  strong crowd on their way. Thankfully everything  went to plan and post race comments have been nothing but positive from those who took part.There was high praise for the volunteers along the route, who cheered, clapped and gave out water. It was not the race that East Down AC had planned but with  fresh in our memories, most were simply glad that they got the chance to run.With all that had gone on pre-race there was barely time to consider who the winner might be, but there was a wave of excitement when Neil McCartan of East Down appeared in the home straight and crossed the line  seconds ahead of Owen Carleton of Annadale Striders.This was a bucket list moment for Neil as he is a longtime club member and he ran well to achieve it.It tops off a great season so far and leaves him primed for the track season which is his first love. When Aaron McGrady, also EDAC, was third, the stress of the morning was washed away in the joy of having two members on the podium.Mal McGrady of M.B. McGrady and Co Chartered Accountants presented Neil with the Jimmy Murray Memorial Shield at the finish line and the top three received cash prizes.The ladiesrsquo race was almost pre-determined when Emma Mitchell ndash the current , metre track championndash decided to throw her hat in the ring.However, given that she has been targeting half marathon timesand that the pandemic has played havoc with both racing and training, it is hard to gauge where iniduals are form wise.In the end she had a clear win finishing in . with Sinead Murtagh of Newcastle and District AC taking second place in ..Eimear McCracken of City of Lisburn came third in . to complete the podium.Emma was presented with the Joe Quinn Perpetual Trophy for first female and she took the time to say that she was delighted to support the magnicent Jimmyrsquos Ten and that the hospitality from the host club was first class.From an athlete who has raced at top level all over the world, it was praise indeed.Two shields are presented for club teams in the K and this year Newcastle and District took the honours in the menrsquos race and East Down AC retained the ladiesrsquo title.It is based on the top four men and the top three women home. There is also a relay event where two people split the K with one runner starting on the line and then passing over a wristband at the changeover point.Their team-mate then heads home to record a joint time. Ollie Robinson and Jacob Crawfordwere the quickest all male team.Holly Scott and Willow Farrington of Scrabo took the all female prize and the mixed title went to mother and son duo Maureen Kelly and James Wright .With the podiums decided the spectators turned their attention to looking for friends and family.The race is a highlight for local runners, many of whom do not belong to a club. This does not mean that they are not well able and plenty of fast times were recorded as the runners flooded in.Some were running to test their pace, some to seethey could run the distance with no speed in mind, others were raising funds or dedicating their run to causes.In short, there were all sorts of reasons and all sorts of runners but they were united in their efforts and the thrill of crossing a line to cheers.The fact that they were then brought to tables laden with food was a big surprise as for so long hospitality has been withdrawn, but with restrictions eased and a bit of careful planning the hosts were able to entertain their guests outside.Even the weather played ball by that stage as the rain had stopped and there were shreds of sunlight to lt the atmosphere.Jimmyrsquos Ten is always a memorable event but the  event will definitely be lodged in peoplersquos minds as the race that went ahead against all odds.EDAC would like to pay tribute to their full list of sponsors McMahon People Solutions, PCG Fitness, MC Dental Laboratories, Duffyrsquos Killough, JS Flooring, Murdock Brothers , P. Gardiner Carpets, Bells Supervalu Crossgar, McDonalds Downpatrick, Gordons Chemists, Plusprint, Wrap and Roll, McVeigh Traffic Management, Soaring Productions and main sponsor M.B. McGrady and Co Chartered Accountants. The financial backing is what makes this race an event.Thanks are also due to the members and even more so to those who are simply friends of the club, who give up their time to make the race happen. The hard graft that they put in cannot be underestimated.Finally, last but not least, there is heartfelt gratitude towards every single runner who signed up.Without runners there is no race. The smiles of the finishers and the kind words of support post race make all the hard work worthwhile. Well done and see you all next year..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"Kilmore overrun Grove in league  ","story":"KILMORE Rec kept their promotion hopes on track with an impressive one-sided victory over a physical Grove United outfit at Robert Adams Park on Saturday.An early penalty kick converted by Anton McGrattan and two further second half goals from Eoin McGrattan and Joe McKinney was enough to see The Blues home and dry in bitterly cold yet sunny conditions.The Blues came firing out of the traps from the first whistle with Kilmore striker Joe McKinney the first to try his luck within the opening minutes, although his effort trickled harmlessly into the gloves of Grove number one Michael Davidson.However, it wouldnrsquot be long until the home side opened their account and after six minutes they were awarded the opportunity to do just that.Following a long ball over the top, Kilmore midfielder Eoin McGrattan spun his marker before he was clumsily clattered from behind inside the danger area.The referee had no hesitation in awarding the penalty kick, which Anton McGrattan dispatched confidently by drilling his effort low and hard to the bottom left corner beyond the reach of Davidson.The Bluesrsquo good start continued as they relentlessly pressed the opposition and didnrsquot allow Grove out of their own half.McKinney danced his way past three opposing defenders before his opportunity at goal was thwarted by a wonderfully timed last ditch tackle from Grove defender David McCallen.This wouldnrsquot deter the ever-dangerous Kilmore marksman, who continued to be a thorn in the side of his United counterparts when he battled to win back the ball before laying off team-mate Patrick Grant for a shot at goal.Grantrsquos effort did swing wide of the post but it was an encouraging sign for the Kilmore team, who clearly had their tails up.Man of the match, Barry Walsh, was enjoying the freedom of the middle of the park, as the Kilmore newcomer flung himself into every tackle necessary in order to gain possession for The Blues.Grove were very much stuck in first gear and were being overran in essentially every area of the park. Kilmore were dealt a blow when Grant came off second best in a crunching tackle with Grove defender Adam McKnight, leading to The Bluesrsquo defender to be substituted on  minutes.However, the silver lining for the hosts came in the form of substitute Joshua Smyth, who made an immediate impact when he entered the fray.Smyth quickly gained possession and whipped in a fast-paced cross to the head of incoming team-mate John McCarthy, whose effort was stunningly saved from point blank range by the reaction of Davidson in the Grove goals.This garnered applause from the sizeable home crowd, who had turned out to support their local side.With half an hour played, Kilmore looked to inflict further damage and almost did so following an eye-catching move which was unfortunate not to double the deficit.Smyth was yet again involved as he played a delicate one-two with the back heel of McKinney before his pass inside to the chest of Eoin McGrattan allowed the midfielder to find team-mate Michael Carvill unmarked at the edge of the box.Carvill unleashed an effort towards goal but it was smartly stopped yet again by Grove custodian Davidson, who was quickly becoming his sidersquos top performer.Any hint of a counterattack from the visitors was quickly dealt with by the confident backline of Christopher Magee, Gary Kennedy and captain Jack Larkin, with Magee in particular winning his inidual battle with Grove striker Jake Long time after time.With less than ten minutes to the interval, Carvill played a short free-kick to McCarthy, who swtly passed to Kennedy  yards from goal.After examining his options, the Kilmore defender decided to take a touch forward before firing a long ranged effort with conviction which ultimately crashed onto the post before falling to the feet of skipper Larkin.The Kilmore captain turned his rebound over the bar although his blushes were saved by the offside flag.Despite Grove proving they were a physically strong side ndash as they never shied away from a tackle ndash they failed to garner any substantial chance throughout the opening  minutes.The half ended with Grove midfielder David Johnston picking up a yellow card for a late challenge on Anton McGrattan.The first real opportunity of the second half fell to Kilmorersquos Walsh, who after a pinball of passes, saw his effort from the edge of the box saved.However, just two minutes later and The Blues would double their scoring tally after marksman McKinney latched on to a long ball before squaring his pass to team-mate Eoin McGrattan for an easy tap in.To their credit, Grove were certainly showing more of a presence in the opposing final third, although they were lacking the end product required to trouble the hosts.Kilmore continued to cause problems and goal-scorer Eoin McGrattan almost added another when he once again showed his marker a clean pair of heels and barrelled down on goal.This time his effort struck the side netting as Grove momentarily escaped conceding a third.The home side refused to settle for just two goals and were almost granted a third when McKinneyrsquos whizzing pass across the box marginally escaped the boot of the onrushing McCarthy.Grove managed to manufacture a seldom chance when captain Michael McNerlin struck a first time volley from  yards which required Kilmore lsquokeeper Christopher Turley to spring into action and tip the ball over the crossbar.However, this seemed to ignite the Kilmore flame further and with  minutes to go they registered their third, courtesy of a surging Walsh run which ended in a pass to McKinney inside the box.The Kilmore striker kept his cool and confidently placed his right footed effort into the net to drown out any chance of a dramatic comeback.Eoin McGrattan made way for substitute John Patterson, who almost added to the scoreline when once again McKinney was allowed to play a pass across goal.However, the substitute fluffed his lines and sent his effort over the bar in what was an escape for the now weathered looking Grove outfit.The visitors were gted a consolation goal in the th minute, after substitute David Long was adjudged to be fouled in the area by Kilmore captain Larkin.Grove midfielder Johnston confidently tucked his effort into the top right corner but seconds later the final whistle sounded.Following the match Kilmore goal-scorer, Anton McGrattan, gave his thoughts on his sidersquos performance.ldquoI thought we controlled the game, he said.ldquoWe could have gotten two or three goals before half-time but we didnrsquot panic.ldquoWe will just take it one game at a time now, we had a setback against Dromara Village a couple of weeks ago but we have now won two on the bounce.He added: ldquoThere is a massive week ahead, we travel to Rosario for a big three points.Kilmore Rec: C Turley, C Magee, P Grant, J Larkin , G Kennedy, B Walsh, J McCarthy, A McGrattan, J McKinney, M Carvill, E McGrattan.Subs: J Patterson, J Smyth, C

This is history that we have actually been living and working through which has been good to have been part of that.

Mr Biden has never been shy about his passion for Ireland, its history and its literature.References to Irish poets pepper many of his speeches, with Mr Biden choosing to namecheck the late Eavan Boland during a speech at the Ireland Funds Gala dinner in Washington on Wednesday evening.It was at the same event that the taoiseach was notied of the positive Covid- result just as he was due to speak.Mr Martin appeared in good spirits during his appearance on-screen.An Irish government spokesperson said earlier yesterday that the taoiseach was “feeling well”.Micheal MartinIrelandUkraine  \"       \"  Get the latest news on the CoronavirusWe have launched a daily public interest bulletin to deliver all the updates and vital information to your inboxSign Up  Most PopularNorthern Ireland school teacher Anna Leitch makes history at Miss World final in Puerto RicoSinn Fein will push for border poll unless DUP wins in May election, says Jeffrey DonaldsonMothers Day : When is Mother’s Day  Why is the date dferent in the UK and why does it change every year Joe Biden tells St Patrick’s Day gathering: I may be Irish but I’m not stupidNorthern Ireland Hate Crime Bill: End of private dwelling legal defence could lead to ‘Big Brother’ in NI living rooms looking for ‘hate speech’ say criticsMost PopularAldi’s sell-out pet sofa is back for  - how to buy, and the best alternative pet sofas UKNI Running prodigy Emer McKee sets new world record at -yearsBest hampers for Mother’s Day including food, drink and flower basketsLEGO launch new Back to the Future DeLorean set with Marty and Doc figures for Retinol: what is retinol, does it work, can it improve wrinkles- which are the best retinol serums UK                         This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us on    ExploreNewsSportIrish League FootballWhats OnLestyleFarming LeMore from the News LetterAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryNewspaper ArchiveUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter \" fill\"#ea\"  ©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-fbyfCU sc-GEbAx ueSoA gsnYBQ\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policyModern Slavery Statement  News you can trust since Sign in   \"    Welcome backEdit Account-Sign OutSubscribeNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessFarmingEducationHealthOpinionPeopleRead ThisUkraine CrisisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      SportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportOpinionWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoNightleRetroLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      LestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensPuzzlese-PaperMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessRecommended\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      RecommendedEntertainmentTechnologyLestyleHome and GardenFashion and BeautyDealsPublic NoticesContact UsFree Happy AdsFollow us       \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityThe independent report, published by campaign group Keep Wales Tidy, is described as the first report of its kind since the start of the COVID- pandemic.  It recorded , littered face masks during the period and it said PPE litter, which was included in street cleanliness surveys for the first time, was present in eight per cent of streets. The ‘How Clean Are Our Streets’ report brings together results from thousands of street cleanliness surveys and is intended to give a ‘snapshot’ of litter and other environmental quality issues.  It only covers streets and doesn’t include parks and green spaces. The report found litter related to smoking is the most common type, found on . per cent of streets. While the report outlines the continued challenge of litter, and its prevalence across the nation, it also reported that recorded dog fouling is at its lowest level since street cleanliness surveys began in - and was present on just eight per cent of streets. Litter from confectionery, including sweet wrappers and crisp packets, was found on nearly half of streets and drinks litter remained at pre-pandemic levels and was found on  per cent of streets. Keep Wales Tidy has highlighted the results as supporting its calls for the implementation of Extended Producer Responsibilityin the UK which would place new duties on packaging producers to pay for the treatment or disposal of their goods. The charity, and other environmental groups, believe that would encourage producers to reduce waste and promote more sustainable product design as, it says, is in the case in many European countries. Keep Wales Tidy chief executive Lesley Jones said a public consultation has demonstrated support for such a scheme:  “The prevalence of littered packaging across Wales further strengthens the case for EPR. The responsibility for tackling litter does not rest solely with local authorities and the financial burden on the public purse must be reduced.” .removeWelsh Government deputy climate change minister Lee Water said it agrees with the principles of extended producer responsibility and will make an announcement in “due course”. The street surveys cover a six per cent sample of streets, selected at random, from full lists of adopted highways provided by each local authority.This article originally appeared on our sister site The National. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log Share s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"  CommentsComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communitySwiss public broadcaster SRF reported that Mr Zelensky, who spoke via livestream on Saturday to thousands of antiwar protesters in the Swiss city of Bern, said: “in your banks are the funds of the people who unleashed this war. Help to fight this. So that their funds are frozen.It would be good to take away those privileges from them.”The Ukrainian president also criticised the Swiss multinational food conglomerate Nestle, which has decided not to withdraw from Russia for the time being as opposed to many other international companies.Mr Zelensky’s speech was dubbed into German. When he called for the blocking of oligarchs’ accounts, great applause erupted.The Ukrainian leader has also said the siege of Mariupol will go down in history for war crimes committed by Russian troops.Those forces have advanced deeper into Ukraine’s besieged and battered port city, with heavy fighting shutting down a major steel plant there.The fall of Mariupol, the scene of some of the war’s worst suffering, would mark a major battlefield advance for the Russians, who are largely bogged down outside major cities more than three weeks into the invasion. vw,vw,px, px\"Local residents carry water from a food warehouse on the outskirts of Mariupol has seen some of the invasion’s worst suffering Evacuations from Mariupol and other cities proceeded along eight of  humanitarian corridors on Saturday.

The party is led by Viktor Medvedchuk, who has friendly ties with Russian President Vladimir Putin, who is the godfather of Mr Medvedchuk’s daughter..removeAlso on the list is the Nashiparty led by Yevheniy Murayev. Before the Russian invasion, British authorities warned that Russia wanted to install Mr Murayev as the leader of Ukraine.Mr Zelensky said that “given a large-scale war unleashed by the Russian Federation and links between it and some political structures, the activities of a number of political parties is suspended for the period of the martial law”.He added that “activities by politicians aimed at discord and collaboration will not succeed”.The announcement follows the introduction of the martial law that envisages a ban on parties associated with Russia..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagagaga, title: Volodymyr Zelensky calls on Switzerland to freeze bank accounts of all oligarchs article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log Share s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"  CommentsComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

Exhibitors will include Flood Marine, McAlinden Boats, Swim Ireland, Royal Yacht Association to name but a few, and it will be packed full of activities from fun and interactive workshops, to on the water demonstrations and experiences.“We’ve hosted successful events for over  years now, including the Ireland Angling Show in Dublin, so we honestly believe that the increasing passion and interest in marine leisure over recent years calls for a bigger and better show.“For those interested in perfecting their techniques or learning about new products, the show will feature talks from a range of experts in all areas of the marine leisure sector, while also giving guests the opportunity to chat to professionals and visit our exhibitor stands.“We are also delighted to have the support of Lisburn Castlereagh City Council who recognise the enormous potential of Northern Ireland in providing these kinds of homegrown holiday activities.“This is a very lucrative market for everyone in the wider tourism industry and from this exhibition alone we estimate that around £, will go into the local economy. Northern Ireland has so much to offer with quality accommodation and catering, superb activity facilities and of course unparalleled access to water be it lakes, rivers or coast, said Hugh.”Officiating at the event launch and welcoming it to the city, Alderman Amanda Grehan, Chair of Lisburn  Castlereagh City Council’s Development Committee, said that this is exactly the kind of event to show off the versatility of their tourism offering.“Eikon Exhibition Centre which is conveniently located beside the main arterial routes to Belfast and Dublin is now a signicant centre for International events being held in Ireland and the United Kingdom. It will draw in thousands of visitors and millions of pounds in consumer spend and sectoral investment.“Supporting events like this is a core part of our economic strategy for the council area demonstrating that we are also a critical economic generator benefiting the whole of Northern Ireland.“The countdown has now started, and I look forward to visiting Ireland on the Water Expo next year. It will be a true partnership across the marine, tourism, accommodation and hospitality sectors,” said Alderman Grehan.Details on further activities will be announced over the coming months and you can check out our website www.irelandonthewaterexpo.ie or follow us on social media @IrelandonthewaterexpoIf you would like to know more about the Expo please contact us here, email [email#protected] or telephone Grace Mc Dermot, Mara Media Sales Manager, on +  .Northern Ireland  \"       \"   for the newsletterKeep up with the latest news and views from NorthernIrelandWorldSign Up       \" d\"M.,.c-.-.-.-.-.-.c-.-.-.-.,-.c.-.,.-.,.,l.-. c.,.,.,.,.,c.-.,.-.,-.L,.c.,.,.,.,,.C.,.,.,.,.,.\"   \" d\"M,.c.,.,.,.,.,.c.,.,.,.,,.c-.,.-.,.-.,l-.,. c-.-.-.-.-.,c-.,.-.,.,,.L.,c-.-.-.-.,-.C.,.,.,.,,.\"   \" d\"M.,c.,,.,.,.,.c,.-.,.-.,.S,.,,.C,.,.,,.,\"    ]]Most PopularEmergency services tasked after swimmer rescued from Lough N...NewsAppeal: Dungannon teenager missing since Tuesday...NewsSeven people injured following three-vehicle crash near Magh...NewsPortadown World War Two hero Jim MacLeod originally from Gla...NewsProposed marina slipway charge could be rolled out across Mi...NewsMost Popular                       This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us on    ExploreNewsSportWhats OnLestyleYour Northern IrelandRecommendedMore from Northern Ireland WorldAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoNewspaper ArchiveUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessArchiveSubscribeEventsPlace your AdReaders Charter \" fill\"#ea\"  ©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-fbyfCU sc-GEbAx ueSoA gsnYBQ\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policyModern Slavery Statement       \" d\"M.,.c-.-.-.-.-.-.c-.-.-.-.,-.c.-.,.-.,.,l.-. c.,.,.,.,.,c.-.,.-.,-.L,.c.,.,.,.,,.C.,.,.,.,.,.\"   \" d\"M,.c.,.,.,.,.,.c.,.,.,.,,.c-.,.-.,.-.,l-.,. c-.-.-.-.-.,c-.,.-.,.,,.L.,c-.-.-.-.,-.C.,.,.,.,,.\"   \" d\"M.,c.,,.,.,.,.c,.-.,.-.,.S,.,,.C,.,.,,.,\"    Sign in   \"    Welcome backEdit Account-Sign OutNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      NewsCoronavirusTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsHealthBusinessEducationEnvironmentPeopleRead ThisUkraine CrisisFootball\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      FootballIrish League FootballSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      SportMotorcyclingIce HockeyOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      LestyleFood and DrinkTravelHomes and GardensCarsFamilyRetroOpinionYour NI\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      Your NI​Antrim and NewtownabbeyArmagh Banbridge and CraigavonBelfastCauseway Coast and GlensLondonderry Derry City and StrabaneLisburn and CastlereaghMid and East AntrimMid UlsterFermanagh and OmaghNewry Mourne and DownArds and North DownMust ReadContact usAdvertise My BusinessFollow us           \" d\"M.,.c-.-.-.-.-.-.c-.-.-.-.,-.c.-.,.-.,.,l.-. c.,.,.,.,.,c.-.,.-.,-.L,.c.,.,.,.,,.C.,.,.,.,.,.\"   \" d\"M,.c.,.,.,.,.,.c.,.,.,.,,.c-.,.-.,.-.,l-.,. c-.-.-.-.-.,c-.,.-.,.,,.L.,c-.-.-.-.,-.C.,.,.,.,,.\"   \" d\"M.,c.,,.,.,.,.c,.-.,.-.,.S,.,,.C,.,.,,.,\"     \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily NorthernIrelandWorld Today newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

Jesus said: “...you do good to those who are good to you what credit is that” – St. Luke :. Surely Jesus wants us to do good to those who can pay us back. In his Epistle letter James : St. James says: “... be doers of the word and not merely hearers.” So, whether we pay for someone’s few items in the supermarket or a cup of coffee for a homeless person or volunteer at a charity shop or any one of a number of good deeds, our motivation should be, we are doing it for the Lord Jesus. It doesn’t matterwe are thanked or not, but it does matter that we show Him to the world. The best sermon anyone can preach is the le you live. St. Francis of old said: “Preach the Gospel,necessary use words.” May we seize every opportunity to care for and do something for people so that they may see Jesus in all we can do. We do good not to get ourselves noticed, but to put the spotlight on Jesus. In this season of Lent instead of “giving something up”, do something good to help others.As St. Paul, one of God’s greatest servants said in  Corinthians : “...God loves a cheerful giver”! May you and I give cheerfully of our time, love, support or whatever we can give to help one another on the journey of le.God go with you and may you go with God.Read More Read MoreExtra Covid- booster for over s and those at high riskJesus  \"       \"   for the newsletterKeep up with the latest news and views from NorthernIrelandWorldSign Up       \" d\"M.,.c-.-.-.-.-.-.c-.-.-.-.,-.c.-.,.-.,.,l.-. c.,.,.,.,.,c.-.,.-.,-.L,.c.,.,.,.,,.C.,.,.,.,.,.\"   \" d\"M,.c.,.,.,.,.,.c.,.,.,.,,.c-.,.-.,.-.,l-.,. c-.-.-.-.-.,c-.,.-.,.,,.L.,c-.-.-.-.,-.C.,.,.,.,,.\"   \" d\"M.,c.,,.,.,.,.c,.-.,.-.,.S,.,,.C,.,.,,.,\"    ]]Most PopularEmergency services tasked after swimmer rescued from Lough N...NewsAppeal: Dungannon teenager missing since Tuesday...NewsSeven people injured following three-vehicle crash near Magh...NewsPortadown World War Two hero Jim MacLeod originally from Gla...NewsProposed marina slipway charge could be rolled out across Mi...NewsMost Popular                       This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us on    ExploreNewsSportWhats OnLestyleYour Northern IrelandRecommendedMore from Northern Ireland WorldAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoNewspaper ArchiveUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessArchiveSubscribeEventsPlace your AdReaders Charter \" fill\"#ea\"  ©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-fbyfCU sc-GEbAx ueSoA gsnYBQ\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policyModern Slavery Statement       \" d\"M.,.c-.-.-.-.-.-.c-.-.-.-.,-.c.-.,.-.,.,l.-. c.,.,.,.,.,c.-.,.-.,-.L,.c.,.,.,.,,.C.,.,.,.,.,.\"   \" d\"M,.c.,.,.,.,.,.c.,.,.,.,,.c-.,.-.,.-.,l-.,. c-.-.-.-.-.,c-.,.-.,.,,.L.,c-.-.-.-.,-.C.,.,.,.,,.\"   \" d\"M.,c.,,.,.,.,.c,.-.,.-.,.S,.,,.C,.,.,,.,\"    Sign in   \"    Welcome backEdit Account-Sign OutNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      NewsCoronavirusTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsHealthBusinessEducationEnvironmentPeopleRead ThisUkraine CrisisFootball\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      FootballIrish League FootballSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      SportMotorcyclingIce HockeyOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      LestyleFood and DrinkTravelHomes and GardensCarsFamilyRetroOpinionYour NI\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      Your NI​Antrim and NewtownabbeyArmagh Banbridge and CraigavonBelfastCauseway Coast and GlensLondonderry Derry City and StrabaneLisburn and CastlereaghMid and East AntrimMid UlsterFermanagh and OmaghNewry Mourne and DownArds and North DownMust ReadContact usAdvertise My BusinessFollow us           \" d\"M.,.c-.-.-.-.-.-.c-.-.-.-.,-.c.-.,.-.,.,l.-. c.,.,.,.,.,c.-.,.-.,-.L,.c.,.,.,.,,.C.,.,.,.,.,.\"   \" d\"M,.c.,.,.,.,.,.c.,.,.,.,,.c-.,.-.,.-.,l-.,. c-.-.-.-.-.,c-.,.-.,.,,.L.,c-.-.-.-.,-.C.,.,.,.,,.\"   \" d\"M.,c.,,.,.,.,.c,.-.,.-.,.S,.,,.C,.,.,,.,\"     \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily NorthernIrelandWorld Today newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

The pay offer would mean another real terms pay cut and comes after eleven years of pay freezes.”However Armagh, Banbridge and Craigavon Council and the Education Authority said annual pay increases are negotiated nationally and not at local level.Unite says: “The union is seeking localised settlements to deliver improved pay despite the other two signatory unions in the bargaining processes of the ‘Green Book’ NJC having agreed the .% pay offer. Unite is seeking locally-agreed improvements through raising pay grades, reduced working hours, more paid holidays and other benefits.“Council workers, Education workers and Housing Executive workers in Northern Ireland have watched their pay stagnate over the last decade meaning real terms falls in their standards of living of  percent over the period and this is set to get worse. The NJC pay offer of a bare . percent increase is actually a real terms pay cut of more than seven percent set against a . percent hike in national insurance and surging inflation .Unite General Secretary Sharon Graham commended her members in local authorities in Northern Ireland on their determination to win a cost of living pay increase, saying:“I want to congratulate my members working in local authorities in Northern Ireland for the strength of their ballot for strike action they have the full backing of my union in their strike action.“The employers must now respond by tabling a pay deal in line with our members’ expectations and to meet punishing living costs. Unite is determined to see real improvements won by local authority workers in Northern Ireland.”Lead Regional Officer for local authorities, Gareth Scott, called on management to negotiate and highlighted the strength of feeling among his members. “These ballots confirm the determination of Unite members in local authorities to secure a decent cost of living increase. The majorities in favour of strike action in councils, the education authority and the housing executive were exceptional our members are calling time on real terms pay cuts.“Management must now engage with us to identy how they can address our members’ pay expectations within the NJC framework so as to avoid what is likely to be a disruptive dispute affecting council services, school transport and housing executive maintenance.”The picket lines will be going up on Monday morning for the first week of strike action by Unite members.A Housing Executive spokesperson said “Unite the Union have informed us of industrial action planned for next week. We will be taking steps to minimise any potential disruption to our tenants.”A spokesperson for Armagh City, Banbridge and Craigavon Borough Council said “Annual pay increases are negotiated nationally on behalf of Councils in England, Wales and Northern Ireland. Pay is not agreed at a local level and as such, Armagh City, Banbridge and Craigavon Borough Council cannot enter into separate local negotiations on pay with Unite.“The National Joint Council has informed all Councils that the - negotiations are complete and the pay award has been agreed.“Nonetheless Council have now received formal notication from Unite regarding their Industrial Action and are currently assessing the situation and the potential impact on services”.A spokesperson for EA said: “As a result of a -day strike by Unite the Union next weekimpacting a wider range of local Government services in Northern Ireland, as well as in England and Wales, the Education Authorityhas warned of disruption to some education and youth services.“The EA is working hard with schools, youth services and our partners to minimise the impact on children and young people as a result of the industrial action.“However, whilst the majority of schools, youth and other EA services are expected to operate as normal or with minimal disruption, it is likely that the strike action will have an impact on some transport, school meals and cleaning services. It is also anticipated that there could be disruption to a number of Special Schools, particularly in the Greater Belfast area, as regular transport for children may not be available, and there may also be a number of Classroom Assistants taking part in Unite’s Industrial action.“The EA will endeavour to keep parents, children and young people informed on the latest updates via our website www.eani.org.uk industrialactionupdates and our social media channels. Schools will also do their best as far as possible to communicate out any key information through their own channels.“However, we know that in some cases, particularly at the start of the week, services may be disrupted at such short notice that advance notication will not be possible, so we would encourage parents to plan ahead and have alternative arrangements in place, particularly in relation to transport and school meals.”“The strike action, which is taking place across a number of public sector bodies is in relation to NJC pay which is negotiated nationally for England, Wales and Northern Ireland by the National Employers for Local Government Services. The EA then implements the outcome of these negotiations.“Whilst we respect the right of those taking part in the strike to raise their concerns, we are disappointed at the decision to take this action in relation to a pay award that has been agreed and settled at a national level with Trade Unions in line with established collective bargaining arrangements."},{"url":null,"title":"spring carnival parade in londonderry for st patricks day ","story":"Antrim and Newtownabbey Council names leisure centres likely to be hit by strike   Emergency services tasked after swimmer rescued from Lough Neagh by person on jet-skiNewsCoronavirusTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsHealthBusinessEducationPeopleEnvironmentRead ThisUkraine CrisisFootballIrish League FootballSportMotorcyclingIce HockeyOther SportWhats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoLestyleFood and DrinkTravelHomes and GardensCars FamilyYour NIRetroOpinionAdvertise My Businesscanonical_urlCANONICAL_URLhostnameCANONICAL_HOSTNAMElocationCANONICAL_URLreferrerEXTERNAL_REFERRERpage_view_id_PAGE_VIEW_ID_scroll_SCROLL_HEIGHTgeo__INJECT_GEO__cid_ga:CLIENT_ID,comScore:CLIENT_ID,compass_uid:CLIENT_IDversionsha-wJFtySqNnAxBmRbBZGkmXyZeJTYkxlpMdJsFNIrrGVlru-DcIEIZ\" class\"i-amphtml-layout-container\" i-amphtml-layout\"container\"Loading...NewsPeopleSpring Carnival Parade in Londonderry for St Patricks DayMayor of Derry City and Strabane District Council, Alderman Graham Warke, is looking forward to the prospect of leading the citys Spring Carnival Parade with St Patrick this Thursday March th.By Peter HutcheonThursday, th March , : amUpdated Thursday, th March , : am  \"       \"  Mayor of Derry CIty and Strabane District Council, Alderman Graham Warke, launching Thursdays Spring Carnival Parade with Jim Collins from NWCI.The appropriately themed Rebirth and Renewal event is making a welcometo the city centre following a three year Covid enforced hiatus.The St Patrick’s Spring Carnival is organised by Derry City and Strabane District Council with support from North West Carnival Initiative, Tourism Northern Ireland and Good Relations funding.       \" d\"M.,.c-.-.-.-.-.-.c-.-.-.-.,-.c.-.,.-.,.,l.-. c.,.,.,.,.,c.-.,.-.,-.L,.c.,.,.,.,,.C.,.,.,.,.,.\"   \" d\"M,.c.,.,.,.,.,.c.,.,.,.,,.c-.,.-.,.-.,l-.,. c-.-.-.-.-.,c-.,.-.,.,,.L.,c-.-.-.-.,-.C.,.,.,.,,.\"   \" d\"M.,c.,,.,.,.,.c,.-.,.-.,.S,.,,.C,.,.,,.,\"     \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily NorthernIrelandWorld Today newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

That’s according to Agriculture Minister Edwin Poots, who was speaking after the ferry operator sacked  staff yesterday. It could be another week before the firm’s ships will be able to operate again and Mr Poots has warned that goods normally coming here wont be able to get in. There are export materials that need to get out of Northern Ireland which wont get out. About % of our food is exported out of Great Britain, so that is a real problem for us, he told BBC NIs The View. Meanwhile the Infrastructure Minister, Nichola Mallon MLA, has expressed her concern at the actions by PO Ferries and the impact locally. The Minister said: I was shocked to hear the news from PO Ferries this morning and my thoughts are with those staff working for PO who have lost their jobs and also with those whose travel has been disrupted. This is a developing situation and officials are working on a cross-departmental basis to assess any local impacts, especially for supply chains, and are keeping in close contact with their counterparts in the Department of Transport in London. With the Economy Minister I am calling on the Secretary of State for Transport to take every possible step to save jobs and to maintain connectivity for passengers and freight on Irish Sea routes.  addthis, Leave your commentTyrone Constitution- High Street, OmaghBT BDTel:     , ,, , ,  .jsp, , ,   , ,success:  ,  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" Order your photos n n n \" Advertise with us n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_baccffafddbcdddfd   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_ddfbbcfbcd   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html .  ,.vc_most_readMost Popular Stories.   , ]]      []js  d js.id  idjs.src  \"connect.facebook.net en_US #xfbmlversionv.\"fjs[],p ^http: .test http:httpsjs+: fjspo  text javascript   truepo.src  https:apis.google js plusone.js s  document[] s"},{"url":"http://www.tyronecon.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/1647596939237.jpg--ufu_launch__dig_in__to_food__farm_and_the_environment__schools__competition.jpg?164759694000","title":"ufu launch dig in to food farm and the environment schools competition ","story":"The Ulster Farmers’ Unionin partnership with Bank of Ireland Open Farm Weekendand Asda, are challenging school pupils across Northern Irelandto “Dig in!” to food, farming and the environment, by putting their creative skills to the test. The comments were made as the UFU launched its annual schools’ competition. Open to all playgroups, nursery, primary, and special schools, this year’s theme relates to the UFU’s food and farming education resource “Dig in!”, which encourages pupils to learn more about food, farming, and the countryside. UFU deputy president, David Brown said, “This year’s schools competition theme ‘Dig in! to food, farming and the environment’ provides an opportunity for teachers to start the discussion in the classroom about the importance of food and farming in NI, allowing pupils to learn more about how farmers work hard to produce the delicious, high-quality produce on our tables, and their contribution to shaping our landscape in NI, which everyone enjoys. “Climate change has been the front runner in NI this year and our farmers play an essential role in combating the global issue, as they are a key part of the solution. The schools competition helps pupils to enhance their understanding of how farmers create dferent environments in NI which support our economy, rural communities, tourism and recreation.” Mr Brown says every year the competition judges are impressed by the number, standard and creativity of entries for the schools’ competition. “We would encourage all nursery, playgroups, primary and special schools to participate in what is a very worthwhile competition. It’s a great opportunity to express their creativity while learning about one of the most important sectors in NI as they will discover the importance of local food production,” he said. The UFU is pleased to have competition sponsor Asda on board for another year with a range of prizes available for the lucky winners. Joe McDonald, Asda NI corporate affairs manager said, “Asda is a proud sponsor of the school’s competition. It is great to see competition entries grow year upon year, especially with the introduction of a dferentiating foundation category last year - the standard is superb. It is vital to create an awareness of where our produce comes from, and this competition is a great opportunity to do so - educating children on the ‘farm to fork’ story.” Now in its eleventh year, BOIOFW is the perfect partner for the schools’ competition. As part of the prize, the winner of each category receives free transport for their class to the nearest participating BOIOFW farm, and all competition entries will be on display throughout the weekend. Mr Brown says schools don’t need to be competition winners in order to visit real, working farms. “This free event showcases NI’s world-class ‘farm to fork’ journey and reconnects consumers with our farmers, the primary food producers.The weekend underlines the importance of supporting local producers to benefit the rural community and wider economy in NI. BOIOFW is taking place on Saturday  and Sunday  June, and I would certainly encourage all schools to consider organising a trip to a local participating farm on the schools’ day, Friday  June,” said the UFU deputy president. Entry forms have been sent electronically to all playgroups, nursery, primary and special schools. Schools’ competition templates are available by visitingwww.ufuni.org.The closing date for entries is Friday  April .
