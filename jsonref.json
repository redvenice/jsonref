Consider the Manet still life in this exultantly beautiful show that was painted in the final summer of his life. It depicts five green pears in a basket. Each is singular and unique, five vital beings turning towards each other in companionable conversation, united in the golden circle of the basket.The man who loved this painting was its owner, Danish collector Wilhelm Hansen (1868-1936), who used to show it to his dinner guests “as an extra dessert after the ice cream”. If this sounds like a plutocrat’s party trick, the feeling was completely sincere. Hansen loved and lost more than one Manet during the Danish banking crash of 1922, selling most of his French art to prop up his insurance company. But this Manet he kept, for its amazingly free brushstrokes, its greens running all the way from emerald to sultry viridian, its unshadowed joy in looking at the world even as life ebbs away. “A painter can say all he wants,” Manet once remarked, “with fruit or flowers or even clouds.”This selection of 60 works from the Ordrupgaard Collection – named after Hansen’s stately villa on the outskirts of Copenhagen – is the first major new show to open in this country since lockdown. It feels like a museum of French painting in miniature. But Hansen’s passions weren’t conventional they reveal a taste for originality, for the humane, the unexpected and the atypical among artists of the French avant garde.Hansen bought what appear to be classic Corots, for instance, but look closely and you will see Hamlet and the gravedigger in the glade of silvery willows. He bought paintings by Courbet that include a startling scene of roe deer hurtling through a winter forest, their sleek dark shapes so incisive against the blurry snow you might be looking at a surrealist collage.The show opens with a spectacular invitation to enter the scented woods of Fontainebleau. Monet takes the eye sweeping through the wide avenue of trees, summer sifting through their leaves. The painting fairly glitters with sunlight. But there is a hint of autumn on the forest floor, and the image seems to present a freedom of nature that we cannot reach just now, exhilarating yet also poignant.Pissarro, alongside all the Monets, seems almost garrulously sociable. Figures appear in every scene. A mother and child sit by a brook as harvest fields meet to the water, crops turning golden-orange in the warm air. Beneath a cloud of efflorescent spring blossom, Madame Pissarro is seen arriving safely home, as if the picture (and the life) were not complete without his wife.In winter, against instinct, Pissarro finds the most abundant colour. The glow of an evening sky above winter fields is almost upstaged by the snow below, twinkling with blue, purple, lavender, pink and orange strokes. It is as if he alone can see all the frequencies of light itself in a frozen landscape.On his first trip to Paris, in 1916, Hansen bought Monet’s view of Waterloo Bridge dissolving in a pearly haze of blue-grey smog, a daringly modern painting then only 13 years old. Back home, he approached Gauguin’s Danish widow Mette for the purchase of The Little One Is Dreaming. This unnerving portrait of their young daughter would pass for 19th-century realism, were it not for the alarming toy Punch tucked into the bed, one pertinacious eye on the viewer, and the harbinger birds taking flight from the wallpaper above. What is dream, and what is reality?More sinister still is Gauguin’s Blue Trees, a quartet of cobalt verticals against a yellow sky patched with scarlet clouds. It is a dazzling image, predating the wild colours of fauvism, painted while Gauguin was staying with Van Gogh at Arles in 1888. Van Gogh’s influence is everywhere apparent, but he has nothing to do with Gauguin’s strange couple, half visible beneath the trees, the man with his hands thrust deep into his pockets, threatening and aggressive. Your Turn Will Come, My Beauty! is the ominous subtitle.It is not clear why Gauguin gets pole position in the exhibition’s title. There are masterpieces here by many other painters, including Courbet, Matisse, Cézanne and Renoir, specifically his scintillating oil sketch for the great Bal du Moulin de la Galette, which is all about movement. Skittering vectors and vibrating lines show the motion of a dance step, a conversation, a kiss. It’s pure graphic dynamism, Renoir as we never see him.And there is a superb section of impressionist women, artists as well as sitters. Eva Gonzalès, Manet’s only student, paints a luminous white-on-white portrait of a convalescent that perfectly conveys that fragile but hopeful state. Among the works by Berthe Morisot is a wonderful portrait of a girl in a red bodice, something of its hue reflected in her complexion, and in the comical faces of the pansies straggling around her.Hansen and his wife, Henny, formed one of the greatest private collections in Scandinavia. But their offer to sell the art to the state for a modest fee was met with “hostile coolness” by the Danish government. The Hansens were hurt and no longer opened Ordrupgaard to the public. It was only when Henny died in 1951 that Denmark was bequeathed this treasury of art.This group of paintings is abroad while Ordrupgaard is closed for rebuilding. The Royal Academy is the final stop on a tour that began in Paris with a different title: “The Hansens’ Secret Garden”. This is more apt for the intimate scale and character of these pictures, so unusual, intriguing and unfamiliar.Here is the other half of a double portrait by Delacroix that shows the writer George Sand in some kind of inner rapture, but not the source of her fascination – namely her lover Chopin, playing the piano (he is in the Louvre). And who has ever seen Courbet’s fantastically outlandish painting of wire-makers’ workshops near Ornans, where the buildings huddle far below a cliff as vast as a fortress, lording it over the workers. You sense Courbet’s subconscious at work with his revolutionary zeal encapsulated in this small but vociferous work.Best of all is a painting so rarely shown you would normally have to travel to Denmark to see it. This is Manet’s portrait of his young wife, Suzanne, holding a jug. The softness of Suzanne’s fair hair and the delicacy of her face and bare throat are a vision of tenderness. But where one hand is perfectly described, the other disappears into indefinite energy. It is a startling hybrid, and an anthology of art – like this show – in this case conflating hints of Titian, Pontormo and Vermeer. Manet had a museum inside his head.• Gauguin and the Impressionists is at the Royal Academy, London, until 18 October"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/012b6b6880cc7974df5822df7559fa021bffce20/0_0_4000_2399/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8ec23219e5295951bc102e3c3158f4c7","title":"the big picture shadow play in 1930s germany","story":"Paul Wolff’s 1930s images of a tennis match in silhouette have a graceful life of their ownIn 1930, Dr Paul Wolff took a series of pictures of tennis players’ shadows for the German magazine Die Dame. The pictures captured a whole tennis match in silhouette – serve, return, volley, forehand, backhand – so that the shadows advancing on the court took on a graceful life of their own, tethered to the ankles and feet of young men and women in ankle socks and white plimsolls. The relation of player and shadow – high summer’s constant doubles partners – has become a familiar theme for sports photographers, but Wolff was among the first to celebrate it.In the decade that followed, the German photographer and his assistant-cum-stage manager Alfred Tritschler became famous as “the masters of the Leica”, extending the range and scope of the pioneering hand-held camera, with work showcased in every major magazine and newspaper. The Leica company, which had given the former medical doctor one of its prototype 35mm cameras to experiment with in 1926, subsequently delivered all of its new lenses to Wolff in advance of release for him to create advertising images. A travelling slideshow of some of the results was watched by hundreds of thousands of people across the world.All of Wolff’s technical mastery coincided, of course, with the darkest days in his country’s history. Almost accidentally, he documented in his pin-sharp, perfectly lit way the end of the Weimar republic, the rise of nazism and the devastation of war. Wolff’s house in Frankfurt and his extensive personal archive were destroyed by bombing in 1944. A selection of the prints and negatives that remain has been collected into a book that includes not only his photographs of tennis players, but also early images of Hitler Youth, the launch of the Hindenburg zeppelin and the 1936 Berlin Olympics. Not for nothing is the book called Light and Shadow. Dr Paul Wolff \u0026amp Tritschler: Light and Shadow – Photographs 1920 to 1950, edited by Hans-Michael Koetzle (Kehrer Verlag), has been nominated for the Kraszna-Krausz 2020 Photography Book award.

Even after her artistic talent was nurtured by Josef Albers following the war, it wasn’t until the 2000s that Asawa’s woven metal structures were acknowledged as masterpieces.

About 63,000 sq km of this land is Wilinggin country of the Ngarinyin people and their connection to country dates back 60,000 years.One of the first stops towards Wilinggin country passes the Queen Victoria Head – a rock formation bearing an uncanny resemblance to the famous monarch. While it’s a blunt reminder of colonialism, it’s also the gateway to an area that until very recently had far more dubious name – the King Leopold Ranges, named after the Belgian king responsible for grievous atrocities, brutal oppression and enslavement of African people.An estimated 10 to 15 million Congolese people died under his brutal regime. Leopold is a figure among many whose inappropriate immortalisation has been brought to the global stage by the Black Lives Matter movement.But after two years of work behind the scenes, traditional owner groups made some new headlines with a historic name change to the Wunaamin Miliwundi Ranges. It’s a hybrid name to represent both the Ngarinyin (Wunaamin) and Bunuba (Miliwundi) traditional names.Since then, another seven places in this conservation park have changed back to their Ngarinyin name.Since the Wanjina Wunggurr Wilinggin native title determination in 2004, the Ngarinyin people have made significant moves to empower their community and return to, and care for, country. One of the first things they set up after determination was an Indigenous ranger program: the Wunggurr Rangers.Ngarinyin man Robin Dann was one of the first rangers employed and is now head ranger, living on country in the Ngallagunda community, with his family. His younger brother Kane Nenowatt is more recent addition to the Wunggurr rangers while his wife, Tanya Spider, sits on the Wilinggin board of directors.Dann’s granddaughters Anastacia and Lizinta Jumburra provide boundless energy and infectious smiles, but they also represent a new generation for the community.“These changes are about time, mate, but we always kept the names when we worked on country anyway – they never went away. But this does give us recognition and that makes us proud,” Dann says.One of locations changed back to its traditional name is (the formerly named) Barker pool, now Dudungarri mindi. The name refers to the dreamtime story of the Wanjina spirit and the Yawarlngarri jirri (blue catfish) which live in this pool. This represents a rich and ancient history that Ngarinyin people hope to share with visitors alongside the staggering beauty of the region.For the Wilinggin Aboriginal Corporation, this moment also highlights the benefits surrounding native title. With it comes a genuine economy: employment and investment brought to the region by the people themselves. With a second ranger group on the way, the determination of the Ngarinyin people to stand on their own is a shining light in an uncertain world."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3e0962a91f677c64569f2956e419ebf016cefc8d/0_73_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6535b730bf17c3dae91a13e680d001db","title":"debenhams hires restructuring firm hilco capital for potential liquidation","story":"Thousands of jobs under threat if attempts to sell historic department store failDebenhams’ owners have appointed restructuring experts to draw up plans for its potential liquidation in a move that could threaten thousands of jobs.Company bosses appointed Hilco Capital, a firm that specialises in helping to wind down distressed retail businesses, to work with them should attempts to sell the historic department store end in failure.It is understood Hilco’s appointment is part of a “contingency plan” and does not indicate that the 242-year-old retailer’s liquidation is more likely.The news comes after the business announced on Tuesday that it would cut a further 2,500 jobs, while taking “all necessary steps” to give the chain “every chance of a viable future”.M\u0026ampCo – 400 jobs5 August: M\u0026ampCo., the Renfrewshire-based clothing retailer, formerly known as Mackays, will close 47 of 215 stores.WH Smith – 1,500 jobs5 August: The chain, which sells products ranging from sandwiches to stationery, will cut jobs mainly in UK railway stations and airports.\u0026nbspPizza Express – 1,100 jobs4 August: The restaurant chain plans the closure of 70 restaurants as part of a rescue restructure deal.Dixons Carphone – 800 jobs4 August: Electronics retailer Dixons Carphone is cutting 800 managers in its stores as it continues to reduce costs.DW Sports – 1,700 jobs at risk3 August: DW Sports fell into administration, closing its retail website immediately and risking the closure of its 150 gyms and shops.Marks \u0026amp Spencer – 950 jobs20 July: The high street stalwart cuts management jobs in stores as well as head office roles related to property and store operations.Ted Baker – 500 jobs19 July: About 200 roles to go at the fashion retailer’s London headquarters, the Ugly Brown Building, and the remainder at stores.Azzurri – 1,200 jobs17 July: The owner of the Ask Italian and Zizzi pizza chains closes 75 restaurants and makes its Pod lunch business delivery onlyBurberry – 500 jobs worldwide15 July: Total includes 150 posts in UK head offices as luxury brand tries to slash costs by £55m after a slump in sales during the pandemic.John Lewis – 1,300 jobs9 July: John Lewis announced that it is planning to\u0026nbsppermanently close eight of its 50 stores, including full department stores in Birmingham and Watford, with the likely loss of 1,300 jobs.Celtic Manor – 450 jobs9 July: Bosses at the Celtic Collection in Newport, which staged golf\u0027s Ryder Cup in 2010 and the 2014 Nato Conference, said 450 of its 995 workers will lose their jobs.Pret a Manger – 1,000 jobs6 July: Pret a Manger is to\u0026nbsppermanently close 30 branches and could cut at least 1,000 jobs after suffering “significant operating losses” as a result of the Covid-19 lockdownCasual Dining Group – 1,900 jobs2 July: The owner of the Bella Italia, Café Rouge and Las Iguanas restaurant chains\u0026nbspcollapsed into administration, with the immediate loss of 1,900 jobs.

In England, only small underground mines in Cumbria and the Forest of Dean continue to produce modest amounts of coal.The Bradley shutdown comes only months after Hargreaves Services, which can trace its roots in the British mining industry back 150 years, told investors that it plans to wind down its Scottish mines because it was “clear that coal has a limited future”.But despite the grim outlook some miners are hoping to lead a British renaissance to provide coal to the UK’s steelworks, which rely heavily on coal imports.Ministers were expected to deliver their verdict on Banks Group’s plans to develop Britain’s largest coal mine at Highthorn in April, after years of fierce opposition from environmentalists, but the government has yet to give a decision on the controversial project.The delay comes after government faced fierce criticism for giving the green light to the UK’s first new deep coal mine in 30 years in the same week that the Treasury launched a review into how the UK can end its contribution to global heating.Britain set a record coal-free run earlier this summer, which came to an end after 67 days, 22 hours and 55 minutes when a coal unit at the Drax power plant in North Yorkshire fired up for a post-maintenance test. Earlier this week a 55-day coal-free streak came to end after the UK’s record breaking heatwave caused wind speeds to slow and made gas-fired power plants less efficient too."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1234cb00adb468a01657cf094c1bbf9c7abdd870/0_339_3972_2381/master/3972.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8269ede1334222a40610cdf0fa063841","title":"after 15 years black pride is ever more vital and relevant","story":"It’s a celebration but also plays a crucial role in allowing the most marginalised to have their day in the sunSome reasons to be cheerful: Black Pride in the UK celebrates its 15th year today. Quite possibly the most egalitarian and heartwarming protest I’ve ever witnessed, it is a haven for LGBTQ people of colour every year. Much like everything else, the programme has gone digital this time round, with performances and talks all streamed online, but it’s worth taking stock. What started in 2005 as a gathering of black lesbians in Southend that cost Phyllis Opoku-Gyimah £427 saw 10,000 people travel from all over the country to attend the event in east London last year.Seeing queer refugees, asylum seekers – multiple voices marginalised by sexuality, class, religion and ethnicity – take centre stage and get their day in the sun is radical. True, it’s really fun too, but unlike the “main Pride”, this one still feels political and with lots still at stake. More power to them.You would think that at least this year, of all years, we would be spared the annual farce of A-level results day. Not the very real catastrophe at hand, but the tedium of adults who use the moment to share their wisdom on why exams don’t matter because hey! Have you heard? Grades are overrated and dreams can still be achieved without a piece of paper!Every August, on TV, radio, in newspapers and especially on Twitter, we are treated to a grotesque strain of humblebrag masquerading as Good Old Fashioned Advice that might as well come from 1842.The “I didn’t even go to school after 11, wore newspaper for shoes and now I’m a rich and famous author!” kind. Or “I fluffed my A-levels at private school and I still inherited a peerage!” sort. (Both real examples, I very much kid you not.)The idea that this should reassure an 18-year-old in 2020, two recessions and a global pandemic already under their belt, only to be punished by an algorithm, makes me cringe to my core.I’m all for optimism and giving teenagers something to look forward to. Offer hope without patronising them. Empathise with their experience without making it about yourself. But let’s not peddle delusions about the strength of our meritocracy - this generation has just witnessed their marks determined by a government-sanctioned postcode lottery.Plenty can and will be achieved by young people, irrespective of their A-levels but no matter how tenacious and talented they are, they’ve still been dealt a terrible hand. It isn’t just unfair – it’s wrong.Is it worth going on holiday if I have to quarantine afterwards?

Succession, Curb Your Enthusiasm, Indian Matchmaker, the BBC’s delicious series on the Rupert Murdoch empire. All thumbs up.

In their last year of school, pupils apply for up to five courses through Ucas. Universities then decide how many deserve the offer of a place, based on how many offers are usually accepted and then matched on results day.It is a difficult task even in a normal year, yet the costs of getting it wrong are huge. If an institution under-recruits, it will have spare places, empty beds and financial problems. If it over-recruits, it will have overcrowded seminars, a worse staff-student ratio and discontented students, hitting league table positions.This year, the job is impossible to do properly. The exams were cancelled and, in their place, we have rough-and-ready results with sharp edges. A teacher relative of mine showed me data for one class at her comprehensive school. Everyone expected to receive grades A to C but, in the event, half received D to U.There is an appeals process, but iniduals cannot appeal directly and the grounds for appeal are limited, plus, where an appeal succeeds, it may be too late to get the university place you want. Universities want to help where they can and many will have spare capacity as international students stay away. Most want to ersify their intakes, but they are not free agents. The UK is meant to have the most autonomous universities in the developed world, yet, bizarrely, ministers have responded to the pandemic by imposing a system of student number caps on English universities, with big financial penalties for over-recruitment. Many challenges posed by the pandemic are the same across the world, but the UK’s university admissions round has one important difference. In two-thirds of European countries, living with your parents is the most common type of student accommodation. In the UK, eight in 10 full-time students leave home to study.Aside from the extra challenges in terms of social distancing, mass residential education encourages a ersity and hierarchy of institutions. People don’t just look to their local institution but much further afield. When our university admissions system works well, it is like the Sorting Hat process at Hogwarts, finding the best match between person and place.This year’s school leavers have been told for years that the world is their oyster. They were told they would have a particularly wide set of options because they are, relatively speaking, such a small group. Apart from 1976-78, 2001 and 2002 were the only years since the Second World War when fewer than 600,000 babies were born in England and Wales – those babies are today’s 18- and 19-year-olds.So they had been expecting unprecedented choice, with universities falling over each other to recruit them. This year was on course to be the least painful admissions round in living memory. But it is instead a terrible time to be leaving any educational institution: no school proms, no normal exam results and no freshers’ weeks. This is encouraging all sorts of wild predictions about the future. Some say the results mess shows why we should move to continuous teacher-led assessments rather than putting all our eggs in a basket labelled “public exams”. Others say the era of big physical university campuses will end as online learning takes over.Those children are now itching to go away as planned. After all, you do not just go to university to study, you go to get away from home, make new friends and journey to adulthood in a secure environment. This is particularly important this year, after so long spent in the claustrophobic atmosphere of lockdown. That is why, against many of the predictions, more young people, including more disadvantaged young people, have secured a place in higher education this year. And they want a traditional university experience when they get there, ideally alongside other students because they know learning is a social endeavour.A traditional experience won’t always be possible, due to social distancing, but universities want to provide it. They wouldn’t have built up such vast physical presences if they had wanted to be virtual institutions. Real, as opposed to online, lectures and social events will return as soon as they can. In the meantime, a bigger concern than entry rates is likely to be drop-out rates. New students will be less well prepared than their predecessors, having generally done no school work since March. They could also find it harder to integrate, as freshers’ fairs and social events are postponed or cancelled. They won’t all survive the distance.In moments of doubt, new students should recall that higher education generally works out, with graduates tending to earn more and live longer. But the journey is not always smooth, so institutions are putting in place more online and face-to-face support for those who need extra help or have second thoughts – and accessing this should be recognised as the act of bravery it is, rather than evidence of being a snowflake.Before anyone does drop out, they should remember that, even if their initial year of university life is disrupted, it is the least important one, academically and socially. As Evelyn Waugh put in Brideshead Revisited, you may even “find you spend half your second year shaking off the undesirable friends you made in your first”.• Nick Hillman is the director of the Higher Education Policy Institute"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/123b6dbc20309b0c456cbe9d979ad2aedbe79ac5/0_51_1594_957/master/1594.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8668f0ab32220612ac142d17e39cc4be","title":"the names bond second best bond","story":"In a world racked by disease, it’s lovely to debate which actor was almost as good as Sean ConneryThe subject of who is the best James Bond is a difficult one on which to be interesting. As you’re about to find out. I really meant not to write about it but I couldn’t resist, simply because I find it so interesting. I reckon that’s probably why it’s tricky to be interesting about. Increasingly I think, when it comes to the risk of being boring, that’s the red flag: are you finding yourself interesting? If so, no one else is.Bores are seldom themselves bored – they’re usually finding themselves fascinating, banging on about wiring, or gardening, or what people don’t understand about Charlemagne or who’s the best Bond. So, listening to a bore is like an offensive metaphor for global wealth inequality. The bores (representing the super-rich) droning on, becoming more and more interested, as everyone else gets more and more bored, until all of the world’s interestedness is in the possession of a tiny number of droning people, while the vast majority must scratch an existence in unremitting stultification.But being boring is really enjoyable if you can find a nice supportive environment to indulge it in. The scourge of mansplaining is well-documented, and I’m absolutely first in line to take everyone through the various issues with that, but explaining things can be deeply relaxing. Anecdotally at least, it feels like something men do more than women, but that doesn’t mean men do it exclusively to women (as the bishop mansplained to the actress). Some of my most peaceful evenings in the pub with other men have involved hours and hours of taking it in turns to explain things – just saying some facts that probably everyone listening already knows, so that they can nod and then it’s someone else’s go. It has the same comforting quality as muttering the Lord’s Prayer or assembling an Airfix model.Discussing which actor’s portrayal of fictional spy James Bond is most accomplished is right in the “thy kingdom come”gluing-on-a-Spitfire’s-landing-gear sweet spot. So, in a world racked by disease and mega-explosions, last week’s news that Sean Connery had won a Radio Times poll to decide the best Bond was lovely to read. It was relaxing and uplifting in the same way as turning on ITV on a random afternoon in the 90s to discover that Moonraker is on and you haven’t missed the bit where the gondola turns into a hovercraft.The poll is of course totally unnecessary. Everyone knows Connery is the best Bond. Statements to the contrary are only ever made as a means of asserting personality. People sometimes find the refutation of obvious fact useful as a means of defining themselves in a group. Like citing a link between the coronavirus and 5G, these aren’t really opinions, but aesthetic choices by which people can stand out from the crowd without the necessity of doing anything difficult or good.It must be a source of some bewilderment and sadness for the producers of the Bond films (as well as for the several talented actors who followed Connery in the role) that the relatively unknown former milkman and bodybuilder who first landed the part in the face of scepticism from, among others, Ian Fleming turned out to be the only person who can quite make it work. Balancing Bond’s suavity and brutality while remaining sympathetic, and also responding plausibly to circumstances of extreme jeopardy, while remaining cool but not becoming smug, is virtually impossible.Everyone else erred in one direction or other: Roger Moore is too suave, Timothy Dalton too stressed, Pierce Brosnan too groomed, Daniel Craig too depressed and George Lazenby, with the best will in the world, made it look like they’d accidentally rolled camera on the stand-in. But Connery got it right first time and made it look easy. It’s taken half a century of other actors failing in order to properly contextualise his achievement.I don’t blame those other actors. James Bond is a ridiculous character – a pathetic mixture of dandy, narcissist, twat and thug – but in the stories’ universe everyone thinks he’s ace and we’re not supposed to think that’s because they’ve all gone potty. The job of playing James Bond is to make all the punching, screwing and fastidious drink-ordering seem cool, likable and real and only Connery managed it.So the real issue (and I know it’s my round and I’ll go to the bar as soon as I’ve just made this one point) is who is the second-best Bond and here, I must say, I take issue with the structure of the Radio Times survey. This was not done as a straight vote but as a series of rounds, with Connery taking on Craig in round one, then Brosnan versus Lazenby in round two, Moore against Dalton in round three and then a final fourth round between the victors of the first three to decide the overall winner.Well, you don’t need to have been in charge of seeding for a Wimbledon championship to see the problem. Craig against Connery in the first round! That effectively eliminates Craig’s chances of coming second overall, which, as anyone but his agent would say, is his absolute best hope. Connery should be seeded one and face Lazenby in the first round, Moore and Craig should be seeded two and three, or three and two – maybe do it based on box office adjusted for inflation – and should take on Dalton and Brosnan in rounds two and three.Then if everything went according to seeding, Connery, Moore and Craig would all make the final and we might get an answer to the only significant remaining question: do people prefer Roger Moore’s dapper charm or Daniel Craig’s craggy-faced verisimilitude?Perhaps it’s time to give The Living Daylights a serious re-evaluation, finger hovering over the pause button and notebook and pen at the ready. This is intriguing. I’m so sorry."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6da38b899a7b659417dd8522829c8c842bd92b03/0_43_1980_1189/master/1980.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f1bb82d30b244ba569cd7ad1e852b7df","title":"tory mps have given their leaders the benefit of the doubt until now","story":"Downing Street’s muddled thinking on schools, Covid-19 and travel presages on autumn of unprecedented challengesAll politicians sloganise in haste and repent at leisure. John Major spent years having “back to basics” thrown at him every time a Conservative politician was caught in flagrante. Gordon Brown didn’t, as he claimed he had, end “boom and bust” after all. David Cameron and George Osborne coined “all in this together” long before the 2008 crash, but it became a useful summary of the Conservatives’ pitch to rebuild the economy – and something critics could remind the prime minister of every time he or anyone around him enjoyed a glass of champagne.Boris Johnson and his chancellor, Rishi Sunak, have spent the past few months trying to capture imaginations with a series of lines about their handling of coronavirus. There was the promise that the government would put its “arms around every single worker”, an odd phrase to use while also urging people to stay two metres away from one another. Last week, after a slew of miserable statistics about jobs and the economy, Sunak said that, while Britain was in hard times, “no one will be left without hope or opportunity”. It was a typically elegant line from the chancellor, but it also puts him in a bit of a bind. Even a nebulous pledge like this one is easy to miss: can Sunak really say with confidence that, come the autumn, when the furlough scheme ends and many people lose their jobs, no one will struggle with a sense of hopelessness?His Conservative colleagues are struggling with a range of emotions that don’t suggest that the men at the top of government have succeeded in captivating them with fine language. “I’m through embarrassment now,” says one senior Tory who is usually quite happy to defend Johnson. “Now I’m disappointed with the way my party has handled things, which is so much worse.”Others start by defending the way their ministerial colleagues have had to respond to an unprecedented situation, only to descend into an anxious volley of swearing as they list the messes the government really could have avoided. One Tory in a former “red wall” seat accuses No 10 of, in rather less charming language than Sunak, “wanking into the void” because it failed to make any real preparations for the row about A-level results. Another colleague describes the current situation as a “total mess”, complaining that ministers have lost focus after the first few urgent months of the pandemic.Despite the UK’s high death toll and poor economic performance, many Conservative MPs have felt their party had done its best up to this point. Cabinet ministers point to the way their colleagues “followed the science” and listened to the government’s expert advisers, rather than taking decisions for political reasons. All accept that this is the toughest time to be a minister.So what has changed the minds of those Tories who were previously prepared to give their government the benefit of the doubt? For many, the turning point came over education.One says: “It seems to me that the only thing that has been done in a timely way were Rishi’s interventions. At least they were decisive and staved off the worst impact in the short term. All the other things have been ballsed up to a greater or lesser extent.“Exams shouldn’t have been cancelled. Schools should have been back months ago, or at least there should have been some serious remote learning followed by exams which at least would have meant schools would be held accountable for doing some teaching.”A fair few Conservatives are frustrated that the government seems to be more concerned about stopping grade inflation than about acknowledging what a stressful and bewildering year it has been for pupils. “So what if you are overgenerous with marks this year? Who cares?” storms one backbencher. “It’s not business as usual, so just go with what the teachers said they’d get, for Christ’s sake.”MPs and ministers alike are full of praise for Michelle Donelan, the universities minister, who has spent most of the week in Zoom calls with worried colleagues. She has told MPs that the appeals process for results should conclude by 7 September, which has helped them reassure infuriated constituents.But cabinet ministers are even more anxious about the coming year, pointing out that students will still be at a huge disadvantage after missing so much schooling. And all agree that if the government fails to get schools open again next month, then the fallout will be far worse than from these results.If children can’t go back to school, their parents can’t go back to work either. That’s presuming that those parents have a job to return to. A huge amount of work is being poured into preparing for the end of the furlough scheme in October. Deferred business rates and VAT will need to be repaid at some point, but senior MPs are worried that this will come at just the point when businesses have a chance to recover. “We could effectively be putting them out of business, which isn’t really what a government wants to do,” says one.Tory MPs don’t know how they’ll deal with this. “There’s not really anyone in contemporary British politics who has had to deal with large-scale unemployment,” says one minister. “Our whole political life has been against a backdrop of good employment. It’s going to be like a stone in the shoe, just getting more and more painful.”Ministers in the Treasury, the Work and Pensions department and the Business department have been drawing up plans to help people move into new lines of work as their sectors shrink. The hope is that most will find they have transferable skills and are able to move from, say, aviation into social care, because both involve working with people. The scale of government employment programmes being planned for the coming months dwarfs anything that Labour unveiled in 2009. But most Tories are pragmatic about their party making government so big at the moment: on this, they accept another Sunak slogan that “this is not a time for ideology and orthodoxy”.Sunak tends to get a lot of credit from his colleagues for moving swiftly with new policies. But the wider government is still moving too slowly on other issues. MPs complain that committees making important decisions that affect the tourism industry are not meeting until the end of August, by which time it will be too late. There is also widespread irritation with the No 10 communications operation, which many feel isn’t doing a good enough job of explaining why things are happening. “The government really should do better at explaining ahead of time to the country and to the party about why decisions are being made and what the trade-offs are,” says one minister. “We should trust the intelligence of the vast majority of people. For me, this whole situation is a reminder of why effective government communications is really important.”Tory MPs are clearly as much in need of better government communications as the general public. They will need even more reassurance over the next few months. The 109 new Tory MPs have spent the past few weeks telling one another that they need to take time off now, because the autumn is going to be far harder than the time they’ve just worked through. But even veteran politicians aren’t prepared for what is coming. When Sunak next speaks to his colleagues, he may want to deploy a new slogan summing up how the autumn will be: hold on tight.• Isabel Hardman is assistant editor of the Spectator"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7c3545493957349d4b386d55a94231130db01c7e/0_0_3543_2126/master/3543.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b1d7a8d20ff522addc331c6beb250423","title":"weve got to start thinking beyond our own lifespans if were going to avoid extinction","story":"Short-term analysis of ways to save society, and indeed humanity, is useless In a biology lesson about the bacterial growth curve, the parallels with the climate crisis were hard to miss. Stick bacteria in a test tube with food and their population will grow exponentially until, eventually, they run out of resources and kill themselves off. Even a couple of decades ago, the comparison with humanity’s predicament felt glaringly obvious and we have not really strayed since from the inevitable path to extinction.The hope seems to be that a big crisis might be the shock we need to change course. But we are living through the biggest global crisis for decades – and are travelling and consuming less as a result of the pandemic – yet it already seems unlikely that much will change. It’s easy enough to throw around the old adage “never waste a good crisis”. But when it comes to existential questions about the future of humanity, it has proved fairly useless.There is a lot that could account for this flatlining. It was once assumed that increased productivity, driven by technological progress, would result in us having more leisure time: see John Maynard Keynes’s prediction in the 1930s that we’d be working just 15 hours a week by now. But instead, luxury beat leisure and an explosion in consumerism has driven us towards ever more consumption. The “happiness” economist Richard Layard has also pointed towards “disorders of development” such as obesity and tech addiction (although it should be noted that within a wealthy society such as ours, obesity is associated with poverty).The costs of this consumption have increased. Much of it is subsidised by labour exploitation, both at home and abroad. And then there is the small issue of catastrophic climate change, as we race towards “tipping points” beyond which global heating becomes self-reinforcing and harder to halt without unprecedented levels of coordinated international action.Stack all this up, and the idea of already-rich societies moving towards a “zero growth” economic model – once the preserve of the radical green fringes of politics – starts to look increasingly like a no-brainer. We would have to sacrifice gains in material living standards, but the potential prize would be preserving the planet and achieving a better worklife balance. If we could protect the least affluent from any negative impacts – which would require more redistribution, not to mention paying more for services such as caring and cleaning – what’s not to like?The big problem is, of course, no one knows how to get there. The 2008 financial crisis offered a chance to take stock. For a while, it looked like something might happen: economists designed global “happiness” indices and the UN General Assembly declared a “world happiness day”. But not only did nothing change: it was used as political cover for darker agendas. Bhutan adopted a measure for Gross National Happiness in an attempt to market itself globally as the “happiness” country, while papering over its record of human rights abuses and ethnic cleansing. In the UK, David Cameron pledged to set up a national wellbeing index as he cut back mental health services, youth services and children’s centres.We’re back there again: happiness advocates saying we can’t afford to waste this opportunity to rethink, even as the government has prioritised pubs over schools – economic recovery over broader measures of wellbeing – in relaxing the lockdown.This is no surprise. Our political and economic systems are utterly indisposed to the radical shifts we need to promote wellbeing over wealth and protect the planet. Short-termism is everywhere, from politicians who face elections every few years to company directors who must account for quarterly results. On the right, there are powerful vested interests who want to maintain business as usual – who go quiet in the wake of a crisis, or even appear to jump on the bandwagon (just look at Davos agendas in recent years), but who do all in their power to obstruct change. The left often makes peace with continuous growth, despite its costs, because a rising tide makes redistribution easier. And it is crazy to think that a shock to GDP caused by a financial crisis or a pandemic could be used as a bridge to a different world because the brunt of the pain is always, always borne by the least affluent and the young.So we need to think far more about the mechanisms and institutions that could get us on to a different path. The Long Time Project is exploring how humans could shift their time horizons so, simply put, we feel more emotionally connected to our future descendants. It points to the fact that we tend to view our future selves, let alone future generations, as strangers. We need to rewire the way we think about the future, and our own ageing and deaths the projects’ founders believe that art and culture can play an important role. And we could learn from those times in history when humans have proved their ability to think beyond their own life: “cathedral thinking” is based on those architects who planned spectacular buildings that would never be finished in their own lifetimes.It’s no exaggeration to say that, unless we find a way to think differently about consumption, wellbeing and sustainability, humans will be responsible for our own extinction. And it should be clear by now that crises – extreme weather, pandemics, financial crises – are never going to be the wake-up call that forces us to confront our own fragility. A good crisis inevitably goes to waste, and it is lazy and irresponsible to think otherwise."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/24a95011f20bb766c1414ce3a6122701e0024b4a/0_163_7360_4417/master/7360.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=655c991d7a42460e6db2348a28d79456","title":"on my radar daisy edgar jones cultural highlights","story":"The Normal People star on livestreamed theatre, the best TV show she’s ever seen and a gem from her dad’s record collectionActor Daisy Edgar-Jones was born in 1998 in Islington, London. She trained with the National Youth Theatre and her breakthrough acting role was in ITV’s comedy drama Cold Feet aged 17. She made her film debut in 2018’s Pond Life but is best known for playing Marianne earlier this year in the critically acclaimed BBC adaptation of Sally Rooney’s novel Normal People. Edgar-Jones stars in Mike Bartlett’s play about politics and patriotism, Albion, filmed at the Almeida theatre and airing at 10.10pm on BBC Four tonight and subsequently on iPlayer.This is one of the best TV shows I’ve ever watched. It’s told from the perspective of Rue, a recovering drug addict played by the phenomenal Zendaya, who laces her character with so much humour and darkness and scar tissue. Sometimes it feels as if the camera is on some form of narcotic as it swings upside down or follows two characters in dizzying spirals as they run up and up a flight of stairs. The costume, music, makeup, sets, characters, writing are all phenomenal. It’s truly a feast for the eyes.I was lucky enough to get tickets to the first livestreamed performance of this at the Old Vic. The story tracks the relationship between a couple as they debate the ethics of bringing a child into the world it’s funny and moving and brilliantly observed. Both Claire Foy and Matt Smith are amazing in it, and I found it so interesting how powerful theatre is, even when delivered through a laptop. The actors and writing paint the world for you so vividly you can still suspend your disbelief. Also, no interval queue for the toilets.If Nobody Speaks of Remarkable Things by Jon McGregorThis story follows the lives of various residents on one single street, all united by one event that took place there. The book celebrates the parts of life we take for granted, and, having spent so much time in lockdown, I’m hyper-aware of what I also take for granted. How wonderful sitting in a pub with a pal is, how great it is to hug your parents. I’m also very aware of all the strangers that live on my street: we all experienced lockdown together, we had the same footpaths we could use for our daily walk, the same corner shop to stock up on loo roll, and yet I don’t know anyone to say hello to.The Last Black Man in San Francisco (dir Joe Talbot)I watched this film not knowing what to expect and I fell in love with it. The story follows a man living in San Francisco, who is on a journey to reclaim a beautiful house his grandfather built and lived in, much to the annoyance of the current residents. It’s like watching moving art and the soundtrack is beautiful, I’m still listening to it now. The story is inspired by the lead actor and it’s directed by his old school friend. It really is a film made with love.Dark Side of the Moon by Pink FloydWe have a record player and I have a load of my parents’s old vinyl albums from when they were young. When I was 18, I found my dad’s copy of Dark Side of the Moon and thought it was incredible. I enjoy the thought of my dad listening to it when he was younger, with all the same scratches and jumps in the record, and I like the use of sound recorded from people chatting or clocks ticking, layered and fed into the music. It’s a good one to have a bop to on your own before bed.Hitsville: The Making of Motown (dir Benjamin Turner and Gabe Turner)I always love a good music documentary and this is just brilliant. It tracks the birth of Motown Records in Detroit in 1958 and the amazing hits and artists that came out of there. We see the insane talent of Smokey Robinson, the Temptations, Diana Ross and the Supremes, Marvin Gaye and so many more as they work together to make music. The documentary explores the sense of community surrounding the label and how they dealt with the success they had when they started making nothing but hits. It also shows you how the label really changed culture for ever. You’ll be tapping your foot for the whole film."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4b98ecff001e57e10fa85c4cbc3813a3a5e56710/0_216_4895_2938/master/4895.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ffa4af83c2a8de80b320e4cee7be99bf","title":"here be dragonflies thriving in britain as never before","story":"Climate change has encouraged a wave of insect migrants from across the Channel. Should we celebrate or fear for the future?As the sun finally emerges from behind a cloud, I catch sight of a pair of dragonflies, yoked together in a mating position to rival the Kama Sutra. Yet this copulating couple, performing in a watery ditch on Canvey Island in Essex, are no ordinary members of their family. They are southern migrant hawkers: a species virtually unknown in the UK until a decade or so ago.The southern migrant (also known as blue-eyed) hawker is just one of half-a-dozen “dragons and damsels” to have gained a foothold in Britain since the turn of the millennium. Together, they’ve brought the total number of UK species close to the 50 mark.The new arrivals include the lesser emperor dragonfly, a duo of jewel-like damselflies – willow and southern emeralds – and the dainty damselfly. This tiny insect was lost from Britain in the 1953 East Anglia floods, but has now recolonised a few sites in Kent.More are poised to follow: there have been breeding attempts by the vagrant emperor, some of which fly here all the way from north Africa while four other continental species have been seen in the UK for the first time during the last 25 years.Other species, once confined to the warmer south and east, are rapidly expanding northwards and westwards. As its name suggests, the migrant hawker used to be mainly a seasonal visitor to the UK it now breeds over much of England and Wales, and I regularly see it in my Somerset garden at this time of year. Another species extending its range, the scarce chaser, has recently colonised the drains and ditches of the nearby Avalon Marshes.But while the possibility of seeing these new species is exciting for naturalists, we do have to temper our delight a little. There can be no doubt that their northward surge across the Channel is driven by current climate changes, and in particular the very warm weather of the past three springs and summers. So, what might be good for them – at least in the short term – is a timely warning to us.As dragonfly expert Dave Smallshire, co-author of Britain’s Dragonflies and Atlas of Dragonflies in Britain and Ireland, points out: “While about half a dozen species appear to be in decline, 20 species have increased the overwhelming reason being climate change”.Until quite recently, a passion for Odonata (the scientific group which comprises dragonflies and damselflies) was confined to a handful of experts. Indeed, until 1937, when scientist Cynthia Longfield produced her pioneering book The Dragonflies of the British Isles, these familiar insects did not even have common English names, and were always referred to using scientific ones.Longfield – whose passion and expertise earned her the nickname Madame Dragonfly – began the slow process of creating vernacular names for each species. However, it was not until long after the second world war that the terms hawker, chaser, darter and skimmer were finally widely accepted. Several of these names are getting increasingly unsuitable, as species such as scarce chaser and Norfolk hawker become more widespread.Towards the end of the 20th century, birders like me began to take an interest in dragonflies and damselflies, which are often visible on hot summer days when birdlife can be hard to find. At the same time, other naturalists were also becoming fascinated by these charismatic creatures. As a result, there is now a network of experts all across the country, recording changes in range and noticing new arrivals.Trends over the past half-century are currently being analysed, using more than 1 million records gathered by these citizen scientists. Given that some species can only be told apart from one another by tiny differences in pattern, or, in the case of the common and scarce emeralds, by the shape of their anal appendages (yes, really), then expertise is certainly required.For the beginner, dragonflies and damselflies are, fortunately, relatively easy to tell apart. Dragonflies are generally much larger than their slenderer cousins, and many species sport distinctive patterns and colours. When perched, a dragonfly holds its wings out at right angles to its body – looking rather like a first world war biplane – whereas damselflies either hold their wings tight along their abdomen, or, in the case of the emeralds, at a 45-degree angle. Contrary to popular belief, neither are able to sting you, though dragonflies are fearsome predators of other insects, including their smaller relatives.With so many exciting new species colonising southern Britain, we should not ignore what is happening at the other end of the country. In Scotland, dragonfly expert and wildlife guide Jonathan Willet has noticed some significant changes over the past two or three decades. “Species that were once very rare and localised are getting much commoner and more widespread,” he tells me.For example, until quite recently the southern hawker was known from just a few scattered sites now it is found across much of the country, as far north as Aberdeenshire. He says: “Dragonflies are very mobile, so they are ideally placed to take advantage of changes in the climate, including a run of very mild winters.”Scotland’s rather limited dragonfly fauna has also been boosted by new arrivals, including the emperor and the migrant hawker, both of which have now managed to cross the border.It’s not all good news for Scotland’s dragonflies and damselflies. Warmer, drier summers are likely to cause some habitats to dry out, which could reduce numbers of northern specialists such as azure hawker, white-faced darter and northern emerald. Having been around for at least 300 million years, dragonflies are pretty adaptable but the rapid pace and unexpected consequences of the climate emergency means that some might struggle to cope.Dragonflies and damselflies certainly respond to changes in climatic conditions very rapidly, but they are not the only insects doing so (see below). Last summer, I caught up with the long-tailed blue butterfly, a Continental European species which invaded Sussex that year. This year I watched a large tortoiseshell butterfly – a species which disappeared as a British breeding species following the second world war – feeding on a buddleia bush on the Isle of Portland in Dorset.As with the mating pair of southern migrant hawkers, however, the thrill of seeing these new species was tempered by the knowledge that their colonisation is somehow ‘unnatural’, as it is being driven by anthropogenic climate change. Several butterfly and moth species are also close to colonising the UK.Large tortoiseshellThis larger cousin of the familiar small tortoiseshell vanished from the UK in the mid-20th century but recently it has started to appear at several sites in Dorset.Long-tailed blueOne of the world’s commonest butterflies, this species has been arriving in good numbers in summer along the Sussex coast.Camberwell beautyFirst identified in Camberwell in 1748, this butterfly occasionally turns up in the south-east.Jersey tigerClassified as ‘nationally scarce’, this strikingly patterned day-flying moth is seen in good numbers across southern Britain.Death’s-head hawkmothMade famous by The Silence of the Lambs, this huge and impressive hawkmoth, sporting a skull and crossbones on its thorax, is seen more and more often."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1a930d7dfc326c23790e20a56830ea36f61bbd79/0_0_5000_3000/master/5000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6f80106416f0c9d0d169c48b197c05d6","title":"naomi campbell it is time to reset the supermodel relishes a moment of change","story":"The world’s greatest supermodel has been a fearless champion of ersity in fashion for decades. Now she’s relishing a moment of changeAn upside of our new Zoom-operated civilisation is supposed to be the abolishment of lateness. It’s harder to justify when the commute is from your bed to the living room. Unless you’re Naomi Campbell, of course. Twenty minutes into waiting for her to join our call, a message pops up from a representative apologising that she’d be a few minutes late. Another 20 minutes and I’m told she’s “just working out how to sign in”. I’ve been expecting the wait, comparatively tame compared to the tales of four-hour stake-outs I’d heard from other journalists.And then, suddenly, she enters, and the atmosphere changes even in a virtual room, international accent first and then the face that launched 1,000 covers skin dewy and glowy, goddess-like impossibly high cheekbones and honey-blonde highlights. “Hi,” she says coyly. Polite but unapologetic. It’s fascinating to witness in real time this acute awareness of her own mythology an unspoken agreement with anyone she encounters that she will be operating according to her own time zone.The scene is made all the more surreal for me by how locally her story started. Naomi grew up in Streatham, south London, and attended Dunraven, a school that’s a bus ride from the house I currently sit in and is best known for the hood-famous disstrack Fuck Dunraven, penned by an excluded pupil. It’s difficult to conceive of a time Naomi Campbell was ever “from ends”, occupying a level of fame often reserved for black American juggernauts: Michelle Obama, Serena Williams, Oprah Winfrey. She’s easily the most famous black person in Britain and one of the most famous people in the world full-stop – meeting her feels like facing the final boss at the end of the Black Girl Magic hashtag. When I met her at the Fashion for Relief launch last year, people actually congratulated me.“I don’t think about the word ‘fame’,” she says, when I bring this up. “I really just feel that I’m me. I’m just Naomi. And that’s it.”Still, being “just Naomi” means being fashion royalty since puberty, a muse to the likes of Azzedine Alaïa and Karl Lagerfeld, a supermodel of the early 90s alongside Cindy Crawford, Claudia Schiffer and others. She, Linda Evangelista and Christy Turlington famously formed “The Trinity”, who now quaintly share a WhatsApp group.“They really put themselves out there, Linda and Christy, in terms of supporting me with designers back in the day who hadn’t used a model of colour yet,” she says. “We were friends outside of work.”Indeed, it’s well known the pair once famously told Dolce \u0026amp Gabbana: “If you don’t take Naomi, you don’t get us.” Racialised sidelining would be a theme in her early career, though her impact on the fashion world was near instant. Naomi started modelling at 15, in 1986, and covered British Elle just before her 16th birthday. Two years later, she became French Vogue’s first black cover girl. By 1989, two more covers: the first British black model to front British Vogue, and the first black model to cover US Vogue’s most distinguished edition of the year, the September issue. In January 1990, she was declared “the reigning megamodel of them all” by Interview magazine.These career highlights were not without difficulty. In a recent Woman’s Hour interview, she recalled crying at the sight of her 1988 Vogue Italia cover because of her “grey” makeup. The makeup artist didn’t have her shade, he said, because he didn’t know she was black.“Now it’s OK to speak up, right?” she says. “But when I spoke up when I was younger, I was ‘difficult’.”There was similar strain in the lead-up to her French Vogue cover, which came about after her friend and mentor Yves Saint Laurent threatened to withdraw his advertising from the publication if they continued to leave black models off their covers. Still, she does witness breakthroughs. Last year, she noted that her  Weekend cover marked the first time she had ever worked with a black photographer “on a mainstream publication”. This year, she had her first black photographer for a Vogue publication. She finds it galling that these are still milestones to pass.There’s still a great deal to celebrate in terms of her own history making. This year, she became the first ever face of Pat McGrath Labs makeup line, launched by the renowned black British makeup artist in 2015, who Naomi has known for over 25 years. At the height of quarantine, she appeared on the MayJune cover of black magazine Essence in celebration of both their 50th birthdays. She did her own hair, makeup and styling for the shoot, capturing the images on her iPhone.This ability to adapt is as integral to brand Naomi as her signature strut – she has managed to stay generationally relevant at the forefront of an entirely trend-led industry. Gen Z have come to fall for a more motherly iteration, affectionately dubbing her “aunty”. She laughs, properly now, when I ask how she feels about this new appellation.“I don’t feel old,” she assures me. “Even when I was called aunty 10 years ago. I’ve never felt old. I find them sweet!”This shift was solidified in July last year by a viral YouTube video of her inflight sanitising routine, depicting levels of both hypochondria and clean-freakishness that immigrant children know well (her choice of Dettol as cleaning agent reminded many a Tweeter of their Jamaican mum). “Clean everything you touch, anything that you could possibly touch,” Naomi instructed fans, wiping down the TV screen, pull-out tray, remote. She finished off her pre-Covid precautions with a pair of gloves and mask, which made her pandemic-era upgrade to full hazmat suit and goggles a whimsical but logical leap, and one the internet lapped up.Years ago, she dominated headlines for very different reasons. In 2000, she pleaded guilty to assault after throwing a phone at her personal assistant. Seven years later, she pleaded guilty to assaulting a former housekeeper. She arrived for community service at a New York City sanitation garage in a glittering $300,000 Dolce \u0026amp Gabbana gown, a move that was panned by the press as petty – the very reason her legion of younger fans love it. Other controversial examples from her past live on in gifs. Naomi taking the witness stand in the “blood diamonds” trial of former Liberian president Charles Taylor is immortalised in a meme often used to display eye-rolling disbelief. It is captioned: “She’s reaching, your honour.”“I’ve seen some of the memes,” she shrugs. “They make me laugh. I only recently figured out how to send a meme. Someone sent me one and I was like, ‘How do you do that?’”The youth celebrate the hedonistic Naomi suspended in 90s decadence alongside the matriarch they now know from No Filter with Naomi, her YouTube show, where she interviews fashion innovators. Her first foray into reality TV was as a coach on modelling competition The Face, where she frequently cut contestants down to size. A filter has not been added for her YouTube channel, nor for Amazon’s Making the Cut series, on which she is a judge. But she says young models appreciate the tough love approach. She’s taken a number under her wing, such as Anok Yai and Adut Akech, who has referred to her as a “second mother”.“I’m bossy and motherly,” Naomi says. “And I don’t want to see my babies go in the wrong direction, if I can say, ‘Don’t do that, do this.’ I don’t put my nose in, but if I’m asked, I’m going to give my opinion. And when they come running to me, I’m gonna pamper them.”With a career ning decades, she prides herself on having seen it all, the peaks and troughs of ersity, black falling in and out of fashion. At the moment, things seem to be moving in the right direction. Virgil Abloh is one of the most sought-after designers. Olivier Rousteing became the first black designer to run a major Paris house when he took over at Balmain in 2011, aged just 25. Gap recently inked an apparel deal with Kanye West. Fenty is the first fashion brand launched from scratch by LVMH since Christian Lacroix was founded in 1987, making Rihanna the first woman of colour at the top of an LVMH maison. Much of the ersity we see with models now, Naomi notes, she lobbied for with Bethann Hardison and Iman via the platform Black Girls Coalition. “Now I want to see them pay models of colour in the right way,” she says. “Now I want to see that the board seats are given, and no: ‘Let’s make a ersity board for this.’”As the Black Lives Matter movement continues to create change, there is also a touch of cynicism about the now-vocal voices that were silent when Naomi decried a lack of industry ersity before it was deemed “in” to do so. “I’m sticking to the people that I’ve spoken to before,” she scoffs. “I’m not trying to jump on any new bandwagon. So, now we’re allowed to speak up? We weren’t allowed to before – who’s given the permission? I’ve given myself the permission – if I feel a certain way and I’m in a situation that I don’t think is right, I’m gonna speak it.“I understand that a lot of people didn’t want to then, or thought, ‘If I do, am I gonna lose my job?’” she continues. “I get it. Listen, better late than never. But I have not changed in this aspect, in terms of what’s going on in the world now, from how I was 15, 20 years ago.”It is this consistent push for change, paired with past mistakes, that’s made her such a compelling figure. Decades of charity work have been at times obscured by scandal. In 2005 she set up Fashion for Relief, a catwalk show and auction that’s raised millions for various charities. Last year, she was awarded the Fashion Icon award at the Royal Albert Hall in London for her contributions to the fashion industry, as well as her philanthropic work. The honour reduced her to rarely seen tears. “I learned today that I’m the first woman of colour to receive this award,” she said in her speech, voice cracking. And, of course, there’s her ongoing work in many African nations, supporting everything from infrastructure to women’s rights, a love affair that started in South Africa in 1993 and saw Nelson Mandela name her his “Honorary Granddaughter”.“I just love the people, love the vibe” she says. “It’s just been a continent that’s just been ignored and only cared about for their resources. What about them as the wonderful people that they are?”It’s more likely now than ever. After the launch of the chart came the Disney + release of Beyonce’s long-anticipated Black Is King album, which pays homage to Africa’s erse cultures. It features artists from across the continent. Campbell herself appears in the Brown Skin Girl video, alongside Kelly Rowland, Lupita Nyong’o and her mentee Adut Akech. The album has elicited largely positive reactions, though the Chicago rapper Noname wrote it off as “an African aesthetic draped in capitalism”, and it has reignited But the so-called “diaspora wars” continue to plague online spaces.“Diaspora wars?” Naomi repeats, confused. I explain to her that it references the mainly digital infighting among the world’s black communities: African Americans vs Black Brits, Caribbeans v Africans, everyone versus Nigerians. “There’s no time for that,” she tuts. “In order for this to really work and grasp this that is our time, we have to be together. There’s no other way. There’s no time for separating. I’m not into that,” and she shoos the notion away with an elegant flick of the wrist. How could she be, when so many across the diaspora feel they have a personal stake in celebrating her success as theirs as a “Jamaican aunty”, as Mandela’s granddaughter, as the south London schoolgirl who conquered the world?Naomi Campbell: an updated two-volume portfolio published by Taschen at £100, is out now (taschen)"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cebec942dbc2928c4f5dc91fc7f69cae439112b9/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0a472e50990b597f1523311f37e1139c","title":"the edit kaftans in pictures","story":"Throw on a relaxed and stylish kaftan in a bold print or a classic stripe for a chilled day at the beach – or just for garden cocktails...

It’s bad news for minority authors, says former Booker prize judgeOver the summer, novelist and screenwriter David Nicholls has been something of a hero. With a humorous nod to the less glamorous aspects of publishing life – hastily defrosted canapés and eked-out warm white wine – the author of One Day and adaptor of the Patrick Melrose novels has thrown a series of Twitter book launches, amplifying new releases from writers including (but far beyond) the big names who will automatically elicit review space and window displays. The responses from the authors, especially the debutants, to gaining the imprimatur of a much-loved and huge-selling colleague, and from readers to discovering books to connect with in a time of such immense disconnection, has been powerful and touching. It’s a particularly nice example of someone paying it forward.Nicholls’s virtual launches have been held every Thursday, the day new books are traditionally published in the UK, but this week’s will be his last. Quite possibly, his publishers have reminded him that the paperback edition of his own book, Sweet Sorrow, needs some love, or perhaps he wants to get on with writing another.It’s fortunate for him – although arguably less so for the world of books – that he’s bowing out before 3 September. On that day, in a development that has provoked anguish among booksellers, editors, reviewers and readers, almost 600 new books will be published, an increase of about a third from last year. There is such a thing as a crowded market, and then there is this: an avalanche of words that no retailer or media outlet could hope to accommodate. Even Waterstones Piccadilly, the chain’s flagship London store, is feeling the strain, one of the team writing on Twitter: “We are big and I doubt we’ll stock them all. No one has enough space for this.” They added: “We’ll do what we always do. Choose the books we think our Piccadilly customers will love most and those that we can honestly recommend.”Why the surge? Largely, of course, it’s the pandemic: with bookshops closed and literary festivals and events cancelled or significantly shrunk and moved online, publishers moved swaths of their publication dates to later in the year. Festivals are still in abeyance, albeit with virtual events, but publishing houses – and their authors, many in extreme need of their publication payments, which usually represent a third of their advance against royalties – had to do something. To shift entire programmes to next year, its landscape still highly uncertain, would be to kick the can down a highly congested road.But 3 September – just the first of a series of similar days throughout the autumn – is a problem. Waterstones Piccadilly has vast premises, but others – including the independent bookshops attempting to weather 2020’s storm – must rely on heavily curated selections and hard choices. For an industry that has suffered a series of shocks – including the collapse of wholesaler Bertrams, owing £25m to its creditors – autumn will be tough. For literary editors presiding over fewer pages for book reviews the issues are similarly intractable.As ever, certain realities prevail. It is implausible that the autumn’s big releases – which include Martin Amis, Roberts Harris and Galbraith, David Attenborough, Elena Ferrante, Caitlin Moran, Nick Hornby, Ant and Dec and Will Young, plus the cookery books that so often top the charts in the run-up to Christmas – will go under the radar there is simply too much marketing spend and, generally though not inevitably, too much public appetite for that to happen.And yet recent months have also intensified long overdue conversations about representation in publishing, and the need for radically overhauling both the systems and sensibilities that dictate who and what ends up in bookshops. Covid-19 has not created an arena in which writers of colour, working-class writers and writers living with disabilities have been marginalised and struggled to find an outlet for their stories, but it would be a travesty of publishing and bookselling’s core mission – to put the best array of writing in front of readers – if it were to make that arena even smaller. It’s not what the literary world’s most dedicated workers, who in better times turn out to eat their semi-defrosted canapés and chug their tepid Sauvignon Blanc with gusto – want or are working towards. Let’s hope the Super Thursday to end all Super Thursdays doesn’t drown them out."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c9eb4e2681c2bfa1c080cdde258367652c698f21/0_0_3130_1878/master/3130.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=02968dbb1f44bcd907a8474bbd94239f","title":"best thing i ate all summer chefs memorable lockdown dishes","story":"Chefs and food writers pick their memorable dishes in a season transformed by coronavirus. Standout moments: ice cream in Sicily and pizza from a secret vanI’ve never cooked as much as I have this spring and summer. Cooking has been sustenance, pastime, balm and escapism. I’ve shrugged off the reins of my usual Chinese habits and cooked more eclectically: Thai food, Sri Lankan curries, crumpets, quiche. But I think the meal that’s given me most satisfaction was a roast guinea fowl, prepared according to Judy Rodgers’ famed chicken recipe in the Zuni Café Cookbook.I fancied making something simple – forgetting that the recipe is five pages long and meticulous. The bird was pre-salted, sprigged with herbs, roasted in a hot oven and then served in pieces on a complicated, delicious bread salad made with green leaves, pine nuts and currants. On the side were boiled Jersey royals with tarragon mayonnaise and grilled asparagus. Finally, because Chinese thinking suggested something was needed to balance the richness of the other dishes and perk up the colour scheme, I made a salad of sliced pink grapefruit with chopped shallots, chives and olive oil.Roasting a whole bird rather than parts felt like a joyful symbol of the easing of lockdown, and the possibility of cooking for other people once again.fuchsiadunlopI’d been experimenting with dry-ageing duck, salting the breast, then leaving it in the fridge skin-side up so the skin gets very dry. I went into the garden at the Sportsman and picked white onions, a couple of handfuls of peas, lemon verbena and thyme that still had the flowers on. I pan-roasted the duck, and while it was cooking, sliced the onions and cooked them gently with butter and a tablespoon of water. I podded the peas, chopped the pods and added those to the onion trimmings and a little dried mushroom, and made a stock. When the duck rested, I added the peas to the stock and onions, with a little more butter, and stirred through the herbs and flowers. I put it in a shallow bowl, then sliced the duck on top. When you have fresh produce like that, the key is to cook things very gently: that’s all it needs for the flavours to shine. HO thesportsmanseasalterI’ve been cooking at home a lot. Let me first tell you about my failure. My son and I got interested in reproducing takeaways, because some of the offerings where we are in Devon aren’t great. We made a green curry burgers a kebab – and the bread to go with it. Our soup dumplings looked really good, but when I steamed them all the liquid came out. My son still liked them, maybe most of all, so it was all right. We’ve been buying fish and supporting local fishermen, as there were still a few people down here going out. Because my son really loves lobster, one Sunday we grilled one with herb butter and asparagus. Being locked up with a 17-year-old wasn’t ideal, but seeing his face as he ate lobster, that was the best thing in lockdown for me. HOwildartichokesLockdown has left me with an urge to spend as much time out of the house as possible, so I’ve been taking every opportunity to cook outdoors. I load up a tray, lay my chopping board and bowls on a garden table, and slice my way through a mountain of vegetables to barbecue. I’ve also been making flatbread and naan dough outside and by taking everything out on a neatly organised prep tray I can whisk up a dressing while I turn things on the barbecue. I’ve been trying to buy sustainable British charcoal and using dried garden twigs to smoke food. There’s that nice feeling of going slightly feral by cooking outside over an open fire. Even my dog has developed a taste for lightly barbecued cauliflower. HOThe Roasting Tin Around the World (Square Peg) is out now rukmini-iyerThe lettuce had been cut and the potatoes dug. The chard sat in bunches like floral bouquets. The radishes in wooden crates, their leaves tied together with white rubber bands.And then the restaurants closed. The markets too, and with them, the possibility that the vegetables may have been harvested in vain. Worse still, the cycle had begun months ago, long before lockdown. You can’t tell a field of peas to stop growing.A shuttered restaurant is just the visible face of a long chain that includes not only furloughed staff but suppliers, laundries, maintenance workers and drivers. The need to find a home for the food being grown for their tables was urgent. Box schemes were set up where you could order online and food arrived at your door. Beans and spinach found a home, flowers found a vase, farm workers could be paid.The box scheme I joined brought cucumbers and dill, parsley, heads of lettuce and bags of rocket, all delivered by the restaurant for which it had been grown. As I clicked on “vegetable box – buy” I scrolled down to find the restaurant’s kitchen had been busy too. There were ginger cakes and rye loaves, cookie dough and cordials. It was then I saw the ice-cream.The elderflower and lemon ice-cream arrived tucked among the chard, in a waxed cardboard tub. I prized off the lid to find not the creamy white ice I expected but one the colour of apricots. Here was an ice somewhere between ice-cream and sorbet, fruit and flower, as sharp as it was sweet. It had the soothing notes of vanilla and the fizz and froth of sherbet. I tucked in, slowly, a teaspoon at a time.The Fern Verrow vegetable box and Spring ice-cream are available from springrestaurant-shopRavneet GillPastry chef and authorAll my friends know I am not a salad girl. When I’m working in restaurants, I just eat carbs, pasta and rice. But lockdown has changed me. I’ve been baking every day it’s sugary and you’re tasting all the time, so I haven’t wanted big heavy meals. I was craving fresh Asian food, so I started making a prawn and peanut salad.I’ve been thinking about this salad, a lot. It’s taken weeks and weeks, and I’ve finally nailed it. Black vinegar is key, and you need good fish sauce, loads of lime juice, a bit of sugar and lovely vegetables. I always use the pre-roasted, salted peanuts because I’m lazy, and for prawns, I go to my fishmonger or Waitrose. The dressing is acidic it has that balance of sharpness and a bit of sweetness. It’s super fresh, crunchy, and I just feel healthy when I eat it. Now I’m a salad person. MTHRavneet Gill’s The Pastry Chef’s Guide (Pavilion) is out nowThis summer I became a hunter-gatherer, my senses highly tuned in the search for food. This didn’t just involve foraging, it also meant going down on hands and knees on the floor of my local Co-op, peering under shelves. I became more of an opportunist. Six weeks into lockdown, a friend of a friend spread an unbelievable rumour on WhatsApp: at 7pm a van with a wood-fired pizza oven would be parked at the bottom of a lane nearby. “Don’t mention this to anyone,” it ended. Was this illegal pizza? If I went out for margherita would I return as a super-spreader? That night the sky was dark but as I rounded a corner into the lane, I saw something magical: a fairy-lit van framed by a rainbow. As I waited, I talked to a furloughed worker from a bookshop and we helped each other with the impossible task what to choose when you don’t know when you’ll get to do this again? I opted for the prosciutto. By the time I got home, it was 8 o’clock, so the pizza waited as I clapped with my neighbours. Was it the best pizza I’ve ever tasted? No. But it was the one I needed most.Last Harvest by Dan Saladino : A Search for the World’s Most Endangered Foods is published by Jonathan Cape in 2021One of my desert island dishes is the spicy cumin lamb hand-pulled noodles from Xi’an Famous Foods in New York. So when Ixta Belfrage, a development chef at Ottolenghi, posted her recipe on Instagram, I decided to recreate it.These noodles are known as “biang biang” in Chinese. It’s phonetic, the words “biang biang” sound like the noodles when they are slapping on the kitchen counter. I used cull yaw, the meat of an older ewe, from Matt Chatfield, who usually supplies leading restaurants. The meat loses the lamby smell and ends up being more beefy. The noodles have this beautiful bouncy, chewy texture and the sauce a deep flavour from the cull yaw with the spice from cumin, and heat from Sichuan peppercorns.The joy of lockdown was having the time to recreate these dishes. Now I have the knowledge that I can make them too. MTHsambalshiokIt was the octopus tostada. Maybe the empanada or the deep leafy green mole what won it. Late-June Copenhagen felt almost post-covid. Numbers near zero, everything already opened for a month. We were nervous but needing to eat.We had wanted somewhere small. Simple in the best sense. Nothing fancy that would take too long. So Sanchez near the main station in the old red light district, at Istedgade 60. A cantina, not a New Nordic restaurant. We sat at the side bar by an open door, separated from the kitchen by sheets of Perspex. The meal was a sort of Mexican omakase. No choice. A small series of small plates of exquisitely crafted food.Rosio Sanchez was once a development chef at Noma. She knows which combinations work. Brilliant iterations of Mexican classics served with a smile. There were a couple of beers, there may have been a mescal. We watched the cooks work. Perfect plate after perfect plate. Our taste buds danced. All our food senses wide awake. We relaxed and we remembered why we eat in restaurants.It has been a joyfully erratic summer as far as eating goes a dance of last-minute barbecues, restaurant DIY kits, and one blustery family picnic that united deli-bought quiche and hot fistfuls of chicken-shop chips. Fittingly, then, there was something wholly unplanned about my most vivid food memory.Feeling a building hunger after a mid-July work meeting, I rode my bike towards Borough Market, weighing lunch options and dismissing all of them. Then I spotted Rice Error: the Bao restaurant group’s lockdown-prompted Taiwanese takeaway and delivery spin-off, operating out of a tucked-away hatch.Minutes later and I was perched in an abandoned courtyard, unwrapping a bamboo box to reveal a rumpled duvet of fluffy omelette, splotched with sriracha and nestled on a lively, umami-forward tumble of Chi Shang rice and mapo-spiced aubergine and tofu.There was a bag of sweet potato fries double-crisped by a salt-flecked batter and served with a neon purple, unaccountably delicious, pickled plum ketchup.The sky was as grey as the pavement, my only companions a couple of morose, crumb-seeking pigeons. Every bite felt like a holiday.Itamar SrulovichChef and co-owner, Honey \u0026amp Co, Honey \u0026amp Smoke, Honey \u0026amp SpiceWe were getting ready to reopen Honey \u0026amp Smoke after more than 100 days of lockdown – we hung sanitisers and put tape on the floor, briefed and trained the team, we burned sage for a ritual cleanse.The restaurant’s head chef plated the new dish for the team to taste – courgette kibbe with cashew tahini and a summery salad in pale green, dotted with cheeks of apricot. It looked so appealing: normally it would be devoured in seconds by everyone in the area, now we all stood around it, far from each other, not sure what to do, realising that we cannot all taste from the same plate. This was one of many little heartbreaks when we realised what the new normal entailed, like not being able to hug someone you haven’t seen since March, or sit together at staff lunch – small things we must do to stop the pandemic.It is a longstanding tradition in our company that whenever someone opens a watermelon they set a plate for staff and guests.As we all stood around that kibbe, one of the chefs came from downstairs with a platter of beautifully sliced watermelon and we each took a slice and sunk our teeth in – cold, sweet, refreshing, a distillation of so many summer memories, as good as it always was.An old tradition a new way for all of us to share food. What a weird summer this is.honeyandcoJoseph Benjamin restaurant in Chester started doing food to reheat at home. The two best things I ate this summer were by them. The first was a paella, which comes in a proper paella pan, for which they charge a little deposit. It has chicken, runner beans, butter beans, and saffron – obviously.The other thing is their beef – they do a brisket you can pick up. They’re known in Chester for their Sunday roast, and they started doing it for people at home while they’ve been closed, and it’s just as great. When lockdown started they were doing other things, like cooking for homeless people in Chester. They’re good guys. HOelitebistrosOne Sunday, I woke up with an urge to cook something I’d been craving for days, a much-celebrated Sindhi recipe – dal pakwan. I am lucky to have got this recipe from my mum’s neighbour, who would always send us a tiffin box full of it whenever she made it for her family.Making dal pakwan took me right back to my parents’ dining table. The dal (lentil) used in this dish is chana dal. It’s cooked with the most basic of spices and finished with fragrant ghee tadka (tempering). This is then served with pakwan, which are deep-fried flatbreads but more like crispy pastry.The crispiness of the pakwan with the spices and creaminess of the dal is enhanced with fresh herbs and chutneys – zingy coriander, and sour and sweet tamarind. The dish is finished with crunchy onions and juicy tomatoes. All this together on a plate is heaven.chetnamakanClaire PtakChef, author and owner, Violet BakeryYou can smell the smoke from Yum Yum Caribbean in Hackney Downs from my front door. One day, I walked outside, and … “They’re back! Yum Yum is open!”I always get the fried chicken, rice and peas, and coleslaw. The chicken is so tender and crispy, seasoned really well and I’m sure there are a few secret ingredients in there too. It reminds me of being home in the US and having amazing fried chicken.I was worried about Yum Yum because it is an independent business, and knowing what was going on for me, well …When I smelled that smoke, and went by the shop, it made me feel optimistic that businesses are going to reopen and be OK. I’m still really worried, and we don’t know what will happen, but it made me feel proud of people for persevering because it’s hard, it’s really hard. MTHAnissa HelouChef and authorI started making bouza, Arabic ice-cream, some 25 years ago when I wrote Lebanese Cuisine. Since then, I have had off and on phases. However, with the lockdown in Sicily, where I am based, I renewed my passion. I had all the ingredients in my pantry: best quality salep, a thickening agent of ground and dried wild orchid tubers from Safranbolu in Turkey, mastic from Chios, and rose and orange blossom water from Lebanon. I was able to buy unpasteurised milk from a woman in a nearby village who had 200 cows grazing in the mountains. I also had Kashmiri saffron. I spent days whisking salep into simmering milk to give it the incredible chewy and stretchy texture that is so typical of bouza to make the base for either the pure milk version flavoured with rose water and mastic, or the Iranian bastani flavoured with ground saffron infused in rose water. I had ice-cream in the morning, in the afternoon and before going to bed. Truly the best thing I had this summer!I sat on the terrace of the Seaside Boarding House – set on a cliff at a point where Chesil Beach becomes the Jurassic Coast – tucking into a tureen of fish soup rich with crab and any fish landed fresh that day. Made fragrant with tomatoes, saffron and herbs, it was accompanied by a feisty rouille so good you could drink the whole bowl while munching on thin slices of bread cooked crisp with olive oil. Alastair Little, an old pal of Mary Lou, who runs the Boarding House, gave the recipe to her after their years in Soho when Mary Lou ran the Groucho, and Alastair ran his eponymous restaurant on Frith Street.

The reaction of her rivals ranged from patronising to full-on hostileJulie Welch can still remember how it felt to cover her first football game. Pushing through the press box, desperately trying not to bang into anyone or draw attention to the fact that she was not simply the only woman there, but the first to enter this most hallowed of spaces, terrified that she would find herself unable to write.It was August 1973, Coventry City were playing Tottenham Hotspur and Welch, who was filing to the Observer, was 24. “Covering that first game, it almost felt like a bit of a dare,” she says, sitting in her house in Blackheath, south London. “Like a trick you might try out at school and see if you could get away with it. I expected someone to tap me on the shoulder and tell me I had to leave.”The Fleet Street Girls is both a witty love letter to a vanished era when typewriters clacked long into the night and the filing of copy was punctuated by reviving trips to El Vino’s wine bar, and an honest picture of an era when women writers frequently struggled to be taken seriously. They had to battle not only workplace misogyny but a wider society that wasn’t happy about women handling their own finances – let alone holding down high-powered jobs.“I really wanted to ensure all sorts of stories were told,” Welch says of the decision to talk to a variety of women from celebrity interviewer Lynn Barber and former You magazine editor Sue Peart to long-standing Observer secretary Edie Reilly. “Partially because my own time in journalism was so short, and also wanting to show how much changed over that period – and how much didn’t.”Her own experiences weren’t always pleasant. While the Observer sports desk, including the celebrated Hugh McIlvanney, were “marvellous”, not everyone was happy that a woman had been allowed to cover the beautiful game.“I did find it really awful at times,” she admits. “One sports writer was just horrible. He used to go on about the Observer’s gimcrack football reporter. When I returned briefly during the Crazy Gang era, he got so outraged at seeing me again he actually shoved a chair into the side of my leg. I can’t quite bring myself to name him because I’m still a bit scared of him.”While that particular reporter was an extreme case, plenty still refused to see her presence as anything more than a gimmick. “It was terribly frustrating, because I’d grown up loving the game. I had a brain, and I knew how to follow a match as well as any of the beardy, sweaty men alongside me.”There were plenty of good times, however. Welch, who was 22 when she started at the Observer, working as secretary to the sports editor Clifford Makins, was newly married with a young son. She had suffered postnatal depression and says when she began her job “my world turned from monochrome into colour”.“I still remember that summer’s day stepping out of Blackfriars station in my mini-dress and my silly shoes and hat and feeling this was it. The whole thing felt so wonderful.“There was a romance to it, being part of that whole great Fleet Street tradition.” She breaks off and laughs: “Of course, in the first few years in particular I did spend most of my days completely pissed.”A lifelong Tottenham fan – one of her first post-journalism jobs was writing the television play Those Glory, Glory Days about her teen passion for Danny Blanchflower – she grew up fascinated by the stories in football, “the way there were heroes and villains and crisis and redemption”. She got her break after Arthur Hopcraft, the Observer’s chief football reporter, said he was bored with covering matches.From there interviews and profiles followed. She memorably convinced Leeds hard-man Norman “Bites Yer Legs” Hunter to open up about how emotional playing made him. , Irascible football manager Brian Clough and tennis legend Arthur Ashe would become godfathers to her two sons from her second marriage to Ron Atkin, who became the Observer’s sports editor after Makins left.“I don’t think I can remember meeting a shitty footballer,” she says. “They were all just super.”“I remember walking with Brian Clough one day and Lucas, my middle son, his godson, was there and he’s lovely with him, chucking him in the air, and I just said, ‘Oh Brian, you are a good man,’ and he laughed and said, ‘I wish I was, love, I wish I was.’ But to me he was. His wife, Barbara, was too. They were just nice people.”She struggled after first leaving Fleet Street. “I felt it was time to try womaning. I’d married again and I wanted to stop travelling around, but I did find life outside really dull. I missed the conversation and the wit. It all just seemed a bit bland and colourless and I had no idea how to talk to the neighbours because I was still me – a bit weird and obsessed with sport and slightly pissed…”She managed to adjust and carved out a solid career as a playwright and screenwriter. These days she writes books about her beloved Spurs and enjoys “ultra events”. “It used to be long-distance running, but now it’s more like long-distance walking,” she says, admitting she remains nostalgic for what once was, bad times and all.“It sounds grim to say that there will never be another time in my life that felt like this, but it’s true,” she says with a wide grin. “Because I had felt as though I was dead, then I came alive again. In that sense walking into the Observer was like walking into heaven.” She laughs again. “When I look back, it really was such a marvellous life.”• The Fleet Street Girls by Julie Welch is published by Trapeze Books (£16.99) To order a copy for £14.78 go to bookshop.

No matter. Fail again. Fail in pretty much exactly the same way.How many times, Pep, how many times? The idea that Pep Guardiola over‑complicates knockout games has become such a truism it seems impossible a manager of such clarity of thought could still be following that pattern still finding ways to insert his own anxieties, his maniacal intellectualism into the fine details of elite knockout football.And yet, here we are once again. Hello tactical confusion my old friend. On a thrilling, frantic night in Lisbon Pep Guardiola picked a Manchester City team to play an entirely un-Manchester City game, straight-jacketing this pass-and-move machine into a strangely muted shape, apparently with the aim of mirroring the three-man defence of Olympique Lyonnais, the seventh best team in France.To put this in its simplest form: by the 50th minute in the Estádio José Alvalade, João Cancelo, Kyle Walker, Rodri, Fernandinho and Ilkay Gündogan had touched the ball 288 times. Riyad Mahrez, Bernardo Silva, Phil Foden and David Silva had touched the ball zero times. And City had spent more than half of this eventual 3-1 defeat crouched behind a mannered defensive guard.Kyle Walker as a bespoke man-marking wing-back-cum creative overlapper? Is this really a good idea right now? Certainly Walker gave it a go, haring up and down, whirling into unmapped spaces, a man doing an impressively intense free-running parkour circuit while all around him a Champions League tie was taking place. Elsewhere, the manager who loves midfielders gave us surely one of the drabbest midfields of his entire career.For 60 minutes City shuttled from side to side. Kevin De Bruyne, the great creative talent of the Premier League, struggled to find space. Why do this? Why suck out the joy and the freedom just when it was needed most? For these players it must have felt like being invited to perform your triumphant new No 1 hit single, and deciding en route to the studios to go with the 10-minute jazz odyssey instead. We came in search of that sublime expressive entity of the last two years. Instead we got an hour of nose flute and drum solos.Guardiola was predictably unpredictable from the start, opting for a back three, with his squad’s three main holding midfielders starting either in or in front of the defence. No doubt City were concerned about Lyon’s mobility in midfield and their intelligent forward surges. In the event they forgot to bring their own quiver of arrows, as for 20 minutes the team that always goes forward barely mustered an attack.Then Lyon scored. It came from a knot in that City backline, as Walker lingered in an empty space, playing Karl Toko Ekambi onside. A saving tackle sent the loose ball towards Maxwel Cornet, who finished brilliantly.City’s players worked hard. De Bruyne was prominent, albeit strapped into a stilted system. On his touchline Rudi Garcia looked puzzled, man trying not to make too much noise for fear of breaking the spell. For an hour his team had been asked to do nothing different, to perform only within their comfort zone. When, you wondered, would Garcia be forced into some uncomfortable contortion by the super-brain in the opposite corner? What was this? A rope-a-dope?Eventually Mahrez came on for Fernandinho and an equaliser was a more familiar kind of City moment. Mahrez eased Raheem Sterling in down the left. His fine pullback was struck firmly into the corner by De Bruyne.And yet from there it was Garcia who won the in-game flow of move and counter-move, bringing on Moussa Dembélé and pressing his team forward when they might have been swamped.There were some details that could have changed the narrative. Lyon’s second goal was, arguably, awarded within the rules. But it still stank. First Ekambi received a pass from Houssem Aouar in an offside position. He jumped over the ball, which counts as a non-involvement, a point of view that confounds any kind of good sense. In the meantime Aymeric Laporte was sent sprawling by a collision with Dembélé, who ran on and scored. No foul was given.Then, with four minutes left, Sterling missed an extraordinary open goal from eight yards out with the tie there to be revived. Within a minute it was decisively dead as Dembélé tapped home at the other end.Afterwards Guardiola seemed a little vague, perhaps even a tiny bit relieved to escape this weird, distended season. Either way, defeat makes it three in four quarter-finals for City, and a decade without a Champions League final for the most revered club coach of the age. Perhaps one of these days Guardiola will overthink a European knockout game so hard that he’ll accidentally play his normal team and win it. The great shame is that City exited without having ever quite been themselves, and without ever expressing their finer qualities. And once again Guardiola had blinked with the line in sight."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e7c2cb6aad07558f8565eba55258e15d00759834/0_8_2741_1644/master/2741.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=105b415bb50b40fdcb5b89e218ef8481","title":"david goldblatt what is a football club its supporters","story":"Fans’ collective web of stories, memories and identities is what makes the game matter• Time to reset: more brilliant ideas to remake the worldThe eerie, tepid games of football played without crowds have been one of the pandemic’s stranger sights. Accompanied by the AI noise engine that provides the soundtrack for football video games, they have been disquieting.Why should watching Liverpool or Norwich, otherwise unchanged from before lockdown, feel so one-dimensional? What is a football club? The players and coaches come and go, owners and shareholders buy, sell up and move on, and they endure. Stadiums seem to embody them, until they are knocked down and relocated, but the club’s existence is unbroken. Even the legal entity that constitutes a club can be expunged and liquidated, only for the same club to rise again in a new form.They can perform such alchemy because, in fact, football clubs are their supporters and the collective web of stories, memories and identities woven between themselves and the team over time: the stuff that makes football matter. Without the real energies of real people, the digital spectacle has proved hollow, however good the play. Were it to continue in this form, its commercial appeal would dim.Yet English and Scottish football clubs have, since the 19th century, been in private hands. In the past two decades, consortia of local businesspeople and regional magnates have given way to multimillionaires and then billionaires foreign states and their agencies oligarchs and former prime ministers. Some are reasonable custodians, some are asset-strippers, some are chancers and most are disingenuous egotists. Either way, none of them should be able to profit from or control these deep, shared, cultural entities.• David Goldblatt is the author of The Age Of Football: The Global Game In The Twenty-first Century (Macmillan)"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8d7b206623a179f157b2a1b9171d6d31a4011cfc/0_274_3648_2189/master/3648.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c344f2b3afa6986d5fe61c923ce89acd","title":"my older partner is a gambler and keeps asking for money mariella frostrup","story":"Stop giving her cash, says Mariella Frostrup. It’s not good for either of you if you become her financial cushionThe dilemma My partner and I have been together for two years and I could not be more in love with her. We spend our days laughing until our stomachs hurt. The problem is that she is 36 and a recovering gambling addict while I am 24 and have just recently graduated. She has accumulated several years of debt from friends, family and loan sharks. I naively lent her almost £2,000 from my savings at the beginning of our relationship. She told me at the time she needed it to pay her rent, but I’ve since found out she gambled it away.Despite the fact that I earn less than her, she consistently runs out of money halfway through the month and I end up paying joint expenses. She pays me back, so other than the initial £2,000, which she has not yet started to pay back, I don’t end up out of pocket for too long. However, it is beginning to get me down.My savings are now almost depleted and I want to keep the rest. However, she knows about the money and I feel like I cannot say no when she asks to borrow from me. Her mother recently called her in tears because she didn’t have enough for her rent and my partner expected me to lend it to her. Am I selfish for resenting this when I come from a much more stable background than she does?Mariella replies Truth be told, not at all. The first thing we need to address is that you describe your partner as a recovering gambling addict. On the basis of what you’ve written I’m not sure the word “recovering” is appropriate. Taking £2,000 out of a graduating student’s meagre savings and failing to pay it back (and then delving further into your dwindling funds) is the act of a desperate, irresponsible adult.My suspicion is that your partner is still gambling or, at the very least, has retained that fluctuating emotional addiction to her fiscal ups and downs. It would certainly explain her monthly funding crisis. I’m also concerned by her presumption that you are a kind of cash-cow on call to help her wider family with their financial woes. It’s so inappropriate that my suspicion is that the money was not for her mother at all, but to cover her own needs.I want you to wake up and take a hard look at your circumstances. You are young with your future ahead of you. You have to ask yourself if this is an acceptable basis for a romantic relationship. Your longer letter indicates that you are in a same-sex relationship and it might be clearer if you were to turn this around: if this was a man 12 years your senior pressuring you for money, we would be much more censorious.I would encourage you to contact a gambling addicts’ organisation (visit gamblersanonymous.org.uk and gamcare.org.uk) in order to be better advised on what to look out for in case your partner’s problem really is an ongoing issue and, if so, to help her get the guidance she needs. Even if she’s not gambling, this flow of money from your account to hers and the presumption that you are duty-bound to personally subsidise her carefree spending habits has to stop. Just because you love someone doesn’t mean it’s incumbent on you to roll over and do your party trick every time they command.Supporting your partner’s irresponsible attitude to money is not an act of love and may well be detrimental to her in terms of her addiction. A functional relationship is either about sex and fun and a sell-by day, or the potential for evolution into the contentment and security that proves better glue for the long-term. A strong partnership creates a buffer against the vicissitudes of the wider world and makes the sacrifices worth the investment. You may have the former right now, but you’ll need to put some serious work into achieving the latter. Belly laughs are a good start, because if you can’t laugh together you definitely can’t stay together. But mutual respect, appreciation and understanding are also qualities that should be on your long-term list.It’s not respectful of your girlfriend to treat you as a cashpoint. If taking a position on that causes a long-term rift, you’re better to do it now and escape from a relationship whose roots are mired in an addiction that you are powerless against. Alternatively, if your partner has simply developed a set of bad financial habits, you need to stand your ground and put her straight on why you can no longer be her financial cushion.You have nothing to feel guilty about. Being a responsible adult who takes care of your money is not a privilege, it’s a choice and one you’ve clearly made at a young age. That’s something to be proud of. It’s not something you need to compromise on for love. If you continue to allow yourself to be unfairly subsidising this woman’s life, the laughs will soon dry up. I urge you not to let that coincide with the day when you see a zero balance on your bank account.

He is director of the Francis Crick Institute and was head of Cancer Research UK. He has also been president of the Royal Society. What Is Life? is his first book and it seeks to explain biology in five steps.Your book is a reminder of the fundamental importance of cells. Do you think cells have been overshadowed by genes in the public imagination?I’m a geneticist, so I’ve lived through molecular genetics and molecular biology and that has focused a lot on genes. I do think cells have not caught the attention of the world in perhaps the way they should have done, because it’s the fundamental unit of life. I sometimes use this analogy: it’s like biology’s atom. It’s not the gene, it’s the cell.During the Covid-19 crisis, you’ve been critical of ministers and advisers, comparing them to blancmange. Do you think we need to rethink that relationship between politicians and advisers?Yes, I do. I’m particularly concerned about the attempt to convey communication through one-liners such as “we’re following the science”. It’s a sort of populist tendency and that reduces complex situations to an almost meaningless sentence. I also think we need more clarity about how decisions are made. For example, testing for coronavirus was absolutely critical. What they decided to do was produce very big labs to do it, not thinking that this would take many months to get it to work efficiently. Whereas they could have developed it locally and contributed something immediately. All the testing capacity basically did nothing during the big infection phase. That was very bad policy and implemented badly, but we didn’t see the discussions behind those decisions.Another area of concern for you is the effect of Brexit on the science community. Do you see any cause for optimism there?Not really. There are three major science blocs in the world, which are North America, China and the far east and Europe. Britain is actually good at science and had a lot of influence in European science. And so we have lost power and influence. That’s a political thing. The psychological thing is that I meet scientific colleagues around the world and they just think that the UK has turned away from collaborative science by looking back on an imperial history that no longer exists. It’s just very sentimental. And we’ve taken a leap several decades into the past.You mention an extraordinary personal story in the book: that you found out that your sister was actually your mother. How has it affected your sense of identity?I was in my late 50s when I found out. I was living in New York and I was president of a research university called Rockefeller University. I applied for a green card and was turned down, which was a bit of a surprise because I had a Nobel prize, I was president of a university and I was knighted. It was because they didn’t like my birth certificate, which didn’t name my parents. So I applied for a full birth certificate and discovered the truth. I’m astonished that my parents, who were my grandparents, managed to keep this all quiet. As my actual mother and grandparents were dead, I had no recourse to find out exactly what happened. I would like to know who my father is. I mean, I’m a geneticist. I’m actually quite a good geneticist. And I lived for half a century not knowing my own genetics. I hope I find out before I eventually die.Your main area of research is in yeast, but you became head of Cancer Research UK. How far away do you think science is from gaining some cellular grip on cancer?Our understanding of cancer has really dramatically improved. We understand the cellular basis of it, the genetic origins of it, the ways in which it’s caused, the way in which the regulatory circuits get altered in cancer cell tissue, which is immensely complicated and one reason it’s so difficult to develop therapies. Our treatment of it is still lagging but in my view we will be able to get cancer under significantly more control in a matter of decades, though we’ll never be able to eliminate it.You famously failed your French O-level six times. What are your linguistic skills like these days?They are absolutely appallingly bad. It’s a matter of great distress to me because I travel a great deal. I even got a Légion d’honneur, believe it or not. I had to give the speech in French! You needed a foreign language to get into university, so they let me sit French six times. I didn’t pass so I worked as a technician for a year. And then eventually I was let into Birmingham University.What did it mean to you to win the Nobel prize?The Nobel prize is the prize that everybody knows. I was fortunate that I got it on the 100th anniversary of the Nobel, so it was a great occasion. The fact is that I do talk more to the public and journalists now and it’s mainly because of the Nobel prize. Suddenly you become a public figure. You have to be careful you don’t say anything too stupid. In some countries such as India or China it’s a huge distinction, even in Germany and France. In the UK, we don’t tend to see it like that so much. In some ways, I think that’s a good thing."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c245533edd0423344f911c367d7ea805de1b2cf2/0_1859_4480_2686/master/4480.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=51990bb6a0c927eab2c22dba8448dfd0","title":"jean baptiste alaize i run to survive that is my destiny rising phoenix","story":"When the Paralympian was three he lost his mother, and his right leg, to a machete attack in Burundi’s civil war. He reveals how he outran his trauma and is about to star in a documentaryFrench Paralympian Jean-Baptiste Alaize has flown in to Paris from Miami, where he’s been living, on a cheap flight that has taken about 22 hours and a couple of stop-offs. The film company behind a new documentary featuring the world champion athlete has explained he may be late – he has a flexible relationship with punctuality, they say – and very tired.Are they kidding? Alaize turns up within minutes of the arranged time, full of energy and raring to go. He certainly does not need the strong double espresso he orders from the sports centre cafe. Instantly warm, friendly and irrepressible, he is the human manifestation of an overexcited puppy delighted to find himself the centre of attention.Following a machete attack as a child, Alaize has a prosthetic between the knee and the fluorescent orange trainer on his right foot, but even when he’s in running shorts, it’s not the first thing you notice.“Try getting around Paris in a wheelchair. Impossible!” says Alaize, who insists he is not disabled. “We all have some kind of handicap. Mine is my leg. But for me it’s not a handicap, because I do what I want in my life. If I want to play football, I play football skating, I go skating snowboarding… and when I want to jump far, I jump far,” he says. “A handicap is something that stops you from doing what you want… but not me. I’m not handicapped. Everything is OK for me, because I feel good in my head.”It’s taken 26 years for Alaize to feel this good, but despite his conviction, the reality is slightly more complicated. Alaize was three years old at the height of the civil war in Burundi, east Africa, when machete-wielding Hutu neighbours attacked his Tutsi family, decapitating his mother in front of him and leaving the small boy for dead with devastating cuts to his neck, back, arm and right leg, which was later amputated below the knee.A new Netflix documentary, Rising Phoenix, recounts his subsequent Paralympian sporting triumphs: at under-23s, he was four times world champion in the long jump he won two bronze medals and a silver in the 100m sprint a bronze in the 200m and a long jump bronze at the 2018 European championships.Lawrence Terry, Alaize’s trainer back in Miami, admires the athlete’s work ethic. “I believe in him strongly. He falls, he gets up, he falls, he gets up again… and again,” Terry has said.Rising Phoenix directors Ian Bonhôte and Peter Ettedgui, who wrote, produced and directed the 2018 film McQueen, about fashion designer Alexander McQueen, were similarly impressed with Alaize when looking for Paralympians to take part in the documentary.“His personal story and survival against all odds left us speechless. He struck us as such a genuine and charismatic presence,” Ettedgui said.Rising Phoenix tracks the history of the Paralympic Games, from their origins in the dark days following the second world war under Dr Ludwig Guttmann, a German Jew who fled the Nazis, came to Britain and worked at Stoke Mandeville hospital. Alaize stars alongside Paralympians including Jonnie Peacock, a British amputee sprinter who won gold at the 2012 and 2016 Paralympics, Bebe Vio, a gold medal fencer, who lost her legs and forearms to meningitis when she was 11, and Ellie Cole, a swimmer and wheelchair basketball player who has one leg.“We are all superheroes because we have all experienced tragedy, we have all lived through something that should not have allowed us to succeed, and that is our strength. We are trying to save the world,” Alaize says in the film.Alaize has not always felt as self-assured as he does today. He regrets that nobody is much interested in his story in France, where he is not a household name, in spite of his medals. This is why he prefers Miami, where, he says, there is far less racism and discrimination.“They don’t take me seriously in France, and I don’t know why. After all, I’m French and I have done some good things for France in athletics, but nobody seems interested. Nobody has called me to congratulate me over the Netflix film – not even French journalists want to write about it. I can only think it’s jealousy,” he says.“France portrays itself as a country of liberty, equality and fraternity, but everyone is put in a box: there’s a box for whites, for blacks, for Arabs, for Jews. Where’s the equality in that? It’s 2020 and there’s still a lot of racism in France, but nobody talks about it.”At his birth, on 10 May 1991 in the hills of Muyinga in north-east Burundi, near the Tanzanian border, Alaize was named Mugisha – meaning blessed and lucky child. He was the youngest of six children in a relatively well-off family – his father was in the military.On 23 October 1994, Alaize was playing outside with friends and siblings in his village, surrounded by banana plantations, when a group of armed Hutu neighbours arrived with machetes and spears. Earlier that year, a 100-day genocide that pitted Hutus against Tutsis in neighbouring Rwanda had left between 800,000 and a million people dead. The conflict spread to Burundi, where it would kill an estimated 300,000 people before it ended in 2005. Unicef estimated 558,000 Burundian children lost at least one parent (and 77,000 lost both).Alaize was one of those children, but says that before that day in October 1994, the Hutus and Tutsis of Muyinga had lived peacefully together.“Nobody expected this. If they had, maybe we would have been better prepared, but everything was good between us Tutsis and Hutus. These were people that came to the house to eat every day, even the day before, and who knew my parents well. When we saw they wanted to kill us we were in shock.“The men arrived in the afternoon. They were making a lot of noise and I remember they had machetes and spears and other arms. We realised they weren’t happy about something, but we were playing and didn’t pay much attention, even when they said they were going to kill everyone that evening.“Three hours later, at 8pm, they came back. We heard lots of shouting and screaming and saw houses on fire and people everywhere. Suddenly they were doing what they said they’d do, killing everyone.”Alaize says his mother tried to return to the family home to hide, but was unable to enter because there were so many people around it, and decided to try to run to safety.“Maman had me in her arms and she was running but we didn’t make it very far barely 30 metres. Five or six men surrounded us. They stabbed Maman in the stomach. Then, before my eyes, they cut off her head. They deliberately wanted me to see this, but I was little, I didn’t understand, I was crying and screaming. It was horrible.“I was very close to my mother, as the baby of the family I was with her all the time. I threw myself on her body, not understanding what had happened, and the men turned on me. They cut me with the machete on my arm behind my head, my back and my leg they kicked me too. Then they left, thinking I was dead.”It is a scene that Alaize has relived in nightmares and recounted many times, and his eyes well up as he recalls it.“I threw myself at my mother, but when I saw she had no head I didn’t know what to do. I wanted to hide. I wanted help. There was so much blood. At that moment, I saw this tunnel and the light coming nearer and it was so beautiful, and I felt strangely content. Then I woke up and was in hospital and they had amputated my leg.”Initially it was uncertain whether Alaize would survive, given the basic resources of a rural African hospital and the fact he was transfused with blood from the wrong group. When Alaize’s father collected him from the hospital, he left him at the local orphanage, promising to come back when he had a prosthetic leg. Every day for three years, Alaize, who believed the rest of his family had been wiped out, waited for his father to return, unaware he had signed official papers putting his son up for adoption. Alaize would never see his father again. When he returned to Burundi in 2013, for the first time since leaving for Europe at the age of six, he met his three surviving sisters, but learned his father had died, taking with him the secret of why he had deserted his only living son.“For many years I saw it as an abandonment, because I didn’t understand why. Every day I thought I would see my real father, but no. Now, at 29, I think I understand: he couldn’t say he was sending me away for a better life, so he preferred to lie.”That “better life” was the gift of Robert and Daniele Alaize, a couple from near Montélimar in south-east France, who had already adopted a Hutu survivor of the Rwandan genocide, whom they named Julien, and fostered many other children. Robert, a former soldier, had lost both his legs after a car accident and could empathise with the boy in photos sent by the orphanage.Alaize remembers the day the man he calls “my father” turned up in Burundi while the civil war was still raging.“He arrived with a pair of trainers and it was such a strong moment. From three to six years old I didn’t see anyone in my family. My real father had abandoned me and I’d lost all sense of love. I didn’t think it was possible to find a person who would love me. My father said: ‘You will go to France and we’ll get you a new leg.’ I didn’t even know where France was, and I didn’t understand, as I didn’t speak French.“Every evening there was shooting outside near the orphanage, and we were both afraid. He took a great risk for me. He was ready to do anything for me, but at first I was afraid of him, because I had never seen a white person before. We have fairytales like you, except in yours the blacks are the cannibals and in ours the white people eat the black children. He was not just a foreigner, he was an extraterrestrial.“I could never have imagined someone like him, so full of love, so full of opportunities, would come to look for me, but he did.”Robert took Mugisha back to the Alaize family home in Bonlieu-sur-Roubion, a village of fewer than 470 inhabitants, where he was renamed Jean-Baptiste.“I was not a normal child. I was traumatised from the war, I had had no mother’s love, I didn’t always behave well. But my parents gave me everything I had lost: love and self-confidence.“I was still having nightmares. Each time I closed my eyes, I had a flashback and saw the killing of my real mother and the attack on me. For years I would try to sleep, but it was impossible, I couldn’t get over it.“My mother, who was a nurse, gave up her job to help me. She would stay up all the night at my bedside.“For a long time I hid my handicap, because I don’t want to add to my problems. But I had to adapt, and I did so by showing people I was normal. I couldn’t do anything about my colour, but I could be good at sport.”It was during a school sports day that Alaize discovered his real talent.“I was in our class relay team and they asked me to be the last runner. It was such a responsibility. We were last, but I ran like an arrow, caught up everyone, and we won. Nobody knew I had a prosthetic, and I had beaten people who were normal. I was so happy,” he says.Away from his classmates, Alaize showed his sports teacher his missing leg, hoping he would keep the secret. Instead, the teacher told the whole class.“He said: ‘Look, he has a handicap, he has only one leg and voila! He still won you the race. You should respect him he is black and handicapped, don’t judge him or push him to one side.’“I’d wanted him to be discreet, but actually it was a strong message and as if a barrier had been opened. Suddenly my classmates knew I was different, but despite that difference I could run fast, I was good at heart and I could be like everyone else.”On the advice of the same PE teacher, who saw a future champion in Alaize, the boy joined a local athletics club and was soon winning against able-bodied runners. Alaize uses the French word valides for his non-disabled rivals.“I was around 13 or 14 and still having nightmares, but after the first training session I felt so good. When I tried to sleep that night I felt a sense of peace. I had never slept so quickly since the crime. I had found the one thing that would change everything.”When Alaize started to win races against valides with a standard walking prosthetic, it was time to get a running blade, like his then hero, South African double below-knee amputee and Paralympian sprinter Oscar Pistorius (the first amputee to win a world championship medal in non-disabled athletic events, and who was later convicted and jailed for the murder of his girlfriend, Reeva Steenkamp, in 2013).“My prosthetic specialist brought out a blade costing €15,000. I said: ‘Can I just try it? It’s not like I’m going to have a career as a world champion or anything like that, but I’d like to just try it on like a pair of shoes,’” he says, laughing.Anxious to help their son fulfil his dream, the Alaizes organised fundraising and persuaded their local authority to contribute. Shortly afterwards, Jean-Baptiste was invited by the national sports federation to take part in the world championships in Dublin.“I loved it. It was the first time I had seen so many handicapped athletes competing against each other. I loved the fact we were all in the same races, and I came home with three silver medals.”More medals followed, and Alaize was admitted to Insep, France’s National Institute of Sport, Expertise and Performance in Paris, where he trained for the 2016 Rio Paralympics, where he came fifth in the long jump.He says the Tokyo Paralympics – postponed because of Covid-19 until at least 2021, and possibly 2022 – represent his long-awaited opportunity to go for gold, though he will settle for silver or bronze if he feels he has done his best.“What I am missing is an Olympic medal. Tokyo was my dream, probably my last chance because of my age. I had everything planned… it’s almost my dream that’s been crushed.”With his Paralympic hopes on hold, Alaize has no idea what the future offers, but he has an innate optimism that something will turn up. He wants to write a book, make a film – a biopic was to be made, but failed to secure financial backing – become a personal trainer, and he’s been offered acting lessons to star in a one-man theatre show. Above all, he wants to stay in Miami.“Tomorrow is a new day. That’s my philosophy. I just want to try to be the best I can as a person and in sport. I’ll seize any opportunity.”It was the love of his adoptive parents and his love of sport that saved him, he says again, a fact brought home when a friend who worked with young offenders persuaded him to speak to a group of prisoners at Carcassonne prison in the south of France.“These were tough guys, people who had killed their wives or children. I know it’s difficult to change people for the better, but I tried, and they said I was an inspiration. I hate to say it, but after what happened to me, I could have detested the world, I could have been bad or violent, killed people, been a big gangster, but the love and guidance my family gave me allowed me to choose the path of freedom.”In 2016 he became a “Champion for Peace”, one of a group of 100 elite athletes under the patronage of Prince Albert of Monaco, who encourage sport as a tool for dialogue and social cohesion.It has been two hours since we met, and Alaize’s strong coffee has gone cold. He still shows no sign of jet lag, leaping up to greet other disabled athletes and former friends at Insep, where he trained for seven years. When not running and jumping, he loves just hanging out with friends and family.“I run to escape the people who wanted to kill me. All my life I have the impression I am a target, but it doesn’t stop me. I never give up. When I fall, I get up if I fall again, I get up again, and that is my strength,” he says. “That’s the message I wish for everyone to know that if you really want something you can get it. Me, I run for my life. I run to survive. That is my destiny. My story is sad, but it has a happy ending.”Rising Phoenix is on Netflix from 26 August"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b49477144ab54e8ec0bc4aa384339cdc3d48290f/0_256_4697_2818/master/4697.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5744b3886161a5817c985eb6c5cd5683","title":"england v pakistan second test day four live","story":"The players are back on the field.

This is becoming a little irksome for England.90th over: Pakistan 231-9 (Rizwan 67, Naseem 1) Naseem survives a full over from Broad, aided by the fact most of the deliveries were off target.“I had expected the game to start at 7.30am to make up for lost time and with the introduction of ‘Breakfast’ at 10.30am,” says Ian Copestake. “But no, you’re right, why change what isn’t broke, eh Pep?”89th over: Pakistan 231-9 (Rizwan 67, Naseem 1) Rizwan charges Anderson again.

For extra storage space, comfort and reduced emissions, a hybrid SUV is worth considering for a variety of lifestylesAdam Smith identified Britain as a nation of shopkeepers, but these days it might be more accurate to say we’re a nation of small businesses. There are almost 6m in the country, of which 3.5m operate as sole traders.Many of those people, whether they work at home or from a small office, need transportation that is reliable, spacious, cheap to run and that can double as a family car. Whether you’re a caterer transporting cakes, a fitness trainer carrying weights or a maker selling craftwares at small markets, you need a vehicle that can adapt effortlessly to your needs and budget.A hybrid’s combination of petrol and electric power means those short delivery runs are more cost-effective and you never have to wait on a recharge. Emissions are reduced, meaning a small reduction in car tax but also reductions when certain types of low-emission vehicles are registered as a company car for tax purposes – useful when you’re watching every penny.There are plenty of other reasons to buy a large hybrid if you run a small business, of course, not least a huge amount of storage to stow goods away in. The latest Honda CR-V hybrid, for example, features a wider, deeper boot than in previous models, and can be opened by waggling your foot underneath, ideal if you’re loaded down with goods. A smart, flexible “company” car that’s tax deductible and cheaper to run? Sounds like good business.Face it, when you become a parent, you sign up to run a taxi service for the best part of 20 years. Factor in a twice-daily school run, regular shopping trips, weekend jaunts and holidays with two or three kids, perhaps a dog, too, and the attraction of a big car such as an SUV is undeniable. But there’s a major downside: emissions.Many schools in urban areas suffer from high pollution, exacerbated by parents depositing their kids at the school gates and waiting around when they pick them up later with engines needlessly idling. Fearing the effects, headteachers are calling for car bans and schools are leafleting parents to stop parking nearby. The city of Bristol is even discussing a potential diesel car-free zone, because of the dangerous particulates they emit. The UK Energy Research Centre recently revealed the surge in SUV sales was jeopardising the UK transport sector’s ability to meet EU emissions targets. That’s not a good look for a parent, even if an SUV is.The ideal solution is a more efficient, cleaner version that can still meet the needs of a busy parent – a hybrid that can run on pure electric around sensitive zones such as schools and in town.When you combine the other benefits a modern, large hybrid car brings to the party – such as high safety ratings, masses of room, plenty of storage and parking assist features – they begin to make a compelling case again.There are many downsides to a long commute, not least the grinding tedium of heavy traffic, the slow crawl and tailbacks with repeated stop-starts. Add to that stress and musculoskeletal disorders from sitting in an uncomfortable position, and public transport starts to seem a whole lot more appealing. However, if commute time, connectivity or the price tag make public transport difficult to justify, a low-emission vehicle might just be the next best thing, especially with today’s petrol and diesel prices.A hybrid with a stop-start system automatically shuts down and restarts the engine to reduce the amount of time it spends idling, reducing both fuel consumption and emissions. And you may just end up spending less on maintenance as well. Because of the regenerative braking system, you won’t use your standard brakes as much, resulting in less wear and tear. The batteries in hybrids are also designed to last the lifetime of the car, and have solid warranties to reflect this. The Honda i-MMD battery, which is used to power its new CR-V hybrid, is covered for five years or to a distance of 100,000km, whichever comes first.We all have many factors to consider when choosing which transport option best suits our lifestyle, but for some of us, a hybrid could tick quite a few boxes."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b1c2fe19fd67bca653c753499a8cadf6d48eaffd/0_0_4893_2936/master/4893.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b8a66804da8d76926a240da37d432a04","title":"hybrid cars have to be plugged in and five other common misconceptions","story":"Complicated and costly? Think again. Driving a hybrid vehicle is a practical way to reduce emissions while being economical and fuss-free, say expertsAs awareness of the climate crisis grows and urban pollution levels creep ever higher, we’re all starting to think more about our carbon footprints. For those who are considering buying a car, which one to go with requires careful thought and research.Should we stick with petrol or diesel, take the plunge to buy an electric vehicle or maybe opt for a hybrid? Of these options, there tends to be the most confusion around hybrids. There are a lot of myths about these vehicles, many of them based on the early, less sophisticated versions that entered the market about 20 years ago. But it’s worth busting through these concerns and getting to grips with what hybrids can offer, as for many of us they can be an excellent choice for greener, more economical and fun motoring.“We were early to market with hybrids back in the late 1990s with the Insight and then the sportier CR-Z,” says Phil Webb, deputy general manager automotive at Honda UK. “These were arguably ahead of their time and are now modern classics. Fast forward 20 years and, while hybrids have changed drastically, the concerns around owning and driving them have not.”Here are some of the most common misconceptions.Myth one: hybrid technology is complicated and difficult to understandThere are different types of hybrid cars, and hearing terms such as “mild”, “full” and “plug-in hybrid electric vehicle” (PHEV) bandied around can be confusing. But it’s quite straightforward. A hybrid car is one that uses two forms of energy to maximise efficiency and reduce emissions. Usually this means combining electrical energy contained in batteries with the combustion energy of petrol or diesel fuel.“Hybrid cars were developed to reduce CO2,” explains Nick Molden, CEO of Emissions Analytics, a global emissions testing specialist. “They do it via two means. Firstly, there’s regenerative braking. When a vehicle brakes there’s a lot of wasted energy. Hybrids capture this energy into the battery and it can then be used to power the vehicle. Secondly, hybrids help the engine work at optimal efficiency as much of the time as possible. Electric power is suited to lower-speed stop-start driving such as you might do in a city. And petrol and diesel engines are more suited to driving at higher, constant speeds – for example, during motorway driving. Hybrid technology means that the two parts work together in harmony, each doing what it’s best at.”“We have deliberately made our hybrids incredibly easy to drive,” says Webb. “Our new CR-V hybrid has three driving modes pure electric, hybrid and engine-only – but what makes it easy to drive is the fact that the car will select the most fuel-efficient way of powering the car, so the driver doesn’t have to.”Myth two: hybrids have to be plugged inSome hybrids are plug-ins, while others are not. Plug-in hybrids have batteries that can be charged from a power outlet and can run on electric power alone for between 30 and 40 miles, before needing the petrol or diesel engine to kick in. But hybrid technology is also available in cars such as the CR-V hybrid, which does not need to be plugged in. And with both types of hybrid, “range anxiety” isn’t something you need to worry about – if the electrical energy runs out, they will shift over to the petrol or diesel engine.Myth three: hybrids are a cop-out. If we care about climate change we should be driving electric carsIn an ideal world, more of us would be driving electric cars. They have zero tailpipe emissions, so in terms of reducing CO2 and combating climate change they’re an excellent choice. But the fact is that electric vehicles aren’t practical for many people – especially those who live in flats or terraced houses and don’t have access to a charging point, or anyone who does a lot of long-distance driving.Tim Anderson, head of transport at the Energy Saving Trust, says: “For motorists who don’t have access to charging points, hybrids can be a worthwhile stepping stone towards reducing their CO2 emissions. They are more energy-efficient than their petrol and diesel counterparts and are easy to buy, drive and live with.”Myth four: hybrids aren’t fun to driveMotoring journalist Tim Barnes-Clay doesn’t agree. “Early hybrids used to feel quite different from ‘regular’ cars, with a lack of connection with the driver’s input and the vehicle’s road behaviour. But now hybrids can be a joy to drive on any road, including motorways. For example, the Honda CR-V hybrid uses CVT automatic transmissions, giving a continuous flow of smooth power.”Myth five: hybrids aren’t very stylishWhen hybrids first came out about 20 years ago they did look quite quirky and different. “However, designers have responded to what consumers want and hybrids are now styled to look as attractive as any other car,” says Keith Adams, editor of car-buying website parkers.Myth six: hybrids are too expensive“Although hybrid cars cost a bit more than their petrol and diesel counterparts, their fuel economy means that savings can be made in running costs,” says Adams. And with minimal running costs and excellent reliability, hybrids are in demand on the secondhand market and their resale value tends to be strong.Misconceptions about hybrids mean they can be seen as the worst of both worlds – not as green as electric cars, and less stylish and enjoyable to drive than conventional petrol or diesel vehicles. But for many motorists, they are the opposite, offering a practical and accessible way to reduce emissions while also being economical and fuss-free."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b9f2191029e5033edacd0e10f21cc1f48d654563/1386_1800_3526_2116/master/3526.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=dcd005d88e378c8b805305f897f38f6b","title":"quiet as a deserted chapel test driving a hybrid car","story":" Mike Pattenden and his wife Andrea Walker take the Honda CR-V hybrid out for a spin. Here’s what they discover …Despite being the self-conscious subjects of a photoshoot in the busy car park in Bedfordshire’s Dunstable Downs, no one paid a blind bit of notice to us. Clearly, as a couple, my wife and I were as commonplace to the families, walkers and kite flyers up there on a breezy Sunday morning before lockdown as the Honda CR-V hybrid that was actually the quietly unassuming star of every shot.There were plenty of SUVs in view, even a few other Honda CR-Vs – hardly surprising, given it’s the world’s most popular SUV. More than 9m have been sold since it was launched back in 1995.When it comes to cars, “popular” is a good thing. It means dependable, safe and cheap to run and, consequently, as eye-catching as denim. And yet, this fifth-generation model of the CR-V is remarkable in its own way. It’s a hybrid with an engine that combines the best aspects of petrol combustion and electric to power it.Our CR-V is powered via a combination of a 2.0-litre Atkinson-cycle engine and two electric motors via Honda’s integrated motor assist (IMA) system, meaning it runs in three modes: EV, hybrid and petrol, constantly defaulting to electric at speeds below 30mph. In this mode, the electric motors are used to drive the wheels, using energy from the battery that was previously harvested from the petrol engine while driving at higher speeds. This means the petrol engine is generally used at lower revs, making it more fuel efficient and quieter.And, golly, is it quiet. Honda’s noise-cancelling system makes it feel like a deserted chapel as we drive around this Sunday morning, albeit one with heated pews.“You’d hear a squirrel squeak if you ran over one,” observes my wife as we drive stealthily over to Ivinghoe Beacon, where we like to walk at weekends. Luckily, no such tragedy occurs. Honda’s cross-traffic sensor warns me of a jogger as I begin to reverse (I spot him a moment later in the handy rear camera), and the CR-V hybrid has a collision detection system that prevents a rear-end shunt by slamming on the anchors for you. Having recently endured a trip to Bristol in horrendous stop-start motorway traffic, aggravated by a succession of these infuriating incidents, I’d make this feature mandatory in every car.As for efficiency, the car shifts modes seamlessly, meaning it’s incredibly thrifty, capable of 56mpg in town. You can have fun stretching its electric running, too, through regenerative braking via two paddles behind the steering wheel that slow it like changing down gears in a manual, although, given its powertrain, the CR-V hybrid is an automatic. And because of the way it tops up the batteries, there’s no recharging, so no “powernoia” on long journeys.“You don’t really have to do much, do you?” says my wife approvingly, when she takes the wheel. “I could get used to this.”On the motorway, the car switches to petrol mode at high speed and proves adept at eating up the miles in comfort. There’s a suite of driver-assist features including adaptive cruise control that will adjust distance to the car ahead, lane-keep assistance, in case you wander, and a speed limiter that will automatically maintain a specified speed – handy for the inevitable 50mph surveillance sections. For someone who views a future of driverless cars as dystopian, this level of autonomy feels perfectly acceptable to me.Inside, it’s roomy and well supplied with storage points. The centre console swallows my wife’s chunky handbag whole. There are cup holders for coffee addicts and bottle racks in the door pockets, along with charge points for phones.The boot is roomy enough for a dog. Put the rear seats down and you could probably fit a Shetland pony in. Shell out for the top-of-the-range EX model and it’s also automated, meaning you can open it by waggling your foot underneath, handy for the big shop. All but the most basic models boast a centre console with a 7in touchscreen. I had the radio set to 6 Music within a couple of minutes and the sound from the nine speakers was impressive.

We apologize,” read Newsweek’s editor’s note on Friday, which replaced the magazine’s earlier detailed defense of the op-ed.“We entirely failed to anticipate the ways in which the essay would be interpreted, distorted and weaponized,” read the apology, signed by Josh Hammer, opinion editor, and Nancy Cooper, global editor-in-chief.But the pair ended the note by saying that the op-ed would remain on the site, with their note attached.The op-ed was written by John Eastman, a conservative attorney who argues that the US constitution doesn’t grant birthright citizenship. Eastman attempted to sow doubt about Harris’ eligibility based on her parents’ immigration status. Harris’ mother was born in India and her father was born in Jamaica.Eastman ran unsuccessfully in the 2010 Republican primary as a candidate for California attorney general. Harris eventually won the election against Republican Steve Cooley.Newsweek had earlier defended the piece, arguing that Eastman “was focusing on a longstanding, somewhat arcane legal debate” about the 14th amendment and not trying to “ignite a racist conspiracy theory around Kamala Harris’ candidacy”.The conspiracy theory is false. Harris, who was tapped by Joe Biden to serve as his running mate on the Democratic ticket, was born in Oakland, California, and is eligible for both the vice-presidency and presidency under the constitutional requirements. The question is not even considered complex, according to constitution lawyers.Trump built his political career on questioning a political opponent’s legitimacy. He was a high-profile force behind the “birther movement” – the lie that questioned whether Barack Obama, the nation’s first Black president, was eligible to serve. Only after mounting pressure during his 2016 campaign did Trump disavow the claims.Asked about the matter at the White House on Thursday, Trump told reporters he had “heard” rumors that Harris does not meet the requirement to serve in the White House. The president said he considered the rumors “very serious”.Some Newsweek staff had publicly slammed the decision to run the oped. Christina Zhao, a New York news editor, tweeted: “This is an inflammatory and racist op-ed that should never have been published. That is my opinion.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a8aa97e36af271a35fdee65d3ccad46a6ddb35cd/0_47_3600_2159/master/3600.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fa01fa390a35098ffa63d40c058ac833","title":"us schools reopening teachers sickout arizona","story":"Arizona public school district forced to abandon plans after more than 100 teachers and staff members called in sickAn Arizona public school district was forced to cancel its plans to reopen on Monday after more than 100 teachers and other staff members called in sick.“We have received an overwhelming response from staff indicating that they do not feel safe returning to classrooms with students,” Gregory Wyman, district superintendent, said in a statement on Friday.Now some activists in Arizona, which saw a high-profile teachers’ strike in 2018, said they hope teachers across America will adopt a similar strategy to keep educators safe, as some parents and politicians continue to push for schools in the US to reopen during the coronavirus pandemic.“I’d love to see a nationwide sickout,” Kelley Fisher, an Arizona kindergarten teacher who has led protests in the state, told Reuters on Friday.In San Tan Valley, a suburb of Phoenix, the JO Combs unified school district’s board of governors had voted to resume in-person classes on Monday. Another school district nearby had made a similar choice, pressured by some parents who argued that reopening schools would be best for their children.The president of the Arizona Education Association, a teacher’s union, told the Arizona Republic that the two districts both decided to reopen despite not meeting the health metrics as recommended by Arizona’s department of public health.Not a single district in Arizona currently meets all three metrics for a safe resumption of mixed in-person and online learning, the Arizona Republic reported, citing the most recently available state public health data.“Due to these insufficient staffing levels, schools will not be able to reopen on Monday as planned,” Wyman, the superintendent, said, noting that “all classes, including virtual learning, will be canceled” until further notice.Debates over when or how to reopen schools for in-person instruction have flared across the US. In Arizona, even as teachers are protesting to delay reopening schools, citing safety concerns, some parents have rallied to open classrooms, arguing that choice is best for their children.Hundreds of parents and students held a rally in Phoenix last week in support of resuming in-person classes, Reuters reported. Among them was parent Christina DeRouchey, whose son is in first grade.“We just want the choice that is best physically, mentally and most importantly emotionally for our children,” DeRouchey said.Elsewhere in Arizona, the debate over when to reopen schools remained at a standstill. In Lake Havasu, Arizona, the local school district pushed back the discussion of when to reopen schools to this coming week, the local paper reported.“At some point, we are going to have to come up with an acceptable casualty rate, and nobody wants to have that conversation,” one school board member said during last week’s discussion over reopening schools, a comment the editor of Today’s News-Herald, the local paper, called “chilling”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d0f176f38940ce37c2cb7a8defd401baff9340df/0_0_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b5083c78276f0a7404cf9894a94741c0","title":"latino voters us elections bernie sanders joe biden","story":"Energized by universal healthcare and free college tuition, enthusiastic young Latinos favored ‘Tio Bernie’ – and Biden has work to do to convince this crucial voting blocThomas Kennedy remembers spending all day on the phone keeping up with excited new voters wanting to know how “el caucus” worked, ahead of the first Democratic primary contest in Iowa in February.The most noticeable callers were highly motivated young mothers, part of a huge wave of Hiic voters, activists and volunteers inspired to get involved in politics for the first time by passion for their candidate.That candidate was Bernie Sanders. Kennedy, a progressive activist and former Sanders operative, has switched to support Joe Biden, who will next week become the Democratic nominee for president, but worries whether Biden can win over valuable young progressives underwhelmed by his moderate politics.“Bernie talked directly to people’s material needs,” said Kennedy. The clear populist promises of universal healthcare and cancelling student debt in particular caught fire, Kennedy said.And expansive outreach and slogans like ‘¡Nuestro Futuro, Nuestra Lucha!’ — Our Future, Our Struggle – clicked with the cohort who nicknamed Sanders “Tío Bernie” (Uncle Bernie).For the first time, Latinos are poised to be the nation’s largest non-white ethnic voting bloc in the 2020 election, with a large young cohort among the estimated 32 million eligible to vote – a record.Democrats know that their support is crucial to winning the White House – and potentially both chambers of Congress – but concerns remain over whether Biden can not only persuade young progressives who were energized by Sanders, but mobilize Latinos in decisive numbers at a moment when the coronavirus and economic crises are disproportionately hurting communities of color.“The Biden campaign must reach young people,” María Teresa Kumar, the president of Voto Latino, a political organization focused on voter engagement. “Because if you’re not reaching young people, you are not reaching the Latino community.”“When I worked for Bernie, it wasn’t about electing one person. It was about a movement,” Belén Sisa, a former Sanders press secretary, said. “I don’t feel that from Joe Biden.”Since the primary, Biden has appeared to move to the left on key policies important to young Latinos. He has embraced a $2tn climate plan, though not the Green New Deal, and pledged an ambitious overhaul of Trump’s immigration orders, and an economic agenda centered on racial equality.“We’ve moved the needle a bit,” Sisa said.But, like many progressives, she is frustrated by Biden’s reluctance to embrace Medicare for All, the universal healthcare policy that she says would reduce health disparities for Latinos, who are among the country’s most uninsured. And he has refused to abolish Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice), the agency carrying out hardline Trump anti-immigration policies at the US-Mexico border and in raids in US cities.Sisa also said Sanders’ campaign invested more, much earlier, to cultivate Latino voters.Chuck Rocha, the architect of Sanders’ ambitious Latino outreach strategy, is now applying some of the tactics used to win Hiics voters in primary contests from Iowa to California, to help Biden beat Trump in November.After Biden won the primary, Rocha founded Nuestro Pac, a Democratic Super Pac that will target Latino voters in Michigan, Wisconsin, Florida, Nevada and Pennsylvania.The Biden campaign recently made other high-profile hires including Julie Chavez Rodriguez, the granddaughter of civil rights hero Cesar Chavez, and Matt Barreto, the founder of Latino Decisions, a top Democratic polling firm. The campaign has also hired Republican strategist Ana Navarro.Biden’s platform aimed at Hiic voters – “Todos con Biden” – focuses on healthcare, education and reversing Trump’s anti-immigration agenda. Biden has promised to reinstate the Daca program of rights and protections for undocumented young people, and send a bill to Congress “on day one” that would create a path to citizenship for the estimated 11 million undocumented immigrants in the US.He has also pledged a 100-day moratorium on deportations.During the primary campaign, Biden was repeatedly confronted by immigration activists who demanded contrition for the more than 3 million deportations carried out while he was vice-president.“You should vote for Trump,” Biden told one critic. Weeks later, he was obliged to apologize for the “pain” caused by the policies.He described the Biden-Harris ticket as “looking to the future, and the changing demographics in the United States”.The campaign hailed her efforts to stop the Trump administration separating undocumented families crossing the US-Mexico border and “sponsoring legislation to help victims of Hurricane Maria”, which decimated Puerto Rico in 2017.But her  record as district attorney and attorney general in California has prompted disquiet among some progressives.Meanwhile, leading Democratic figures say Trump’s handling of the public heath crisis and the economic slump, allied to his xenophobia, is driving voters away from the Republicans.“Donald Trump’s cruelty is backfiring on him,” said Julián Castro, the only Latino candidate in the Democratic primary race.Castro believes frustration with the president could have a significant effect in battleground states such as Arizona, Florida and his native Texas, where coronavirus is wreaking havoc.“More people are getting sick, and more people are dying,” said Castro, whose stepmother died from coronavirus. “That’s not going unnoticed.”And yet strategists say antipathy for Trump is not enough. “It has to be ‘this is why you should vote for Joe Biden’,” said Nathalie Rayes, the president and chief executive of Latino Victory.Elsewhere, voting by mail, likely the safest way to cast a ballot during a pandemic, presents another hurdle for Latino voters. Overall, Latinos have said they had little experience and low confidence in the security of voting by mail, according to the Latino Decisions survey.“That was a big code red for us,” said Kumar. “Especially where there is no habit of voting by mail.”The Biden campaign has pivoted sharply to Latinos, but is it too little too late?Cristóbal Alex, Biden’s senior campaign adviser, and the former president of the Latino Victory Fund, said Latinos are “essential” to winning the White House.“We’ve brought in the A-team to ensure that we engage Latinos and compete for every single vote as we go into November,” he said. “That’s a very dramatic scale-up in staffing, and that’s also being reflected in the organizing at every level of the campaign. It’s an indication of just how seriously the campaign takes the Latino vote.”Alex said it is understandable that in the midst of a national crisis, which he says has been made worse by Trump’s extraordinarily isive presidency, many Latinos are not yet fully engaged in the election. But he is confident that will change.Over the past several weeks, the campaign has significantly ramped up its outreach, touting a “culturally competent” advertising strategy that includes younger English-heavier speakers and older Spanish speakers.In an effort to reflect the ersity of the Hiic electorate, the campaign is “micro-targeting” Latinos by region and ethnicity. For example, the narrator in an ad running in Arizona has a Mexican accent, while the same ad running in Miami features a narrator with a Cuban accent. But some say, as a strategy, it needs more fine tuning.The temporary protected status (TPS) government program is designed to prevent foreign nationals from being deported back to countries facing threatening conditions such as civil unrest or the aftermath of a devastating natural disaster.Microtargeting with accents is a “necessary” principle of outreach, said De Jesus, and has been used since Obama’s 2008 run to the White House. But more cultural nuances need to be included now, De Jesus said. He pointed at a successful ad by the Trump campaign after liberals began to boycott Goya, the canned food brand, citing its impressive depth and authenticity.“Its content was reprehensible, but it used a specific slang that a millennial Puerto Rican woman would use. So it’s not just the accent or the policy, but the words and the music,” said De Jesus.Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is due to speak at the Democratic national convention this week, fresh from being a member of the Biden-Sanders policy taskforce created after the primary in an effort to unify the party against Trump. Sanders, Michael Bloomberg and Andrew Yang will speak, too, but as of Friday, Julián Castro had not been scheduled.And with the stakes so high, the latest ad from the group America’s Progressive Promise is narrated by Sanders, who says: “Every person who voted for me or the other candidates … understands that Donald Trump is the most dangerous president in the history of our country.”“It’s absolutely imperative that we come together and defeat him, and defeat him badly.”The spot concludes by declaring that Biden would be “the most progressive president since FDR”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/af9841366cf986fb230e3e48c945b44c37518cbd/0_209_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bda6d1a1d43ffd7e867b11f490c0bf95","title":"republican democratic party conventions","story":"With Democrats and Republicans holding no in-person conventions this year, some have called to ditch them completely – but others say they’re a vital political toolThere won’t be any huge balloon drops at the Democratic or Republican party conventions this year. Presidential candidates will not get the chance to accept their nominations in front of massive, cheering crowds. Political reporters and strategists will not descend on a carefully selected American city to kick off the final stretch of the 2020 presidential election.And some in Washington say those changes may be for the best.The coronavirus pandemic has upended plans for both nominating conventions, which will unfold over the next two weeks – Democrats first, then Republicans. Both nominees – Donald Trump and Joe Biden – will deliver their acceptance speeches remotely, and attendance at the two conventions has been sharply restricted. About 50,000 people attended each convention in 2016, a mere fraction of that number are expected to this year.Rather than mourning the loss of the in-person convention, some commentators have suggested that the unique nature of this year’s events may represent an opportunity to re-evaluate an outdated tradition. But leaders of both parties insist the conventions still serve a vital purpose of informing voters about the presidential nominees and their platforms.While the conventions have been held since 1831, they have become increasingly anticlimactic in recent decades. No convention has gone to a second ballot since 1952, and the last legitimate, although unsuccessful, effort to seize the nomination at a convention took place in 1980.Now, a convention mainly serves as a party’s stamp of approval on its already-chosen nominee. The four days of events have turned into an intricately coordinated infomercial for each party’s nominee, featuring a lineup of speeches from longtime lawmakers and rising stars.“Once you have the introduction of the more open primary process to select the candidates, the conventions then become about presenting a more unified party to the American public and more about what they’re going to stand for in the election,” Brownell said.Those shifting dynamics have translated into decreasing interest, at least among television networks. The days of “gavel-to-gavel” coverage are long gone, and networks in recent years have instead devoted just one hour of primetime coverage to the conventions each night.In an editorial published earlier this month, the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette’s editorial board argued the conventions had devolved into a “half-hearted spectacle of too many dull speeches and too many TV talking-heads spouting repetitive gossip and gibberish”.The board wrote: “It is a bit sad to lose the tradition of the political convention. But, in truth, it died, like the dodo, long ago.”Despite that waning interest, party leaders push back against claims that conventions are relics of a bygone political era. “I think there’s still a remarkable importance to coming together in a city,” the Democratic National Committee chairman, Tom Perez, said last week. “I think there’s a lot of value in that.”For the host cities themselves, there is economic value. The 2016 conventions generated roughly $200m in revenue for Cleveland and Philadelphia, but this year’s host cities – Charlotte and Milwaukee – will not see the same bump now that the events are mostly virtual.Perez also argued the traditional convention represented an invaluable opportunity for party members to gather and discuss their priorities. “There is often no substitute for that interaction that you get and the learning that you do,” Perez said.That sentiment was echoed by political strategists on both sides of the aisle, several of whom said they expected the conventions to return to their traditional format once it was safe to host large events.“That’s the kind of kinetic energy that is untranslatable. You’ve got to be in the room. You’ve got to feel that,” said Michael Steele, the former chairman of the Republican National Committee. “It sets up the shockwave the nominee wants to send out to the country.”Steele and others said there was no replacement for the excitement of nominees delivering their acceptance speeches to thousands of cheering fans. Democrats in particular are losing the opportunity to celebrate California senator Kamala Harris’ historic achievement, as she becomes the first Black woman and first Asian American to join a major party’s presidential ticket.“We’re all lamenting that that moment in history will not be captured in the traditional convention stage way,” said Leah Daughtry, who ran the 2008 and 2016 Democratic conventions.Both Daughtry and Henry Barbour, Mississippi’s national committeeman to the RNC, also noted that the conventions allow delegates, who represent some of the most ardent members of each party, to come together for training and networking.“The opportunity for the grassroots workers to go to a national convention and be around people who share their passion and love of politics is important,” Barbour said. “It serves as a great reward to the workers in the party.”Barbour is one of just 336 delegates who will still convene in Charlotte to formally nominate Trump, and he is missing the convention hoopla of past years. “It’s just not going to have the impact that 2016 and other years have had, and so I think we’ll get back to that,” Barbour said.However, even if in-person conventions return in 2024, this year could still represent an opportunity to reconsider how they are held. Democrats, for example, are allowing virtual delegate voting for the first time, which could expand participation in future conventions as well.Daughtry, who virtually cast her delegate vote for Biden last week, also suggested shortening conventions. “My prediction is that they will be one or two days, not four, because the business of the convention can really be accomplished in just a few hours,” Daughtry said.Steele was similarly open to shorter conventions, and he argued that social media could help make the events feel less scripted. “I’m watching to see how social media generates and creates that spontaneity or brings some of that back in future convention settings,” Steele said. “Because you can’t control what someone’s tweeting from the floor.”Despite some calls to end the political tradition, Steele expressed optimism that the parties could find ways to resurrect the interest sparked by earlier conventions. “They’re boring, but they are necessary,” Steele said. “I don’t think they need to be necessarily boring.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5420e646c4edb197d5c3871a475805ed78a8b065/0_0_5000_3000/master/5000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=98005456156c213022556df3721cadcd","title":"us inequality coronavirus pandemic unemployment","story":"US billionaires’ wealth is soaring while millions remain unemployed, creating a country with two economies and increased inequalityby  Dominic Rushe in New YorkIt’s only a hundred miles from Manhattan to East Hampton but as the city swelters the Long Island town can seem a world away. Cool Atlantic breezes take the heat off long summer days spent on its miles of white, soft sand beaches. High-priced farm stands provide heirloom tomatoes, peaches and arugula to summer visitors and the mansions of the financial titans and the celebrities, including Beyoncé and Jay-Z, Julianne Moore and Robert Downey Jr, who summer there.If anything, quite the opposite. House prices are soaring. High-priced rentals have all been snapped up. It took developer Joe Farrell just one day to rent Sandcastle, his 15-bedroom mansion with sunken tennis courts, for $2m for the summer to “a textile tycoon and his family who were stuck in Manhattan and wanted to leave the city on a day’s notice. This was a Covid situation – not a normal summer rental”, he told the New York Post.The Hamptons really is a world away for Sara Fearrington. It may as well be another planet. The 43-year-old lost her job at Waffle House in Durham, North Carolina, when the pandemic struck. Now she, her husband and their six children are trying to make ends meet on $125 in unemployment benefits each week. Fearrington is one of the 2.6 million people to have lost her job in the food services and drinking industry since February.The Fearringtons had been receiving an extra $600 a week in benefits thanks to an emergency lifeline set up by Congress in March. That expired at the end of July and Washington is deadlocked over a replacement. “Now we literally have to sit here and wait, your head on a chopping block,” she said.Once again coronavirus has shown that it is far more deadly for those suffering from pre-existing conditions. For the US body politic that pre-existing condition is inequality.Stock markets are setting new highs driven by soaring prices for the tech companies that enable those lucky enough to work from home. Apple is close to being valued at $2tn. The total wealth of US billionaires has soared $685bn since the middle of March to a combined $3.65tn. Rock-bottom interest rates have triggered a home sales boom for some as those with the money reconsider their priorities in the work-from-home era. With nowhere to go, those Americans who can are saving at record rates.“It’s white-collar professionals who are able to work from home. In some ways, this is a sign that the economy is just officially split in two,” Glenn Kelman, chief executive of property company Redfin, told NPR last week.“We are all in this together” may be the rallying cry for the pandemic but the truth is the poor, and particularly people of color, have been devastated by coronavirus and its attendant recession while the wealthy have weathered it and in some cases made huge gains. Research into previous recent pandemics from economists at the International Monetary Fund suggests it’s a trend that may continue even after the outbreak abates.Economists often talk of V-shaped economic recoveries, a sharp drop and an equally sharp bounce back. Sometimes the economy drags along the bottom before bouncing back – a U-shaped recovery. Now there is talk of a “K-shaped” recovery. A fall followed by a split where the well off and well educated tick up while the poor and poorly educated fall further behind.For people able to work from home, “life has returned largely to normal”, said Peter Atwater, adjunct lecturer in the economics department at William \u0026amp Mary. “In fact, the wealthiest today are even richer than they were before the outbreak.”For those people, on the arm of the K, Atwater said it’s “almost as if the outbreak never happened. That’s starkly different for people on the leg. If you are a small business person, work in the service industry, had to go back out into a manufacturing facility, a job in the ‘real world’, as it were, that has weighed heavily. Sadly it has weighed particularly heavily on minority communities at a time when they are the largest populations experiencing the outbreak. It’s a stacked inequity.”In Edgar Allan Poe’s The Masque of the Red Death Prince Prospero and the knights and dames of his court retire to “the deep seclusion of one of his crenellated abbeys” to escape the Red Death, a plague that is devastating the country around them.Amply provisioned and, so they think, sealed off from the outside world, Prospero and his pod put on a masqued ball but the prince is angered to find that one of the guests has dressed as Red Death.Prospero chases the guest from room to room, only to realize the figure is the Red Death personified. The guests sicken and die: “And Darkness and Decay and the Red Death held illimitable dominion over all.”Inequality was a pre-existing condition for the US economy long before the coronavirus started its spread. For Fearrington the pandemic has merely exposed its “ugly face”. But she is certain that if this goes on much longer today’s Prosperos too will see that face.A Fight for $15 activist campaigning for a rise in the national minimum wage, Fearrington is hopeful that as so many people come to realize how bad the situation has become, something will change. “What we have right now is economic failure,” she said.“My husband is black. We are a mixed family that is living through this struggle. It is not a fun place to be. I have been with my husband for 28 years. Twenty-eight years and I am still seeing the same problems? No. We have got to speak up. I have had enough.”She has seen the reports of people snapping up second homes. “I have dreams of that too,” she said. “I am happy for people who have that. I want everybody to prosper. But at the same time I feel left behind. Some of my dreams are now halted.” She said “every little bit of savings” she had stowed away has gone “just to keep our heads above water”.Even before Covid-19 life was hard for Fearrington. She worked 42-72 hours a week, taking all the shifts she could get. “Every holiday. Every one of my kids’ birthdays, I was working.” Paid $3.15 an hour before tips she could make $40-$70 a day. The family needed every dollar. Medical costs are a constant fear. Her husband has a rare lung disease, ABPA. His inhalers can cost $300. One stay in hospital left the family with a bill for $15,000. “If you get sick, too bad, so sad,” she said.“We need healthcare for all,” she said. “A lot of things have to change, we need to learn to live together. Just because we fall in a certain pay bracket doesn’t mean our lives are less valuable than anybody else’s.”The rise of the Black Lives Matter movement, the Fight for $15, #MeToo and Occupy Wall Street are all recent examples of powerful, popular movements demanding real change. The continuing protests across America following the killing of George Floyd and the fact that more white people too are joining those protests gives her hope. “Now is a time when people are recognising that silence has not worked. We are coming together. Ugliness has to stop,” she said.Without change there will be more outrage, said Atwater. “I don’t think the wealthy appreciate how vulnerable they are to those who are out in the real world. They are not immune to the world around them.”If the current situation continues, “there is a very real risk that companies will start looking at their balance sheets and thinking, ‘Actually, we really need to trim our workforce’, and that could happen across the board. That’s not just confined to leisure and hospitality,” said John Payne, economist at Oxford Economics.Widening job losses and increasing inequality is likely to lead to louder calls for change.“We talk about the American dream, the ability to pull yourself up by your bootstraps. Rags to riches. All this American mythology is being challenged by this extraordinary wealth ide,” said Atwater. “The rubber band has been pulled too far. People are uncomfortable with how ided we have become.“At the same time I don’t think the wealthy appreciate how vulnerable they are to those who are out in the real world. They are not immune to the world around them.”That realization can’t come soon enough for Fearrington: “It has to stop. We are still all humans at the end of the day,” she said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a755301fa33bb8fb74210e89305ea9a4d44907ff/77_0_2774_1664/master/2774.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ab1a84bc94058dde6b82b74c959daaf0","title":"iran calls us defeat over un arms embargo a humiliation","story":"President says US will unilaterally reinstate sanctions a day after only two countries voted for prolonging embargoDonald Trump has vowed to use a contentious provision to unilaterally reinstate UN sanctions on Tehran, following what Iran’s president said was a humiliating defeat for the US in its bid to extend an arms embargo on Tehran.A day after the UN security council overwhelmingly rejected a US resolution to extend the embargo, Trump said at a news conference at his New Jersey golf club: “We’ll be doing a snapback. You’ll be watching it next week.”The US president was referring to the contested argument that the US remains a “participant” in the 2015 Iran nuclear deal – despite Trump’s withdrawal from it – and therefore can force a return to sanctions if it sees Iran as being in violation of its terms.European allies have been sceptical on whether Washington can force sanctions, however, with experts saying a “snapback” threatens to plunge the council into one of its worst ever diplomatic crises.Iran’s president said earlier on Saturday that the US had suffered a humiliating defeat when the council voted on the American proposal on Friday.Russia and China voted against, while 11 members – including France, Germany and Britain – abstained. The US and the Dominican Republic were the only votes in favour.“I don’t remember the US preparing a resolution for months to strike a blow at the Islamic Republic of Iran, and it garners only one vote,” the Iranian president, Hassan Rouhani, said in a televised speech. “But the great success was that the US was defeated in this conspiracy with humiliation.”Iran’s foreign ministry spokesman, Abbas Mousavi, wrote: “In the 75 years of United Nations history, America has never been so isolated”, while people on the streets of Tehran had mixed reactions.“This is an American political game. One day they give a resolution to the security council, the next they say they have taken Iranian fuel,” said a worker at the city’s grand bazaar, who gave his name only as Ahmadi.A drug store employee named Abdoli told AFP she was happy Iran won but added that it “should interact with the United States and establish relations”.The UN arms embargo on Iran is due to expire under a 2015 nuclear deal between Iran and world powers, which allowed many international sanctions against Iran to be lifted in exchange for curbs on Iran’s nuclear programme. Donald Trump withdrew the US from the deal in 2018.“It’s a serious mistake, we regret that,” the US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, said on Saturday of the security council vote in a news conference during a visit to Poland.Israeli’s foreign minister, Gabi Ashkenazi, said the security council’s decision not to extend the arms embargo on Iran could lead to further Middle East instability.“The extremist regime in Iran doesn’t just finance terrorism: it takes an active part in terrorism through its branches around the world and uses it as a political tool. This behaviour represents a danger to regional and international stability,” Ashkenazi said in a statement on Saturday.The security council vote followed a proposal made by the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, for a summit of world leaders to avoid “confrontation” over the American threat to trigger a return of all UN sanctions on Tehran. Trump also said Saturday he would “probably not” take part in the summit.“I think we’ll wait until after the election,” he said, with the US set to hold its presidential poll in November.Speaking in Poland, Pompeo made it clear the US would press on.“It is unfortunate that the French and the United Kingdom ... didn’t support what the Gulf states have demanded, what the Israelis have demanded ... I regret that deeply,” Pompeo told reporters.“The United States is determined to make sure that the Iranians and this regime, this theocratic regime does not have the capacity to inflict even more harm on the world.”• This article was amended on 16 August 2020 to correct the description of Abbas Mousavi he is Iran’s foreign ministry spokesman, not foreign minister as an earlier version stated."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/744609bdfbac5cf39931d17f7ba1c961e09d1c40/1149_447_602_361/master/602.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3175c2d0d785376d046352a154202969","title":"irish tourism chair resigns michael cawley coronavirus travel advice","story":"Michael Cawley tenders his resignation after details of Italian holiday are revealed The chairman of Ireland’s tourism authority has resigned after defying government guidance to avoid all non-essential travel by going on holiday to Italy.Michael Cawley, Ryanair’s former chief operating officer, handed in his resignation on Saturday after details of his Italian excursion were revealed by the Irish Independent.Italy is on Ireland’s green list, meaning those returning from the country do not have to restrict their movements. However, Cawley’s trip came as Fáilte Ireland, the country’s tourism authority, launched its “no place like home” marketing drive to encourage people to take domestic breaks, while the government has also called on citizens to avoid non-essential trips abroad.Cawley told the paper he had “no wish to allow this issue to become a distraction from the important work of Fáilte Ireland in rebuilding the Irish tourism industry”.He said: “I fully support the government’s policy on tourism and I will continue to help the industry emerge from its current difficulties. It has been a privilege to serve as chair of Fáilte Ireland and to have contributed to the massive growth which Irish tourism has enjoyed prior to this global pandemic.”Tourism minister Catherine Martin said she was disappointed to learn Cawley had been holidaying in Italy.“I rang Mr Cawley this morning and he has offered his resignation, which I have accepted,” she said. “I wish to thank Mr Cawley for his service as Chair of Fáilte Ireland.“Mr Cawley has served Fáilte Ireland with energy over his time as chair, and I want to thank him for his service to the cause of tourism promotion in Ireland.

I’m just really excited to get back to the beauty side of it all now.”Hollywood Bowl said 48 of its 61 centres were reopening on Saturday, with each operating with reduced numbers of lanes, reduced customer capacity, and groups restricted to a maximum of six people.Stephen Burns, the chief executive of Hollywood Bowl Group, said: “It’s a great relief to finally have clarity on when we can reopen after such unexpected and long delays. We’ve been ready to reopen in the fully government approved Covid-secure way for many weeks and our trained teams are eager to get back to work.“Our centres are spacious and well suited for social distancing, and we’ve put in place wide-ranging hygiene and sanitisation measures. ”Grosvenor Casinos, which has a portfolio of 52 casinos across the UK, said it was reopening 35 in England. Coronavirus safety measures include a capacity cap, voluntary PPE and face coverings for guests and staff, screens on gaming tables and machines, hand sanitiser stations and contactless payments.Jonathon Swaine, managing director at Grosvenor Casinos, said: “We’ve been ready to reopen safely for a number of weeks and we are delighted we can now finally welcome back our customers to enjoy our casinos safely once more.”Genting casinos said it would be opening the majority of its casinos on Saturday. A spokesman said: “After weeks of meticulous planning, we are fully confident that our casinos are ready for re-opening. This is what we have been building towards for some time now, and the delays we have experienced have of course been hugely frustrating and damaging to the business. The re-opening is therefore incredibly exciting for all involved and we cannot wait to welcome customers back into our casinos.”The lockdown restrictions were due to be eased on 1 August, but a rise in coronavirus cases at the time resulted in them being paused for two weeks.The reopening comes as the prime minister, Boris Johnson, announced tougher fines for people repeatedly not wearing a mask.At present, people who refuse to wear a face covering where it is required face a £100 fine, which can be reduced to £50 if paid within 14 days, but under the new measures, that penalty will double for subsequent offences, up to a maximum of £3,200.A clampdown on illegal gatherings of more than 30 people could result in those responsible being hit with spot fines of up to £10,000, a No 10 source indicated.Meanwhile, the transport secretary, Grant Shapps, said an estimated 160,000 holidaymakers were expected to try to return to the UK from France on Friday before the new quarantine measures were brought in.Travellers returning to or visiting the UK from France, the Netherlands, Monaco, Malta, Turks \u0026amp Caicos and Aruba after 4am on Saturday will be required to self-isolate for two weeks."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ca6e5088fa389908e0f625b11f18136a3a0157c6/0_146_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=303be7290a74524ccc2f89da8b261a15","title":"uk to mark 75th anniversary of victory over japan day","story":"VJ Day was declared when emperor Hirohito ordered his people to stop fighting in second world warThe 75th anniversary of VJ Day – the victory over Japan which signalled the very end of the second world war – has been commemorated with a series of events honouring those who fought in east Asia.A televised remembrance service took place at the National Memorial Arboretum in Alrewas, Staffordshire, where a two-minute silence at 11am was led by the Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall.Boris Johnson read the exhortation before the silence, which was followed by a flypast by the Battle of Britain Memorial Flight over the arboretum.The RAF’s Red Arrows scheduled a UK-wide tour with flypasts to take place over the four nations’ capital cities. However, due to poor weather the flypasts over Edinburgh, London and Cardiff were cancelled.Instead, the Red Arrows flew over Glasgow Prestwick Airport, where the aircraft landed to greet three second world war veterans.Victory over Japan was declared on 15 August 1945, when the emperor Hirohito addressed his people and told them to stop fighting. The formal surrender of Japanese forces came on 2 September that year, the date traditionally commemorated by the US.The day began with a piper playing Battle’s Over at the Imperial War Museum’s HMS Belfast in London at sunrise, as part of a tribute entitled Waking Up to Peace. Military pipers also played at dawn in India, Australia, New Zealand and Nepal.The defence secretary, Ben Wallace, was joined by military chiefs as he laid a wreath at the Cenotaph in London on Saturday morning.Charles and the duchess laid poppy posies and wreaths at the Kwai Railway Memorial, while veterans looked on from nearby benches in order to maintain social distancing.The prince’s wreath read: “In everlasting remembrance, Charles,” while the duchess’s poppy posy read: “In everlasting remembrance of your service and sacrifice.”The Covid-19 pandemic has meant tributes to mark the landmark anniversary have been organised online and on television, with the Duke of Cambridge appearing on screens across the country in VJ Day 75: The Nation’s Tribute, a pre-recorded BBC programme filmed at Horse Guards Parade.William spoke of how King George VI addressed the nation as “the most catastrophic conflict in mankind’s history came to an end”.“As he marked the moment the world had long prayed for, King George expressed his pride in the international effort from across the Commonwealth and allied nations which secured success in the Asia-Pacific region,” he said.“We are forever grateful to all those who fought alongside us. It is hard for us to imagine what Victory over Japan Day must have felt like at the time a mix of happiness, jubilation and sheer relief, together with a deep sadness and overwhelming sense of loss for those who would never return home.“Today we remember those who endured terrible suffering and honour all those who lost their lives.”Shortly after 10am, the BBC broadcast the Friendship of Nations, which included 10 world leaders paying tribute to all who served. They included the Malawian president, Lazarus Chakwera, the Nigerian president, Muhammadu Buhari, and the Australian prime minister, Scott Morrison. The Canadian prime minister, Justin Trudeau, Donald Trump and Johnson also delivered remarks.Johnson said: “On this 75th anniversary of the end of the second world war, we pay tribute to the heroes deployed thousands of miles away in the mountains, islands and rainforests of Asia. “Unable to celebrate the victory in Europe, and among the last to return home, today we recognise the bravery and ingenuity of those who, in the face of adversity, restored peace and prosperity to the world.“Their immeasurable sacrifice changed the course of history and at today’s commemorations, we take the opportunity to say what should be said every day – thank you.”The Labour leader, Keir Starmer, also paid tribute to those caught up in the conflict, saying they “gave so much, not only to defend our country but for freedom across the world”.Starmer said: “The conflict in the Pacific and south-east Asia was particularly cruel and saw many British, Commonwealth and allied troops lose their lives fighting for a better world and a better future.“On behalf of the Labour party, I want to pay tribute to the wartime generation, who through the horrors of conflict showed us the spirit and determination that we need to always remember and always be grateful for.“It’s important that as we face the challenges of today, we take inspiration from that generation. Through their community spirit and their bravery and their determination for a better world, they’ve shown us what we can achieve when we pull together.”In a special message, the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh – who himself was aboard HMS Whelp in Tokyo Bay as the Japanese signed the surrender aboard USS Missouri on 15 August, 1945 – gave “grateful thanks” to all those who fought for the allied nations.In a statement, the Queen said: “Prince Philip and I join many around the world in sending our grateful thanks to the men and women from across the Commonwealth, and allied nations, who fought so valiantly to secure the freedoms we cherish today.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ad5c9e3d6351dfb6049fd3a2791b252efc7f3ebd/0_175_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8bacc1cf31bcf1eceda21f6689c383d5","title":"facebook algorithm found to actively promote holocaust denial","story":"Similar content is also readily accessible across Twitter, YouTube and Reddit, says UK-based counter-extremist groupFacebook’s algorithm “actively promotes” Holocaust denial content according to an analysis that will increase pressure on the social media giant to remove antisemitic content relating to the Nazi genocide.An investigation by the Institute for Strategic Dialogue (ISD), a UK-based counter-extremist organisation, found that typing “holocaust” in the Facebook search function brought up suggestions for denial pages, which in turn recommended links to publishers which sell revisionist and denial literature, as well as pages dedicated to the notorious British Holocaust denier David Irving.The findings coincide with mounting international demands from Holocaust survivors to Facebook’s boss, Mark Zuckerberg, to remove such material from the site.Last Wednesday Facebook announced it was banning conspiracy theories about Jewish people “controlling the world”. However, it has been unwilling to categorise Holocaust denial as a form of hate speech, a stance that ISD describe as a “conceptual blind spot”.The ISD also discovered at least 36 Facebook groups with a combined 366,068 followers which are specifically dedicated to Holocaust denial or which host such content. Researchers found that when they followed public Facebook pages containing Holocaust denial content, Facebook recommended further similar content.Jacob Davey, ISD’s senior research manager, said: “Facebook’s decision to allow Holocaust denial content to remain on its platform is framed under the guise of protecting legitimate historical debate, but this misses the reason why people engage in Holocaust denial in the first place.“Denial of the Holocaust is a deliberate tool used to delegitimise the suffering of the Jewish people and perpetuate long-standing antisemitic tropes, and when people explicitly do this it should be seen as an act of hatred,” he added.Researchers also found that Holocaust denial content is readily accessible across Twitter, Reddit and YouTube. They identified 2,300 pieces of content mentioning “holohoax” – a term often used by deniers – on Reddit, 19,000 pieces on Twitter and 9,500 pieces of content on YouTube, all created in the past two years.In the top 20 most retweeted messages on Twitter that used the phrase “holohoax”, 14 contained explicit Holocaust denial.This week a coalition of UK faith leaders will call on the government to get tougher with social media companies, arguing they are still too weak on tackling racist, antisemitic, Islamophobic and anti-Hindu hate online. However, ISD said that tackling the issue was straightforward, pointing to a sharp reduction in mentions of “holohoax” on YouTube since spring 2019, when the video-sharing platform banned Holocaust denial content.On Reddit, researchers noted how concerns from other users were effective in hiding and discrediting Holocaust denial content. Other factors limiting the visibility on Reddit included the banning of groups dedicated to Holocaust denial and moderators deleting comments.Jakob Guhl, ISD research coordinator, said: “Our findings show that the actions taken by platforms can effectively reduce the volume and visibility of this type of antisemitic content. These companies therefore need to ask themselves what type of platform they would like to be: one that earns money by allowing Holocaust denial to flourish, or one that takes a principled stand against it.” A significant amount of denial content is couched in careful language, codes and tropes, and thus this analysis probably does not show the true extent of the spread of such content on social media.A Facebook company spokesperson said: “We take down any post that celebrates, defends, or attempts to justify the Holocaust. The same goes for any content that mocks Holocaust victims, accuses victims of lying, spews hate, or advocates for violence against Jewish people in any way.“We also remove groups and pages that discuss Holocaust denial from recommendations and references to it in search predictions. While we do not take down content simply for being untruthful, many posts that deny the Holocaust often violate our policies against hate speech and are removed.They added: “In countries where it is illegal, such as Germany, France and Poland, this content is not allowed in accordance with the law. Striking the right balance between keeping people safe and allowing free speech is difficult and we know many people strongly disagree with our position.

Until now.“I was gutted obviously. We had reached 100 days so it does feel like a kick in the teeth,” said Dr Siousxie Wiles, a British microbiologist and science communicator who lives in Auckland, a city of 1.5 million.“But we know that with people coming in there is the chance this would happen.”Wiles praised the government’s resurgence strategy as “absolutely spot-on” and said it had shown an impressive ability to adapt and move swiftly through alert levels.“They have been very fast and very transparent. The speed which they moved people up the alert levels really frightened people, but this is the way to do it. What we will see now is: how quickly can you stamp out an outbreak?”The prime minister made the decision for Auckland to re-enter lockdown six hours after the first positive test result came back – light years ahead of the likes of Vietnam, South Korea, and the Australian state of Victoria all of whom were slower to reinstate lockdown.This decisiveness has won her widespread praise, apart from the opposition who said they should have been consulted.On Friday afternoon Ardern announced a softer resurgence plan than many had expected, one that will allow the economy – even in Auckland – to cope, if not flourish.Tracking and tracing cases related to the south Auckland cluster is the priority, and New Zealand police have been drafted in to help investigate the source or “index case” that kicked it off, with efforts focusing on the borders and the Ports of Auckland area, as well as a cool store facility that handled international freight in the city’s west.In addition, active cases are being quarantined in government-run hotels – a new measure adopted from some south Asian countries.Testing in the community has been ramped up with 30,000 tests conducted in 48 hours and labs working 24 hours. Auckland will remain at level 3 for an additional two weeks, giving health authorities time to test and track everyone related to the outbreak. The rest of the country will remain at level 2.The resurgence plan has earned the approval of epidemiologists, and so far, the compliance of the general public.But the fact it has to be enacted at all is being viewed as a major failure for the Labour coalition government, who are now just five weeks out from a general election. Attention is turning to the borders, where more than 30,000 people have entered a fortnight of mandatory quarantine on returning to New Zealand.Management of the dozens of quarantine hotels has long been lambasted as “shambolic” by the opposition, after a series of people escaped the facilities and made trips to the liquor store and supermarket, prompting the police and army to start regular patrols.In other cases, perhaps as many as 1,000 of them, returning New Zealanders were allowed to leave the facilities without being tested.Wiles called the oversight “deeply disappointing” while the Otago university epidemiologist Sir David Skegg said it was “extraordinary” that border workers were not being tested weekly, on a compulsory basis.“We haven’t been doing weekly testing of workers, so I think that may have turned out to be a missed opportunity to avoid this lockdown,” Professor Hendy said.Skegg agreed and called the government’s handling of the border complacent.“I think it is absolutely vital for our elimination status that we have the most stringent protections at the border.”The health minister, Chris Hipkins, has said all border workers would be tested for the virus by the weekend, but with the disease having circulated in the community for up to two weeks, the horse has well and truly bolted.In Auckland compliance with lockdown measures has been high, even as the city haemorrhages money – a calculated NZ$150m in the last three days alone.Zafer Isiklar is a cafe owner in the Auckland suburb of Mt Eden. He believes this outbreak is the result of incompetence. “They didn’t control the borders or manage quarantine well,” Isiklar said.The region of south Auckland is one of the most densely populated in the country, and the suburb of the latest outbreak is a mere 14km from the country’s only international airport.Hundreds of airport and border workers live in south Auckland, and its proximity to quarantine hotels also had it under Covid modellers’ microscope as a high-risk site for a potential outbreak.According to Statistics New Zealand half of all New Zealand’s overcrowded homes are in Auckland, with the highest rates in south Auckland. Pacific and Māori people are the most likely to live in overcrowded homes. If it was going to happen anywhere, it was here.But Hendy said there were some silver linings to New Zealand’s outbreak, and the prime minister has stressed that things are not complex or severe enough to warrant a level 4 nationwide lockdown, as so far the outbreak is limited to a single cluster.“We definitely have had the benefit of learning from what has happened in other countries,” Hendy said.“The Melbourne example was quite instructive. We learnt that suburban lockdown just didn’t work.”The prime minister has said that New Zealand will be building on it’s earlier success, which she calls “evidence-based”, “following the philosophy of hard and early.”“As we have said from the start, our overall Covid-19 strategy remains elimination. That means stamping out the virus whenever it comes back,” Ardern said.“We have been world-leading in our Covid response – we can do all of that again.”For Aucklander Craig Shearer, a software-developer from Hobsonville, any “science-based approach to handling the pandemic” wins his approval.“I think we have dodged a bullet,” Shearer says.Additional reporting by Phil Taylor in Auckland"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b9710d712a3936bc27b1db6cbc5aa762d9d6a386/0_33_4609_2764/master/4609.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a350f335fffb8b62c9bbb65c026fe878","title":"island nations have the edge in keeping covid away or most do","story":"Nations from New Zealand to Cuba closed borders promptly with strict quarantine rules, but the UK won’t admit its ‘serious mistake’Island nations have an advantage when it comes to stopping travellers importing disease, be it Covid or other infections.Seas are usually harder to cross than land, and beaches are easier to police. There are no cross-border towns, and fewer ways to sneak over frontiers.These advantages, combined with strict quarantine policies, have made island nations some of the most successful at containing Covid. But the ones that did best had shut themselves off from the world to varying degrees. And a fresh outbreak of cases in New Zealand last week suggests coronavirus can evade even tight controls.Experts say the lack of special border measures in the UK ahead of lockdown was a “serious mistake” that significantly increased the pace and scale of the epidemic. Even now, the UK’s quarantine measures – for selected countries and with limited enforcement – appear to be nowhere near as comprehensive or effective as those used by other island nations.Stringent border controls helped New Zealand eliminate Covid within three months. Prime minister Jacinda Ardern sealed its borders to all but its own citizens in March and has kept them closed with a handful of exceptions. All new arrivals have to spend two weeks in quarantine, originally paid for by the government but now self-funded.The country declared itself Covid-free in June, and until this month the few new cases identified were among travellers in quarantine. Last week, though, a new cluster emerged in Auckland, with 37 cases reported so far. Authorities have not been able to trace its origin tests so far show it is not linked to either the March-April outbreak or the known imported cases.477 cases 7 deathsTaiwan’s experience of Sars meant it was prepared to act fast. In February it banned visitors from China, and in March from the rest of the world. It was one of the first places where life returned to something like normal. Now, all new arrivals spend two weeks in quarantine – non-residents in designated hotels, where they stay in one room, with a “digital fence” monitoring their location, and regular check-ins about health and temperature required. Fines for breaching quarantine are up to a million Taiwanese dollars. Business travellers can apply for a shorter quarantine period if they get a negative Covid test.344 cases10 deathsMauritius is one of the few countries that hasn’t seen a local transmission for months, thanks largely to an extremely strict quarantine regime. Borders were sealed in March, and apart from Mauritians stranded abroad, remain closed. Every new arrival has quarantined for 14 days. The shut-down devastated the tourism industry, and authorities are working on reopening, possibly with airport testing for all.After borders closed in late March,Cuba’s underfunded but well-staffed healthcare system helped with track and trace, and controls were strictly enforced. The island has been largely Covid-free since June and in July, in need of foreign currency it reopened hotels on off-shore islets, promising a virus-free holiday. Few visitors have yet returned."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/145768436904c59f79c47320bf883c88345709f4/0_35_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=262ea31de5e7450cd2266afff3996480","title":"israel continues airstrikes on gaza in retaliation for hamas balloon bombs","story":"Israeli forces say they bombed Hamas targets for a fifth consecutive night as clashes broke out along borderIsraeli aircraft have bombed sites belonging to the militant Hamas group in Gaza for a fifth night in a row, the Israel defence force says.The military said early on Sunday that the airstrikes were in response to arson balloons that Hamas-affiliated groups sent across the Gaza frontier into Israeli territory.Clashes also broke out in the evening along the Gaza-Israeli border, the army said. A statement released by the Israel military said dozens of Palestinians burned tyres and hurled explosive devices and grenades towards the security fence while attempting to approach it.The Gaza health ministry said two demonstrators were wounded by Israeli gunfire.Over the past week Israeli forces have carried out repeated night-time strikes on targets linked to the Islamist group Hamas, which controls Gaza.The army says they are in response to the use of makeshift firebombs, attached to balloons and kites, that have been sent into parts of southern Israel, causing thousands of fires in Israeli farms and communities.There were 19 such Palestinian attacks on Saturday, according to Israeli rescue services.In response the army said “IDF fighter jets and aircraft struck a number of Hamas military targets in the Gaza Strip”. It said the targets hit included “a military compound and underground infrastructure” belonging to Hamas.Israel has also closed its Kerem Shalom goods crossing with Gaza and reduced the territory’s permitted Mediterranean coastal fishing zone, in response to the recent balloon launches.Despite a 2019 truce backed by the UN, Egypt and Qatar, the two sides clash sporadically with rockets, mortar fire and incendiary balloons.Gaza has a population of two million, more than half of whom live in poverty, according to the World Bank.Hamas “is responsible for all events transpiring in the Gaza Strip and emanating from it, and will bear the consequences for terror activity against Israeli civilians”, the IDF said.Khalil al-Hayya, a senior Hamas official, accused Israel on Saturday of not honouring an informal truce to ease the blockade it has imposed on Gaza since Hamas took it over in 2007.He told Hamas al-Aqsa TV that the Palestinian people in Gaza were experiencing slow death by the blockade."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e68d7328ea8c574f255b821563c25d742d017d6a/0_282_7155_4293/master/7155.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3ff9d7ae18f692cf85ad7cc6288de325","title":"the underwater future of the maldives in pictures","story":"By 2100 the island nation could be submerged.

It is now compulsory to cover your nose and mouth in public in the busiest areas of several French cities where physical distancing is difficult, including Nice, Rennes, Lille, La Rochelle, Lyon and Bordeaux,The French national health agency Santé publique France on Saturday reported 3,310 new infections in the previous 24 hours, another record since the country emerged from lockdown in mid-May.It said some, but not all, of the increase was due to massively increased testing, warning that the proportion of positive tests was increasing steadily.The Netherlands, meanwhile, added Paris and the Bouches-du-Rhone area, Brussels, Madrid and several Spanish regions to its orange advisory list, warning against all but essential travel and demanding that people returning go into quarantine for 14 days.Britain is also on the list because of the 14-day quarantine it has imposed on travellers from the Netherlands, but those returning from the UK are not required to quarantine when they get home.More than 650 people tested positive for coronavirus in the Netherlands in the 24 hours to Saturday, bringing the country’s latest weekly total to 4,508, more than 1,000 more than the previous week.Guidance urging travellers to avoid using public transport in Wales except for essential journeys is being scrapped from Monday.The Welsh government is telling people to act responsibly and avoid travelling at busy times where possible, as the number of coronavirus cases continues to fall.Face coverings on public transport remain compulsory except for people who are unable to wear one for medical reasons.Under measures announced last week, people in Wales will be able to see more of their families and friends from 22 August. Up to four households will be able to join together to form a single extended household and up to 30 people will also be able to join a meal indoors after a wedding, civil partnership or funeral if social distancing can be maintained.Essential travel only guidance was dropped in England on 17 July.Meanwhile, in Russia, 4,969 new cases of coronavirus have been confirmed, bringing the nationwide tally to 922,853 – the fourth highest caseload in the world.Russia’s coronavirus crisis response centre said that 68 people had died over the past 24 hours, bringing its official death toll to 15,685. It added that 732,968 people have recovered.The Philippines has recorded 3,420 new cases of the coronavirus and 65 additional deaths, the health ministry has announced.The country has so far registered a total of 161,253 infections and the death toll from Covid-19 has risen to 2,665 according to ministry data.Good morning, good afternoon and good evening.Its Mattha Busby here taking over from my colleague Helen Davidson.

Stay safe and well.Northern Ireland’s chief scientific adviser has warned of the risks of complacency after Covid-19 cases in the region increased rapidly last week. Professor Ian Young said it was “inevitable” that there would be a significant increase in coronavirus cases if people stopped following social-distancing rules designed to prevent the spread of the disease.The reproduction rate of the virus is estimated at between 1.2 and 2.0, according to Northern Ireland’s Department of Health. There were 242 cases last week, with 74 positive tests announced on Friday alone – only 237 people tested positive during the whole of July.Read the full report from the ’s James Tapper and Henry McDonald here:Parts of Malaysia’s Penang island are back under strict movement control orders, after more than 100 days dubbed “Covid-free bliss”, the Straits Times is reporting.It comes after a 58-year-old woman was diagnosed with the virus on Friday, and two new cases were reported on Saturday.According to the article, roadside hawkers can only serve takeaways, and while restaurants and coffee shops are allowed to have dine-in patrons they must strictly observe operating procedures.No form of crowding is allowed.Ms Nor Fazila Jaafar, 33, who works at a Malay food shop near the walk-up flats where the 58-year-old woman lives, said she was told on Saturday morning that they had to stop allowing dine-in.“Business was so bad. We cooked less, but we still only sold 30 per cent of the food all morning and afternoon,” she said.“We discovered that our rice comes from the sundry shop where the Covid-19 patient’s daughter works.”More on the confusion in US schools, from Reuters in Nebraska, where a school district said on Saturday it had canceled classes after staff members tested positive for the new coronavirus, the latest state to see instruction disrupted after resuming in-person learning.Three staff members have the virus that causes Covid-19 and 24 more are in quarantine for exposure in the Broken Bow School District about 190 miles (300 km) west of Omaha, superintendent Darren Tobey said in a statement.Preschool and grade 6 to 12 classes are canceled until 24 August.President Donald Trump has made reopening schools a re-election campaign issue, threatening to pull federal funding if institutions fail to do so, but resumption of classroom teaching ran into trouble in several states this week.There is no national plan for school reopening, and Education Secretary Betsy DeVos has urged districts to resume in-person classes when they consider it safe.That has led to a patchwork of policies, ranging from Republican Governor Pete Ricketts saying it was safe to resume in-person learning in Nebraska to Democratic Governor Michelle Lujan Grisham delaying classes until 8 September in New Mexico.The Australian shadow government services minister, Bill Shorten, has taken aim at the profit-driven focus of the nation’s privatised aged care homes, while blaming the federal government for failing in its duty to oversee the system during the pandemic.The former Labor leader asked how privatised centres were able to “serve two masters” – profit and care – given the cost of properly caring for elderly people, particularly those with health issues such as dementia, was not insignificant.“This is the problem,” he told the ABC. “Looking after elderly people with diagnosis of dementia is not cheap. So if we want to make a profit, and you want to look after people, then you create faultlines in the system.“Covid-19 right across Australian society has revealed things which have been glossed over. And if you’re a worker in the system, and they’re doing the hard and the tough work, they have to work at multiple centres just to make a living.”Sydney Girls High School will be closed for cleaning on Monday after a student tested positive for Covid-19. Trial HSC exams scheduled for tomorrow will be postponed, the school said in a Facebook post.“The school will be non-operational tomorrow for the on-site attendance of staff and students to allow time for the school to complete contact tracing and have the school cleaned. All staff and students are asked to self-isolate while contact tracing occurs.”"},{"url":null,"title":"climate","story":"\u0026lsquoExtensive Irish commitment to data centres\u0026rsquo could cause cost to consumer, study findsBuyers may want to go green, but for those travelling long distances the range is smallReform needed to safeguard \u0026euro6bn income while promoting electric vehicles, economist warns"},{"url":null,"title":"heritage","story":"Michael Viney: North Atlantic\u0026rsquos top predator now shares island with 13 other speciesMichael Viney: The wayside ashes of the west stand as defiantly healthy emblems of their kindInidual ants are certainly not smart, but their group wisdom may exceed our ownMichael Viney: Irish numbers have more than doubled since the counts of Operation Seafarer in 1970Michael Viney: A predator denning in parks, gardens and wasteland gets mixed responsesA beefed-up, independent National Parks and Wildlife Service would be just the ticketMichael Viney: Wild grasses have loved the mood swings of our climate this yearAnother Life: As one of many of the world\u0026rsquos declining seabirds, puffins are now receiving much more necessary and serious attentionAnother Life: A new book on the founders of the Tyler Prize shows their political influenceAvian science journal Ibis reports \u0026lsquogreat conservation concern\u0026rsquo about the speciesAnother Life: Dairy farmer Bruce Thompson examines impact of worming drug on beetlesMichael Viney: Crumbling hilltop trig pillars\u0026rsquo played key role in the mapping of IrelandAntipodean flatworms pose risk to indigenous variety which could have severe knock-on effectsAnother Life: Some floaters circle territories and sneak the odd \u0026lsquoextra-pair copulation\u0026rsquoMichael Viney: Plant intelligence rests in the ways by which they solve their problemsA Life on Our Planet is a terrifying catalogue of our self-sabotaging transgressionsGreys carry squirrel-pox virus which is fatal to Ireland\u0026rsquos native redsAnother Life: The disappearance of this bird from cities has prompted much researchRobinson has followed Mair\u0026eacutead, his wife and collaborator, into the list of Covid-19 fatalitiesWill Covid-19 begin a resurgence of the 1970s withdrawal from growth-driven capitalism?Greater industry involvement required if bovine TB to be eliminated by 2030 target"},{"url":null,"title":"confronting","story":"A news podcast from The  that covers Ireland\u0027s response to the Coronavirus outbreak.

File photograph: Dara Mac DónaillThe In a statement today, Minister for Tourism Catherine Martin said she had accepted his resignation. “Tourism and hospitality have suffered significant losses since the start of this pandemic, with the industry in the three midlands counties of Laois, Kildare and Offaly particularly affected at present,” she said. “While Italy is on the green list, meaning that people who return from there do not have to restrict their movements, the Government has called on people to avoid all non-essential travel. Many of our citizens and residents have followed this guidance at some personal and financial cost to themselves.”She said the Government and her Department in particular has encouraged people to holiday in Ireland this year, with the vast majority of people heeding that call.“I was disappointed to learn that the chair of Fáilte Ireland was holidaying in Italy. I rang Mr Cawley this morning and he has offered his resignation which I have accepted. I wish to thank Mr Cawley for his service as chair of Fáilte Ireland.”She said Mr Cawley had served with “energy” over his time as chair and she thanked him for his service to the cause of tourism promotion in Ireland. “He recognises that solidarity with the industry is extremely important at this time, and I have accepted his resignation this afternoon because I believe his position was untenable,” she said.DistractionMr Cawley according to a report in this morning’s Irish Independent, is in Italy for a holiday. He told the paper it was a “family decision and a personal decision” to travel. He said he planned to take two holidays in Ireland this year, and that he had met family members who lived abroad on the Italian trip. In a statement on Saturday afternoon Mr Cawley said it was with great regret that he had tendered his resignation.He said: “It is with great regret that I have this morning tendered my resignation as Chairman of Fáilte Ireland to Minister for Media, Tourism, Arts, Culture, Sport and the Gaeltacht, Catherine Martin TD.“As has been reported in the media this morning I am on a pre-arranged family holiday in Italy, which is on the Government green list. As I have no wish to allow this issue to become a distraction from the important work of Fáilte Ireland in rebuilding the Irish tourism industry, I have decided after six years in the position to step down. I fully support the Government’s policy on tourism and I will continue to help the industry emerge from its current difficulties. It has been a privilege to serve as chair of Fáilte Ireland and to have contributed to the massive growth which Irish tourism has enjoyed prior to this global pandemic”.CEO of Fáilte Ireland Paul Kelly thanked Mr Cawley for his “strong chairmanship” and contribution to Fáilte Ireland and to the tourism industry since his appointment as chairman of the authority in 2014.“Michael has been an invaluable support to the executive team at Fáilte Ireland. He has made a significant contribution to developing and growing the tourism sector in Ireland. On behalf of the executive team and staff I want to express my thanks to Michael and I wish him well in the future,” he said. LeadershipSinn Féin’s spokeswoman on tourism Imelda Munster said the holiday was “a crass error of judgement”.“It shows a desperate lack of leadership… lots of us have family abroad and haven’t seen them, most people would have liked to holiday abroad this year,” she said. “For the head of a tourism board to jet off like that depicts a lack of leadership and no faith in his own industry. (It is) a slap in the face for his own industry, which is on its knees.”Senator Mark Wall, the Labour Party spokesman on tourism, said it was “unbelievable”. “I travelled into the town of Athy and other towns in south Kildare yesterday in the business of tourism, they’re on their knees.”Fáilte Ireland has been the main State agency responsible for a months-long campaign to encourage people to take holidays at home in order to support the domestic tourism industry, which is uniquely exposed to the economic impact of the Covid-19 pandemic. Italy is on the Government’s so-called “green list” of destinations, meaning normal precautions apply to travel there, with no period of restricted movement expected for those arriving into the State from there. However, the Department of Foreign Affairs continues to advise against non-essential travel overseas. Mr Cawley was paid €21,000 in board fees for each of 2017 and 2018, the most recent years for which information is available. The issue also drew criticism from those in the hospitality trade. Adrian Cummins, the chief executive of the Restaurants Association of Ireland, said “leadership starts at the top and this is definitely poor judgement and shows how out of touch the chairman of Fáilte Ireland is at a moment in time when our tourism industry needs every support it can get.“Restaurants and tourism businesses across the country are struggling to stay afloat, but when you see the chairman of the national tourism board not leading by example it’s shocking optics.”Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4331413.1597525894!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"coronavirus 200 new cases reported in largest daily total since may","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tSome 25 cases have been identified as community transmission, with 68 per cent of cases among those under 45 years of age.  File photograph: Alan BetsonThere have been 200 new cases of Covid-19 reported on Saturday , the Department of Health has confirmed. It brings to 27,191 the number of confirmed cases of Covid-19 in the State.No new deaths were reported. A total of 1,774 people have died of the disease.It is the largest number of cases reported in a single day since the beginning of May. Dr Ronan Glynn, the acting chief medical officer, said the situation facing the country is “deeply concerning”. The Republic now has “multiple clusters with secondary spread of disease and rising numbers of cases in many parts of the country,” he said, adding the National Public Health Emergency Team (Nphet) will “monitor this extremely closely over the coming days”. Some 25 cases have been identified as community transmission, with 68 per cent of cases among those under 45 years of age. Sixty-eight of the cases are confirmed to be associated with outbreaks or are close contacts of a confirmed case. Of the new cases, 81 are in Kildare, 56 are in Dublin, and 13 are in Tipperary, where a mushroom facility was closed on Friday following an outbreak among staff at Walsh’s mushrooms in Golden, near Cashel.The HSE has set up a testing facility in the town.“This virus is still out there and has not gone away. Covid-19 seeks to capitalise on complacency and is just waiting for the opportunity to spread. I am asking everyone, especially those who are over 70 or medically vulnerable, to limit your contacts, keep your distance from other people and take extra care to heed public health advice,” Dr Glynn said.Eight cases were recorded in Limerick, six in Laois and Galway, and five each in Meath and Kilkenny. The remaining 20 cases are in Carlow, Clare, Cork, Donegal, Louth, Mayo, Offaly, Roscommon, Waterford and Wicklow.Validation of data has led to the denotification of four confirmed cases.RedoubleThe Minister for Health Stephen Donnelly said a number of our EU neighbours are also experiencing an uptick in cases. “The virus capitalises on complacency. Please redouble your efforts on handwashing, physical distancing and reduce your contacts,” he urged in a message on Twitter.He said the spike in cases in young people is a real concern. “They can get very sick, but do so less frequently than older people. But young people can transmit the virus to anyone. The decisions you make about who you meet and where you go are hugely important,” he said.“It may not be your life but your choices could be the difference between life and death for someone else - someone you love. Remember that most people are susceptible to this virus,” he added.The HSE’s CEO Paul Reid said the number of cases on Saturday was a concern but people should hold firm. HospitalMeanwhile the number of confirmed and suspected cases of Covid-19 in the hospital system continued to remain steady at the end of the week, new figures released by the Health Service Executive (HSE) show. As of 8pm on Friday evening, there was a total of 14 confirmed cases admitted to hospitals, and a further 136 suspected cases across 29 acute hospitals monitored by the health service. This is an increase of one confirmed case and a decrease of two suspected cases when compared to the same time the previous day. When compared with the same time last week, it is an increase of two confirmed cases and 24 suspected cases. There are currently 308 vacant general beds, excluding critical care beds, across the hospital system. Some 33 adult critical care beds are available, in addition to six paediatric beds and 15 critical care beds in the private system. A total of 284 critical care beds are occupied, including eight occupied by Covid-19 patients. A further nine patients with suspected cases of Covid-19 are in critical care beds. Five confirmed cases are ventilated, as well as three suspected cases.The latest data on contact tracing shows the average time taken from referral for a test to obtaining a lab result is two days. This is a slight increase on the same day last week, when the process was being completed in 1.8 days. The average time to complete contact tracing calls is 1.8 days, an increase on last week’s figure of 1.2 days. NorthEarlier, the Department of Health in Northern Ireland reported a further 65 diagnoses of Covid-19 there on Saturday. The total number of cases in the region is now 6,364 there were no further deaths linked to the disease, with the toll remaining at 558. Some 173,227 iniduals have been tested in the six counties, with 289 positive tests in the last seven days.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4330683.1597437468!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"schools urged not to demand clean uniforms each day","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tA Department of Education spokesman said ‘current policy on school uniforms remains a matter for the board of management of each inidual school’. Photograph: Bryan O’BrienSchools have been urged not to impose financial pressure on families by directing parents to provide clean sets of school uniforms each day.Some parents have expressed concern about recent communications from certain schools urging that freshly-laundered uniforms or school-branded tracksuits be worn every day in order to help limit the spread of Covid-19.There is no reference in public-health guidance to daily washing of school uniforms or any clothes, and acting chief medical officer Dr Ronan Glynn has confirmed no such advice has been issued by health authorities.A Department of Education spokesman said “current policy on school uniforms remains a matter for the board of management of each inidual school”.One mother, whose twins attend a Co Limerick primary school, said she received a note last week “encouraging” parents to have two to three crested tracksuits, “one should be washed and dried every day”. The mother said the crested tracksuits cost €35-€40 each. “That means, having twins, I may have to buy six tracksuits which are also very cumbersome to wash.”Jean Leonard, principal of the Assumption Junior School in Walkinstown, Dublin, said she was changing policy so that all pupils would wear tracksuits, whereas until now those in first and second class wore a uniform. “We are doing this because they are easier to wash,” she said. The principal said she was not asking parents to launder the tracksuits every day because it would be difficult for some, such as those living in accommodation for homeless who had no laundry facilities easily available.“I do think most parents will choose to do it and would like other parents to, but we are conscious there has not been a directive from the department on this.”Paul Rolston of the National Parents’ Council Post-Primary warned any new requirements, such as changing uniforms on a regular basis or buying additional supplies, could put parents under financial pressure. “There are issues to do with dry clean-only uniforms, cost consideration and hassle,” he said. Páiric Clerkin, chief executive of the Irish Primary Principals’ Network, said: “At primary, a lot of schools have tracksuits and uniforms, so there could be flexibility there. We expect schools and boards of management will be pragmatic, support families and come up with flexible approaches which put families at ease.”Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"asia","story":"Covid-19 outbreak spreads to more than 30 people and extends beyond capitalJacinda Ardern sounds warning as number of cases in locked-down Auckland rises to 17Hundreds of police had raided Apple Daily in move decried as assault on press freedom\u0026lsquoGoing hard, going early with lockdown is still the best response,\u0026rsquo Jacinda Ardern saysReturn to nationwide restrictions announced by PM Jacinda Ardern in surprise press conferenceReaders queue from 2am to buy pro-democracy tabloid after owner Jimmy Lai\u0026rsquos arrestFair Work Commission\u0026rsquos decision that man made \u0026lsquooffensive\u0026rsquo video overturned on appealMaria Ressa\u0026rsquos news organisation Rappler is a buffer against dictatorship in PhilippinesLai has been a prominent democracy activist and an ardent critic of BeijingAuthorities warn against complacency as other countries battle a resurgenceCrack in hull of Japanese-owned ship is spilling oil into country\u0026rsquos famed blue lagoonsAttitudes still shaped by legacy code of conduct that dictates women must be submissive and patientAircraft with 190 passengers and crew on board overshoots runway in heavy rain in CalicutAbe avoids reference to nuclear treaty during scaled-back ceremony due to coronavirus\u0026lsquoWhat frightened me the most was how we got used to the piles of dead bodies\u0026rsquo \u0026ndash survivorIndia\u0026rsquos supreme court handed site to Hindus last year in culmination of complex disputeChina says attempts by Washington to engage more closely with Taipei \u0026lsquodoomed to fail\u0026rsquoCountry\u0026rsquos move closer to China set to be confirmed after unusually subdued pollThree men stuck on tiny Pikelot Island after boat ran out of fuel spotted by military aircraftAustralian state to deploy military, impose hefty fines to enforce Covid-19 isolationStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"middle","story":"Thursday\u0026rsquos announcement underlines split in Arab world on Palestinian questionIsraeli right wing furious over decision to drop plans for annexation of parts of the occupied West BankDire condition of Libyan migrant detention centres condemned by human rights groupsCountries to open diplomatic relations for first time and Palestine accuses UAE of selling outAgreement between the two countries described as \u0026lsquoa complete sellout\u0026rsquo of PalestiniansMove seen as victory for Israeli PM Binyamin Netanyahu and will infuriate PalestiniansCountry needs administration that can fight graft, says German ministerWith 200 dead, 6,000 injured and 300,000 destitute, the mood in Beirut is unbendingNames of victims read aloud at demonstration near site of explosion that killed at least 171Prime minister Hassan Diab says blast that killed at least 163 was result of endemic corruptionResignation of government could enable international donors to sideline corrupt administrationPolice fire tear gas near parliament as donors pledge \u0026lsquomajor resources\u0026rsquo after explosionPort officials globally have a tough time preventing the abandonment of ships or seafarersTwenty-five years after the Balkan conflict\u0026rsquos worst atrocity the Bosnian town remains idedDemonstrations stretch far beyond prime minister\u0026rsquos official residence in Jerusalem\u0026lsquoWe have no trust in our government . . .

Video: NYT\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tJoe Biden and Kamala Harris. That Biden chose a candidate so evidently symbolising generational change has raised some Democratic hopes that he is resurrecting the winning Obama-Biden combination of 2008 and 2012. Photograph: Robyn BeckAFP via Getty ImagesThis week, after the most sedate US presidential campaign in recent memory, due to coronavirus, the 2020 election race suddenly got interesting.On Wednesday, hordes of media representatives and Democrat supporters descended on the small state of Delaware to witness what is likely to be the most consequential political decision of Joe Biden’s long career. A day earlier, Biden had named Kamala Harris, a daughter of immigrants and member of the US Senate, as his running mate in November’s election as he seeks to unseat Donald Trump.Hours before their first appearance together at a suburban Delaware high school, supporters were showing up, undeterred by the fact that they would be unable to witness in person this moment of history because of Covid-19 restrictions.“I just felt I wanted to be here,” said Pam, a retired African-American woman who had driven north from Maryland. “They’re the perfect ticket. I have always admired Joe. And Kamala – her intelligence, her experience. She is willing to grow, to do, to help the ordinary person.”That Joe Biden chose to hold one of the key moments of his presidential campaign in Delaware is not surprising.Though born in an Irish-American household in Scranton, Pennsylvania – a connection that his critics say he overplays at every opportunity to demonstrate his homely, man-of-the people, persona – the small state of Delaware, half way between New York and Washington DC, has been his home for more than six decades.Service stationOffaly’s Barack Obama Plaza notwithstanding, few other politicians have a motorway service station named after them. Biden does – the Biden Welcome Center is a recognisable stop-off on the busy I-95 freeway that tracks the east coast.Biden’s secluded lakeside home, surrounded by satellite trucks and media vans this week, is just a few miles away from the high school where Wednesday’s event took place. So too is St Joseph of the Brandywine’s cemetery, the resting place of his son Beau who died in 2015 of brain cancer at the age of 46.Joe Biden’s life story is one of professional triumphs and personal tragedies. In 1972, a week after he was elected to the Senate for the first time at the age of 29, his wife and 13-month daughter were killed in a car crash. His two young sons, Beau and Hunter, survived but spent weeks in hospital. Biden was sworn-in as senator at the hospital bed of one of his sons. He then began the daily commute from Delaware to Washington DC by train to make sure he was always there to give them breakfast.Over the next 40 years, Biden carved a career as a Washington insider as he rose up the ranks of the Senate. He developed a reputation as a bridge-builder, an east coast Democrat who once worked as the only white lifeguard in a predominantly African-American pool, but who could work with arch-conservative Republicans across the aisle.But this bipartisanship brought its own questions – most notably his willingness to work with known segregationists in the Senate.As chair of the senate judiciary committee in the early 1990s he oversaw the Anita Hill hearing, established to investigate allegations of sexual assault brought by Hill, a young African-American government employee, against supreme court nominee Clarence Thomas.Fresh scrutinyHis handling of the episode would come under fresh scrutiny almost 30 years later during the 2020 campaign at the height of the #MeToo movement. So too would his support for the 1994 crime Bill signed by then president Bill Clinton that led to a steep rise in the incarceration rates for black men.The decision by the young senator from Illinois, Barack Obama, to select Biden as his running mate in 2008 surprised many. Biden, then chair of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, had helped introduce the young Obama to the workings of the upper chamber when he was elected in 2004.But the choice of Biden proved politically astute – adding a generational weight to the experience-lite Obama ticket. “I want someone with gray in his hair,” he reportedly told confidantes. Though temperamentally very different – the loquacious and gaffe-prone Biden contrasted with the reserved, almost austere Obama – they developed a strong working relationship.Twelve years later, Biden has now been faced with the same choice as Barack Obama – who to pick as his own vice-presidential candidate as he seeks to dislodge Donald Trump from the White House.After a months-long selection process, involving teams of lawyers vetting and interviewing almost a dozen woman, Biden named Kamala Harris, a 55-year-old senator from California, this week.The choice was paradoxically the least surprising, and the most radical.Harris, a highly accomplished prosecutor who has impressed through her forensic questioning of Trump officials and US supreme court justice Brett Kavanaugh in her role as senator, was always the most likely choice. She has been the front-runner since ending her own presidential bid last December, a campaign that now appears to have been well-conceived given that it dramatically raised her national profile. \u0026nbspBut the fact that Biden has chosen the first black and Indian-American vice-presidential candidate of any political party without much fuss suggests how far the US has come in terms of what it expects from its political figures.Civil rights marchesHarris was raised in Berkeley, California. Her mother, a PhD student from India, met her father, a Jamaican-born academic, during the civil rights marches of the 1960s.Harris and her younger sister attended services at a black Baptist church and a Hindu temple when they were growing up, with Harris choosing to attend the historically-black institution of Howard University in Washington DC. After law school back in California, she embarked on a successful career as a prosecutor, serving as district attorney of San Francisco and attorney general of California.In 2013 she met her husband, Doug Emhoff, on a blind date. The pair married a year later and she is stepmother to his two children.In her first public appearance with Biden at the Greenville high school this week, a beaming Harris gave some hints of how she intends to campaign over the next 80 days, as she delivered a commanding and comprehensive speech. \u0026nbspShe took on Trump directly – as a former prosecutor, she said, the case against Trump and Pence is “open and shut” –\u0026nbspand she outlined her commitment to racial justice, climate change, as well as plans to deal with the coronavirus pandemic.Harris also spoke in moving terms about her friendship with Biden’s late son Beau. Both served as state attorneys general at the same time, and Biden himself has said that Beau’s respect for Harris was one of the reasons he chose her, despite Harris’s well-publicised attack on the former vice-president’s record on race relations during the first Democratic debate.That Biden chose a candidate so evidently symbolising generational change, as well as representing a different gender and race, suggests he is aware of his own limitations as a candidate. It has also raised some Democratic hopes that he is resurrecting the winning Obama-Biden combination of 2008 and 2012.But like Obama’s choice of Biden, the double-act is about more than identity politics. Just as Biden shared many of Obama’s political policies and instincts, Harris is similarly a centrist candidate. Like Biden, Harris is a moderate progressive, much more to the centre than many in the party would like. While Harris’s record as a prosecutor is likely to come under scrutiny from those who believe she was too reticent to investigate police misconduct, for the most part the left wing of the Democratic Party has rowed in behind her and Biden.InfightingUnlike the 2016 Democratic campaign when the infighting between the Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders camps continued right up to the convention, next week’s largely virtual convention will see left-wing stalwarts of the party such as Sanders and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez deliver prime-time speeches, as the Democratic Party tries to show a united front.Such is the effect of the Trump presidency, that the imperative to remove Trump is overriding any real attempt to debate or scrutinise the direction of the Democratic Party at this moment, though that conversation will ultimately return. \u0026nbspAs for the Trump campaign, the president has lost no time in denigrating Harris as “nasty” “angry” and a “mad woman”.“She’s very bad on facts. She is very weak on facts,” he said this week about the one-time federal prosecutor.Trump and his daughter Ivanka in fact donated to Harris’s campaign for attorney general between 2011 and 2014. A spokeswoman said this week that the former developer and reality TV host donated to candidates across the political aisle at that time.With Harris due to hit the campaign trail in the coming weeks, following next week’s national convention when she will officially accept the nomination along with Biden, the Trump campaign now has a new force to reckon with.Given the broadly unsuccessful attempts to smear Harris this week, it is evident that the Trump campaign has a battle on its hands as its confronts the challenge of a Biden-Harris ticket.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"britains universities have become indoctrination camps reckoning","story":"The Institute for Fiscal Studies recently announced that 13 universities in the UK face a very real prospect of going bust. Like all such announcements in the higher education sector the news was clearly meant to be received with a gasp of fear. Worse, the IFS warned that it is our least prestigious universities that are most at risk.I don’t know about you, but on reading this news I immediately put my head in my hands and cried, “Oh no. Not our least prestigious universities. Take anything but that.”There are many oddities about our higher education system. Oddest is the presumption that the more universities there are and the more people go to them, the better our country will be.Tony Blair was merely the most notorious proponent of this idea. His target of 50 per cent of young people going to university was achieved last year. Is our country noticeably smarter or more successful as a result? Many would say not. In some ways I would say it is noticeably stupider.One clue as to why lies in the old truth identified by Kingsley Amis. Which is that in certain areas – and universities are the most pronounced – more means worse. You may expand the sector, certainly, but at some liminal point everything you get is worse.Visit the universities at the bottom of the league tables and you will see this for yourself. Universities in towns you knew had a cathedral but are surprised to learn also have a campus. These are full of students being charged top-dollar to learn ‘international relations’ or ‘journalism’ at best. That is to be trained in non-disciplines for careers that barely exist.There might be some excuse if they were, as a by-product, being trained to be open-minded, perceptive and creative iniduals. But for many people university is an indoctrination-camp, not a place for mental stimulation.Those who attend them are being factory-farmed to have the same boring and malevolent views. For example, you have to have been educated at a British university to go home and inform your parents that “gender is a social construct”. Or that the whole curriculum is “colonial” and needs to be “decolonised”.Rather than improve British societies, the automatons churned out by our universities are merely clogging up our country with bad thinking which becomes (when the graduates are employed) massive bureaucratic distraction-techniques. That British universities expand and make money out of this venture does not endear them to all of us.And that is before you get to the racket of ‘international students’. The loss of foreign students in the coming academic year is one of the threats to certain universities that the IFS has identified. But those who warn of this fail to acknowledge what this ‘threat’ reveals.Certainly there are some universities and courses where the presence of international students is a recognisable boon. Historically it has been a magnificent form of ‘soft-power’ among other things.Of course the unions and other spokespeople for the university sector rarely talk of it in such terms nowadays. They suggest that their love of foreign students is simply an expression of their personal liberal internationalism.In fact, for most universities foreign students are a piggy-bank. Their eyes grow beady at the opportunity to charge fees above the cap imposed by the government on British students.Nor is this avarice limited to the universities at the bottom of the league tables. Look at the experience given to many postgraduate students at universities like Cambridge and you will hear a familiar story.Sky-high fees, and the expectation of a full immersion in university life translates into a foreign student being rinsed for cash with the rarest imaginable meetings with a supervisor.Behind the scenes many university staff are embarrassed by this. But the finance departments and overpaid vice-Chancellors love to use the resulting charts to prove that their university is growing.Many could do with contracting, or simply disappearing altogether. And the era of Covid has put some of this into a newly imaginable perspective. Just as the likely diminishment of foreign students in 2020 has exposed UK universities’ over-reliance on this as an income stream, so the necessity to go online reveals a deep question about the nature of the modern university experience.Today if you have access to the internet you can follow a university course at any of the great universities of the world. Many of these – including from American Ivy League schools – are free online. Many other lectures – often far more cutting-edge and free-thinking than those found on our increasingly doctrinaire campuses – are free at the click of a button.Once students begin shelling out fees for a virtual university experience, questions will be raised. “Is this really the best education I can buy?” and “Is such an education worth ‘buying’ in the first place?” Traditionally the greatest universities have given an experience which is about so much more than just lectures.As one retired academic friend said to me recently, the real secret of university education is that the students educate each other. That is one of the ideals of the true, genuinely liberal university system. The lecturers provide the impetus, and the students cogitate amongst themselves.But as the universities have become greedy they have also become more cautious. Not just more cautious – indeed reluctant – about academic freedom (see the seemingly endless restrictions on this at Cambridge). They have also become more cautious in every other way about protecting themselves, certain of their employees and specifically their freedom from litigation.So in their precautionary Covid-aversion they are organising virtual freshers’ weeks, support bubbles and more to try to pretend that the class of 2020 will be a normal one. But it won’t be in any of them. And for some it may be the last.If that is so then we should not mourn the fact. The problem would not have been that 2020 was the year when the students dried up. The problem would be that 2020 was the year that the students saw through the universities and wondered – like everyone else – whether what they get for the down-payment is returned in any currency of value.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"british photographer reveals charmed way a list actors dressing","story":"One might wonder how renowned British photographer Simon Annand managed to charm his way into the dressing room of so many A-list actors and actresses.An intensely private and unseen world, the 65-year-old was granted access to observe the likes of Dame Judi Dench and Sir Anthony Hopkins 30 minutes before the curtain raised, and they found themselves on stage.He revealed to The  that it all began 37 years ago, pulling pints at the Lyric Theatre Hammersmith where he got to know them personally behind the bar as he served them drinks.He had worked behind the bar for two years in the early 1980s. As much as he loved the theatre, he was “frustrated” by the job. So, buying a second-hand camera, he persuaded Griff Rhys Jones to allow him to take some shots, including in his dressing-room just before the actor was to appear in a staging of Charlie’s Aunt.He said: “Immediately, I thought, ‘I haven’t quite seen that before’ and for the next 37 years I started doing all sorts of actors, in the dressing room where they’re getting themselves ready to go out there and face the music.”Now he is lifting the lid on some of the backstage secrets by revealing hundreds of photographs in a forthcoming publication. There are images of Jude Law, just before he transformed into Hamlet at the Wyndham’s in 2009, with a photograph that he had with him of Fred Astaire to “lighten the mood of the Prince’s melancholia”.Then there was Juliet Stevenson, minutes before her appearance in The Heretic at the Royal Court in 2011, seen next to the word ‘listen’ which she had written in huge capitals “to remind herself to do so in the performance”.Other stars include Tom Hiddleston, seen working out for Coriolanus at the Donmar Warehouse in 2014, “preparing for a role full of physical and mental challenges”, Mr Annand recalls. Or, Jeff Goldblum at the Vaudeville Theatre in 2010, limbering up for The Prisoner of Second Avenue, by playing the piano “non-stop” for 20 minutes.He said that while some method actors will be immersing themselves in “aspects of the performance as they get closer to curtain-up”, for example, through music or not talking to anybody, other actors “chose not to get into the part until about two minutes before they step on the stage”.He added: “One of the aspects of my photographs is capturing some of the melancholia that exists in the dressing rooms.”He noticed that on his first assignment. Although Mr Rhys Jones was portraying “a very ebullient character” in the riotous farce Charlie’s Aunt, the atmosphere in his dressing room was entirely different, essentially “more melancholic… more introverted”.His book, Time to Act, will be published on September 14.In an essay written for it, Victoria Broackes of the Victoria \u0026amp Albert Museum, which has staged touring exhibitions of Mr Annand’s work, writes: “The actors are seen as workers, not celebrities. His photographs reveal a fragility and humanness without undermining the courage that comes with being a performer and doing what many of us would find practically impossible.They also give an insight into the intimacy of the actor’s dressing rooms and the various ways they mentally prepare: a calming cigarette a final bit of chat with co-stars the finishing touches of make-up or perfecting the body language of their character.“Contrary to the glamorous image of theatre dressing rooms that we might imagine, most people would be surprised to see the cramped conditions in many British theatres today.”Mr Annand said some of facilities backstage are so minimal, with only one toilet, for example, that one actress was reduced to urinating in a sink.Theatres were long seen as ideal places for thieves and vagabonds to operate and Annand believes that the dressing rooms in old buildings reflect a time when actors were still looked down upon.Many are full of cards sent by other actors and bouquets of flowers. He said: “Some of them just let the flowers sit there and die. I’ve got pictures of four-month-old flowers which have gone grey, brown and brittle. I\u0027m never quite sure why they do that. There are some others who are real gardeners, who chuck them out.”If an actor is playing a famous historical character, such as Winston Churchill, Mr Annand said that they will often have images of those people “dotted around the mirrors, to give them a sense of the journey they need to go on that evening”.Singling out the Theatre Royal Haymarket among historic West End playhouses, he said: “You know that the greatest actors of their generations have been in these rooms.

it’s unambiguous evidence that there is infectious virus in aerosols, she said.However, some experts say the results should be interpreted cautiously, as it is unclear whether the sample of the virus isolated by the scientists is enough to infect someone.“It’s very hard to sample biological material from the air and have it be viable,” said Shelly Miller, an environmental engineer at the University of Colorado Boulder who studies air quality and airborne diseases.“We have to be clever about sampling biological material so that it is more similar to how you might inhale it.”In this study, the scientists used two samplers positioned at two metres and 4.8 metres from the patients in the hospital room.They were able to collect the virus at both distances and laboratory tests revealed the samples were sufficient to infect cells in a dish.This was despite the fact none of the patients had undergone medical procedures which the World Health Organisation had previously identified as primary drivers of airborne transmission.In addition, the air in the room was regularly being cleaned using specialist equipment.Given the virus could still be isolated in the air samples, the scientists believe this means the risk of transmitting the virus indoors is far higher than previously thought.The study concludes: With the current surges of cases, to help stem the Covid-19 pandemic, clear guidance on control measures against SARS-CoV-2 aerosols are needed.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"have finally woken small town belarus turns back europes last","story":"Deep in the Belarusian countryside, burly men with sun-burnt cheeks stood outside their quarry with home-made posters reading “We stand for free and fair elections” mounted on top of the machinery.They were on strike for the first time in their lives in what could be the most significant week in the nation’s post-Soviet history - and another turning point in relations between Europe and Russia.Small-town, working-class Belarus, once loyal to Alexander Lukashenko, the president of 26 years, has turned its back on Europe’s last dictator following widespread election fraud in Sunday\u0027s vote, savagery by riot police and horrifying stories of torture in Belarusian jails.With the opposition ranks swelling in the capital Minsk, it is the heavy industrialised towns like Hrodna that could spell the end of the continent\u0027s longest-serving leader in the coming days.To handyman Roman Vydra, in his mid-40s, a chubby man with a broad face, official results that gave Mr Lukashenko an 80 per cent win at the polls were a personal insult.“No one thought the vote-rigging would be so brazen,” he told The , standing in his tracksuit and oversized blue t-shirt near one of the loaders under the afternoon sunshine.“I don’t know a single person who voted for the current president.”While middle-class activists and intelligentsia marching in Minsk may not trouble Mr Lukashenko and his inner circle as he hangs on to power, factory floors cleared of workers rising up in the name of democracy leaves the strongman facing an uncomfortable reality.Employees at tractor works, quarries, bus depots and oil refineries in Belarus have all downed their tools. Workers at dozens of state-owned factories across the country have either walked out or threatened industrial action unless authorities meet their demands: hold a new, fair election, stop police violence and release thousands of people detained at anti-government demonstrations earlier this week.With state-paid workers turning against him, Mr Lukashenko is losing his main electoral base as well as billions of pounds in revenue that he has used to maintain Belarus’ mighty security apparatus and secret services.  The working-class revolt in Belarus has more than echoes of anti-Communist protests in eastern Europe in 1989 when workers tipped the scales to help bring down the Soviet Union.Belarusian protesters are on the cusp of breaking a decades-old status quo in the region with Belarus serving as essentially the buffer zone between Russia and European democracies.In the medieval town of Hrodna, just nine miles away from Poland where electoral fraud of the scale seen in Belarus would be unimaginable, workers spoke of monthly salaries under £300 and the way that outright lies on state TV, which portrays Belarus as a workers’ idyll, clash with the reality of declining living standards near the EU border.At a quarry, several dozen men in tracksuit trousers and overalls stood by the side of the road, smoking cigarettes and waving white balloons at the passing cars.“We’ve been cheated for such a long time, and now enough is enough,” said Mr Vydra, the handyman, who conceded that he and his friends did not care about elections in the past until they saw last Sunday’s vote-rigging and the ensuing crackdown.This week\u0027s unrest began when protesters against Sunday\u0027s election result were met with a staggeringly vicious police response.Riot police and special forces in full gear would throw stun grenades at unarmed people and fire rubber bullets into crowds, killing three. Belarusians with blood streaming down their faces fled the scene.Days later, protesters were released from detention, with bruises covering their bodies like full-body tattoos in a chilling testament of beatings and torture at the hands of law enforcement.Nearly 7,000 people across the country have been detained, and hundreds have been injured and beaten up while in custody. A 16-year-old man detained at a Minsk protest was taken to hospital from jail on Saturday after he fell into a coma from beatings.The scenes of police violence have stunned the nation of nine million people, drawing comparisons to the country’s history as a major battlefield in the Second World War.Hrodna, a quiet town of 370,000 people, with baroque cathedrals, was plunged into urban warfare for several nights in a row as riot police in full gear chased away anti-Lukashenko demonstrators.Less than a mile away from Hrodna’s picturesque bridge overlooking two medieval fortresses, middle-aged men came out of the Neman cigarette factory to discuss an upcoming walkout during their lunch break. Standing in the air smelling of tobacco, the several dozen men spoke about a car accident provoked by riot police that shook residents to the core.On Tuesday night, riot police officers threw themselves onto a car of a local family and started thrashing it with truncheons as punishment for honking in support of the protests. An armoured vehicle rammed into the car from the back, injuring a five-year-old girl who was in the back seat, local media reported.“What we saw on our streets was open warfare. How can you forget it and move on?” said Rashid Latykov, who came out of the factory building to buy a pack of Minsk cigarettes from a nearby kiosk. “Our country has been seized by a gang.”Earlier that afternoon the cigarette factory workers held a union meeting. It started with a call to stand up to show if they voted for opposition candidate Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, who fled the country after reported threats. The entire room of people in Neman’s blue uniforms got up and clapped.But nothing, perhaps, cuts deeper for Mr Lukashenko than unrest at the iconic Minsk Tractor Works, which accounts for 10 per cent of global tractor production.There is a saying in Belarus that outsiders know the country for two things: potatoes and tractors. Asked about the dangers of coronavirus earlier this year, the president said: Tractors will heal everything.Workers from the plant marched across the city centre on Friday after the prime minister refused to speak to them publicly during a visit.On Thursday, several-hundred angry workers confronted the local mayor outside the gate of the BelAz heavy machinery plant in a Minsk suburb.The country’s eight largest enterprises that have staged walkouts this week brought in a combined £9.5 billion in revenues last year, according to the Russian news website The Bell.Once scared of losing their jobs, workers in Hrodna say they have passed the point of no return.“That violence has changed anything - I can’t stay silent,” Larisa Rybak, a petite woman in blue-and-black overalls of the Hrodna Azot fertiliser plant, told The  as she walked out of the plant’s gate at the end of her shift to join a march into the city centre.At 54, Mrs Rybak, who makes about £400 a month, is nearing state pension age in an economy with dim prospects, but she feels compelled to be part of the movement on the cusp of toppling President Lukashenko. “We have finally woken up, and we won’t leave till he goes.”As the clock struck 5.30pm, she and several-hundred men and women in Hrodna Azot overalls set off from the factory to join a 30,000-strong rally in the centre, chanting “Long live Belarus!” and flashing  peace signs.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"ministers urge no10 wait september expanding red list","story":"Boris Johnson is being urged by ministers not to add any more countries to the quarantine list in order to save what is left of the summer holidays.There are fears that if Greece joined France and Spain on the list it would collapse the travel corridor system that has given overseas holidays to hundreds of thousands of Britons during the pandemic.The status of Greece was uncertain on Saturday with one Cabinet minister saying that it all depends on the numbers. Transport secretary Grant Shapps will review its figures on Thursday.Ministers are privately now hoping that the position will not be clear cut enough to force a decision before the end of this month to avoid ruining holidays for tens of thousands of Britons.One minister said: We should be wary of doing this too precipitately - I do think that the evidence in France seems clearer cut.

As dawn broke a lone piper played \u0027Battle’s O\u0027er\u0027 on the decks of HMS Belfast in London.Various world leaders including the US President Donald Trump and the Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau released a joint televised message while the Duke of Edinburgh contributed to a video memorial featuring veterans of the conflict.On August 15, 1945, the Duke was a young Naval officer aboard HMS Whelp in Tokyo Bay as the Japanese signed the surrender aboard USS Missouri.The Duke of Edinburgh and the Queen also released a joint statement reflecting on their memories of VJ Day and “the jubilant scenes and overwhelming sense of relief” that the war had come to a close. Such joy was tempered, they said, by the cost borne by so many”.On Friday, only around 45 veterans attended the main event at the National Memorial Arboretum – their numbers diminished by social distancing requirements and age.Those present recalled the privations of jungle warfare. In conversation with the Prince of Wales and Duchess of Cornwall (who laid her own posie of poppies) 97-year-old Edward Woodward who served in Burma, India and Malaya with the Royal Corps of Signals, asked them to guess the most sought-after item in their air-dropped rations.Toilet paper, he deadpanned to the amused pair.One of those responsible for delivering those jungle airdrops was Warrant Officer Richard Wellings, who was part of a Dakota crew delivering supplies across Burma.During the service was the first VJ Day commemoration the 97-year-old had ever attended and he did so with a tear in his eye – in memory of fallen comrades and his wife Joan who died two weeks ago. “I feel proud knowing we did something essential and good,” he said.  Others came bearing the scars of the Burma campaign. Lance Sergeant Peter Heppell, 100, sheltered under a Chindit hat during the ceremony – a token of the elite guerrilla training he underwent before flying into Burma. Embedded in his upper left thigh was a piece of a Japanese mortar shell.He said the commemorations were a fitting tribute to the Forgotten Army. “A lot of my mates never came back from there and I think they ought to be remembered,” he said.Prime Minister Boris Johnson read the Exhortation before the two minute silence, which was followed by the Battle of Britain Memorial Flight flypast over the arboretum.The Kohima Address, so often recited in remembrance ceremonies though of particular poignance for VJ Day veterans due to its inscription in the memorial to the 2nd British Division commemorating the fallen during one of the key battles in the Far East, was recited by veteran Richard Day.The 93-year-old, who served with the Royal Welch Fusiliers, was present at Kohima and the words – ‘when you go home, tell them of us and say, for your tomorrow, we gave our today\u0027 – were recited in memory of fallen comrades.The Prime Minister also laid a wreath and spoke with various veterans, among them 91-year-old Jane Elgey, a survivor of the Japanese camps in which over a quarter of all Allied prisoners of war lost their lives.Elgey had been captured aged 12 with her family following the fall of Singapore in 1942. Her father, who worked as a civil servant for the British, managed to get the family on a tugboat but was then separated as Japanese aircraft strafed the harbour. Elgey spent the rest of the war as a prisoner with her mother, grandmother and four siblings.She was put to work fetching water for Japanese officers and fed on just one bowl of rice a day – watered down to  three meals. “If you disobeyed orders you were badly treated,” she says. The family were reunited after the war although her grandmother didn’t survive the camps.As the Prince of Wales said in his speech, the veterans of the Far East “comprised a force whose courage was as remarkable as its ersity”.Friday\u0027s service was designed to reflect the contribution of so many nationalities. Sikh veteran Darbara Singh Bullar, who served as a signaller in Burma and Singapore, laid a wreath alongside the Prince of Wales. Following the two minutes silence a lone Gurkha played the piper’s lament.No Gurkha veterans from the Second World War were in attendance, though a living link to the past was proud to play his part.Captain Buddhi Bahadur Gurung, a 45-year-old Afghanistan veteran is the grandson of the legendary Bhanbhagta Gurung who in March 1945 was awarded the Victoria Cross for a heroic one-man dash through the Japanese lines. No fewer than 29 Victoria Crosses were awarded during the Burma campaign, the highest tally of any theatre of war.“I am proud to be here,” Captain Gurung told the . “I grew up with his stories and that is what inspired me to join the British army and continue what my grandfather did.”The day’s commemorations didn’t entirely pass without a hitch. The Red Arrows had been scheduled for the first UK-wide tour since the London 2012 Olympics, conducting flypasts across the four nation’s capital cities.However, due to poor weather, the flypast over Cardiff and Edinburgh and Cardiff were cancelled. In Scotland, the Red Arrows were erted to Glasgow Prestwick Airport, where the aircraft landed to greet gathered Second World War veterans.The day concluded with the Duke of Cambridge giving a televised tribute on Friday evening. Remembering the address of his great grandfather, King George VI, delivered 75 years ago to mark the end of the war, the Duke spoke of his pride at the resolve of the wartime generation.“To each and every one of you who contributed to the effort, I say – thank you our country owes you a debt of gratitude,” the Duke said in his address. “Your bravery, and the sacrifices you made, will never be forgotten.”More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"chess players cash online put fortnite call duty counterparts","story":"Chess players are now earning more money online than their Fortnite and Call of Duty counterparts, prompting a row with competitive gamers who argue the game shouldn\u0027t be classified as an esport.World champion Magnus Carlsen has pocketed over $260,000 (£199,000) in prize money since hosting an online chess tournament during the Covid-19 pandemic.The vast sum has seen the Norwegian Grandmaster leapfrog most of the world\u0027s top esports earners, with the 29-year-old almost certain to be ranked number one if he overcomes American rival Hikaru Nakamura in the Magnus Carlsen Chess Tour final.However, Carlsen\u0027s foray into competitive online gaming has drawn criticism from some industry experts, who claim chess should not be categorised as an esport.Chester King, founder and CEO of the British Esports Association, said chess was in a different league to popular games such as Call of Duty, League of Legends, and Fortnite as it is a board game being streamed virtually rather than a video game in its own right.He told the : You can’t say chess is an esport. In my mind the word virtual is more appropriate for online chess than esport. If you go to the core of it, chess is a board game.However, while Mr King said chess and esports should be classified separately, he stressed there were similarities between them, such as players relying on setting strategies in order to be successful.“When we talk to people about esports and the positive side of it, we always say look it is a bit like modern chess because of the socialisation aspect of it. Most of the popular esports are also team sports.”“When we speak to parents and teachers and we say \u0027you’re complaining that your child is playing three hours of esports a night or on the weekend. Would you be complaining if your child was playing three hours of chess\u0027, and they say no, he added.Currently, esports do not have a governing body or overarching regulatory mechanism, meaning little can be done to prevent chess from marketing itself as an esport.Online versions of the board game have benefited from a surge of interest during lockdown with thousands of viewers tuning in to matches being played out on streaming platform Twitch.Nakamura, one of the star names using the platform, has almost 500,000 followers. However, Twitch does not classify chess as an esport, instead placing it in the same category as board and card games.  However, chess officials say a growing attraction to esport audiences can help attract younger players to take up the board game.David Llada from The Fédération Internationale des Échecs (FIDE), the international governing body of chess organisations, claimed chess should be viewed as the father of all esports.Chess is a sport, officially recognized as such by the IOC. It requires skill, technique, reflexes. All this is still there when you play it online. If you consider FIFA and Formula 1 Virtual an e-sport, definitely the same applies to chess, he said.Mr Llada added: Chess has actually been always in the frontline of innovation and closely connected to every breakthrough technology.Every major advance in computer science has been somehow connected to chess: from the first supercomputers to personal PCs, smartphones, artificial intelligence.You can be sure that as soon as we have a quantum computer, one of the first tasks that it will be given would be to solve the game of chess.Sebastian Kuhnert, CEO of chess24, said the huge financial rewards on offer to chess players meant the game was now able to compete with top online games.He added: Millions of people play every day on chess platforms such as chess24, and since Covid-19 elite tournaments like the Magnus Carlsen Chess Tour have sprung up online and been hugely successful.We have our stars and we have huge prize money at stake, so this is a great opportunity for online chess to enter the world of esports and compete for the attention of children and adults with the other big online games.The difference with online chess, of course, is that it comes from traditional over the board chess which has a long and established history and culture all of its own.The game itself is 1,500 years old and we have recorded games going back centuries and a World Championship that started in 1886.

People on social media were quick to praise Parton for speaking out.“Between Dolly Parton’s quiet Covid research fund, BLM support, and her sending generations of children books through the USPS, at 74, she continues to be one of the most relevant and ever timely people of every era,” wrote one Twitter user.Parton was also described as a “national treasure,” and an “American treasure”, while someone else described Parton as “one incredible American”.Comedian and actor Patton Oswalt wrote: “Me: I couldn’t love @DollyParton more.

I have got them outlined and a chapter written I think of the first one, so I know it’s there.”Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesHowever, it could be a while before fans will be able to get their hands on the next Twilight instalments. Meyer added: “I am not ready to do that right now – I want to do something brand new.”The Twilight saga was also adapted into a hit film franchise, which starred Robert Pattinson as the sullen vampire Edward and Kristen Stewart as the love-struck mortal Bella.Midnight Sun review: Time’s up for Twilight’s twisted romanceAnna Kendrick compares working on Twilight to a ‘hostage situation’Midnight Sun has sold more than a million copies in the US in a week.In the UK, 62,460 hardback copies  were sold in the three-day window between the novel’s launch and the cut-off date for sales monitor Nielsen BookScan’s charts, which was enough to launch Meyer into the number one spot. In a two-star review for The Independent, Annie Lord wrote that Midnight Sun is “a frustrating reminder of how much of popular culture focuses on a helpless woman being saved by a troubled, yet ultimately forgivable man”.The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

All money raised from the auction will go to The Independent’s appeal partner, The Felix Project, London’s largest food surplus distribution charity. Our campaign has so far raised £7.5m towards our £10m goal which includes a pledge to open London’s largest community kitchen to tackle food poverty.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesHighlights from the Sotheby’s Help the Hungry auction include a drawing from Tracey Emin, a series of three etchings by Anish Kapoor, Mark Wallinger’s “Ghost”, and Bob \u0026amp Roberta Smith’s “We Have Only Got Each Other” placard.British-Nigerian artist Yinka Shonibare also joins the catalogue with his “Unstructured Icons - Aristocrat I” alongside a pair of polished steel reliefs by Michael Craig-Martin and a floral plate by Chinese artist Ai Weiwei.

This new community kitchen will provide a high-quality meal for homeless Londoners, cooked by great chefs using surplus food.” Turner Prize-winning artist Mark Wallinger said: “I am delighted to contribute to help raise funds for The Felix Project, a fantastic charity that does such vital work in providing food for vulnerable people throughout London, work that is ever more necessary in our current crisis.”Sotheby’s Help The Hungry Auction will go live on 20 July and will run until 30 July.Help the hungry\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspNo hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

I’ve also been thinking a lot about the people in lockdown, particularly women facing domestic violence, and I’m proud to be able to be a voice for those who don’t have one.”Prior to the swim, Ms McCardel said she hopes her latest feat can help to raise awareness about domestic violence, revealing this week that she is a survivor who has been diagnosed with Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder.There was initial concern as to whether Ms McCardel and her team would need to quarantine on their return to the UK, with the Department of Transport warning that the Australian should seek legal advice over the issue.However, she said she had been given the all-clear by English and French coastguards and was now hoping to celebrate once she was back on British soil.“I would like to have a little celebration this evening in England,” she added.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Mike Hill tells The Independent he is waiting for workers and tourists to start coming back to his small pub, The Rake, and beer shop in Borough Market, central London.Sharing the full story, not just the headlines“In terms of the commerciality of it, the reality is we’re down 50 per cent on the sites at Borough,” the Utobeer founder says.Hill says another of his sites in Stratford, east London, is also “missing the people who work in and around the area”.What are the UK lockdown rules now?How to ease yourself back into socialising once lockdown liftsThe new lost generationWhich countries are seeing a second wave of coronavirus?How to wear a face mask safelyGreene King, a huge pub chain in the UK, says their city centre pubs are also feeling the absence of office staff, who often head to pubs for after-work pints. “We continue to see a wide disparity between country pubs where customers are returning and those in central London, which rely on custom from tourists and office workers,” Karen Bosher, a director for the pub retailer, tells The Independent.“While most pubs are facing challenging trading, it is city centre ones, and in particular central London, which are being hardest hit as offices and theatres remain closed and the streets are quiet.”Meanwhile, elsewhere in the English countryside, pub landlords have told The Independent they have seen had a good first month of being able to reopen, after staying shut for months due to the pandemic. Joe Tansley, who runs a pub in a village in Worcestershire, says he had 90 customers booked in on the day he spoke to The Independent in early August.

McClarkin also senses a feeling of wanting to “support your local” during this time, which people may realise they have not used enough in the past. “We are seeing far more confidence out in community pubs,” she says, adding this seemed to be the “trend across the country”.Greene King says the “vast majority” of its pubs around the UK have reopened, which has been allowed since 4 July, while 40 per cent in London are still shut “as they are not currently viable”. “In central London, across the City and West End, our pubs are trading significantly behind the rest of our managed estate,” Bosher, the managing director for premium, urban and venture brands, says.She adds: “We are confident that once customers see first-hand the pub safe measures we have introduced in our managed pubs, they will feel reassured that the pub is a safe place to visit.”Like many other pubs, The Rake in London has had to make changes to allow it to reopen safely during the coronavirus outbreak, such as introducing a one-way system and getting customers to write down their name and phone number on a card that is kept for two weeks – in case they need to be traced. The tiny pub, which sits close to the Thames, has been open since early July, albeit on reduced hours.Landlord Mike Hill says it has been a good feeling to see customers coming back. “It’s very much business as usual, in reality,” he tells The Independent. “The problem is, there’s just not enough of them.” Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Swindon is now the fourth worst affected area in the UK when measured as a proportion of population, having seen a 200 per cent increase in new cases over the last seven days.It has nearly as many new cases per person as Leicester, which was the first place to see tougher local restrictions put in place after the nationwide lockdown lifted.The UK as a whole remains a long way off its peak levels from April and May, when daily new cases frequently reached above 5,000.Yet local spikes could see the recent upwards trend continue if not brought under control, as has been the case in other countries like France and Spain.Having endured a big surge in cases during the early stages of the pandemic, London has since seen its number of daily cases drop at an even greater rate than the rest of the country.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

At a time when Londoners from all walks of life are struggling due to the impact of coronavirus, the importance of love and care from others has been magnified tenfold.The phrase comes from a work made by the artist Bob \u0026amp Roberta Smith – one of several fantastic lots in an auction kicking off today at sothebys to support The Independent’s Help the Hungry appeal.Over the past four months we have raised more than £7.5m for food redistribution charity The Felix Project – a cause for which we have pledged to raise £10m as well as to open central London’s largest community kitchen.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe auction is an opportunity to get your hands on works by some amazing artists – more likely to be seen on the walls of a museum than your living room. They can also be viewed at Sotheby’s, 34-35 New Bond Street.Ceramic has been a recurring motif for Ai Weiwei (a 1995 series of photographs showed him dropping a Han dynasty urn) and he has often used porcelain, for centuries a secret formula known only to Chinese makers. Flowers, too, are significant – when his passport was taken Ai put a bunch of fresh flowers in a bike basket outside his studio every day until he was able to travel freely. This small plate holds a great deal of meaning.Yinka Shonibare deconstructions of icons of western power couldn’t be more current. This elegant woodcut print, using vivid Batik textiles, transposes animal masks from Mali onto the faces of English aristocratic figures enriched off the back of colonisation and slavery. The patterns of textiles overlay the repeating patterns of power and show how history’s long fingers reach into our present.Unfailingly optimistic, Bob \u0026amp Roberta Smith’s work is always a call to care. He’s known for his colourful and impassioned but peaceful slogans (“Make Art Not War” seems like a good standard to live by) and his advocacy of art as a tool for education and understanding. We Have Only Got Each Other quotes his late mother, the artist Deirdre Borlase, spoken in response to the isions revealed during the Brexit campaign — but its universal meaning is clear.I’m a sucker for a good drawing – I’ve always felt that even at 500-odd years distance, it’s the form that brings you closest to an artist the sweep of a human hand that has just left the page. After many years of deeply mining her own emotions and experiences in her work, Emin is an artist at the height of her powers. Her raw, almost agonisingly expressive draughtsmanship gets me every time and this little sketch nails the feeling of having a really good cry.These three etchings – a supremely generous donation from Anish Kapoor, more usually known for the interactive theatricality of his large-scale sculptures – exude a quiet drama. Their simplicity belies their seductiveness velvety and intense, they draw you in, never quite revealing their secrets.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Wallinger was inspired by X-rays of Old Masters, which he thinks of as akin to spirit photography: “The revelation of the invisible, supernatural life of a painting.”A reminder of the pre-lockdown era, when we were able to wander the Hayward Gallery and bathe in the sea of pulsating colour that was Riley’s superb exhibition. This screenprint is from a series that vibrates right off the paper (Tate owns an edition of Elongated Triangles 5, so you’ll be in good company if you get your hands on this one).The essence of things is what Michael Craig-Martin seeks in his work, and colour is part of seducing the viewer to really look at the objects that make up our world. These sculptural reliefs in polished steel come from a series that pays homage to designers and architects whose vision has shaped what we think of as “modern”. You can’t sit on them, but look at them.

Several roads were closed and the surrounding area was cordoned off“I feel my life has been completely ruined, I can’t get into any universities with such grades or progress further in my life,” the New College Stamford student said. “I would like to know how this has happened.”In response, Mr Gibb, the schools minister for England, who was also appearing on the programme, said: I do feel for you. This should not have happened to you. We don\u0027t want you to have to go through this stress of having to go through an appeal to find out what’s going to happen to your career.“None of this is satisfactory, the best system is for people to take their exams – that’s what should have happened. It’s what we wanted to happen, but we had to take a very difficult decision in March to cancel exams and what we didn’t want was for young people like Nina to have to delay a year.”Starmer urges government to scrap ‘injustice’ of A-level results“The reason for the standardisation model is to ensure we have consistency between schools and we don’t have grade inflation.”Mr Gibb was then challenged over why the system was not working by BBC presenter Chris Mason, as the student told the minister “you have ruined my life”. But the education minister added: It won\u0027t ruin your life, it will be sorted I can assure you. The trouble with these models – when you have a model that standardises grades across the country there will be imperfections in it.”“That’s why we have introduced very robust appeals processes that schools will trigger for candidates like Nina. Those appeals will happen very swiftly and universities have said they will hold offers open until 7 September and we’re working through that now.”The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Under Section 21 of the 1988 Housing Act, no reason needs to be given to seek possession, but tenants must be given two months’ notice.This was extended by ministers to three months at the beginning of the crisis, which will remain in force until 30 September in England. Earlier this month, the Welsh government said landlords would now need to give renters six months’ notice before any eviction, with the exception of cases relating to anti-social behaviour.Boris Johnson has pledged to end so-called no-fault evictions – as did his predecessor Theresa May – in a new Renters’ Reform Bill, but it will not be brought forward until the “urgencies of responding to the pandemic have passed”.The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

These crucial steps will help keep thousands safe in their homes.“The eviction ban lifts in England in little over a week and time is running out. With the country plunged into an unprecedented recession, tens of thousands could face the trauma of losing their homes over the autumn and winter.“The government must show it hasn’t abandoned renters in this country. When parliament returns after the summer break, their priority must be to give judges new powers to stop renters being evicted because of Covid-19. Otherwise, we risk rising homelessness adding to the economic crisis.” Crisis, a charity that works to prevent homelessness, said it was difficult to calculate the total number of people affected if the government does not extend the ban or introduce emergency legislation, but added that 24,000 possession claims were issued by the courts before the March ban. Many of these are probably ongoing and could be reactivated imminently.Dan Wilson Craw, the deputy director of Generation Rent, added: “If courts start hearing eviction cases in a week with no new protections from the government then thousands of renters will be vulnerable to losing their homes. Warrants paused since March can be reactivated and bailiffs could be around within days.“Because landlords don’t have to give a reason to evict, anyone who has received a valid Section 21 notice faces losing their home – whether they have been able to pay rent or not. The government must extend the ban to stop any evictions using no-fault grounds or where the renter has lost income due to coronavirus.” The government has previously said landlords and tenants should “work together and exhaust all possible options” to ensure eviction cases only end up in court as “an absolute last resort”. Landlords will also be required to set out information to the courts on tenants’ circumstances, including the impact of the coronavirus crisis on a “tenant’s vulnerability”.However, Ruth Jacob, a policy officer at Crisis, told The Independent the judges presiding over these cases will be “powerless” to do anything with the information.“If the landlord is evicting someone under Section 21 they don’t have to give a reason,” she added. “If the notice has been served correctly then there’s no legal protection to prevent someone from being evicted and that’s something the government could solve quickly and easily, early in September.“What we need to see now is the government act as soon as they come back from recess in September to introduce emergency legislation that would actually help to mitigate the effects of the ban coming to an end and protect tenants that have been affected.”However, a survey from the National Residential Landlords Association (NRLA) suggested that 95 per cent of private tenants are paying their rent or have made alternative arrangements with landlords, including deferrals and a decrease in payments. The organisation claimed less than a third of those in arrears, or two per cent of its polling sample, have been served with a possession notice.It is also calling on the government to introduce hardship loans for tenants forced into arrears as a result of the pandemic.Ben Beadle, chief executive of the NRLA, insisted the vast majority of landlords and renters were “working together to sustain tenancies, and critically that the overwhelming majority of tenants are paying rent as normal”. He added: “Eviction is not, and need not be, an inevitable outcome where tenants have struggled to pay their rent due to Covid-19. Those who argue otherwise are stoking needless anxiety for tenants. When the courts do start to hear cases again, it is essential that they deal swiftly with the most serious cases, including those where tenants are committing anti-social behaviour or where there are long-standing rent arrears that have nothing to do with the pandemic.”A spokesperson for the Ministry of Housing, Communities, and Local Government said: “The government has taken unprecedented action to support renters during the pandemic, including providing financial support to enable tenants to pay their living expenses and their rent, and this has helped ensure no one was forced from their home.“New court rules will provide appropriate support to those who have been particularly affected by coronavirus when court proceedings start again, with landlords required to set out information about a tenant’s circumstances, including the effect of the pandemic on a tenant’s vulnerability, when bringing a possession claim.“We’re committed to breaking the cycle of homelessness and to ending rough sleeping for good. That’s why we changed the law so councils now have a duty to try to stop people from becoming homeless and have provided over half a billion pounds to tackle homelessness and rough sleeping in 2020 and 2021.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.A new study has revealed that one of the world’s most endangered species of elephant is under greater threat than previously thought. Africa’s forest elephants have been decimated by the illegal wildlife trade, with more than two thirds killed in the last decade. There was estimated to be around 90,000 left, with about half of that population believed to be in Gabon.However, a study by a 10-member international research team fears that the total remaining population could be between 40 to 80 percent smaller. The study, published in PLOS ONE, shows the urgency of The Independent’s Stop The Illegal Wildlife Trade campaign, which calls for an international effort to clamp down on the illegal trade of wild animals.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesFunds raised will pay for vital wildlife protection projects implemented by the campaign’s partner charity Space for Giants. This will work to help stop the poaching and illegal trafficking of animalsThe illegal trade of wild animals is the world’s fourth largest criminal enterprise, after arms, drugs and human trafficking.The forest elephant has been ruthlessly hunted by poachers in the rainforests of Democratic Republic of the Congo, Cameroon and Gabon. The ivory is smuggled to Asia where it is in high demand for intricate carving. However the full extent of the bloodshed has been hidden from the world’s gaze.Professor Lee White, Gabon’s Minister of Water, Forests, Oceans, Environment and Climate Change, welcomed The Independent’s Stop The Illegal Wildlife Trade campaign and said that the world must act now to end wildlife crime, to both protect forest elephants but also for greater global security.“The illegal trade of wildlife wreaks havoc in Africa and even threatens to destabilise whole countries,” White said. “The ivory trade is linked to terrorists and criminal syndicates who also smuggle gold, guns and people at Gabon’s border with Cameroon.”White says some poachers in Gabon “take a ‘shoot on sight’ approach” to confrontation with law enforcers, and have become “much more violent and threatening” in the past five years. “It is partly because we have become more professional and aggressive, but also because there’s now much more involvement of organised crime.”No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Biological anthropologist Nelson Ting co-led the study, which revised the population size by using a method known as genetic capture-recapture, which involves assessing dung piles. Ting said “Gabon was thought to be a population stronghold, but even our most optimistic results suggest a smaller population size. Our research shows how endangered they really are. “Forest elephants are among the most threatened animals. More information is key to figuring out the best ways to prevent extinction.”Forest elephants are the smaller, rarer cousins of the giant savannah elephant, and their densely wooded habitat makes them harder to study and count.White, a biologist born in Manchester, spent his childhood in Uganda where he developed a passion for elephants. “Tragically, nobody had noticed that Gabon had lost about a third of its forest elephants. You can’t fly over and see the carcasses because they’re hidden”As poachers continued to empty the country of its forest elephants, White spearheaded a war against them - and against ivory trafficking in particular.The threat to forest elephants has been greatly reduced, but danger still looms large. Gabon has maintained its usual level of frontline protection throughout the Covid pandemic in case of any upturn. Elephants can also be killed during conflict with local people, often after trampling or eating crops. Space for Giants is working with the National Parks Agency and Assala Energy over three years to build 23 miles of electrified farm boundary fences to keep elephants from danger, and to protect people’s livelihoods.Several fences have already been completed. These types of projects provide local communities with a sustainable way to earn a living, and are designed to incentivise the communities to help protect their primary source of undeveloped wealth capital, Gabon’s rich bioersity and forest elephants.White was appointed to Gabon’s cabinet by President Ali Bongo Ondimba, whom he calls “one of the planet’s greenest heads of state”, and today he works to not only save forest elephants for their own sake, but to also protect the health of the whole planet.Space for Giants Founder and CEO Dr Max Graham explains: “Forest elephants are incredibly important for the health of our whole ecosystem and in fighting global warming. “They play a role in the dispersal of seeds, which have to go through their gut to germinate, and the unique way in which they forage creates a forest canopy structure that is perfect for carbon sequestration. “They take out the young growth and leave what is longstanding, which has been attributed to creating carbon stock worth billions.”The survival of forest elephants is a human issue, inextricably linked to issues around environment, poverty, law enforcement and finance.White believes that international effort is needed to end the poaching war being waged against Africa, and that wildlife crime needs to become a new global priority in order to protect species and prevent another global pandemic.“If we don’t deal with the illegal wildlife trade we’ll have criminal and terrorist groups rampaging across the continent, destabilising countries,” says White. “But we also cannot continue to aggress nature and think there will be no price to pay. “If we continue to cut down forests, kill animals and destroy ecosystems the consequences will be catastrophic. We must be stewards of nature if we want it to keep being friendly”.Stop the Illegal Wildlife Trade\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.It was a particularly cold June morning in northern Kenya when rangers working in Loisaba Nature Conservancy first spotted a large male elephant limping near a watering hole. The rangers began monitoring the elephant, a large bull with enormous tusks, who was nicknamed Alan. Max Silvester, a Conservation Volunteer in Loisaba, said “the injury was likely the result of a botched poaching attempt. Alan had some of the biggest ivory I have seen.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesA wounded animal is liable to attack anything that comes close to it, and the elephant charged at the team who assembled to help him. “I was very afraid because he was huge,” said Loisaba’s Security Assistant Rita Orahle, who assisted KWS vet Dr Dominic Mijele.“He was trying to scare us by trumpeting because he knew he could not run away due to his injury”, said Dr Mijele. “I darted him and it became obvious that the wound was caused by a bullet which had entered the animal’s right foot, having first grazed the trunk.“After cleaning the injury and administering antibiotics I gave him an antidote and he walked off. If the elephant had been left untreated he would have been dead within a week.”All hunting is illegal in Kenya, a nation that has led the war against the plundering of wildlife, and ivory trafficking in particular. The Independent\u0027s Stop The Illegal Wildlife Trade campaign was launched to call for an international effort to clamp down on poaching and the illegal trade of wild animals.Funds raised will to pay for vital wildlife protection projects implemented by the campaign’s partner charity Space for Giants. This will work to help stop the poaching and illegal trafficking of animals.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The communities around Loisaba understand the value of wildlife, and the happy result is the conservancy is a zero poaching zone - a fact that even pachyderms themselves might understand. Silvester told The Independent “it’s likely that Alan the elephant was shot elsewhere, but the intelligence of this bull, in moving quickly to a place of safety Loisaba Conservancy, allowed the rangers and the vet team to assure his wound was treated quickly and successfully.“He continues to roam Laikipia as a testament to his forefathers, the huge tuskers before him.“Orahle adds “the rangers continued to monitor the bull, and he was last spotted in early August looking happy and not limping at all.”Alan was not the only animal to be rescued in Loisaba that day. The ranger team rushed off to treat a giraffe with a split hoof. In the midst of a raging global pandemic Loisaba’s wildlife operations continue to protect endangered species, preserving bioersity and supporting local communities in the process.The wildlife veterinary unit that saved the elephant is sponsored by Sheldrick Wildlife Trust, working in collaboration with KWS, to attend wildlife cases in Laikipia.

That’s the biggest month-on-month jump since records began. It’s clear that we DO stand a chance of a relatively swt economic recovery - but onlyBrits start going about their pre-Covid lives sooner rather than later. And with hospital cases down  per cent since the peak of the coronavirus pandemic, the NHS is in no danger of being overwhelmed. Of course Covid isn’t over and we can’t be complacent. But Government scientists are attracted to long-term lockdowns because they’re trained to think about public health in the narrowest possible terms. The rest of us, though, understand that in the long run, mass poverty and unemployment kills just as surely as any disease.It’s time to get Britain working.OUR sympathies are with A-level students facing uncertainty today. Given the unprecedented situation has wreaked havoc with their exams, no solution is going to be perfect.And so we offer broad support to the Government and its “triple lock” strategy, which aims to give the vast majority of English and Welsh pupils the results they deserve.It makes much more sense than the indiscriminately clunky Scottish strategy — which saw thousands of kids miss out on good grades, until Nicola Sturgeon was forced to make a humiliating U-turn and bump grades up.We are concerned, though, about the long-term prospects of school leavers across the home nations.

I am proud to “confess” that I have been on two foreign holidays in the past month, utilising legal air bridges, and I am far from ashamed.The myth in coronaphobic Britain is that overseas trips are for the elite, rich and powerful: If you dare get on a plane to low infection-rate locales such as Italy or Greeceyou’re not showing solidarity to the Covid cause and risk spreading the damned virus.That rhetoric hasn’t been helped by the Government’s feeble air bridge policy, which puts any country with a region experiencing a minor outbreak at risk of being added to the quarantine list.The reality is the total opposite. If you and me are shamed into staying home now, travel WILL soon be limited to the elite, rich and powerful.The democratisation of tourism has been one of the most pleasing developments of this new millennium, with the explosion of budget airlines causing price wars and a move towards all-inclusive package deals.Yet our ability to keep seeing the world is now in real peril.Airlines are on their knees. Hotels are closing at an alarming rate. Many popular European tourist destinations remain ghost towns.Goons in the Extinction Rebellion movement have already talked weak parties including Labour into backing the introduction of more travel taxes.All for a virus that, albeit nasty, killed just a fth of the number of people who died from run-of-the-mill flu and pneumonia in the final week of July in the UK.If you’re one of the many people currently tormented over whether to take the risk and book that break, I implore you to go for it.On a practical level, both my week-long trips to Europe were pure ecstasy, with responsible and reassuring safety measures that never came close to overshadowing the glorious experience of being overseas again, something unimaginable just a couple of months ago.Yes, the airport is a little more torturous than usual and you do have to keep the mask on at all times.When I arrived on the Greek Island of Mykonos last week, I was random Covid tested at immigration, causing a touch of nervousness while I waited -hours for the result.  And you’re not going to be able to dance or listen to loud music at night.But the benefits are endless. Your favourite tourist destinations are emptier than they’ve ever been during peak season, you’ll always get into your favourite restaurant, and the staff on British Airways have never been happier to see you on board.Most importantly,more of us choose to fly now, we will help keep affordable travel and tourism viable for years to come.I was one of just three people in total in a gym this week for a pre-booked, hour-long session.When we were booted out the moment our  minutes were up, the entire fitness centre was shut for a -minute deep clean.While we should, of course, encourage cleanliness, these types of self-imposed and over-the-top rules will make it impossible for most businesses to survive long-term.A healthy dose of common sense should be required, too.THE Prince of Woke emerged from his latest multi-million pound Calornian mansion this week to preach to the world, yet again, about racism.In an online conversation with Rashad Robinson, president of US civil rights group Colour Of Change, the usual clichés and judgy mumbo jumbo were out in full force.He spoke of “acting, rather than just saying”, going to “the root of the problem” and charity being “like bringing a bucket of water to a forest fire”.But what Harry didn’t talk about was his own notorious past of racist language and cultural insensitivities.After all, this was the Duke who was forced to undergo racial sensitivity training in the Army after using the P-word to refer to an Asian soldier.And this was the Duke who wore a Nazi unorm to a friend’s birthday party.If Harry wants to help spark real change and debate, it would be much more effective for him to stop the meaningless platitudes and talk publicly in some detail about his own journey.How did he realise that using the P-word as an adult is unacceptable in any circumstances How did he learn that larking about with a swastika around your arm as a member of the Royal Family is just plain wrong The Duke does have a valuable contribution to make about the need to stamp out everyday racism in society – one that will involve less pious preaching and more examination of his own notorious follies and foibles.LIKE Emily Maitlis, Naga Munchetty has become such a powerful BBC News presenter she believes the rules of the public service broadcaster no longer apply to her.First, the Breakfast presenter threw impartiality out the window to express a negative view about the US president Donald Trump.Now this week she has been caught pocketing cash to appear in corporate videos for the troubled car company Aston Martin.The Sun’s TV Editor Andy Halls revealed Naga didn’t follow protocol by seeking approval from her Beeb bosses and did not declare the fee she received either.That would be a sacking offence for most Beeb newsreaders.But Naga received the most minor slap on the wrist, with BBC bosses saying, “She has been reminded of the risk of conflict of interest when undergoing external engagements”.No wonder other BBC news presenters don’t want to follow the rules either.The corporation’s weak approach is asking for trouble.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I think it came from Japan ”“If you don’t stay two metres apart, you would definitely get coronavirus,” Blossom Lee Watkins, seven, of South Shields, South Tyneside, added.“You can’t touch people, that’s why people get coronavirus,” Lucas Claydon, four, of Consett, Co Durham, explained.Four-year-old Tim Ogah, from Newcastle, disagreed. He said: “I didn’t really miss my friends at school because I was far too busy in lockdown.”He added: “You can’t stop coronavirus because it’s too strong. We all need to be really, really careful as it takes over your bodyyou don’t wear a mask.”What about the Prime Minister, the man tasked with guiding us through the pandemic Blossom Lee said: “I don’t like Boris Johnson because he opened up pubs before he opened up parks!”“I don’t like him either because he’s too strict,” Clover replied.Blossom Lee then added: “He said that no one was allowed to have haircuts and then he had a haircut! I think Donald Trump’s hair is worse than Boris Johnson’s, I think Boris’s is great.”Evie Claydon, four, of Consett, Co Durham, cut in: “Everybody in my family has been shaving their hair off because they needed a haircut. My dad now looks like my uncle because my uncle has no hair.”The group agreed that, unlike many adults, none of them would shave their hair offthey couldn’t get to the hairdressers.The children then moved on to discuss the PM’s chief adviser Dominic Cummings.“Why did he go all the way to a castle to test his eyes ” Blossom Lee asked the group.“We just went on loads of walks in lockdown! We didn’t go very far,” Evie replied. “I really enjoyed lockdown because of all the days off nursery.”Matt Hancock, Secretary of State for Health and Social Care, was also brought up. Blossom Lee: “Matt is probably a friend of Boris because he has the same clothes as him.”“I would definitely be friends with him, becausehe’s friends with Boris then I could probably go and meet Boris and talk to him,” said Clover.“I would tell Boris to open everything up and be less strict.”Next, the children were shown a photo of national treasure Captain Sir Tom Moore, who raised £million for the NHS by doing laps of his garden.They instantly recognised him. Lucas said: “I don’t think Captain Tom would be able to play football with me. Well, maybehe had his walking stick.”Clover added: “When Captain Tom was knighted he definitely got a sword and armour.“He must have special armour attached to his walking stick. Maybe he uses his sword as a walking stick ”Blossom Lee said: “Maybe he’s got a magic power, where he shoots things from his walking stick ”Evie cut in: “If I raised £million, I would buy a flying unicorn.”The group were then shown a photo of Prof Whitty.Clover jumped in straight away to say: “I have seen him on an advert on TV. He says ‘stay at home’ and ‘don’t go and meet people’.”Blossom Lee wasn’t sure who he was but said: “I don’t think I would be friends with him because his eyebrows are scary.”Evie added: “If he had brown eyebrows then people would think he was nicer.”Clover said: “We need to glue some hair on him, because he hasn’t got much.”Later, the children were shown a photo of fitness coach Joe Wicks.Clover said: “He’s the person who goes on TV and does workouts and stuff. I would just get tired after doing his exercises though, I had to have a big glass of water afterwards.”The children agreed that Joe’s workouts were far too early in the morning.Most of the children missed going to school.Clover said: “I like school, and I missed not going because my favourite subject is art because I love drawing.”Blossom Lee said: “I think this will all be over in two weeks, I can go back to ballet then.”She added: “You should be washing your hands twice a day, once in a morning and once at night.”She added: “I really don’t like wearing a mask because it steams up my glasses.”GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

In person, hes got about  per cent of his skin that looks like hes been burnt with a kettle of water.The doctors have said he has got no quality of le. He doesnt sleep because of the itching and how sore he is. He shouldnt have to be in the pain hes in.Every hour I have to apply three dferent creams - thats every hour, even during the night.

I had to use all my duvet covers and towels to clean it up off the floor, because it all flooded.The smell was not only in my house but you could smell it outside the property.Keeghan is meant to have at least minimum two baths a day for his skin, but he hadnt had that for three weeks because I wasnt bathing him in a stinking bathroom with faeces and urine in the air.The repairs to the toilet were eventually carried out after more than three weeks - while the council say the problem was “resolved as swtly as possible”.Amy said: Ive told them its not just a painting over job. I just want them to recty the problems, actually sort it out, because all theyve done for the past five years is come back with this magic paint to stop paint and mould but it just comes back twice as bad.Birmingham City Council claimed all the “urgent” repair works were carried out in October last year following the court case.A spokesperson for Birmingham City Council said: “While we apologise for any delay to repairs carried out, we do need our tenants to work with us.When a problem arises, we need our tenants to report the issue and most importantly, provide us with access to the property, including keeping scheduled appointments.All urgent repair works to the flat were successfully completed last October.The issues regarding the broken toilet were resolved as swtly as possible and were completed in July.A follow up will be made with Ms Harrison to ensure that there are no outstanding issues.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But in my case, that means just to be alive. It isn’t wise for them to surround themselves with him or anyone affiliated with him.”Grishin, , has boasted of a huge fraud. And court documents reveal he is accused of holding a gun to his estranged we’s head and knocking out her teeth during a campaign of intimidation.Anna said she believes Harry and Meghan did not know about her ex-partner and doesnt want to criticise them personally, but says their advisers showed a “lack of due diligence” over the purchase.The -year-old said: “Even a simple Google search would have led to court records containing horric allegations against Sergey.“He put me through hell, with domestic violence, assaults and threats to me and all my loved ones.“I am still fear for my le. I do not think it wise for anyone to surround themselves with Sergey Grishin, let alone Harry and Meghan.”Three years ago, Grishin — who strongly denies the accusations — was asking £million for the seven-acre Riven Rock site which comes with pool, tennis court, playground, guest quarters and  bathrooms.Harry, , and Meghan, , moved from LA with one-year-old son Archie to the sprawling home in Montecito, Santa Barbara, in July.But the deal emerged last week, sparking questions about how they would be part of a deal with an alleged we-beater, especially as Meghan has just addressed a virtual summit for a feminist website.Grishin, who began his career selling cookies and hot dogs, was chairman of Rosevrobank when it was at the centre of a money- laundering scandal.After he sold his stake in , he bragged on  a YouTube video: “I practically brought the Russian banking system to collapse in the s.” He added: “I stole a lot in Estonia and Russia. It was the largest fraud scheme.”But it is the court papers’ claims of violence and threats towards women which may cause greater alarm to the Sussexes.Anna, who said she was spending the weekend camping at an undisclosed location, met Grishin in  and they wed two years later.She moved with him to Calornia, but their marriage fell apart at the beginning of  when, Anna says, Grishin hacked her computer and discovered pictures of her with pal Jenner Sulkess.The friends were making a film through Jenner’s company. But court papers claim Grishin was “insane with jealousy” and filed for orce the next month.Documents allege he started to threaten both women.He is said to have texted Anna: “All your le and the lives of all your loved ones are at stake now.”He also reportedly referred to himself as a “killing machine” in “total destruction mode”.Anna said he accused the pals of having a lesbian affair and sued them in , claiming they tried to steal a fortune from him.But their counter-suit, set to be heard in LA in October, claims Grishin “sent numerous death threats, violent images and pornographic images” to them.The papers say in June  he invited Anna to an apartment, pulled out a gun with a silencer, told her he would kill her and ordered her to strip naked.In the struggle which followed, he is accused of punching Anna in the face and head-butting her, cracking her teeth.Both Anna and Jenner took out restraining orders.Grishin is also involved in legal action with his ex-fiancée Catherine Loginova, with whom he hooked up after splitting from Anna. A spokesman for Grishin said: “He is the unfortunate victim of a fraud perpetrated by his former we.

Ofqual withdrew its guidelines for students using their mocks to appeal against final results late last night, hours after they were published. Exams were abandoned due to coronavirus so A-level grades were based on teacher predictions - but % were then downgraded by a controversial algorithm. Amid an outcry, ministers had promised a apostriple lockapos in which students could appeal using a mock A-level result instead. But yesterdayaposs Ofqual guidance - now withdrawn - said mocks may no longer guarantee a higher grade,the teachersapos original predictions were still lower than the mock result. No reason for withdrawing the Ofqual guidance was immediately given - as it plunged this yearaposs A-level marking process into further disarray. Robert Halfon, chairman of the Commons Education Committee, said the appeals process had turned into a “huge mess” and the U-turn over confusing guidance was “unacceptable”. He warned there may end up being no option but to ditch appeals and rely on teachersapos original predicted grades, like in Scotland. What do you think of how grades have been decided  Join the conversation in our comments below oryouaposre affected, email your story to webnews@mirror.  Mr Halfon told BBC Breakfast: “Goodness knows what is going on at Ofqual. “It sows confusion amongst pupils, head teachers, school teachers, and it’s the last thing we need at this time. “We need a ‘Ronseal’ appeal system that is simple, people understand it, is fair and helps young people climb the ladder of opportunity.” He added: “Ofqual shouldn’t put things on websites, take them away, sow confusion. This is just not on and has got to be changed.” Mr Halfon said the algorithm that decided results was “Kafkaesque” and came at the same time as a “safeguarding crisis in the offing”.  But he stopped short of calling for Gavin Williamson to go, saying students simply want “this mess to be sorted out”. Mr Halfon added: “If we have a bigger problem with GCSEs this week then perhaps the only alternative will be to go back to the existing grade predictions of the teachers. “But there is a chance now to sort out that appeal system. It’s got to be done efficiently, fast and fairly for students.” Lib Dem education spokeswoman Layla Moran said: This is embarrassing for the Government and excruciating for students. We need clarity and urgently but we just get chaos and confusion. Gavin Williamson must take responsibility and resign. The latest A-level controversy comes following an outcry from students after almost % of predicted grades were downgraded by the regulatoraposs moderation algorithm. In a brief statement, Ofqual said the criteria for appealing based on mock results was being reviewed by its board and that further information would be released in due course.Earlier today we published information about mock exam results in appeals, said an Ofqual spokesman in a statement released late on Saturday. This policy is being reviewed by the Ofqual board and further information will be published in due course. The Labour party has accused Education Secretary Gavin Williamson of backtracking on assurances given to students about the appeals process. Mr Williamson gave a triple lock commitment that students could use the highest result out of their teacheraposs predicted grade, their mock exam or sitting the actual exam in the autumn.  However, in its document, Ofqual said thatthe mock result was higher than the teacheraposs prediction, it was the teacheraposs prediction which would count. The regulator said while mock exams did not usually cover the full range of content, the assessments took into account a studentaposs performance across the whole course. Shadow education secretary Kate Green said: Gavin Williamson promised to give students a triple lock, but instead he left many devastated by unfair exam results, and now his commitment to give them another chance is rapidly unravelling. Having promised that students will be able to use a valid mock result, the reality is that many will not receive these grades eventhey represent a studentaposs best result.  The latest chaos is the inevitable consequence of this Governmentaposs shambolic approach to exams, which saw solutions dreamt up on the back of a cigarette packet and announced barely a day before young people received their results. The latest setback comes as ministers were braced for a fresh backlash when GCSE results for England are announced on Thursday. Like the A-level results, they will initially be based on teacher assessments and then moderated by the Ofqual algorithm to bring them in line with previous yearsapos results. Mr Williamson has said the process was necessary to prevent grade inflation which would render the results worthless after actual exams had to be abandoned due to the coronavirus outbreak.  However critics have complained it has led to thousands of inidual injustices, disproportionately penalising students from schools serving disadvantaged communities. Geoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said the Qfqual document was surreal and bureaucratic. He urged the Government to follow the example of Scotland - where there was a similar outcry - and abandon the moderated results and go back to teacher assessments.

He hotly denies ever doing so. But today he cannot duck his responsibility for a greater crime – jeopardising the futures of hundreds of thousands of young people. Their exams were cancelled months ago. Mr Williamson had all that time to prepare an alternative way to assess them. He failed that test abysmally and that is why he should go.

We do expect them not to get absolutely everything wrong. Nicola Sturgeon had a similar algorithm assessment system in Scotland. The moment results came out, she realised computers cannot decide grades, and scrapped it. Gavin Williamson is either too stubborn or too stupid or both to do the same.

Students cannot be marked on exams they never took, which is why teacher predictions are the best judge. If Mr Williamson cannot see that then he is unfit to be in charge of our children’s education.

Some women have been making ­thousands of pounds by posting nude or lingerie-clad photographs and videos to paying subscribers online. But while critics have raised ­concerns about revenge porn, others say it is an empowering way for ­women to make a living – and even describe it as a “leline”. Website OnlyFans, which has  million ­users and , “creators”, ­reported a  per cent rise in sign-ups during March and April, while Fanzworld doubled its subscribers. Here, three women who signed up to adult-only subscription sites during lockdown explain why they did it – and how it has kept them financially afloat during the pandemic. Bar Manager Catherine Single mum Catherine, , says fan sites were “a godsend” to her after she went into lockdown facing serious financial hardship.She had been earning £, a month for nearly two years but, because she was self-employed, she found herself without any income when the bar she managed was forced to close. She said: “I totally fell through the gap. It was horrendous. “I needed two years’ worth of accounts to qualy for support and was only three months short of that. “It meant I was entitled to nothing – I couldn’t get help from the government and couldn’t be furloughed. “I was offered £ a month universal credit but that wouldn’t even cover my rent, never mind gas, electricity and feeding my kids, who are seven and . “We were all at home, so the electricity was being used all day and I had to feed my kids more because they weren’t getting their school meals. I panicked because I went from a full-time wage to nothing.” So when friends told Catherine about online adult subscription sites, she signed up. She said: “For me, it was a total leline. I made £, in the first month, after joining Fanzworld and OnlyFans. “Without that work I would have lost everything. “The fan sites were a godsend and got me out of a really sticky situation. “I didn’t feel brilliant having to do it,I’m honest. But lockdown put a lot of people in really bad situations. “I was lucky to find a way out. I’ve had friends take their lives because of financial struggles during the pandemic.”  Catherine, from Preston, Lancs, posted topless photos and glamour shots on the websites, but made sure she always felt comfortable with what she was doing. She said: “Sometimes I would just post a picture of me soaking up the sun in the garden. “The men would pay more for a chat on messenger online and that sometimes felt like a normal chat with a friend. “I had some lovely fans who understood why I was doing what I did and would send money to help me out. “Lots of people have a really bad perception of fan sites and think they’re sleazy, but it’s not what you think and you can make a fortune. You get to set your own standards and charge accordingly. “My subscribers paid £ a month and came from all over the world. A lot of the men in the UK were bored, home alone in lockdown and just wanted interaction.” She added: “I never worried about revenge porn because the men who sign up for these sites often don’t want people knowing.” Catherine now works in security – and runs courses to help get people back into employment after lockdown. She said: “This was a stop gap for me, but it really helped me through what would have been an unbearable time.” AE Nurse Nicola  Mum-of-four Nicola turned to adult sites when her nursing shts in AE were cut during the pandemic. The -year-old said: “I’ve been working in healthcare for  years. While coronavirus was at its peak our shts were reduced to stop there being too many people in the department. “It was such a depressing time, with everything that was going on. I decided to sign up to some sites initially for the fun of it and as an escape.” But Nicola, from Lincoln, earned £, in her first month – much more than her £, nurse’s pay. She said: “I am very careful about what I post. I keep it extremely tasteful. I post pictures or short video clips in swimwear, bikinis or gym wear. “I know some girls go totally nude, but I don’t – and I still do well. “I don’t worry about revenge porn because the pictures I post are no dferent from the holiday photos other women post on Instagram. “The only dference is I’m getting paid for it. I don’t do anything distasteful or harmful.” She added: “I’ve had negative comments from people who have said I do porn, but this isn’t porn. “It’s a legitimate way to make money during a tough time. And it has been a huge help financially.” Graphic Designer Abi  Abi turned to fan sites after she lost her job in the lockdown. The -year-old, who graduated from Leeds Beckett University in , was earning £, a year designing artwork for a paint brush company. She said: “I loved it. It’s what I always wanted to do.” But then coronavirus hit and Abi was made redundant. She joined several sites – including Glamour Lounge Live, which runs live webcams. She said: “I was nervous but because I can’t see the men viewing me I quickly built up my confidence. I’m now making an average of £ a week. I do worry about people re-posting my images, but I won’t post anything too explicit. I still want to go back into Graphic Design but this is a good alternative for now.” "},{"url":null,"title":"american tracks down brit crush","story":"NewsAmerican tracks down Brit crush she met in bar  years ago - but it doesnt end wellKate Lefler used the power of the internet and social media to help her track down a man she met on holiday in Plymouth- but its not a case of happily ever afterShareCommentsByKatie TimmsReporter:,  AUG NewsKate Lefler, , launched a search to find her perfect man named Adam after sparks flew between the pair two years ago \" %, rgba, rgba, url\"News, views and top stories .

Willow the bearded collie was on holiday with her family in Dinas, Pembrokeshire when she plunged from the top of the rented cottage.Owner James Oswald heard a commotion and ran out to find her in a aposbad wayapos, Wales Online reported. The six-year-old dog had dislocated paws and serious ligament damage. Mr Oswald said: Instantly it was clear that Willow was not in a good way and had seriously damaged both of her front legs and jaw. Shocked and devastated we picked her up and rushed her to the nearest vets in Fishguard. They diagnosed that she had dislocated both front paws and one had pierced her skin but they managed to put them back in place. There was however serious ligament damage in both legs and she would need to see a specialist in Bristol and we were to take her straight there. The family put their holiday on hold while Mr Oswaldaposs we Suzie and son Noah took Willow three-and-a-half hours to the vets in Bristol. The specialist there told them Willow needed emergency corrective surgery to implant new man-made tendons. They would replace the ruptured ones in both her leg and paw joints at a cost of £,. Further surgery to rebuild the tendons might be neededthe tendons cannot be fixed and Willowaposs aposankleapos joints might need to be fused, which would cost £, for both legs.  Vets are planning to reconstruct Willowaposs ligaments using man-made lb twine and are flying in two specialist casts that can be moulded to her legs. Mr Oswald believes Willow somehow got onto the roof from the raised garden at the back of their holiday cottage.  He added: She lost some teeth when she fell, but they think her jaw is OK but they will need to remove her remaining lower front teeth. We then have the additional rehabilitation and medication she will need for a substantial amount of time following any operation procedure they decide she needs. Unfortunately, it will take six-months plus for her to recover from,she can recover at all. Mr Oswald said he was reluctantly asking for donations towards the eye-watering vets bills but that his self-pride is less important at this time. He continued: Weaposve been sensible and insured her since birth but unfortunately the emergency veterinary bills for the freak accident sheaposs had go far far far beyond the maximum claim on her insurance pay out.

The Duke and Duchess are said to be looking forward to the latest chapter of their American dream in their new home by joining the club every A-lister in the area has signed up to - from Michael Douglas to Ellen DeGeneres. Sources say the Sussexes would have to pay an eye-watering £, just as an “initiation fee” – with an annual membership charge on top. But that’s unlikely to be a problem as ­movie experts told the Sunday People Meghan could command million a filmshe ever ed to Hollywood. That would put the couple way above even the flashiest fellow guests at the Coral Casino Beach and Cabana Club, where they are said to be eyeing up a spot. The venue, part of Santa Barbara’s Four Seasons resort, is known for being an “A-list playground”. It is close to the mansion Harry and Meghan have bought in Montecito in her native Calornia. Michael Douglas, Catherine Zeta-Jones and Ellen DeGeneres are club members, and it was also favoured by Ronald Reagan. The number of members is capped at . The site has  acres of gardens, a saltwater aquarium bar with  types of tropical sea creature and a children’s pool and restaurant ideal for Archie. Guests can also rent the private Cabana , which has its own two-storey sundeck and private butlers. Prof Jonathan Shalit OBE, chairman of talent agency InterTalent, told how Meghan could earn £million – or million – for her first Hollywood film or TV series.He said: “I think her pulling power both in America and on a global scale at this moment is phenomenal. “We are talking a million fee. People are going to be fascinated to see her perform at the very start. It is going to be very compelling. “You get a salary based on your box office appeal, it doesn’t relate to quality of acting. “If Meghan is in a movie or on TV, everyone is going to look at it once.” Tonight Paul Feig, who has directed hit films Bridesmaids, The Heat, Spy and Ghostbusters, said he and fellow moviemakers were scrambling to work with Meghan.  Askedhe would sign up the Duchess, he said: “Meghan, bring it on. I would love to have you in a movie. I think she is great. I’m a fan.” And Emmy award-winning director Joe Russo, the man behind the highest grossing movie of all time – Avengers: Endgame – told how -year-old Meghan could offer some “incredible opportunities to filmmakers”. He said: “She can bring an incredible awareness to causes and issues, so I think it’s amazing she’s coming back to work in the business.” It has also emerged that Meghan – who found fame on hit TV show Suits as paralegal Rachel Zane – has been given the go-ahead by the Intellectual Property Office in London to trademark the name of her and Prince Harry’s planned foundation, Archwell, for “television shows” and “motion picture films”. Shalit added that Meghan’s choice of co-star would be crucialshe came back to acting.  He added: “If Will Smith or Tom Hanks agree to play opposite her, that will give her integrity and credibility.” Harry and Meghan could also earn six or seven-figure fees just for turning up at events. In February, Prince Harry, , gave his first speech as a private citizen at a conference thrown in Miami by JP Morgan where, according to some sources, he could have received a fee of up to £,.  Experts have said becoming a brand ambassador for a global giant such as Google or Apple could also earn the couple tens of millions a year. Their new mansion, which was on the market for £million three years ago, boasts nine bedrooms,  bathrooms, a pool, wine cellar, play area and pub games room. The property can only be accessed by a private road. The Sussexes have been living in the house for six weeks, after moving  miles along the coast from a mansion in Los Angeles where they were house guests.  Deed documents reveal that they bought the house on June , after taking out a £.million, -year mortgage. The couple put down a deposit of £.million. Records show Harry and Meghan’s new home – which also has seven acres of land, a pool, tennis court and guest quarters on top of the stunning main property – was sold to a company called the Residential Real Estate Trust. The Trust is registered to the address of Calornia lawyer Andrew Meyer, who is Meghan’s business manager.  The previous owner of the house was businessman Sergey Grishin. The -year-old Russian is known as the “Scarface Oligarch” as he owned another home nearby where the  movie was filmed. Grishin and his former we, Anna Fedoseeva, are currently embroiled in a bitter legal battle. Court documents allege the oligarch “sent numerous death threats, violent images, and pornographic images” to Ms Fedoseeva and her new partner. Grishin denies the claims.

Omid Scobie said: “It’s something we’ve definitely seen over the decades... women being married into the royal family and leaving scarred. “If this were a business I’d really be investigating, perhaps by human resources, how this happened over and over again.” He claimed Meghan and Harry repeatedly and fruitlessly asked for support to remain full-time royals.  In a podcast, he accused the family of not being concerned enough about their mental health. Brit Scobie, who wrote Finding Freedom with US royal reporter Carolyn Durand, said: “Many of those times it fell on deaf ears or it didn’t seem to be taken seriously enough.” Meghan and Harry have denied co-operating with the authors.A royal spokesman did not comment. It comes as her husband the Duke of Sussex accused social media giants of stoking a crisis of hate and called on advertisers to use their spending power to transform the industry. Writing for US-based business magazine Fast Company earlier this week, the duke outlined his and his we Meghanaposs efforts to help the Stop Hate for Profit campaign.  He revealed they had personally been calling on heads of major corporations, asking them to suspend their advertising revenue from social media sites that fail to tackle hate speech. Harry said their message to them was to reconsider supporting s that have contributed to, stoked and created the conditions for a crisis of hate, a crisis of health and a crisis of truth.

The Sussexes recently moved into their sprawling pad aposThe Chateauapos after buying it in May - with American talk show queen Oprah Winfrey and Hollywood stars Gwyneth Paltrow and Rob Lowe among their nearby neighbours. The lavish , sq ft property - designed and built by multi-millionaire businessman Terry Cunningham and his we Randi - is so technologically advanced that it can detect fog rolling in from the Pacic ocean. Set in . acres of spectacular land in Montecito, The Chateau is based on a classic French country house, and is surrounded by sweeping lawns, rose gardens, huge Italian cypress trees, blooming lavender and -year-old olive trees. Mr Cunningham and his we spent four years building the plush nine-bedroom mansion after buying the land in , creating a dream home for themselves and their children to make memories. The businessman even poured two bottles of red wine onto the cellar floor to give the room an authentic aroma. But despite installing sensors which can detect fog, there was one natural phenomenon the couple didnapost think when designing the house - mudslides. In , devastating mudslides came within ft of the property, after being triggered by heavy rain in the hills nearby which had been ravaged by wildfires.We sure as hell didnapost think about it when we were building, but certainly itaposs something I would be thinking about now, said Mr Cunningham, now , in an interview with the Mail on Sunday. Giving an idea of the star-studded nature of the Santa Barbara neighbourhood, Mr Cunningham recalls Oprah holding her th birthday party nearby in  - when he and his we got to listen to Stevie Wonder playing live. The Canadian-born tycoon - chief executive of software company Descartes Labs - has fond memories of the palatial property, which features  bathrooms, a spa, a two-bedroom guest house, library, games room, arcade, cinema and private gym. There is also a large pool and tennis court, as well as an outdoor childrenaposs play area. We loved it. We built it. It was our dream home and we built it as a family home and we still love the place, said Mr Cunningham.  The tech tycoon described how the heating system used an algorithm to determine when it should shut down or spool up, based on the rate of change in the fog detected by sunlight sensors on the south-facing wall. He also detailed how he designed and built the wine cellar using plywood from his brotheraposs mill, and poured wine on the floor so that it smelled correctly. Meghan and Harry bought the property in May through a shell company listed at the LA address of her long-term business manager Andrew Meyer, according to the Mail on Sunday.

They were getting people to leave. Quite a good amount of water around. Twitter users posted video clips and photos of buildings and roads that flooded.One woman posted footage of cars driving slowly through floodwater, with one pulled over at the side of the road. She wrote: Terrible flooding on Parkway, Chelmsford at the moment. Please god no more rain for a while or my house could be underwater! Another person tweeted: Absolute carnage in Chelmsford. Half the city seems to be underwater! BBC meteorologist Dan Holley shared video of flooding in the city, tweeting: Flooding in parts of #Chelmsford this evening, as slow-moving torrential downpours moved through the area.

On Saturday morning, firefighters used a boat to rescue two people and a dog from a van that became stranded on a flooded road in Bishopaposs Stortford in Hertfordshire. The water was about knee deep. In its yellow warning for thunderstorms, the Met Office said: The warm, humid airmass across the southern half of the UK will lead to further heavy showers and thunderstorms on Saturday, some persisting into the night. Many places will miss the thunderstorms, but where they occur -mm is possible in an hour and up to -mm in two to three hours. Lightning is another potential hazard.  The Met Office said sudden flooding could lead to dficult driving conditions and some road closures. It also said there was a small chance homes and businesses could be flooded quickly, and buildings could be damaged by threats such as floodwater, lightning strikes, hail and strong winds.Forecasters said power cuts and travel disruption were possible in places where violent weather develops.Heavy rain with the risk of thunderstorms is expected to continue over the rest of the weekend, with warnings of potential flooding and travel disruption. The Met Office issued a yellow warning for thunderstorms across large swathes of England and Wales stretching across the weekend and into most of Monday.The warning says that spray and sudden flooding caused by the rain may lead to dficult driving conditions or road closures.The south of England and Wales are likely to be the wettest areas over the whole weekend, with other parts of the country seeing dry and warmer weather.The Met Office said .mm of rain fell in an hour in Canterbury, Kent, on Saturday, which could lead to some surface flooding. Becky Mitchell, a meteorologist for the Met Office, told the PA news agency the weekend was a messy picture.

Johnson needs to reach out and secure a good deal for Britain instead of posturing, pretending no deal would be good. It wouldn’t. It would be bad. Very bad. Chancellor Rishi Sunak must also extend job protection and prioritise job creation. The misery of mass unemployment is a price the country isn’t prepared to pay.

The guest claimed that the woman had been wearing the crown for a while before she let the bride wear it. She then continued to wear it until it broke.  They said: She’s not the MOH[Maid of Honour] or the sister of the bride or groom. She had the future bride wear it for a few minutes after that, and then she had it back on and continued to wear it until it broke.

Remember there’s another manager coming in after’.“Maybe that didn’t help!”He joined from Rangers a -year-old, for a reported £,, in  and his arrival coincided with a spark in form that led Scott’s Dundee to equal the best top-flight finish since the league-winning side of  .But less than  months later, when Boyack wasn’t given a squad number by incoming boss Bonetti, he knew it was all over.A former Scotland U  international, the midfielder had been on the fringes of Walter Smith’s Rangers squad during the Nine in a Row era.Despite making his debut in  alongside the likes of Andy Goram, Richard Gough, Jorg Albertz, Paul Gascoigne and Brian Laudrup – and up against Ray Wilkins in the Hibs team – he eventually moved on in search of first-team football.Step forward Dundee, with family ties making it the perfect move.“I had been at Rangers a while and it was time to move on,” he said.“I had family connections to Dundee, my dad was a big fan and was always talking about ducking school so he could go watch the AC Milan European Cup semi-final.“I think that local connection helped and I was quite happy people knew that. Dundee is a small place and I remember my granny from Broughty Ferry getting on the bus with me and saying to everyone, ‘This is my grandson, he plays for Dundee!’“It was the right move and it was great, for the most part anyway – it ended really badly.“Things started off great and I loved it at Dens. As much I was on the fringes of the first team at Rangers and playing in the reserves, Dundee was my first real club where I played consistent first-team football.“It was exciting times and completely dferent to reserve football – it’s just not the same pressure as a young guy at Rangers.“That was boy’s football – I was playing the men’s game at Dundee.“Suddenly it was a relegation battle and there’s all these experienced guys who are playing for a contract or to avoid a wage cut by being relegated.“The pressure was much more, suddenly everything was about  o’clock on a Saturday. Nothing  mattered.”The news was out that fans’ favourite Dariusz Adamczuk was leaving for Ibrox in the summer after three years at the club.Boyack said: “I remember there was a story at the time I was being brought in to replace Adamczuk because he was leaving on a Bosman, going to Rangers funnily enough.“I think it might have been right after I signed when Dariusz got sent off at Dunfermline and got a six-game ban. That gave me my start in the team.“We went on a run after that and won five on the bounce near the end of the season.“We had a good hard-working team with youth and experience mixed well, with some good players in there as well.“It was lucky how it started for me but brilliant as well.”Boyack made his first start the following week in a - win over Hearts before playing the final seven matches of the season, winning five, drawing one and losing the final match against third-placed St Johnstone.He also notched his first senior goal in a win at Pittodrie and followed up with another at home to Dunfermline as Jocky’s side romped up the ision and into a fth-placed finish.Boyack added: “I think at that time Dunfermline were at the bottom but they weren’t a million miles away from us so we needed those wins.“Jocky Scott andJimmy Bone made things very easy for us players, they were pretty old school and they built a good team. There were no favourites, they picked the best team.“We had guys like Gavin Rae in midfield, Iain Anderson, Eddie Annand, Willie Falconer, James Grady then there was Rab Douglas who wasn’t far off the best keeper in the league, he was brilliant.“Really dependable guys like Barry Smith and Brian Irvine, then there was Willie Miller who helped me a lot – anyone who kicked me, he’d kick them back twice as hard!“I think we must have had snot s of Premier League games of experience in that team but young players as well.”The following season, Boyack was a regular in the Dark Blues midfield with only Rae, Douglas and Steven Tweed featuring more for Scott’s men.The Dark Blues would finish seventh, just one point off repeating their fth place of the campaign before.However, that signalled the end of Jocky’s spell in charge and he made way for the flamboyant Bonetti regime.It was clear early on that there were going to be huge changes at Dundee and, unsurprisingly, the new manager didn’t fancy some of the stars he had inherited.But Boyack, who had played  times in the Premier League the previous season, wasn’t too concerned despite several warning signs.“We went on a pre-season trip to Italy and they didn’t seem to know who any of the Scottish players were!” he said.“Some of the older guys were saying the writing was on the wall but I didn’t listen. I said, ‘I’ve got a contract for another year andthey don’t want me, I’ll go somewhere .’”Boyack soon realised the experienced members of the Dark Blues squad were spot on and he was eventually put on the transfer list.It was too late, however, to go anywhere – a problem for a club needing to recoup some of the money they had already spent on new players.At the time, a frustrated Boyack told the Courier: “The managersaid I would remain here until another club met Dundee’s valuation but he spoke to me while watching a football video and I only got  seconds of his time.“No one has told me I am not good enough to play for Dundee and I’ve not become a bad player overnight but it’s now best I move on.”Twenty years on, Boyack is philosophical about his Dens dream turning into a nightmare under Ivano and his brother Dario.He said: “I didn’t play a minute under them but the club had a problem because they’d signed a lot of players but they’d done that before getting rid of the players they didn’t fancy.“I didn’t even get a squad number. They were bringing in good players and they gave my number to Fabian Caballero. He was brilliant so at least they gave it to somebody pretty decent.“ThenCaniggia came in#had somebody said when I signed a year before he’d be there I’d have said they were mad.“They told me really late in the summer that I could go but, at that point, a lot of teams already had their squads signed up.“There was a chance to go to Hibs but they brought in Didier Agathe from Raith Rovers and it ended up being too late for me. It felt like the goalposts had moved.“I eventually dropped down a ision on loan to Ayr in October because I couldn’t go on loan to another Premier League team.“I imagineI had dug my heels in about it all, I maybe wouldn’t have played for a whole year.“Ideally I wanted to continue playing at Dundee and play in semi-finals or finals because I knew what it would mean for the club and the fans.”He added: “For a while I was maybe not quite bitter but disappointed at the way things went. With a bit more time and experience you start to understand clubs do certain things.“I enjoyed it at Dundee, people always ask about the way things ended but it’s blown out of proportion really.“I bump into Peter Marr quite a lot actually and it all doesn’t matter now. I would have loved to have played another ,  games but it wasn’t to be.”Boyack would only play  times for Ayr before Craig Levein snapped him up for Hearts in a £, deal.He made  appearances in three years at Tynecastle. His most consistent football, however, was played at Dens Park under Jocky Scott.Now working in the construction and engineering trade, he says some of his best moments in the game came during his stint in the City of Discovery.“My best memories include my first derby. I remember walking across the road to Tannadice, I’d never done anything like that before.“It’s funny, you always remember the games you did better in! Big Brian Irvine scored, that was great for the big man, then I played in James Grady to get the winner and we won -.“I also remember going to Ibrox and winning. Rangers were flying at that point, seriously flying.“They’d just beaten Dortmund a few days before. My mates were saying we were in for a hiding and I didn’t disagree.“But they didn’t turn up and Gav Rae popped up in the last minute. I don’t know how many times Dundee have won at Ibrox but that was a great time.“And we were at a supporter’s do that night too. On the road down some of the boys were saying it was the worst time to have that, coming back from a game at Ibroxwe got stuffed.“Turns out it wasn’t a bad night after all!”Kane Hemmings says decision to leave Dundee #wasn#t taken lightly# in message to fans\" title\"#Kane Hemmings says decision to leave Dundee #wasn#t taken lightly# in message to fans# # Evening \" src\"https:www.eveningtelegraph fp kane-hemmings-says-decision embed # secretqvAoqpAp\" data-secret\"qvAoqpAp\" width\"\" \"\" frameborder\"\" marginwidth\"\" margin\"\" scrolling\"no\"For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles.Newsletter Get top stories straight to your inbox every day.SUBSCRIBE HERE!Latest blaize_config   n t t tCancelation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Eveningwebsite and Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening  n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb + ePaper n t t t n t t t n t t t tDuration: n t t t t Month n t t t n t tSubscribe TodayEnjoy the digital edition of the Eveningnewspaper on your smartphone, tablet and computer.Unlimited access to all articles on the Eveningwebsite.

To the best of my knowledge, he#s not a member of the SNP.#I can#t interrogate how people vote and nor should I interrogate how people vote. It#s a personal choice.#Nicola Sturgeon added that recent polls, which predict an SNP landslide at the next Holyrood election, could create an #issue#these iniduals are barred from holding appointments based on their qualications.She said: #On the basis of current opinion polls, more than half of all the Scottish population intend to vote SNP so there would obviously be an issuewe started to exclude people who have qualications to do things from doing these things because they might vote SNP.#I wouldn#t exclude someone who was qualied because they vote for another party.#I don#t think it should be relevant in terms of somebody#s ability to do a particular job that needs a particular specialism, which I don#t think anybody doubts Mark Priestley has.#I wouldn#t exclude someone who was qualied because they vote for another party.#First Minister Nicola SturgeonThe academic came under fire after the Daily Record revealed tweets he posted ahead of the last general election, in December, one of which stated that the #clear# message in some seats was #vote SNP or get a Tory#.He also tweeted that supporting Neale Hanvey, a candidate who was suspended by the SNP amid an anti-Semitism row, before being readmitted to sit as an SNP MP in June, was perhaps a #lesser of two evils#.Education Secretary John Swinney announced Prof Priestley#s appointment during a statement in which he also apologised to pupils directly affected by the downgrading of awards. Mr Swinney said that it was #deeply regrettable we got this wrong# and announced all downgraded results would be withdrawn and replaced by the original estimates.He also told parliament that the government hoped to learn lessons for the future and said the review led by Prof Priestley would provide initial findings within five weeks.Scottish Conservative education spokesman Jamie Greene said Scottish parents and pupils demand a #truly neutral and fully independent review# into the exams debacle.#If the SNP are serious about righting their wrongs over the fiasco, andthe public are to have any faith in this review, they must consider removing Mr Priestley#, he added.Prof Priestley has been approached for comment.For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles.Newsletter Get top stories straight to your inbox every day.SUBSCRIBE HERE!Latest blaize_config   n t t tCancelation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Eveningwebsite and Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening  n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb + ePaper n t t t n t t t n t t t tDuration: n t t t t Month n t t t n t tSubscribe TodayEnjoy the digital edition of the Eveningnewspaper on your smartphone, tablet and computer.Unlimited access to all articles on the Eveningwebsite.

If you#re going to one pub where there is a transmission risk and immediately going to another, you are quickly spreading that risk and making that greater than it would otherwise be.#Visiting lots of pubs in a single day or evening massively increases the workload of test and protect, so please think about that # it makes a really big dferenceyou stay in one pub.#There will be further restrictions on hospitality venues, banning queuing both inside and out except for takeaway products and for #unavoidable# safety reasons.Speaking during Friday#s Scottish Government briefing, Prof Leitch said Melbourne provides the #best recent example#, citing that it took four weeks of a six-week lockdown in order to #bend the curve# of infection.He added that while the curve has #slowed# in Grampian, the rate of infection has not yet begun to fall in terms of an overall trend.Scotland#s national clinical director added: #I am not surprised we are still seeing numbers related to this Aberdeen cluster and I#m hopeful as we see that de-acceleration we will then see that curve bend in the next week to  days but I cannot guarantee it so that#s why we continue with lockdown restrictions.#A total of  cases have been identied in Grampian since July  and  cases have so far been linked to the Aberdeen outbreak associated with pubs and other nearby venues, with , close contacts being identied so far.The NHS Grampian area accounted for  of the  new confirmed cases in Scotland overnight, taking the total to , across Scotland, with a further two cases attributed to an outbreak in Orkney.The First Minister also confirmed that nine cases were recorded in Glasgow and a further  in North Lanarkshire, related to a cluster in north-east Glasgow.When askedAberdeen could see its lockdown measures extended for a third week, the First Minister said: #All I can say is, I can#t rule that out but I hope we#ll be able to lt these restrictions as soon as possible.#We will formally review them next Wednesday and give the outcome of that.#For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles.Newsletter Get top stories straight to your inbox every day.SUBSCRIBE HERE!Latest blaize_config   n t t tCancelation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Eveningwebsite and Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening  n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb + ePaper n t t t n t t t n t t t tDuration: n t t t t Month n t t t n t tSubscribe TodayEnjoy the digital edition of the Eveningnewspaper on your smartphone, tablet and computer.Unlimited access to all articles on the Eveningwebsite.

However, there are still numerous restrictions in place, including no operation of locks and bridges, limited services and limited staff available on the ground. This remains the position.#We are, however, pleased to let you know that Scottish Canals is planning to re-open canals to navigation in line with the announcement that Scotland’s tourism sector is preparing to reopen during phase three of the Scottish Government route map on July . Subject to the confirmation of phase three from that date, the canals will open to navigation as follows:While boats will be able to transit the canals, the operating hours and days still have to be confirmed#When the canals were closed to navigation at the beginning of lockdown, mooring customers received three months# navigation licence free of charge to June .Scottish Canals added: #We have decided to extend the concession to cover July, with mooring customers getting a credit note issued to their account next month in addition to April, May and June.#A deferment of boat safety certicates has also been further extended until September.With health and safety in mind, Scottish Canals will adopt strict social distancing, segregation and hygiene measures to minimise the risk of transmitting Covid- for the foreseeable future, including cough screens at transaction points, queue management and clear signage to remind people of the importance of physical distancing and good hand and cough hygiene."},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor july 3 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSir,Communities on the A are blighted by the noise of bikers, many with illegal exhausts.Inveraray is the gathering point for motorcyclists and on a recent Saturday during lockdown around  were gathered, not two metre social distancing, and failing to adhere to the maximum eight in a group guidance.This has become the norm throughout the summer, and it seems lockdown guidance does not apply to bikers as they have been a constant feature on the roads, even in phase one.The unofficial Argyll TT goes past our homes most weekends over the spring and summer months.I have a bike licence and understand the feeling of freedom, but three-figure speeds past residential entrances, many of them hidden, is completely unacceptable.As a resident you begin to dread the weekend and sunny days. The noise is constant and intrusive for  –  hours in a day, the decibel level in excess of  dB where sounds above  dB are harmful to hearing.This is a serious issue for residents who cannot open their doors and windows, cannot use their gardens, pets are terried, it is often impossible to have a conversation, or a phone call. The noise from hundreds of bikes is explosive and destructive.The speeds are terrying, they travel in intimidating packs, the noise is threatening and the bikers have no respect for the communities they are speeding through. They pass multiple residential entrances with limited sight lines with no care for risk. The offensive noise seems to come from two actions modying motorbike exhausts and extreme acceleration in legal bikes.If a car made a similar noise, spewed out the same polluting omissions, or did the same ridiculous speeds they would be pulled over by the police, but bikers appear above the law.As technology reduces the noise pollution of cars, planes and other forms of transport, it seems motorbikes are exempt. Bikers claim #loud pipes save lives# but is safety really the motivation for deliberately creating excessive noise Noise counts as a statutory nuisance it either unreasaonably and substantially interferes with the user or enjoyment of a home or other premises or is likely to injure health.The problem on A is known to all the statutory agencies, but nothing is done.If this is a national problem, what action needs to be taken Concerned Loch Fyne-side resident Sir,I am not qualied to judge economic competence, but considering the party he represents, I think that Councillor Redman might find it advisable to be wary of the phrase #colossal mismanagement# .For my part, I would consider a degree of incompetence to be preferable to the great damage caused over the last decade to  per cent of the UK’s people, as well as to its institutions and its reputation by the cruel, self-serving, xenophobic, elitist, dishonestregime currently in Westminster.Name supplied, LochgilpheadSir,Our charity#s support for blind and partially sighted people affected by the coronavirus lockdown has received a £, boost from the Scottish Government#s Wellbeing Fund.With this extra funding we will be able to support an additional  people and respond to the increased demand for more in-depth, one-to-one emotional support.The practical and psychological effects of losing your sight can have a signicant impact on people’s well-being, and this current situation has exacerbated the anxiety and isolation felt by many.Access to essential services such as food and medicines is more dficult as is social distancing, vital information on staying safe isn#t always in accessible formats, and many of our older members aren#t always confident about using new technology to stay in touch with others.Everyone accessing RNIB#s confidential counselling service will receive eight weekly sessions with an accredited counsellor, delivered via telephone and online, with each session normally lasting an hour.The funding will enable us to reduce the waiting list for emergency mental health sessions and also let existing clients access additional sessions.The RNIB helpline is available on   .James Adams, RNIB Scotland directorSir,Every pub across Scotland should be allowed to stock and sell beer from local independent brewers, to help them recover post-lockdown.CAMRA, the Campaign for Real Ale has launched the #Cheers for Choice# campaign.The campaign wants these arrangements to be relaxed, and MSPs are also being urged to support the Tied Pubs Bill being put forward in the Scottish Parliament by Labour MSP Neil Bibby. The legislation would give tied pub tenants protections in law, including a right to be able to sell guest beers in their pubs.Allowing small and independent brewers to sell into all pubs will also improve consumer choice and allow pub-goers to support local brewing businesses.It also makes business sense, with  per cent of pub-goers saying they would be less likely to go back to a pubit doesn’t have a range of brews from small and independent producers.Sarah Crawford, CAMRA Director for Scotland, Kirkcaldy"},{"url":null,"title":"could a two way conversation transform scotlands health","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSome of us have learned in lockdown the importance of other people, and have been longing for these first personal contacts.There have been surprises in discovering just what is important in le, and the comfort of knowing you are not alone in your likes, as your favourite brand of chocolate is again sold out.We have also been made aware that the way we behave makes a dference to the future.

Perhaps for the first time in their lives they have heard the bark of deer or spotted something in nature that is totally new to them.

But what we do not want to do is fall back into the same old traps that were so detrimental to the wildle, nature and ecosystems of our planet. Finding a way forward and a new balance is not just crucial for other species but for that of our own children and future generations too.Many will have been shocked at the sudden increase in fly tipping during lockdown plus the thoughtless parking and abandonment of picnic rubbish, disposable barbecues and indiscriminate toileting as lockdown eased.

The proposed branch line from Dalmally to Inveraray was never built, despite plans to #hide# the railway from the duke’s view. A plan from  shows a proposed tunnel to carry the line through the duke’s policies near to the castle.

Without action and proper investment from central government vital public services will be at risk.This news of huge strain on local authority budgets comes as the SNP is delaying in opening up Scotland’s hospitality and tourism industry. Instead of following other parts of the UK and opening the sector on July , the separatists are forcing businesses to wait until July .This delay will cost businesses millions at a time when thousands of jobs are already on the line.The SNP is risking people#s livelihoods. It needs to accept responsibility for that and take action now.Councillor Alastair Redman,Sir,People occasionally ignore the elephant in the room to support their point of view, but in his latest letter, Councillor Alastair Redman has ignored an entire herd in his living room.In his latest rant he states that the SNP is failing councils as the cost of coronavirus could hit more than £ million, but surely these costs would be the same no matter who was in power He also suggests that #essential local services have been underfunded for years# yet fails to mention the years of needless austerity cuts, actioned by his party and their collaborators, to bail out the greedy and risky practices of the banks, which reduced funding to a devastatingly low level in general. It is worth noting that the Scottish Government has put a greater percentage of their curtailed income into NHS Scotland than any part part of the UK. This has helped NHS Scotland to outperform all of the others, in the UK, for the past five years. This is paying idends now.He s to his familiar attempt to insult by referring to citizens who want to take responsibility for making and managing decisions and working to make their country prosper within the priorities set by its citizens as #separatists#. I’m glad to be described as a separatist because the alternative is to be an apologist for an unrepresentative government in Westminster and to abdicate decision making to that same out-of-touch group.It is Councillor Redman’s final point, however, that demonstrates his blinkered sycophancy. His suggestion that the Scottish Government should follow the example of other parts of the UK. Could he really be saying that we should follow the chaotic shambles and incompetence that has emanated from his chums at Westminster  Does he seriously think that any sensible person, irrespective of their own political affiliation and from any of the devolved nations, would swap what their government#s have done for the Westminster model Sadly, nowhere in his missive does Councillor Redman take time to mention the health and safety of our citizens.It is this, together with scientic advice and without political point scoring, that is driving the Scottish Government#s response to this tragic pandemic.Kevin MacKaveney, TarbertSir,Following reports of littering around Argyll and Bute, including the Isle of Islay, the issue was discussed at a recent meeting of Islay Community Council where community councillors heard that items like rubber gloves have been found dumped in ditches.It is always very disappointing to hear about littering and fly-tipping but doubly so in an area like Islay where residents take such an understandable pride in their environment.We also need to bear in mind that items like disposable gloves can pose a threat to livestock. As well as being profoundly antisocial, this kind of behaviour can be positively harmful.Those acting irresponsibly should remember that there can be serious consequences to their thoughtlessness.Donald Cameron, Highlands and Islands MSPSir,We all have a role to play in the recovery of the country’s tourism industry after its reopening on July .Scots could help by taking a trip, visiting an attraction or experience, shopping locally, dining out and booking a staycation.Scottish tourism is facing its biggest challenge in a generation and will need financial support for some time to come to help it recover. The Scottish public has a crucial part to play in helping this happen.It#s easy to not think of yourself as a tourist in your own country but many of the experiences that we often enjoy with loved ones, such as holidays, shopping or eating out, all contribute to our visitor economy.July  marked a new era for the industry as we start to welcome back visitors and take our first steps on the road to a safe and responsible recovery. However, reopening won’t be the same for all businesses, many are still adapting to this #new normal#, so it#s important that we recognise that as we move forward to try and restore our industry.We look forward to helping Scots rediscover their own country in a way that is safe for everyone # visitors, residents and those working within the industry.

Walking and cycling infrastructure needs to be improved, trees can be planted, and renewable energy can be expanded and made more efficient.Transport and food are the most obvious areas for behavioural change in Argyll. We need to be promoting the benefits of electric cars and making them preferable to petrol or diesel cars.We can easily bring food production and consumption closer together by shopping and eating more locally and more naturally. Farming in Argyll is generally quite low impact, but does not have the capacity to feed everyone in the area, meaning that we have to buy in meat which is less sustainably farmed to make up the dference. If everyone ate only the meat that is produced locally, we could dramatically reduce the emissions caused from the transport of imported meat, as well as supporting our local market and ensuring that it remains natural and sustainable. Reducing food waste is also an easy behavioural change.Acting on climate change is all about thinking of others. Across the globe, the people who see the most adverse effects of climate change so far are those who are already marginalised and vulnerable.Kindness and common decency indicate that we must act with the needs of these people in mind, with the knowledge thatwe do not act, ‘these people’ will soon become us and our children.One thing that I think would make a huge dference would bewe all took #our whole selves# to work with us.Whatworld leaders were constantly thinking: #what would my children say about my role in this decision # This kind of moral thinking would make a huge dference in the future of industry and politics, and the more we educate the next generation, the more influence they will have on their parents.Everyone can make changes such as cutting down on their meat and dairy consumption, shopping locally, re-using plastic containers, recycling, composting, reducing food waste, buying fewer new things, using a renewable energy supplier, and cutting down or cutting out air travel.At the Paris Agreement in ,  nations decided to take measures to limit the global temperature increase to . degrees above pre-industrial levels. Our current behaviour will not allow for this.A rise of  degrees celsius above pre-industrial levels will mean that large areas of land around the equator will be uninhabitable, resulting in huge numbers of refugees fleeing for their survival. Sea level rise caused by the rapid melting of the ice caps will mean that small island states such as Kiribati and Tuvalu will be submerged. The combination of the loss of arable land and ocean acidication due to temperature increase will mean global food shortages, such that we have never seen before.The rich will still be able to buy food, but those who are already marginalised and vulnerable will find it increasingly dficult to access basic amenities like food and clean water, further stretching the inequality gap.It’s not too late to make changes, but it soon will be.We all need to have climate change in the forefront of our minds when making any kind of decision, be it personal or business. It is an omnipresent issue and every decision, however big or small, will have an effect."},{"url":null,"title":"science matters are aircraft vapour trails harmful","story":"Dorothy H CrawfordUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsAlthough much reduced by the Coronavirus pandemic, everyone has seen the vapour trails produced by high-flying aircraft as they streak across the sky. But what are they  and are they harmful Officially called contrails , these ephemeral, cloud-like structures are primarily made of ice crystals. They form at altitudes over , metres from water vapour in the aircraft’s engine exhaust as it freezes almost instantaneously at temperatures below minus  degrees celsius. There are, however, plenty of other volatiles and solid components in engine exhaust, including soot particles that often act as a nucleus around which the ice crystals form.Official figures show that air traffic contributes around five per cent of greenhouse gases. Yet these estimates only account for CO emissions. They do not include the effect of contrails, which can persist for hours and even expand into cirrus clouds several miles wide. These clouds, which are most abundant over North America and Europe, trap heat within Earth’s atmosphere, so do they improve our climate or contribute to global warming Air traffic has been steadily increasing year-on-year, so, assuming the coronavirus effect is a temporary one, estimates suggest that the distance flown by passengers will double every  years, and that air traffic will quadruple by . Therefore, it is imperative to determine how the increase in clouds created by contrails might affect us.In a recent study*, scientists used a climate model to analyse the future impact of contrails on climate change, taking into account their predicted increase balanced against any likely changes in engine soot emissions.The results show a three-fold increase in contrail cirrus coverage by , despite a  per cent reduction in soot emissions due to improved fuel and engine efficiency. These predictions cover all major air traffic routes and are mostly due to increased air traffic volume, although a sht to flying at higher altitudes also contributes. The area with the greatest increase will be Eastern Asia, where the largest rise in air traffic is expected.This previously unaccounted for, non-CO, climate impact of air traffic is now reckoned to have a more damaging effect on climate change than all the CO emitted from aircraft engines.*Atmos.

But it has also been a time of positive change and reflection, prompting people to be more creative. Writing, be it poetry, song writing or short stories, for example, has given many a way of making sense of this time, of sharing their feelings and looking after their mental health.For those who have found it dficult to know where to begin, Seil author Kenneth Steven offers this advice to help you start your creative writing journey.For me, there are two essential ingredients when it comes to setting out as a creative writer: time and space. By creative writing I mean poetry, short stories, novels and children’s writing: everything involving the use of the imagination.When someone claims they don’t have time to write, I don’t believe them as it’s a question of making time.PD James started writing when nursing a dying husband: he needed care all through the day. There was a part of the night when finally he went to sleep and she had the chance to put pen to paper, so that was what she did. If we are serious about wanting to write, we will make time.For many years I lived in Dunkeld, close to the entrance to the cathedral. When friends heard my address they would roll their eyes and say: ‘What a place to be. And you’re lucky enough to be a writer.’Except it wasn’t that easy. The truth is the modern world invaded even that idyllic corner of Scotland.First, there were thousands of pilgrim feet and voices. I was driven mad by not being able to find sufficient quiet. My former we watched a great deal of television. It was a tiny flat and the distant murmur of low voices maddened me because I couldn’t concentrate.It was she who suggested # probably to stop the grumbling # that I should have a cabin built in my mother’s garden in Aberfeldy, a place where I could hide away to write. After considering the idea for a few days, I realised she was right.When finally I sat down to start working in that simple shed among the trees, the words poured from the pen. I will never forget those first days. Poem after poem appeared as though by magic on the page. For me # and after many years of leading creative writing sessions, I would suggest for the vast majority of others too # finding real quiet makes all the dference.But it doesn’t have to be a hideaway in a garden it can be a living room or a bedroom or an attic – just at a time when others in the household are asleep or absent.There are few rules for creative writers, but one I have discovered is that we are all larks or owls. We’re either attracted to early morning or late evening.I have yet to meet anyone who has said they’re drawn to the mid-afternoon # what I term # hammock time, though that’s when I wrote in the Aberfeldy cabin. I’ve come to believe strongly you will use the time you are given. If that’s what you have, you will adapt to that rhythm.But I quickly came to realise in my cabin that I couldn’t simply turn on good writing like a tap. We go into our creative space weighed down by the modern world. We live lives beset by emails, phone calls and text messages. We are all expected to respond quickly.I think creative writers are generally poor when it comes to practice writing. The creative lives of visual artists, actors, singers and musicians are dominated by practice. Why should it be dferent for those from the writing community What do I mean by practice writing  Describing the view out of the window going back into memory to capture a moment as evocatively as possible imagining a dialogue between two characters. There’s no end to the possibilities. What practice writing provides is creative grounding. It brings us from being all over the place in our minds to give us creative focus.What this practice allows us to do is to start, then to pour ourselves into what I like to call deep writing. It creates a kind of doorway so the real writing can begin.Kenneth Steven is best-known as a poet. Sixteen of his collections have been published and he writes and presents poetry-related programmes for BBC Radio. He is also a Scottish novelist and children’s author. He’s written two handbooks on writing and led workshops and worked as writer in residence at home and abroad. www.kennethsteven"},{"url":null,"title":"if walls could talk","story":"Susan WindramUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsStrachur Smiddy opened its doors again on Saturday, August , after an uncertain few months due to Covid-.The museum will only be open on Saturdays and Sundays, until Sunday September , but for now families can again enjoy stepping back in time in the th-century blacksmith’s smiddy, which has been carefully repaired and restored to its original state and now acts as a working museum with with forge, bellows and anvil, cobbled floor, tools of the trade and beamed ceiling.Browse through the Smiddy’s collection of fascinating artefacts and tools.

I think it was Michael Gove who said, Your example gives us hope.

Reduce light from the hall. Make sure there are no electronics sending out light e.g. a digital alarm clock with a lit display, sleep buttons on equipment etc.\"You may want to put black curtains at the window or wear an eye mask to limit the light getting into the eye.\"Sleep Scotland suggests wearing an eye maskOn the other end, you should also get lots of light in the morning to help you feel awake and alert.They added: \"Exposure to light at the right time helps keep the circadian clock on the correct time schedule.\"Make sure you open the curtains and turn on the lightsyou need to.

and to socialise with friends.And while most modern tech has a blue light filter, it does not filter all light.More importantly, the things you do online are usually things that stimulate your brain and make it harder to turn off when you get into bed.Therefore, Sleep Scotland say you should unplug from all screens at least an hour before bedtime.They added: \"In the hour before bed, ensure you

marks will be restored and new certicates sent out.Mr Swinney said: ldquoUsing powers available to me in the EducationAct , I am today directing the SQA to re-issue those awards based solely on teacher or lecturer judgment.ldquoSchools will be able to confirm the estimates they provided for pupils to those that are ing to school this week and next.ldquoThe SQA will issue fresh certicates to affected candidates as soon as possible and, importantly, will inform Ucas and other admission bodies of the new grades as soon as practical in the coming days to allow for applications to college and university to be progressed.What are the new Scottish results The A to C attainment rates for National , Higher and Advanced Higher are now expected to jump by ., . and . percentage points compared to , rising to .%, .% and .% respectively.Will any grades be lowered The Education Secretary has said that no grades which were moderated to give an increased mark will be reduced.When will the results be given John Swinney said that schools will be able to confirm the estimates they provided for pupils to those that are ing to school this week and next.He added: \"The SQA will issue fresh certicates to affected candidates as soon as possible and, importantly, will inform UCAS and other admission bodies of the new grades as soon as practical in the coming days to allow for applications to college and university to be progressed.Will all students get into their course Mr Swinney has said that due to the unique circumstances of this situation the Scottish Government ldquowill make provision for enough places in universities and colleges to ensure that no-one is crowded out of a place they would otherwise have been awarded.\"WhatI have already appealed Pupils, who had been encouraged to appeal their downgrades, will get their new results automatically, although appeals will still be possibledesired.What will happen next year John Swinney said that a current review is being conducted by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development .He said: \"I assure Parliament that we will look to learn lessons from the process of awarding qualications this year that will help to inform any future actions.\"He also said that an investigation will be undertaken to look at how this yearrsquos awards were handed out.He said: ldquoCoronavirus has not gone away and, while we expect next yearrsquos exams to go ahead, we need to put in place the right plans to make sure we donrsquot find ourselves in the same situation again.Mr Swinney announced that a ldquorapid consultation exercise with teachers will start this week, looking at removing parts of course assessment and adjusting the volume of evidence required in coursework.This report is to be

of cometary dust - producing up to  meteors every hour.If skies are clear, the display of celestial fireworks should be visible across the UK from about midnight tonightuntil .am UK time on Thursday, August  - according to astronomers at Royal Observatory Greenwich.What are the Perseids The astronomical event is associated with the dusty debris left by Comet Swt-Tuttle, which orbits the sun once every  years.The meteoroids from the comet, mostly no bigger than a grain of sand, burn up as they hit the Earthrsquos atmosphere at  miles per second to produce a shooting stream of light in the sky.Peak temperatures can reach anywhere from ,C to ,C as they speed across the sky.The meteors are called Perseids because they seem to dart out of the constellation Perseus.The meteor shower began on July  and will continue to be visible until August .What have astronomers said Anna Ross, an astronomer at the Royal Observatory Greenwich, said the best time to spot the meteors is between midnight and .am on Thursday, when up to  meteors or ldquoshooting stars will be visible per hour, which is more than one every second.She told the PA news agency: ldquoThis makes the Perseids one of the most impressive meteor showers of the year.ldquoDuring the peak night of the shower, you will be able to find it in the north-east of the sky, getting higher throughout the night.ldquoYou donrsquot have to be able to see Perseus to spot meteors, however, as they will be moving away from the radiant across the whole sky in every direction.To make the most of the meteors, Ms Ross said observers should avoid well-lit and built-up areas and try to find an unobstructed view to the east.She added: ldquoFind a dark area and allow around  minutes for your eyes adapt to the dark.ldquoAs meteors move quite fast across the sky itrsquos best to look up without using telescopes or binoculars so you can see as much of the sky as possible.How regular will the meteors be The Perseids are one of the more active meteor showers on stargazersrsquo calendars, producing an average of between  and  shooting stars an hour at their peak.The shower in rsquos was especially active, delivering up to  meteors an hour at its height.While the shooting stars this year wonrsquot be quite as regular, stargazers can still expect to see around  of them an hour.Do I need special equipment to see the Perseids Meteor showers are typically visible with the naked eye, so no special equipment is needed, but those in rural areas with minimal light pollution will have a clearer view.Heading out to a dark spot is the best plan of action, but stargazers should allow around  minutes for their eyes to become accustomed to the dark.Patience is also a virtue, with shooting stars tending to appear in clusters, followed by a lull.The meteors will appear to come from the direction of the Perseus constellation in the north eastern part of the sky, although they should be visible from any point.A cloudy night could still scupper your chances of spotting any meteors, however, so keep your eye on weather forecasts."},{"url":null,"title":"confident-borders-schools-safe-says-council-chief","story":"THE leader of Scottish Borders Council says she has \"every confidence\" that schools have been made safe

You should never eat food that has passed its lsquoUse byrsquo date, but lsquoBest Beforersquo dates often reflect quality control, not safety or nutritional value. In determiningthe food that has passed the lsquoBest Beforersquo is safe to eat read up on Food Standards Agency guidelines, use your eyes and nose, and follow your gut.Smell:If it smells fine and it was stored properly, its likely okay to eat.Sight:Donrsquot let your eyes fool you when it comes to fresh food like produce. Bumps or bruises donrsquot mean something is ruined.Dont can the cans:Canned goods can last for decades. Even a can thats started to rust should still be okay, as long as it isnt bulging and the seal is intact.Check the packaging, use your senses, cook food thoroughly, and donrsquot let the perfect become the enemy of the good.

Surprised . You dont know how to store your cooking oilsSome cooking oils are best stored in the cabinet, while others can be refrigerated. Credit: Getty   Angelina ZinovievaCooking oils sourced from fruits, vegetables, nuts, and seeds each have dferent storage needs. Exposure to oxygen, light or heat will subject oil to oxidation, eventually turning it rancid. While some cooking oils can be stored at room temperature, others do best when stored in the fridge.Corn and rapeseed oils:These do just fine stored in a cool, dark cabinet, or you can refrigerate themit takes more than a year to get through a bottle.Olive oil:Leaving olive oil out on the counter or a table, especiallythe bottle gets direct sunlight, or storing it on or near a stove are surefire ways to turn it rancid quickly. Place it in the coolest, darkest place in your home or use a smaller glass bottle in the kitchen.Peanut oil:Can be kept for as long as two yearsstored tightly capped and away from heat and light. Keeping peanut oil in the fridge may extend shelf le even further.Coconut oil:Very stable andhas a shelf le of two years or more.Avocado, grapeseed, hazelnut, sesame, truffle, walnut, safflower and sunflower:Delicate oils that are especially prone to rancidity, especiallyexposed to too much light or heat. Refrigerating after opening is recommended. Kept cold, these oils will remain viable for six months or more.. Youre using the wrong containers to store your foodWe tested the best-selling plastic and glass food storage containers on the market to find the best of the lot. We dropped them onto a linoleum floor, froze them, microwaved them, stained them, pried them apart, stacked them back together, and lots more.Best glass container:Pyrexs Cook and Eat Glass Storage Setisa great choice.

No plastic container is oven-safe, but the set is marked dishwasher- and microwave-safe and carries a letime warranty. You should avoid freezing this set, as expanding food may pop the lid.. Youre incorrectly storing fruits and veggiesDo you know which vegetables should stay at room temperature, which should be kept inside a salad drawer, and which should never be stored together  Are you sure Do not refrigerate:Potatoes, onions, garlic, winter squash, tomatoes, bananas, peaches, plums, avocados, mangoes, melons, apples, pears, kiwis, and citrus. Exceptions include freezing for smoothies, or refrigerating for brief periods when theyre close to spoiling.Keep separate:Produce that emits high levels of ethylene gas, including ripe bananas, apples, stone fruit , cantaloupe, honeydew melons, mangoes, pears, ripe kiwis, tomatoes, onions, and leeks.Store alone:Ethylene-sensitive produce, including aubergine, broccoli, Brussels sprouts, cabbage, carrots, caullower, cucumber, leafy greens, peas, peppers, squash, sweet potatoes, strawberries, and watermelon.,params: .push. Youre letting your avocados turn brownThere are many ways to store a cut avocado, but only one that will actually keep it from browning and preserve the flavour: Leave the pit in an avocado, and tightly wrap the half in plastic wrap to keep the flavour and texture intact.. Youre letting the food in your fridge accidentally freezeFoods in your fridge shouldnt be freezing. Credit: Getty   IssaurinkoBiting into frozen food thatrsquos merely supposed to be refrigerated isnrsquot just annoying: Freezing can completely alter the taste and texture of your food. And itrsquos probably because yoursquore probably arranging your fridge the wrong way.Check your fridges temperature settings:The ideal temperature range for the interior of your fridge is degC and below.Determine problem areas:According to appliance manufacturer GE, the most common problem areas are the top shelf, the bottom of the fridge , and door shelves.Avoid vents:Most fridges have a cooling vent above the top shelf. This is where most of the cold air comes from, so keeping food away from here may prevent freezing. Adjust your freezer:Turn up your freezer temperature settings, but nothing north of degF, which will facilitate bacterial growth and accelerate food spoilage.Check your ice maker:Make sure that your ice maker is not constantly running. This could make your freezer too cold and subsequently cause your refrigerated foods to freeze.Stock up your fridge:Refrigerators need to be well-stocked to absorb all of the cold air being vented into the cavity. If it is relatively empty, all of the cold air will sink to the bottom of the cavity and freeze your food. A fully stocked fridge will help maintain temperatures and, as a result, use less energy.. Youre not fixing a door that wont shut properlyIf your fridge door wont close, its probably due to an old, dried-out gasket, the rubber seal that runs along its edge. Luckily, the fix is simple: wash the gasket, and apply petroleum jelly to the rubber to revitalize the old rubber.. Youre not regulating your fridges temperatureA full fridge will help keep the temperature consistent. Credit: Getty   Group StudioDid you know your fridge could actually be making you sick  To keep food out of what the Food Saftey Agency calls lsquothe danger zonersquo, it needs to remain below degC. The freezer should be set to -degC to keep freezer burn at bay. If your fridge and freezer are regularly warmer than those temperatures, yoursquore risking faster spoilage. Here are a few things you can do to keep your fridge properly chilled:Invest in a fridge thermometer.To use, place the thermometer in a cup of water. Why  Your refrigerator measures the temperature of the air around your food, but you want to simulate the temperature inside your foods. Check the thermometer after  hours and then, adjust the temperature of each appliance based on the results.Check to make sure the gasket is in good shape, and seals well.If you can open the door with one finger, your seal isnt tight enough. A leaky seal is an energy waster, and may be a risk to your food.Dust your refrigerators cooling coils,theyre visible.

Keep your wall colours neutral, like white and grey, but use your curtains, bedding and cushions to inject splashes of colour.Buying new bedding and hanging a new set of curtains can cost a lot less than a few tins of paint once you factor in all the rollers and brushes yoursquoll need to buy, plus it will take less time too.Once yoursquove bought the cushions, next time yoursquore thinking about changing the colour, just buy new covers and match the size of the cushions. That means you can store the others away, pass them on to a friend or use them in another room.Donrsquot forget about artwork. You can find some really trendy prints online and IKEA is great for cheap frames too. Make sure you buy the same size prints each time, meaning you can keep the same frames. You can update the frames easily too with a cheap can of spray paint.Canrsquot afford a new carpet  Yoursquoll be amazed at what a good deep clean and adding a colourful or patterned rug can do.If your furniture is looking a bit tired, upcycle with a lick of paint and new door handles. You can pick up a tin of furniture paint from most hardware stores or online and you can buy cute, quirky doorknobs from eBay or Etsy, or even just try spray painting the existing ones.Metal accessories like curtain rods and light fittings can benefit from that spray paint too!Upcycling is a great way to keep costs low, give a much loved item a new lease of le and is good for the environment by cutting out waste.Living roomMoving on to the most used room in the house, this can be the most dficult to update as it no doubt has many uses. From the TV room to the playroom to the dining room, your living space probably needs to be more practical than anything . But you can still add some style along the way.Your sofa likely dominates the room and can be the most expensive piece in the room ndash with the exception of the TV! So replacing this often can be costly. But have you considered replacing the covers  If your sofa is in generally good condition but itrsquos looking a bit off-colour, you can buy covers that fit over the top.IKEA do a range of these covers that are made for their sofa ranges, but you can find places online that offer made to measure services. This can be more expensive, but definitely cheaper than buying a whole new sofa and are machine washable! Alternatively, adding a new throw and some scatter cushions can have the same effect.Many of the tips for the bedroom can be used in the living room too. Like adding a nice feature wall for a splash of colour or why not try adding a nice gallery wall with lots of family pictures  A great way to add a personal touch to a room. You can even get the family involved to pick out their favourite pictures.,params: .pushPlants are a great way to brighten up a room and fill any unused corners.

With recycling centres and charity shops open again therersquos no excuse. Spend the weekend sorting through any unwanted items and donate where you can.For storage solutions, you need to think outside the box ndash literally. Vacuum bags are ideal, they normally come in multipacks of ious sizes and are really cheap. Great for anything soft that is taking up a lot of space. Winter clothes, quilts and blankets can be reduced to a tenth of the size and slide under the bed nicely.If floor space is a problem, then the sky is the limit, literally. Consider storing items that arenrsquot needed on a regular basis above units or wardrobes. Think about shelving units that are tall and slim, rather than long and bulky.Cheap and cheerful plastic, canvas or cardboard boxes can help to keep everything in place while adding a splash of colour and style. Perfect for keeping clutter off the floor.,params: .pushShelves above radiators are a great way to use otherwise wasted space.If the kids are desperate for some space, a reading nook or kids study area can easily be achieved under the stairs or a window. A simple storage box with a couple of cushions on top will create a comfy seat and can double up as extra storage.Hooks can be attached to pretty much anything like bedroom doors and inside cupboards ndash again keeping items off the floor will create the illusion of more space. In the kitchen, using hooks to hang pots and pans and magnets for knives can free up cupboard space and make a statement.Knowing where things are is half the battle when considering storage options, so think about clear plastic boxes or bags that are easy to see into and can be labelled.Flexible furniture like extendable dining tables, sofa beds and even clothes rails are ideal as they have multiple uses and can be stored away easily when not in use.Let there be lightLighting and mirrors are your friends when it comes to making a smaller room feel bigger. Change large floor lamps for smaller wall lights and when it comes to wall colour, stick to pale colours and swap out heavy curtains with blinds. Luckily, a big tub of value white paint goes a long way. Let in as much light as possible, give the windows a good scrub and update yellowing lightbulbs to bright white.OutdoorsIs it time to rethink that huge sofa set and professional sized goal posts  When buying furniture, think small, light and foldable so that they can be stored away in a shed or cupboard or easily moved around. Updating your garden furniture doesnrsquot need to cost the earth, yoursquoll find some really great bargain sets in supermarkets like Aldi, Asda and Tesco and homeware stores like BM.Another way to make it feel bigger is to simply give it a good tidy. Yoursquoll be surprised at how much space you do have after clearing out those unwanted flowerpots, cutting the grass and trimming back the hedges.Your home is an investment, to be enjoyed for a long time and with these simple but effective ideas, you can enjoy the space you have for longer."},{"url":null,"title":"love-first-sight-couple-toast-golden-anniversary","story":"Norman and Sophia Taylor enjoyed a socially distanced golden wedding anniversary, due to the Covid- restrictions, at their home on North Grange Avenue on July  with their three children.Northumbrian-born Norman, who turned  on June , met Sophia, , in Prestonpans Royal British Legion in , saying it was ldquolove at first sight and ldquoeyes over a dance floor.The pair married shortly afterwards at Prestonpans Register Office and then went on to travel the world due to Normanrsquos job as a fitter and turner, a trade he learned in the Merchant Navy.The family travelled across Britain between  and .

Reduce light from the hall. Make sure there are no electronics sending out light e.g. a digital alarm clock with a lit display, sleep buttons on equipment etc.\"You may want to put black curtains at the window or wear an eye mask to limit the light getting into the eye.\"Sleep Scotland suggests wearing an eye maskOn the other end, you should also get lots of light in the morning to help you feel awake and alert.They added: \"Exposure to light at the right time helps keep the circadian clock on the correct time schedule.\"Make sure you open the curtains and turn on the lightsyou need to. Going for a walk is a great way to start the day.\"RoutineIt is only natural that during lockdown many of us have found that we have lost our routine and have been staying up later and lying in bed longer in the morning.Sleep Scotland said: \"Your body clock works best when you stick to a schedule.\"In an ideal world, yoursquoll go to sleep and wake up within a half hour of the same time each day, even on weekends.\"The routines of the day also give us powerful signals and demands that the body remain alert for certain tasks and events.\"Regular waking and bed times, alongside regular meal times are very important for regulating your body and its s.\"Sleep PressureSleep pressure is the term used to describe the feeling of tiredness we have, due to the activity we undertake through the day.Sleep Scotland say it is important to be active in order to make sure we create the sleep pressure and drowsiness that will help us to fall asleep.They argue that having a nap can relieve our sleep pressure, meaning we find it harder to fall asleep at bedtime.Take a tech breakNaturally during lockdown many of us have resorted to using screens to help keep us entertained,to work and to socialise with friends.And while most modern tech has a blue light filter, it does not filter all light.More importantly, the things you do online are usually things that stimulate your brain and make it harder to turn off when you get into bed.Therefore, Sleep Scotland say you should unplug from all screens at least an hour before bedtime.They added: \"In the hour before bed, ensure you focus on

midnight tonightuntil .am UK time on Thursday, August  - according to astronomers at Royal Observatory Greenwich.What are the Perseids The astronomical event is associated with the dusty debris left by Comet Swt-Tuttle, which orbits the sun once every  years.The meteoroids from the comet, mostly no bigger than a grain of sand, burn up as they hit the Earthrsquos atmosphere at  miles per second to produce a shooting stream of light in the sky.Peak temperatures can reach anywhere from ,C to ,C as they speed across the sky.The meteors are called Perseids because they seem to dart out of the constellation Perseus.The meteor shower began on July  and will continue to be visible until August .What have astronomers said Anna Ross, an astronomer at the Royal Observatory Greenwich, said the best time to spot the meteors is between midnight and .am on Thursday, when up to  meteors or ldquoshooting stars will be visible per hour, which is more than one every second.She told the PA news agency: ldquoThis makes the Perseids one of the most impressive meteor showers of the year.ldquoDuring the peak night of the shower, you will be able to find it in the north-east of the sky, getting higher throughout the night.ldquoYou donrsquot have to be able to see Perseus to spot meteors, however, as they will be moving away from the radiant across the whole sky in every direction.To make the most of the meteors, Ms Ross said observers should avoid well-lit and built-up areas and try to find an unobstructed view to the east.She added: ldquoFind a dark area and allow around  minutes for your eyes adapt to the dark.ldquoAs meteors move quite fast across the sky itrsquos best to look up without using telescopes or binoculars so you can see as much of the sky as possible.How regular will the meteors be The Perseids are one of the more active meteor showers on stargazersrsquo calendars, producing an average of between  and  shooting stars an hour at their peak.The shower in rsquos was especially active, delivering up to  meteors an hour at its height.While the shooting stars this year wonrsquot be quite as regular, stargazers can still expect to see around  of them an hour.Do I need special equipment to see the Perseids Meteor showers are typically visible with the naked eye, so no special equipment is needed, but those in rural areas with minimal light pollution will have a clearer view.Heading out to a dark spot is the best plan of action, but stargazers should allow around  minutes for their eyes to become accustomed to the dark.Patience is also a virtue, with shooting stars tending to appear in clusters, followed by a lull.The meteors will appear to come from the direction of the Perseus constellation in the north eastern part of the sky, although they should be visible from any point.A cloudy night could still scupper your chances of spotting any meteors, however, so keep your eye on weather

The Education Secretary has let them down and should be held accountable for this fiasco.Schools in East Lothian were yesterdaycontacting pupils who had been affected to let them know they would receive new awards.Across the county, , grades were submitted to the SQA for pupils at the end of May across National , Higher and Advanced Higher level by their teachers.In total, , were acceptedwith  adjusted upand ,adjusted down.In terms of pupils who were due to sit the exams, the council said just over  per cent saw at least one grade marked down.Councillor Shamin Akhtar , cabinet spokesperson for education and childrenrsquos services, said: ldquoIrsquom delighted that John Swinney has finally decided to do the right thing for pupils on the exam results fiasco.ldquoYoung people have faced a very tough and stressful time already and this is something they should never have had to go through.ldquoSchool staff worked extremely hard to submit grades for their pupils to the SQA and the adjustments undermined their professional judgement.ldquoThis u-turn is a victory for young people who have led the campaign against the unfair results and should be commended for standing up for their rights.And Councillor Craig Hoy , a member of East Lothianrsquos education committee, said: ldquoI am delighted that grades have been restored to hardworking pupils in East Lothian who faced huge uncertainty over the last week for no good reason.ldquoEveryone can see that John Swinney has presided over a litany of failures, any one of which could have been a resignation issue on its own.ldquoThe SNP defended their appalling grading system to the hilt, even after it became clear that pupils, parents and teachers had no confidence in the system.On Monday, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon issued an apology to students across the country who had been marked down by the SQA.She said: ldquoOur concern, which was to make sure the grades young people got were as valid as in any other year, perhaps led us to think too much about the overall system and not enough about the inidual pupil.ldquoThat has meant too many students feel they have lost out on grades they should have had, and that that has happened not as a result of anything they have done but a statistical model or algorithm.ldquoDespite our best intentions, I do acknowledge that we did not get this right and I am sorry.A spokesperson for East Lothian Council welcomed the u-turn, adding: ldquoThroughout this process our schools have sought to represent the academic achievements of our young people in a way that provided a fair and accurate reflection of attainment using the guidance and methodology provided by the SQA.ldquoThe announcement by the Education Secretary will be welcomed by young people who saw their results downgraded, and by our teachers and schools who used their professional judgement when providing grade estimates.East Lothian MP Kenny MacAskillpledged his support to headteachers in a letter at the end of last week after the original results came out.He said: ldquoI welcome the Scottish Governmentrsquos announcement.ldquoAs I said last week in a letter to East Lothianrsquos headteachers, I believe the people best placed to know about pupils are those overseeing and working alongside them during their academic journeys.ldquoThis decision is the right one, and I want to send my congratulations to all students in East Lothian for the work they have achieved both before and during this pandemic, as well as a huge thanks to the teachers and school support staff who have worked so hard over the last few months."},{"url":null,"title":"betrayal-claim-mcdonalds-musselburgh-recommended-approval","story":"In a letter to the Courier, Fraser McAllister hit out at their ldquoillogical recommendation which,approved by councillors at an online meeting next week, would grant permission for a restaurant to be created in the car park of the Tesco store off Olivebank Road.He claimed that the drive-thru, which would operate  hours a day, seven days a week, would be ldquonext to the most congested roundabout in the county.The former SNP councillor for Musselburgh West said: ldquoTragically,  local objectors and , petitioners have less value than the share value of these gigantic corporations.He called on councillors on the planning committee, which will debate the proposal on Tuesday, to halt the ldquobetrayal.Mr McAllister also lodged a formal objection, citing a range of concerns including traffic congestion, pollution, litter, obesity, residential amenity and economic damage.He claimed: ldquoThe custom predicted for this -hour McDonaldrsquos drive-thru and the intensity of the declared deliveries needed to service it are on an industrial scale. The impact on Olivebank Road would be truly calamitous.The plan will go before a lsquovirtualrsquo meeting of the planning committee after being called off the delegated list by ward councillor Stuart Currie because of the level of local concern.He said: ldquoI have called this application off the list to ensure that all the concerns raised by local residents are discussed and elected members can understand not only the strength of feeling but also the planning issues that exist as a result of this application.Musselburgh  Inveresk Community Council has lodged an objection, citing traffic congestion, emissions, and the facilityrsquos close proximity to local schools as concerns.A public campaign lsquoNo McDonaldrsquos in Musselburghrsquo was also launched in a bid to halt the plan, highlighting concerns such as increased traffic congestion, litter and air pollution.The planning report stated that there were  written representations to the application and, of these,  were objections.It said: ldquoThe councilrsquos road services advise they accept the conclusions of the traffic network modelling exercise, that the traffic impact associated with the proposed development would be minimal and there would be no adverse impact on the operation of the local highway network.ldquoMany written objections are made on the grounds of the proximity of the proposed drive-thru restaurant to Musselburgh Grammar School, and that such a facility promotes unhealthy eating and thus would lead to harmful health consequences.ldquoThe East Lothian Local Development Plan  does not contain any policies restricting the location of drive-thru restaurant facilities to a certain distance from schools, or any other educational establishments. Nor does it contain any policies relating to unhealthy eating or the health consequences of proposed developments. Thus, and in the absence of national guidance on health consequences of proposed developments, no signicant weight can be given to these matters.The report added: ldquoOn the matter of air quality, the public health and environmental protection officer advised that the proposed development was anticipated to result in up to  customer vehicles visiting the premises daily, which was a signicant number of additional vehicles given the proximity of site to the Air Quality Management Areaon Musselburgh High Street.The officer agreed with the conclusion of McDonaldrsquos Air Quality Assessment that impacts upon air quality at ldquosensitive receptors would not be signicant. The officer advised that, whilst it was acknowledged that additional traffic would have an impact upon queuing and reduce traffic speeds, the composition of the increased traffic would be from passenger cars, which are less polluting than HGVs and buses.The officer concluded that the proposed development would have ldquono harmful impact on air quality nor on the objectives of the AQMA and would not harm the amenity of the area.A McDonaldrsquos spokesperson said: ldquoWe look forward to progressing with this application and believe a new McDonaldrsquos would bring signicant investment to the local community, as well as create at least  new jobs.A supporting statement from the company added: ldquoThere are few restaurants in the country who can claim to have made so many positive changes to support healthier lestyles. McDonaldrsquos believe that the lessons they have learned in making these changes can be used to support a wider drive to reduce obesity.Planners are recommending the plan be approved with a number of conditions, including submission of litter and pest management plans.A council spokesperson declined to comment, saying the planning committee would consider the application next week."},{"url":null,"title":"wavegarden-scotland-surf-resort-takes-step-closer-reality----looks-unreal","story":"Artists drawings of the plans for Wavegarden Scotland show the extent of the project - which is hoped to create  jobs and generate up to poundmillion for the local economy every year.The visitor attraction is planned for the disused Craigpark Quarry near Ratho on the outskirts of Edinburgh.Artist impressions for the food and retail hubsThe project will involve the installation of underwater technology that can create , waves per hour, from slow moving white water for beginners through to powerful barrels up to two metres high for experts.Yesterday, the teams developer confirmed it had been backed by planners to include a food and retail hub, as well as glamping pods for accommodation.Tartan Leisure Ltd, developers of Scotlandrsquos first articial surf park, Wavegarden Scotland, received planning permission today.

Essentially, this means there should be no way of telling yoursquove been there ndash no litter, no signs of fires, no damage to trees or other elements of the environment.This is a good example of wild campingSome very conscientious campers take this further by removing litter left by others, i.e. the site looks better for them having been there. Hats off to these heroes.If it can sometimes be dficult to define what wild camping is, itrsquos easier to say what it isnrsquot.It isnrsquot pitching a tent in a car park, and it certainly isnrsquot turning up with your entire family and friends and a car full of glamping kit and or lager.It may also surprise some people, but responsible wild camping would not include an open fire at least not in certain areas. SOAC states that you should ldquonever light an open fire during prolonged dry periods or in areas such as forests, woods, farmland... So, fires in the woods are in breach of the code, as are fires anywhere during dry periods.If yoursquore desperately in need of a fire, the place to have it is on the beach.Itrsquos also a good idea to bring your own wood. Collecting fuel on-site isnrsquot a good thing, as dead wood is a valuable part of ecosystems. Cutting branches from trees may constitute vandalism and anyway, green wood burns really badly.Perhaps itrsquos also important to think about the ethos behind wild camping.As mentioned, truly wild camping should have an intrinsic respect for, and minimal impact on, the natural environment.At some of our sites, wersquove seen a huge increase in camping in recent years.Many of those involved are reasonably responsible campers, fires aside, that is, leaving little or no litter.However, the cumulative effect of such a high density of campersis to slowly degrade the natural environment.Then, of course, therersquos the issue of where all these people are going to the toilet, but letrsquos not dwell on that.So, perhaps it just needs a little more thought on the part of the campers.Some sites are simply inappropriate ndash Aberlady Bay and Traprain Law, for example, being a nature reserve and scheduled monument respectively.Others may be OK sometimes, but not when busy.Under these circumstances, it may be that prospective campers should think about choosing another venue.Right, rant over normal service will be resumed next month."},{"url":null,"title":"msp-column-ensuring-river-esk-remains-clean","story":"For too long now, the river has been a point of concern for many of my constituents, and I wanted to start a forum where it would bring together those who are working to clean the river, as well as those from the community with an interest in the river, so that we could all work together to find a resolution.In my view, it is important that we look at the cleanliness of the river as a whole, tackling the issues from the sewage spillages and the coal mine discharge in Midlothian, right down to the poor water quality at Fisherrow.The meeting was productive and I am looking forward to seeing progress on this matter.

The couple also have six grandchildren and five great grandchildren.Jenny and Harry were said to be excellent bowlers and very keen and interested in the sport they also enjoyed tennis and were keen gardeners.The couple, who say they get on really well and have done everything together, also loved dancing and continued to do so in Tranentrsquos Co-operative Bowling Club until recent times.However, the pair are now unable to get out much and sadly unable to do the sports and activities they once enjoyed.They do, however, enjoy short walks down their street and across to the bowling club when they can.Son David said his parents were still just as in love as ever, adding that Jenny and Harry did not want to make a big fuss of the day and did not want to have a party so are instead going out for a family meal to The Longniddry Inn.David said his parents coped well during lockdown and had been very careful due to their age.The couple are still able to live relatively independently, with a cleaner visiting the house once a week or so.Alongside his sister Linda, he visits his parents every couple of days to check in.The couple get deliveries of Wiltshire Farm Foodsrsquo microwavable ready meals.

Keep your wall colours neutral, like white and grey, but use your curtains, bedding and cushions to inject splashes of colour.Buying new bedding and hanging a new set of curtains can cost a lot less than a few tins of paint once you factor in all the rollers and brushes yoursquoll need to buy, plus it will take less time too.Once yoursquove bought the cushions, next time yoursquore thinking about changing the colour, just buy new covers and match the size of the cushions. That means you can store the others away, pass them on to a friend or use them in another room.Donrsquot forget about artwork. You can find some really trendy prints online and IKEA is great for cheap frames too. Make sure you buy the same size prints each time, meaning you can keep the same frames. You can update the frames easily too with a cheap can of spray paint.Canrsquot afford a new carpet  Yoursquoll be amazed at what a good deep clean and adding a colourful or patterned rug can do.If your furniture is looking a bit tired, upcycle with a lick of paint and new door handles. You can pick up a tin of furniture paint from most hardware stores or online and you can buy cute, quirky doorknobs from eBay or Etsy, or even just try spray painting the existing ones.Metal accessories like curtain rods and light fittings can benefit from that spray paint too!Upcycling is a great way to keep costs low, give a much loved item a new lease of le and is good for the environment by cutting out waste.Living roomMoving on to the most used room in the house, this can be the most dficult to update as it no doubt has many uses.

So replacing this often can be costly. But have you considered replacing the covers  If your sofa is in generally good condition but itrsquos looking a bit off-colour, you can buy covers that fit over the top.IKEA do a range of these covers that are made for their sofa ranges, but you can find places online that offer made to measure services. This can be more expensive, but definitely cheaper than buying a whole new sofa and are machine washable! Alternatively, adding a new throw and some scatter cushions can have the same effect.Many of the tips for the bedroom can be used in the living room too. Like adding a nice feature wall for a splash of colour or why not try adding a nice gallery wall with lots of family pictures  A great way to add a personal touch to a room. You can even get the family involved to pick out their favourite pictures.Plants are a great way to brighten up a room and fill any unused corners.

With recycling centres and charity shops open again therersquos no excuse. Spend the weekend sorting through any unwanted items and donate where you can.For storage solutions, you need to think outside the box ndash literally. Vacuum bags are ideal, they normally come in multipacks of ious sizes and are really cheap. Great for anything soft that is taking up a lot of space. Winter clothes, quilts and blankets can be reduced to a tenth of the size and slide under the bed nicely.If floor space is a problem, then the sky is the limit, literally. Consider storing items that arenrsquot needed on a regular basis above units or wardrobes. Think about shelving units that are tall and slim, rather than long and bulky.Cheap and cheerful plastic, canvas or cardboard boxes can help to keep everything in place while adding a splash of colour and style. Perfect for keeping clutter off the floor.Shelves above radiators are a great way to use otherwise wasted space.If the kids are desperate for some space, a reading nook or kids study area can easily be achieved under the stairs or a window. A simple storage box with a couple of cushions on top will create a comfy seat and can double up as extra storage.Hooks can be attached to pretty much anything like bedroom doors and inside cupboards ndash again keeping items off the floor will create the illusion of more space. In the kitchen, using hooks to hang pots and pans and magnets for knives can free up cupboard space and make a statement.Knowing where things are is half the battle when considering storage options, so think about clear plastic boxes or bags that are easy to see into and can be labelled.Flexible furniture like extendable dining tables, sofa beds and even clothes rails are ideal as they have multiple uses and can be stored away easily when not in use.Let there be lightLighting and mirrors are your friends when it comes to making a smaller room feel bigger. Change large floor lamps for smaller wall lights and when it comes to wall colour, stick to pale colours and swap out heavy curtains with blinds. Luckily, a big tub of value white paint goes a long way. Let in as much light as possible, give the windows a good scrub and update yellowing lightbulbs to bright white.OutdoorsIs it time to rethink that huge sofa set and professional sized goal posts  When buying furniture, think small, light and foldable so that they can be stored away in a shed or cupboard or easily moved around. Updating your garden furniture doesnrsquot need to cost the earth, yoursquoll find some really great bargain sets in supermarkets like Aldi, Asda and Tesco and homeware stores like BM.Another way to make it feel bigger is to simply give it a good tidy. Yoursquoll be surprised at how much space you do have after clearing out those unwanted flowerpots, cutting the grass and trimming back the hedges.Your home is an investment, to be enjoyed for a long time and with these simple but effective ideas, you can enjoy the space you have for longer."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.comource srcset=/resources/images/10102750.jpg?htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"new-bbc-documentary-series-jamie-genevieve-great-indoors-air-week","story":"The make-up artist, who is a worldwide star on YouTube and Instagram, will star in the three-part series Jamie Genevieve: Great Indoors on BBC Scotland onThursday at . pm.It comes after the success of her first documentary for the networks BBC Scotland channel Jamie Genevieve #Unfiltered.The former Cathkin High School pupil started out working in make-up counters in Debenhams in Glasgow.Now she is known for her how to make-up demonstrations on YouTube.The new mini-series focuses on how Jamie and husband Jack is coping in the middle of the coronavirus pandemic from trying her hand at hairdressing to baking."},{"url":null,"title":"list-glasgow-shops-administration-lockdown","story":"Here we look at some of the businesses who will no longer be operating in the city and the ones under threat.Remnant KingsCity location: Howard StreetA total of  stafflost their jobs from the firmrsquos bases in Glasgow, Hamilton, and Edinburgh after the administrators were called in.The firm, which started in Glasgow in , said that although they were historically profitable, they have since suffered from declining turnover and trading dficulties in recent years caused by changing consumer habits.:Glasgow firm Remnant Kings goes into admistration resulting in job lossesOasis and Warehouse GroupCity locations past and present: Buchanan Galleries, Silverburn, Princes Square, and Glasgow Fort.The company behind Oasis and Warehouse went into administration in April when Deloitte was appointed as administrator.All stores haveclosed indefinitely whileonline sales have stopped.Reports say the fashion brands have been sold to restructuring business Hilco in a deal which includes stock but not the  stores or  concessions.Hash Ladha, chief executive of Oasis Warehouse, previouslysaid: ldquoThis is a situation that none of us could have predicted a month ago, and comes as shocking and dficult news for all of us.ldquoWe as a management team have done everything we can to try and save the iconic brands that we love.:Oasis and Warehouse who have shops in Glasgow fall into administrationCath KidstonCity location: Gordon StreetCath Kidston said they will not reopen their shops when lockdown ends.They called in the administrators in April with the closure of shops costing around  jobs.It is understood that the owner of the retro fashion brand has secured a deal to buy back the brand and its online operation.

Get used to longevity. To paraphrase Doris Day, its earlier than you think.Futurologists Andrew Scott and Lynda Gratton say society must abandon the out-dated ldquothree stage, -year le and start thinking about the ldquo-year career and the ldquomulti-stage le. You are going to have to change jobs several times in those six decades and retrain just to remain economically viable.Indeed, le may become one le-long learning experience, possibly overseen by computers that will assess how much you are keeping up to date in your field. Learning to live will become ldquoliving to learn. We may soon be under benevolent surveillance from Big Data and AI using algorithms to test progress ndash a bit like corporate Duolingo.Age itself has to be redefined as ldquomalleable, not fixed in a straight line from cradle to grave. Just look at the Rolling Stones, they say, as perky and productive in their seventies as they were half a century ago.Well, up to a point. There are constituencies in Glasgow where many men dont live long enough to collect their state pensions, let alone to the age of . They might not be so sanguine at the prospect of abolishing the retirement age, which is the main recommendation of this book.But Scott and Gratton are right to identy the absurdity of assuming that people cease to be productive by . This numerical determinism is past its sell-by date.In Japan, which is further down the geriatric road than most countries, theyre already on to this. There,  per cent of over-s are still working in the UK fewer than  per cent do. The Japanese working age population has fallen by five million since , because of a declining birth rate. However, actual employment has risen in the same period by .m as more older people remain in work.But arent ldquoyoung people just smarter as Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg put it in an unguarded remark quoted here  Andrew Scott and Lynda Gratton are on a crusade to abolish this kind of casual ageism. A third of workers aged between  and , they claim, experience it.In fact, people are just as intelligent at  as they were at  ndash they just arent so impulsive, according to the authors. They may not be quite so quick off the mark, but they get things done and make fewer mistakes.Society needs to stop seeing old people as a burden and start seeing them as an underused economic resource. Enlisting retirees into the workforce could boost economic productivity and growth by almost as much as when women entered the workforce in the latter half of the th century.Scott and Gratton are particularly hostile to the oft-quoted ldquodependency ratio ndash the number of people over  ided by the number of people of ldquoworking age. Globally, this is currently around . and is expected to reach . by .In the EU the number of people in what is traditionally called the ldquoworking age category , is expected to fall by  per cent in the next  years. In Japan, the oldest country in the world, it will reach ., meaning one worker for every retired person.This dependency ratio is often referred to as a ldquotime bomb, with the implication being that having a lot of old people around is unaffordable. Scott and Gratton argue that this is as economically illiterate as it is offensive to seniors. People aged  may have  productive years ahead of them, according to the authors.Indeed, some people will have to get used to working until their late seventies and eighties. Unless you are in the public sector you wont be able to save enough during the conventional working le to sustain a decent living standard into great age. Yet, politicians and most corporations still think in terms of retirement at . ldquoThis has to change, and change fast, the authors say. Companies will have to stop thinking about career ladders and start thinking about ldquohorizontal careers with ldquomultiple points of entry as people move between occupations over this extended working le.Scott and Gratton are certainly right to regard older people as productive. However, this rather ignores the digital elephant in the room: technological redundancy. Large numbers of unskilled jobs, and many skilled ones, are likely to disappear in the next half century through automation and articial intelligence.Before the pandemic, the Office for National Statistics estimated that . million jobs are in immediate risk in the UK alone. Many more will have been added to that inventory since lockdown. The big winners have been online retailers like Amazon, which increasingly employ robots.Is there going to be enough work in future for young people let alone the active old  Scott and Gratton skirt round this by insisting that productivity iniably creates more jobs than it destroys. That is true in the broad sweep of history, but it sometimes takes a while for this goldilocks outcome to be realised.Then there is over-qualication. Le-long learning is a fine objective, but half the population already enters higher education. More than half of UK university graduates are in jobs which dont require a degree.You could spend your entire le acquiring degrees and incurring debt without ever actually reaching your intended station in le. Many young people already feel they have had their future stolen from them. They may resent increased competition from smart seniors leaping the career ladder.Millennials talk dismissively of ldquogammons and ldquoBoomers, blaming them for high property prices and pensions young people can only dream of. Scott and Gratton think they will just have to accept it, just as they accept equality for women and ethnic minorities.The authors are both professors at the London Business School and largely addressing an elite audience. You imagine global knowledge workers reading this while sipping their skinny lattes on the way to power-point presentations. A good half of this book reads like a self-help manual for middle managers.One of the problems with le-coach literature is a tendency to coin pretentious ways to state the obvious. We need to turn ldquorecreation into re-creation ldquobuild stackable and portable credentials keep ldquostepping beyond the veil of ignorance to see our ldquopossible selves\". Who am I to argue This is the language of HR and corporate social responsibility reports. Indeed, I suspect Scott and Gratton have a bright -year career as consultants taking their five step programme around the corporate conference circuit.

Both hills can be climbed in one expedition but we didnrsquot arrive in Falkland until early afternoon and the short daylight hours of winter didnrsquot give us a lot of time to climb both hills and visit the Palace, so we opted for East Lomondand a wander down a fascinating little glen called Maspie Den.We parked in the village and made our way up Cross Wynd towards the hill that towered above us, completely dominating the village. It looked like a very steep climb and it was. At the top end of Cross Wynd with a rather dilapidated factory on one side and houses on the other we reached the beginning of the lsquoofficialrsquo path and the start of several long sets of wooden steps.I guess these steps were built with the best of intentions but it was obvious that most folk walk up the side of them. Whatever the merits or not of wooden steps it wasnrsquot long before we could gaze back through the beech trees and see the amount of height we had gained in a very short time. We were surprised how quickly we reached the top of the woods where the angle of the path eased sufficiently to let us get our breath back, but it wasnrsquot long before it steepened again as it climbed the final dome to the summit and its view indicator.From here we could begin to get an impression of the whole of the Lomond Hills Regional Park, a precious  square mile area of moorland, hills, lochs and farmland. The area was designated as Scotlands first Regional Park in  in recognition of its importance for recreation and conservation.As we dropped down towards the Craigmead car park we appreciated the conservation value of such parks as we watched a hen harrier quarter the moorland in search of prey. The ghostly movement of the bird was impressive, a fine raptor that is sadly being victimised by so-called sportsmen in many other areas of Scotland.The car park at Craigmead is also the starting point for climbing the slightly higher West Lomond , but we were intent on something a bit dferent ndash a walk back to Falkland by the impressive Maspie Den, finishing with a wander through the policies of the House of Falkland.Leaving the car park we crossed a field and passed through young woodland before dropping down into the Den, and what a surprise that was. The path suddenly steepens to the right and you drop into what could be described as a mini-cavern with the footpath going behind the waters of the Yad waterfall. Not really the kind of sight yoursquod expect on a walk in rural Fe!The path continues to drop down beside the burn with little sets of waterfalls to keep your interest alive. You cross several bridges before you enter woodland again. Ignore ious turn-offs to the right and continue through another unexpected feature, a dark winding tunnel that takes you into the grounds of the House of Falkland.This rather grand Jacobean-style building was the former home of the Marquess of Bute and today is a school for boys with special needs. The whole estate is still pretty impressive and the long private drive back into Falkland passes a number of interesting looking buildings, including the old stables which today house the offices of the Falkland Heritage Trust. It makes a fine ending to a great short walk.Cameron McNeishROUTE PLANNERMap: OS :, Landranger sheets and  Start Finish: Car Park in Falkland Distance:  miles kmTime: - hoursInformation: St Andrews TIC,  .

There remains a widening gap between high-level rhetoric and delivery on the ground. However, there are a number of statements which suggest the government is beginning to give the necessary prominence to the role that investment in our natural environment can play in addressing the climate, nature and economic crises.In accepting the recommendations of its own Advisory Group on Economic Recovery, the Scottish Government is taking a new ldquofour capitals approach which involves viewing the economy through four pillars of economic, natural, human and social capital. Just as importantly, it is accepting the advice of the group ldquoto treat each pillar as equally important.Government recognises that improving our wellbeing is dependent on our ability to conserve and grow our natural assets. It also appears to have accepted the radical advice of the Scottish Infrastructure Commission that the next Infrastructure Investment Plan should have natural infrastructure as a key component.In other aspects the plan lacks urgency and clear time commitments. Much of the detail seems to have been left to the update of the Climate Change Plan and the Infrastructure Investment Plan. Sadly, a clear timetable is also lacking and all we are told is that there will be ldquoregular updates to the plan.There is welcome acknowledgement that investing in our natural environment, nature-based solutions and green skills are vital to address the twin climate and bioersity crises. Nonetheless, to be genuinely transformational government will need to go further than existing commendable commitments to peatland restoration and vague pledges of ldquowoodland expansion.Government must ensure that we also maintain our peatland in good condition, prevent further damaging extraction and horticultural use and invest in native woodland. Nature-based solutions must also go further and include investment in greening our cities and enhancing the marine environment.With the Scottish Budget already under signicant pressure, providing the necessary funding for nature-based solutions is going to be even more of a challenge. This cannot, however, be an excuse for further delay. Investment in our natural assets must get a fair share of the poundbn earmarked for infrastructure plans. We also need to consider how to make better use of existing funding and instruments like the infrastructure levy. The UK Committee on Climate Change has advised that we must also consider changes in tax policy. The Scottish National Investment Bank also has a key role to play.One low cost and high impact measure that could unlock a whole range of new conservation opportunities would be for the next Scottish Budget to kick start a new Conservation Finance Fund with initial public seed investment to help lever in private finance. This would build on the collaborative work led by SEPA and the Scottish Wildle Trust on the ldquoRoute Map to pound Billionrsquo.If the necessary public and private funding is forthcoming, then the Scottish Governmentrsquos proposed partnership approach and the desire to involve communities much more in decision making is also key to success. However, we must ensure that communities and NGOs are engaged on an equal footing with business. We look forward to working with government to make this a truly green and transformational recovery that enhances all aspects of our wellbeing.Dougie Peedle is Head of Policy, Scottish Wildle Trust"},{"url":null,"title":"Country Life with Rosemary Goring  The simple joys of country walking","story":"Hooletrsquos church is one of the most historic in the area.

Their work can be le-changing. However, itrsquos estimated that  per cent of PhD students in the UK donrsquot finish their studies. Meanwhile, in North America, the figure rises to %. My bet is that these figures will only rise given the current climate, and I know first-hand how challenging PhD study can be right now.Generally, Irsquove been fortunate to have good mental health. However, over the past year or so, once I had got into the meat of my PhD, I began to struggle under the pressure which affected my mood signicantly. The academic industry is inherently competitive and, at the end of the day, itrsquos about how good you are as an inidual.A PhD is often a unique, long-term project and, being so niche, itrsquos not something that can be easily understood by friends, family and even peers. Perhaps because of this, studying for a PhD is quite an isolated experience. You have a supervisor, but its on you to do your work ndash therersquos nobody waiting at the other end for the result. Even your supervisor doesnrsquot know all the detail about your work. Theyrsquore there to help you to think dferently about things and work with you on the bigger picture ndash but the detail you delve into alone.In the sciences we have whatrsquos called The Second Year Slump ndash which is when yoursquore around  months in and you hit a wall. I believe I hit that wall.Research in its nature is a lonely profession ndash with lab work and data crunching often taking place in isolation. And lockdown has exacerbated the pressures and the isolation, by putting deadlines back and inhibiting lab work. Sometimes you start the day, and you feel like yoursquove got no direction or sense of urgency, because yoursquore missing some of the lab work and data.For me, personally, my slump resulted in changes in mood and behaviour. I was sleeping more, eating junk food and moving very little. All of this added to the feelings of worthlessness that were rising within me because, especially in lockdown, there really wasnrsquot anyone to bounce ideas off and share experiences with.Since labs started to re-open, I have found that some of the social aspects of PhD study are starting to come back into my le, and commuting to and from the lab by bike has boosted my mood because itrsquos got me moving again.But research was lonely before lockdown. Whatever the new normal is, it will surely only get worse. Which is why Irsquove been so keen to join and shout about an online academic community called Scientistt. Itrsquos a virtual peer support and network for postgraduate students and early career researchers from across the globe.

Would you find a sense of peace in an alternative timeline or be forever haunted by what might have been Thats the question posed by The Midnight Library, the latest novel by Matt Haig. It centres on Nora Seed, a woman who is hopelessly adrt and wants her le to end. Instead, she awakes in a library, hovering in a curious existential limbo, neither alive nor dead .Each book on the librarys shelves represents a chance to confront her regrets and see how things might have turned out had she not embarked upon a certain path in her \"root le\". And, as she does so, Nora finds the answers to the questions that have long weighed heavy on her mind.Whatshe had never given up her childhood pursuit to become an Olympic swimmer  Should she have followed her music dream to make it as a famous rock star adored by millions  How would things have panned outshe had never left the boyfriend who wanted to open a country pub with her The Midnight Library allows Nora to live out all of those possibilities and more ndash often with surprising outcomes. \"I have wanted to write about parallel lives for a long time,\" says Haig. \"I was just waiting for the right idea.\"Does he believe that parallel lives exist  \"I kind of do,\" he says. \"Increasingly science seems to back it up as well. I think there are all kinds of scientic reasons for some sort of parallel existence out there.\"Haig is warming to his theme. \"I have always been obsessed with it,\" he continues. \"Especially nowadays when we live in this age of constant comparison, which is exacerbated and accelerated by the internet and social media.\"People are continually comparing their lives to other peoples lives. And the lives they are comparing them to might not necessarily exist ndash they are just presented that way on social media.:Doug Johnstone on how spending time with a funeral director inspired his latest novels\"We are often doing hypothetical things where we are punishing ourselves for not having a certain le or body or perfect relationship. We are almost encouraged to feel bad about ourselves.\"The -year-old author, whose books include How To Stop Time and Notes On A Nervous Planet, says he wrote his new novel in the spirit of the  film Its A Wonderful Le, hoping to impart a message about \"acceptance and realising that often you have a lot more than you think\".Regret is a feeling Haig knows well. With the publication of his  memoir Reasons To Stay Alive, he laid bare the severe depression and spiralling anxiety that led to a breakdown and suicidal episode in his early twenties.Haig was  and living in Ibiza with his now we Andrea. Next month marks  years since the day when, feeling utterly powerless within the grip of such dark, debilitating thoughts that he was unable to see a future for himself, Haig stood on the edge of a clf preparing to jump.He wrote about his journey back to le in Reasons To Stay Alive. The book was meant to be a side project in between Haigs fiction works but struck such a chord that it became a UK No  bestseller and was published in  countries .It is impossible not to draw parallels ndash pardon the pun ndash between his experiences and those of Nora in The Midnight Library. When writing the book, Haig admits to ruminating on the many forks in his own path. If, like Nora, he had the chance, which ones would he revisit \"Often it has been mental health-related with me,\" he says. \"I had a bad time in my twenties where I was full of regrets. I was regretting the lestyle that led me to depression, I was regretting all the decisions I had made, and I was regretting having made the wrong career choices at that point.\"For many a year, when I was a struggling writer, I regretted being a writer. I got there in the end, but it wasnt an instant success story. There are lots of regrets, but I think Im much more philosophical about it all now.\"Haig believes he emerged from his breakdown better equipped to appreciate le. \"I wasnt a particularly happy child or teenager or young adult,\" he says. \"Then I was ill for most of my twenties and recovering into my early thirties.\"I still have the odd mental health dip now. My mental health is not in a perfect place ever ndash it is always on the scale somewhere ndash but I genuinely know more contentment, happiness and gratitude this side of my breakdown than I ever did when I was younger.\"Today, Haig lives in Brighton with Andrea and their two children. While many people knew his books before, there are those who have newly discovered Haig, thanks to his thoughtful words of reflection during the ongoing coronavirus pandemic.He has become something of a figurehead for mental health. It is a mantle Haig isnt always comfortable withyet is unabashedly delighted to learn when his words do help others in pain.Haig is prolic on Twitter and Instagram, where he regularly gains attention for his astute observations on current affairs, mental health issues and a raft of sometimes poetic, mostly withering, jabs at Donald Trump .Describing his posts as brave, prompts a wry laugh. \"Brave stupid,\" says Haig. \"Sometimes on Twitter I forget that I have quite a few people following me now. I have always been a strange combination of sensitive but also opinionated. It is not like I am immune to criticism.\"As soon as you get a blue tick and a few thousand followers, its like people think, Oh well, they are fair game hellip I have learned to be a little bit more philosophical about it. There are people who, when they go on Twitter, switch from person to person, and it is just attack, attack, attack.\"A great tip to dealing with Twitter is before you take that one personal insult to heart, go look at their tweets to see what type of person they are. Nine times out of  it will make you feel better.\":Five must-read Scottish books headed for TV and filmThe author is as warm and affable to speak to voice-on-voiceas he comes across in his writing. Despite proffering sage words of wisdom, Haig admits he has struggled through lockdown as much as the next person.He is finding this current period particularly tricky. \"Because it is summer and Im such a person who lives for holidays, restaurants and getting away. I have realised that I dont have those little markers in my calendar of things to look forward to.\"However, Haig and his family have been finding other ways to have fun. \"Im a movie geek and so I try to get them [his children] into movies. We are going through all the James Bond movies. We are onto Roger Moore at the moment. Ive been explaining there is quite a bit of sexism in them.\"Also, we have an electric keyboard and are using an app to learn the piano and competing with each other on that. That is one of the things we have filled lockdown with.\"Basically, I try to get them excited about stuff because they teach me about Xbox-related things. Im literally the worlds worst player of video games. It is laughable how rubbish I am.\"Haig has another book in the pipeline. \"It is going to be called The Comfort Book,\" he says, adding that it will be \"less specically about mental health\" and \"more about how we can accept ourselves and imperfection, and feel comfortable with who we are.\"In the meantime, you can likely find him hanging out on social media. Although perhaps not forever. \"I do think probably, on balance, Twitter isnt a force for good,\" he muses. \"Its not really making society or the world any better.\"I do possibly dream or imagine a day where I will walk away from all social media.

It mattered not that he had died more than five years before and she was addressing a photograph.\"You do strange things when you are down,\" she says. \"I was married to him for  years. We were close. It is still hard.\"Lockdown made it harder. Betty, , walked out her front door on Wednesday for the first time since lockdown was imposed. She has the stock response of her generation to questions about how she came though such an ordeal. \"You just have to get on with it,\" she says.But how  \"I have my two sons. I couldnrsquot see them physically because I was shielding but I could talk to them. I had my friends.\"This help included Glasgowrsquos Golden Generation, a charity that has existed for  years but found its definitive moment in a time of greatest crisis. \"It is good to know somebody outside your family is thinking of you,\" Betty says. Those thoughts were matched by action.Unprecedented. The word is spoken by Richard Donald, chief executive of Glasgowrsquos Golden Generation. There is no glibness to the expression. Rather, it is spoken in awe at what his organisation had faced and how it reacted.The simple figures can be succinctly put: in  days the charity delivered more than  food parcels and made  phone calls to vulnerable older adults.There was a motion commending the work in the Scottish Parliament last week. The thoughts of the recipients remain largely unheard. But the gratitude is immense. There were reports of pensioners who had not had a proper meal for three or four days. The charity moved urgently.\"We had to adapt and adapt quickly,\" says Mr Donald, who took over his role during the crisis and thus had a baptism not of fire but of some raging inferno. \"It was disarray at first,\" he says. \"How do you deal with something that has never happened before \"The charity has four main purposes: to give welfare advice, to provide a befriending service, to operate three day-care centres and to organise more than  clubs. Priorities changed quickly.\"People needed food parcels,\" says Mr Donald. \"Celtic FC Foundation got in touch and their intervention changed everything. They had the money to help is and they had the expertise too.\"The foundation is full of good people who immediately recognised the need. The food parcel programme was organised quickly and efficiently.\"The foundation, supported by the club, moved quickly to support those most in need, announcing pound, of support in April through its Football for Good Fund. That support grew through the crisis. Glasgowrsquos Golden Generation were immediately given pound, to support its work.With the initial crisis of hunger addressed, other more innovative plans took hold. More than  iPads have been distributed to those living on their own. \"We hope to raise money to provide more,\" says Mr Donald. He has he good grace to chuckle at the suggestion that is a novel way to invoke the mantra of ldquokeep taking the tablets but emphasises their importance.\"They do not only offer entertainment but a way to connect to the outside world,\" he says. A more traditional way is also employed to build a bridge between a vulnerable, shielding adult and the world beyond four walls. Volunteers call those in need.\"Some mornings I was on a downer,\" says Betty Satti. lsquoThen the phone would ring and it was Mitch, the volunteer who calls me. There would be a lsquoHow are you  Anything you are needing rsquo That lted me. It showed there were other people out there who cared. It was not just a brief call. He would talk for  minutes and I felt there was a genuine concern for what I was feeling and what I was finding dficult.\"My sons are great. But one lives in Essex and the other one lives in Fe and of course he could not travel to Glasgow. I was shielding anyway so he couldnrsquot see me. They call every day but for someone  to do so really lts you.

When you are on you own, your mind wanders. You think: lsquoHow long is this going on rsquo The days become weeks, then months. It is dficult.rsquoThen it was over. \"I went out my front door on Wednesday,\" says Betty. \"My carer took me shopping and it was wonderful. I can only walk so far so she put the wheelchair in the car and we went to the shops early, when it was quiet. I was a bit hesitant.\"We take for granted being among people. But you miss it terribly, even just watching people walking about. You get depressedyou donrsquot see people.

I have a wonderful family but isnrsquot it great when people help you when they donrsquot have to or need to \"She adds: ldquoI have never know this. It is something I will never forget.

She is no stranger to hard times or moments that test the will or sap the physical strength of even the strongest but the coronavirus posed a dferent problem.\"It is hard to describe precisely,\" she says. \"But is a mental thing. The reality of not being able to touch anyone. Not being able to hug the ones you love. Not to have people in your house. It was a terrible sensation of being locked in not just locked down.\"She pays tribute to her family but is also grateful to Glasgowrsquos Golden Generation. \"They helped provide a leline to the outside world,\" she says. \"I am used to being on my own and quite happy normally in my own company. But this was dferent. I found the tablet particularly helpful. It was a pleasant and useful distraction.\"Nancy lives in sheltered housing near the city centre and also grasped an opportunity to express her gratitude. \"I believe I am luckier than most,\" she says. \"In my block of flats there are  tenants and  of them have no one. No one. Now that is sad and it must be very dficult.\"She believes this is when Glasgowrsquos Golden Generation became not only helpful but essential. \"The people there are truly caring,\" she says. \"I tell you what I mean by this. There is a lot of talk about helping. But they made sure you were all right. They talked to you. They did something. Actions. They came along with the tablet, they called you.\"There is an uplt when you connect with the outside world. It comes when my grandchildren send me a text at night and when my children call me. Grandchildren are a godsend and you miss them dreadfully. We need that human touch.\"There is nothing that can replace that when you are distanced from those you love but those outside that circle can offer something . You need to know there is somebody out there who cares, not because you are a grandmother or a mother but simply because you are a human being.Nancy, too, found something of good to take from a period of her le that she admits caused her fear.ldquoI learned to appreciate what I had, she says. ldquoI learned to appreciate the love I received, whether it was from family, my circle of friends or from Glasgowrsquos Golden Generation.

He theorised that food production could not keep up with human population growth, leading to starvation, war, disease and general catastrophe.In fact, wersquore nowhere near filling the planet with people: put together in a huddle, every person on Earth would actually fit on Islay, with room to spare. Nevertheless, the global population continues to rise, compounding the environmental problems humanity currently faces.This population growth is one of the areas that will be highlighted in Earth Overshoot Day , which this year takes place on August . It marks the moment in the annual calendar when humanityrsquos demand for ecological resources and services starts to exceed what nature can regenerate.The EOD organisers stress one simple truth ndash that the more of us there are on the planet, the less of it there is for each of us. Every person has to be supported in areas such as food provision, healthcare, social ing and waste management, many of which challenge and compromise the environment.The statistics are sobering. If every second family had on average one fewer child, then the projected world population of . billion by  would fall by a billion. By the end of the century, that drop would be four billion.Importantly, that reduction would move Earth Overshoot Day back by a month by .It would mean  per cent more biocapacity per person by the year  ndash a hugely signicant and positive change.Providing high quality education for women also helps to tackle population growth and the accompanying strain on resources. Statistics produced by the World Bank show that the dference in family size between women with no schooling and those with  years of school learning is four to five children per person.Those with the benefit of full education marry later, have smaller and healthier families, and invest in their children. It is clear that female learning generates social change, takes pressure off the planetrsquos resources and acts as a major driver of womenrsquos empowerment.The stark disparity in population growth between developed countries and less developed ones can be seen by comparing Scotland to other poorer nations.In this country, the total population in  was calculated at . million. According to the National Records of Scotland, this is set to rise only slightly to . million by  and then level off.By comparison, Nigeria ndash the most heavily populated country in Africa ndash is predicted to be set to grow from its current  million to  million by  and more than  million by the turn of the century.By lowering the number of people on the planet, we ease the pressure on resources. And as we consume, so we also discard. The levels of waste we generate are frighteningndash and growing.At present, the average person in the United States throws away their body weight in rubbish every month. Population increase means waste has increased tenfold over the last century, and it is now expected to double again by .Recycling and composting are having an impact, but they are not holding back the tide. Urban areas, which now house half the worldrsquos population, are the worst affected, but we are now seeing waste plastic in almost all of our oceans and rivers.How can this problem be mitigated, particularly as societies become wealthier, creating yet more packaging and a throwaway culture  Industrial processes can be improved there can be a greater drive towards re-use and recycling rubbish charges have been seen to have an effect.MADE TO LASTHere at home, there is a drive towards creating a circular economy, a model that aims to eliminate waste and resource over-use by encouraging an extension of the le cycle of products and equipment through initiatives such as sharing, refurbishment and remanufacturing.The Scottish Government published its own vision for this, titled Making Things Last, in , and Zero Waste Scotland took this further through its own study in June.This identies a number of key principles including being led by the available evidence achieving absolute emissions reductions prioritising reduction of emissions over offsetting going beyond net zero and sharing successes and failures to help drive change.Louise McGregor, Head of Circular Economy at the organisation, said this circular model provided a tool not just to dispose of waste in an eco-friendly way, but to reduce it in the first place.ldquoThatrsquos much more effective than waiting for the waste to be generated and then recycling it. Most of the carbon is associated with the production of the products rather than getting rid of it at the end of its le.She described the circular economy as a ldquosystems level approach, explaining: ldquoIf you take something like food waste, then we can do quite a lot to collect that and reprocess it, and of course thatrsquos all beneficial.ldquoBut with a circular economy, you think about things from the start ndash how it is produced in the first place and what you can do at each stage so that waste isnrsquot there to start with. Historically, wersquove not been very good at doing that.Another problem, she says, is that we have developed a throwaway culture. ldquoItrsquos often cheaper to buy something new than to repair a product. One way of incentivising a new approach is to use economic levers. We need to ask how we can use the tax system to make it more cost effective to do the right thing.The countryrsquos farmers, too, are in the front line of the battle against climate change. A report commissioned by WWF Scotland earlier this year raised the prospect of mitigation measures that involve little or no change of land use.Suggested steps included improvements to animal health and breeding, feed additives, use of nitrogen fertilisers, rotational grazing and using plants such as clovers to fix nitrogen levels.Dr Sheila George, the organisationrsquos Food and Environment Policy Manager, said: ldquoAgriculture is at risk from a changing climate but can be part of the climate solution.ldquoOur land is our biggest natural defence against climate change and farmers and other land managers have a key role in protecting it. We need to produce food in a way that reduces emissions and locks up more carbon. ldquoShe added: ldquoBy adapting our farming methods, Scotland could be at the forefront of the global transition to climate-friendly farming with unique export and branding opportunities arising.lsquoldquoTo get there, we need to see a reframing of rural policy andfinancial support along withadvice and training available for land managers."},{"url":null,"title":"property-patter-make-home-feel-bigger-simple-tricks","story":"With some imagination and a surprisingly small budget, yoursquoll be amazed at what you can achieve without having to up sticks and move.StorageDo you have the room space but just too much stuff  For starters, it sounds obvious, but do a big clear out. With recycling centres and charity shops open again therersquos no excuse. Spend the weekend sorting through any unwanted items and donate where you can.For storage solutions, you need to think outside the box ndash literally. Vacuum bags are ideal, they normally come in multipacks of ious sizes and are really cheap. Great for anything soft that is taking up a lot of space. Winter clothes, quilts and blankets can be reduced to a tenth of the size and slide under the bed nicely.If floor space is a problem, then the sky is the limit, literally. Consider storing items that arenrsquot needed on a regular basis above units or wardrobes. Think about shelving units that are tall and slim, rather than long and bulky.Cheap and cheerful plastic, canvas or cardboard boxes can help to keep everything in place while adding a splash of colour and style. Perfect for keeping clutter off the floor.Shelves above radiators are a great way to use otherwise wasted space.If the kids are desperate for some space, a reading nook or kids study area can easily be achieved under the stairs or a window. A simple storage box with a couple of cushions on top will create a comfy seat and can double up as extra storage.Hooks can be attached to pretty much anything like bedroom doors and inside cupboards ndash again keeping items off the floor will create the illusion of more space. In the kitchen, using hooks to hang pots and pans and magnets for knives can free up cupboard space and make a statement.Knowing where things are is half the battle when considering storage options, so think about clear plastic boxes or bags that are easy to see into and can be labelled.Flexible furniture like extendable dining tables, sofa beds and even clothes rails are ideal as they have multiple uses and can be stored away easily when not in use.Let there be lightLighting and mirrors are your friends when it comes to making a smaller room feel bigger. Change large floor lamps for smaller wall lights and when it comes to wall colour, stick to pale colours and swap out heavy curtains with blinds. Luckily, a big tub of value white paint goes a long way. Let in as much light as possible, give the windows a good scrub and update yellowing lightbulbs to bright white.OutdoorsIs it time to rethink that huge sofa set and professional sized goal posts  When buying furniture, think small, light and foldable so that they can be stored away in a shed or cupboard or easily moved around. Updating your garden furniture doesnrsquot need to cost the earth, yoursquoll find some really great bargain sets in supermarkets like Aldi, Asda and Tesco and homeware stores like BM.Another way to make it feel bigger is to simply give it a good tidy.

Those who strongly disagreed rose from % in April to % in June.A signicant number of children reported a sedentary lestyle and having less energy during lockdown \"that may have longer term impacts on physical activity, health and wellbeing\", the study said.More than one in five did not agree they had plenty of energy while over one in four did not agree they got enough exercise with around three in four saying computer games were helpful during lockdown.And most children did not like the home-learning model during lockdown and struggled to engage with just over half agreeing they often felt bored.John Dickie, director of Child Poverty Action Group in Scotland said the analysis showed that ministers had to urgently act for the future well-being of the nations children.ldquoThis survey highlights just how vital it is that policy makers and service providers listen to the voices of children as schools reopen and Scotland builds toward social renewal. We know from our work that children in families struggling on low incomes faced particular challenges engaging with school during lockdown, and that maintaining mental health was a real concern.\"Its own survey of  parents and  young people found that % of those in low-income families were missing at least one essential resource to support their childrens learning.Mr Dickie added: \"We need to listen to their experience and ensure lessons are learned so that all families have the resources they need to ensure their children can fully re-engage at school, with friends and in their communities.\"We must act now to prevent a generation of childhoods being blighted by lack of resources and worries over money.The Childrens Parliament study found a fall in the proportion of children who reported that learning at home made them feel good - from % in April to just % in April.Meanwhile nearly one in three said exams were a worry, and % said in June they worried about doing school work.The Childrens Parliament said thatany model of home or blended learning is to be used in the coming months in Scotland, the experience of children revealed in the study shows \"there is much work to be done to improve what is offered and how children are supported\".It added: \"Likewise, as childrento school on a full-time basis, there is a need for educators to acknowledge the childs experiences and think about what this means for theirto school-based learning.\"\"The survey results should inform considerations being given to how we mitigate the immediate concerns there are for children as a result of lockdown, and also inform the medium to longer term road out of lockdown - what we might consider as a period of recovery.\"The Herald revealed concerns about the education of Scotlands children amongst parents in June, as analysis of the experiences of over  parents revealed two thirds of parents complained their school was not providing online lessons during the coronavirus lockdown.Organised by the National Parent Forum of Scotland, the poll found that some % reported that their school had not provided online lessons, either live or recorded, for children while confined to the house.The revelations emerging from a poll of the parents found the biggest challenge faced by parents when supporting learning from home was balancing work with supporting the children , motivating kids to learnand not having enough resources and or support from the school .NPFS chairman Joanna Murphy said there had been a \"real inconsistency\" over educational delivery between local authorities and that there would be no excuse over a lack of planning when childrento school.The new study targets the feelings of children directly, and aims to give a national lockdown picture on a range of areas from home le, to learning in lockdown, to mental and physical health, family and peer relationships.It emphasised the need to consider the impact of lockdown on  to  year old girls, in particular.The analysis said they were more likely to feel bored during lockdown, to feel lonely and to say that that there are a lot of things that they worry about in le and and their own health.The analysis also showed a \"statistically signicant\" drop in how much children enjoyed being with their families during lockdown. In April and May % said they did enjoy being with their their parents and siblings, while this had dipped to % in June.Paul Carberry, Action for Childrens director for Scotland, said: ldquoIt is clear this pandemic has triggered a crisis for mums, dads and children on an unprecedented scale and this study chimes with many of the accounts our frontline staff are hearing from families on a daily basis.ldquoAs we begin to take steps out of lockdown, huge numbers of children will need extra support, over the coming months, which we are actively playing our part in. Despite this many parents are telling us they donrsquot know where  to turn for other support. As the immediate health crisis passes we now need to turn our attention to the scars coronavirus has left on families struggling with a whole new reality.\"One in four of Scotlands children are recognised as living in poverty, and the Joseph Rowntree Foundation reported that almost a third of Scots incomes have reduced in lockdown, with half of affected renters worried about paying rent.The Childrens Parliament report said that children were not immune from understanding and worrying about the financial circumstances and pressures their families face.Across the three months over one in four reported that their parents carers worry about having enough money for their family, with younger children more likely to raise concern.There was also a statistically signicant decline in the proportion of children who said that while they were having a dficult time, they felt they would be okay, dropping from % in April to % in June.And nearly one in five reported a worry about not being able to play or be create, while around one in four did not agree that they think they make health choices in their le.The report noted: \"The quality of our relationships with others matters and as we emerge from lockdown and children can socialise again they take their lockdown experiences with them these need to be considered as we support children to re-engage with these important interpersonal relationships.Meanwhile a \"signicant number\" - over one in four - agreed that they felt lonely and there was a decline in the numbers of children who reported having \"fun things to do in their days\".And across the lockdown period children were less likely to \"try their hardest\" or feel pride in what they do.But there remained personal confidence across all children that they knew they were things they were good at, with over % agreeing.Although on the decline, around % agreed that they were proud of the things they can do.The Childrens Parliament was established in  to support the Scottish Government, local authorities and other public bodies to fulfill their legal obligations to promote and protect the human rights of everyone and fulfill their duty of care toward children.A Scottish Government spokesmanssaid: ldquoWe know lockdown is putting a strain on the mental health and wellbeing of many children and young people and have been working closely with all health boards to maintain the integrity and quality of Childrenrsquos Adolescent and Mental Health Servicesservices across Scotland throughout the COVID- pandemic. We have also provided pound million of new funding to local authorities to support the planning and development of new community mental health and wellbeing services for - year olds, their families and carers.ldquoAs children and young peopleto school, wellbeing should be at the centre of considerations and we have been working to encourage children to stay active for the physical and mental health benefits that brings.ldquoWe have provided pound. million of additional funding to create new online support services and increase the capacity of existing ones including resources on mental health and wellbeing available on Young Scotrsquos website and social media, the digital resource Mind Yer Timeby Scottish Youth Parliament and Childrenrsquos Parliament and content around mental health on Parent Club including free access to Solihull Online for parents and carers."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/11703102.jpg?type=article-full","title":"flying-school-scone-aerodromes-rich-history-no-flight-fancy","story":"Now, nearly  years on, the school at Scone Aerodrome, near Perthrsquos ldquoAir University is still training pilots and aeronautical engineers from across the globe at its hi-tech surroundings.The airport opened in  as Scone Aerodrome and Airwork Ltd established an RAF flight training school.In the Second World War, RAF squadronrsquos  and  were based at the airport. After the war, Airwork purchased the airport from the local council and undertook civilian pilot training.But it was  when it really took off after Airwork acquired Air Service Trainingand relocated it from the south of England to Perth.AST quickly gained a worldwide reputation for aircraft engineering and aviation training, with thousands of students from over  countries being trained at Perth Airport.AST senior business manager Bob Sutherland said: ldquoAir Service Training , more commonly known as AST, has been providing aircraft engineering training to the worldrsquos airlines, maintenance organisations and military formations for almost  years. In this time it has developed a reputation for innovative, effective and high-quality training strategies to meet industry needs.ldquoAST is EASA Part -approved to offer courses and examinations to meet the requirements of the Part  aircraft maintenance licence in most A and B categories, which includes piston and turbine aeroplanes, turbine helicopters, and avionics.AST had its roots in the Aeronautical Engineering College, founded by John Davenport Siddeley in , at Hamble Aerodrome in Hampshire.Siddeley was born in Cheshire in  and was a pioneer of the UK motor industry, manufacturing aero-engines and motor vehicles.But he decided there was a need for a better-equipped aeronautical school, where the RAF could offload its foreign pupils to receive civilian training.AST was formally opened by HRH The Duke of Gloucester on June ,  and he gave it the unofficial title of ldquoBritainrsquos Air University. Siddeley was knighted the following year.Initially, the courses offered at AST were aimed at pilots who had completed some basic training which included advanced piloting and blind flying courses.AST also developed a basic ground training device, an early flight simulator.The first woman to undergo flying training with AST was the legendary Mrs Victor Bruce who, in , went on to become the first woman to fly around the world alone, although she crossed the oceans on ships. Another famous student of AST was Amy Johnson, who completed the blind flying course in  and went onto become the first woman to fly solo from London to Australia.ASTrsquos expertise was valuable in the war effort, as it carried out many duties, including repairing spitfires and training over , RAF and allied personal in flying, aeronautical engineering and airfield control.It continued to grow after it moved to Perth in the s and trained students from airlines, including Aer Lingus, British United Airways, and Cambrian Airways.It also became involved on the big screen when AST instructor Captain Cyril Sweetman piloted the AST Hiller C helicopter used in the film From Russia with Love, chasing James Bond across the Scottish countryside.By the mid-s, AST claimed to be the largest civil aviation training organisation in the world.But in  it stopped training pilots for global economic reasons and the decision of the Civil Aviation Authorityto approve overseas flying schools which could offer training at a lower price.:Anger from Glasgow residents as military plane performs figure of eights above city in early hoursThe engineering school became a subsidiary of Perth College, University of the Highlands and Islandsthat year. AST continued to increase its aircraft resources including purchasing a Jetstream aircraft from Cranfield University.The existing hanger was not large enough for what was required so a larger hanger was leased from Perth Airport and a ceremony was held in November  with the then-Cabinet Secretary for Education and Lelong Learning, Fiona Hyslop MSP, officially opening the new hanger.Bob Sutherland added: ldquoWith a turnover of around pound million and a staff base of  personnel, AST and its students contribute enormously to the local community in terms of employment creation through spending on local goods and services.ldquoIt also takes part in school fairs, open days and is active in the Perth and Kinross aero clubs and STEM organisations, sharing knowledge withyoung people in the community. AST is a glowing example of a SME contributing not only to its local community but to the wider aviation environment, acting as advocates for safe air travel around the globe.AST also resumed flight training in  in collaboration with ACS Aviation which is also based at Perth Airport.In , AST was awarded the Queenrsquos Award for Enterprise in the category of international trade. It offers a wide range of training courses from foundation courses and approved courses to become a licensed engineer.:Last flypast for former flight training school For sale sign at Scone aerodromeIt also offers degrees in aircraft maintenance engineering and aircraft engineering in partnership with UHI. Training takes part at both Perth Airport and UHI at Perth College.Perth Airport also changed hands s when it was purchased by the Morris Leslie Group in . While there are no commercial flights operating from the airport, it is Scotlandrsquos main airport for general aviation.As well as AST, there are other organisations which operate from the airport, including the Scottish Aero Club which was established in  near Glasgow and relocated to Perth Airport in  ndash it is Scotlandrsquos largest flying club.Meanwhile, ACS Flight Training was formed in  and offers flight training courses.Alba Airsports offers training in gyro and microlight flying."},{"url":null,"title":"prince-charles-ordered-tailors-stop-making-jacket-finding-buttons-werent-scotland","story":"And now it can be revealed that Prince Charles really does give more than two buttons about supporting the countryrsquos craftspeople.For he has insisted that even the tiniest part of his iconic Scottish attire must be home-sourced ndash after the heir to the throne rejected stag horn buttons from Austria for his kilt jacket and matching waistcoat.Instead, they had to be Scottish, he said.After a hunt, John Sugden, owner of Campbellrsquos of Beauly ndash which made the striking attire ndash managed to find good Scottish stag buttons to sow on to the stunning khaki green, faint houndstooth pattern tweed, which has an orange window pane check.ldquoThe prince had chosen the tweed himself. It just happened by chance to be the cloth on my fatherrsquos old briefcase and the prince said lsquothatrsquos just what Irsquom looking for,rsquo said Sugden, who has just been announced as a textiles programme ambassador for The Princersquos Foundation.ldquoThe majority of stag horn buttons come from Austria. The prince is very open and both fastidious and passionate about craft. So he insisted that the buttons had to be Scottish stag horn. He does care about the detail. It really matters to him that he promotes British craftsndash even with the smallest of things.ldquoWe were actually both a little concerned that it would be the Austrian buttons that went on the jacket because we couldnrsquot find an alternative at the time. But the princersquos fastidious nature drove us to look into sourcing Highland stag and we went to great s to do so. Now we have a gamekeeper who makes them for us.ldquoWhy do we have to ship stag horn buttons from Austria at all that extra cost  It does not make sense. It also fits in with the princersquos philosophy about carbon footprint with the distance goods unnecessarily travel to market.The cost of the jacket and waistcoat has not been revealed, but a similar bespoke pair of the garments made by Campbellrsquos retails at around pound,.Sugden said the princersquos insistence on Scottish stag horn buttons was one important example of why it was important to promote British crafts.Through his role as an ambassador, he will use his expertise of working in the textiles industry to support the princersquos charity in its vision, mission and strategy.He is also co-chair with Patrick Grant ndash from the BBCrsquos The Great British Sewing Bee ndash of the Dumfries House textiles school in Ayrshire.The Princersquos Foundationrsquos Future Textiles programme aims to address a skills gap within the UK textiles industry by offering practical workshops and advanced training courses to school pupils, teachers and those looking to gain employment in the industry. Many of these courses are delivered in the estatersquos textile training entre, located in the old sawmill at Dumfries House where the foundation is based.Programmes range from one-day workshops for school pupils to in-depth training programmes producing garments for the luxury fashion market. Supporters of the programme including major retailers and brands such as Yoox, Net-a-Porter, Alexander McQueen and Christopher Kane.Campbellrsquos, which holds a royal warrant from the Queen, also supplies the RoyalHousehold and makes all the tweed outfits for Balmoral Estate.Over the years, the company has also supplied the Queen Mother and the Duke of Windsor. Sugden is too discreet to name other famous clients but admitted: ldquoI often see our clothes being worn by people gracing the pages of Hello, Country Le, and Harperrsquos Bazaar.ldquoI saw the movement towards craft coming. I try to push and promote British-made products. We use British cloth every time we can. We have some of the finest fabrics in the world. Fast fashion will have a downward spiral.Sugden has worked with the prince for five years. ldquoI have always had a passion for clothing and for making things in Britain ndash and so does the prince, he said.People are starting to care more about provenance. But I was struck by the lack of skills in the industry that were in danger of dying out and that it was imperative to build them up.ldquoThe problem is not really in design ndash lots of people want to be designers ndash but there is a worrying age gap in making things in such skills as cutting, tailoring and working as seamstresses. If the demand is coming back we need to make young people feel valued in the industry again.ldquoWe need people to work on the shop floor of the mills again ndash it is not like the days of Jerusalem and dark satanic mills. They are modern working spaces. A weaving job is a skilled job. We all canrsquot be designers. We have to enthuse people to be involved in the whole process. Even the skills to darn socks are being lost.Sugden recognised that the fashion industry had to do more to cut down on its environmental damage from such things as microfibres polluting the ocean.He said: ldquoWe need to drive down the use of plastic in the industry. I know its a great passion of his highness as well to get its usage down. Itrsquos a huge challenge for the fashion industry, but in the UK we are specialists in natural fibres. I would rather buy natural fibres ndash why do we need polyester  Itrsquos just the price. You have to change the psyche of young people.ldquoWhat the prince is doing at Dumfries House is amazing and leading the way in saving our traditional crafts. It is offering youngsters the opportunity and pathway to be part of the future of Britainrsquos textile industry. Without his initiative and raising awareness there is a real danger we could lose these old skills.It is not the first time the prince has publicly backed buying British. During a visit in  to the Isle of Harris distillery in the Outer Hebrides, Charles, known as Lord of the Isles, asked why its pound gin drinking glasses were made in Poland.The Isle of Harris distilleryrsquos gin is contained in distinctive bottles made in Yorkshire by specialist manufacturer Stolzle Glass Group. ldquoThey couldnrsquot do both  asked the prince. It was explained to the prince that they could not.Polish-born Peter Kwasniewski, the Tarbert-based distilleryrsquos shop manager, said afterwards:We tried in the UK to find a handmade glass that could match the pattern of our bottles. But we couldnrsquot find anybody. We also tried in France but with the same result. I knew of a manufacture in southern Poland who were able to do it."},{"url":null,"title":"https:wwworcadiancouk  \n","story":"August ,  at : amADVERTORIAL: For more information go to mygov.scot shielding copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

This will require the Scottish Government to invest in lower emission modes of transport, including more fuel efficient ferries.“Orkney’s internal ferry service is a perfect example.

It brings together erse partners to develop the tools, processes and business models that mean rural and poorly connected communities can rapidly establish next generation and G connectivity for local benefit.Currently, only  per cent of the UK is being served by all four UK mobile network operators and there are still , homes and businesses that don’t receive adequate broadband service as investment predominantly focuses on areas with higher population density.To date, mobile connectivity in the UK has relied on mobile network operators to purchase exclusive licences for access to spectrum and they design, build, own, and operate their own networks.  In , Ofcom changed its policy on spectrum sharing to develop a more open and accessible spectrum market one that acts as a  for innovation, reducing the cost of access to high-quality spectrum in regional areas and opening opportunities for new endeavours to address rural connectivity.G New Thinking will help by providing a practical how-to guide for rural communities looking to capitalise on this opportunity and invest in local connectivity. By developing this replicable and flexible approach, the project aims to help poorly connected communities build commercially sustainable, next generation networks using G technologies.By making this guidance widely available, G New Thinking also aims to stimulate local investment in rural connectivity across the country, to close the rural digital ide. All of this is built on the learnings from trials undertaken as part of G RuralFirst, a Cisco-led DCMS G Trials and Testbed programme.Chief Executive, Cisco UK  Ireland, David Meads, said: “Our findings with G RuralFirst revealed that over a ten-year period, the UK’s rural economy could grow by an additional £ bngood quality G services were accessible.“We believe that by taking advantage of neutral hosting technologies, fixed wireless access and spectrum sharing, we will be able to allow third parties – including local businesses and communities – to build and own radio infrastructure, as well as work with mobile network operators to reduce costs and make rural coverage commercially sustainable.”Minister for Digital Infrastructure, Matt Warman, said: #We are making sure the UK#s rural communities aren’t left behind in the digital age and are investing record amounts to improve connectivity in the least connected parts of the country.“G New Thinking is part of our £ million programme to help the countryside capitalise on new ways of using next generation G technology and I look forward to seeing how rural communities will benefit.#The project is expected to go live later in  and to conclude in .copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

DaoineNow there is much within the machinations that occupy the precious time of our Comhairle officers that could well be regarded as relatively ‘trivial’, although I will fully concede that even the most improbable deliberations might well form the centre of somebody’s entire universe.But when we, as a community, or section of that community, continue to press for answers and resolutions to a subject that has already been explained fully to us, then we should ask ourselves one important question: “Are we doing this for the greater good, or because we are trying to promote our own agenda ”. about some of the material that was included in the Scottish Government’s RSHPguidelines and how I felt that some of it was completely over the top for inclusion in any classroom.Several concerned parents had written to me, asking what on earth was going on.I enquired of both the Director and Chair of Education and Children’s Services as to the validity of these concerns.I was happy to note that the ‘plot’ wasn’t as sinister as had been portrayed by some ‘concerned’ groups both within the counciland on anti-social media.Some alleged that the Comhairle were somehow, through the back-door and under the cover of the Covid- crisis , trying to sneak through an agenda which went against the “moral values of this community”.An inflammatory accusation, one that was sure to ignite passions and ring yet another Pavlovian bell.Except that, far from being subject matter that was about to get rammed down our children’s throats, not just ‘promoted’ it was simply an extreme example of what was included for reference, should anyone wish to avail themselves of it.Yes, some of it was fairly graphic stuff and, as I’ve said before, I was hugely alarmed that it was even considered for anything to be found in our classrooms.But, as is the case with material which has been taught in our schools for at least a couple of centuries the devil is in the detail .Luckily we have seen teachers, historically, opt to use the message of love, forgiveness, compassion and mutual understanding from this particular tome ignoring the more sinister aspects where death, retribution, punishment and all kinds of nastiness are very much front and centre.Choosing your testaments wisely is what this is primarily about.We are lucky to have an educational framework where common sense prevails, otherwise there could be very many distractions in the subjects of Biology, Geology and quite possibly Physics.I attempted to be amusing about a topic which has very legitimate, obvious, and serious, implications for our most impressionableyoung people.I hoped I was taking a cue from people who think that a banana dipped into a jar of Nutella is a suitable metaphor for something.Possibly the obesity crisis I think a jar of Bovril might have been funnier.If people wish to identy as a Unicorn and have sex with the pavement, then that’s fine too, but not surely for inclusion in ‘guidance’ material.Yes, I have to admit that I also jumped onto the bandwagon, until I had the situation clearly explained to me and was told to trust the teacher’.They will be given the ultimate discretion and they know best what’s appropriate for their young audience.We do ‘much ado’ well here.When ‘Ironside’ and ‘Bob the Budget Builder’ steered the Comhairle and helped many local businesses through the worst of the effects of the ongoing pandemic, we turned inward and focused on upholstery.With Bernie, Angus and the Education Department, all under immense pressure to get a hugely problematic school year underway on time, we are more focused on what won’tbe getting taught, rather than what will, and how.Andour kids come home from school with a penchant for strange combinations of fruit and nut sandwiches, then it will have been discussed with the Head Teacher and Parent Council first.A lot of the contentious issues which occupy us here in the Western Islesare perceived to exist somewhere between a conservative, culturally protective, radically Christian, ‘right’, and a somewhat more progressive, more liberal, secular, bunch of left-wing snowflakes.Most of us are somewhere, far more certainly and squarely, in the middle trying to make sense of it all.If we cannot empower and trust our teachers to do what’s best for the most vulnerable amongst us, then we will have failed both.The man of the week, last week, certainly in the northern half of this county, was the irrepressible David Black.Three rounds crammed into  hours saw him claim the Thompson Bruce Trophy at Stornoway and take an early lead in Scarista’s  ‘Blue-Riband’ event.Rounds of +  around Lady Lever Park on Friday and Saturday saw him edge out Eddie Rogers,  +  by just a single shot over  holes.A further shot adrt saw Murdo ‘Griddy’ MacLeod,  +  in third slot.Iain ‘Juke Box’ MacKay won the handicap trophy with two excellent rounds of nett  for a  total.In between his Thompson Bruce exploits, Davie also posted the leading score in the, two-round, Harris G.C. Club Championship.His  was  shots ahead of nearest challengers, Billy Fraser and Cal Robertson, both on .Starting with six straight pars, he succumbed to bogies at the ‘amen’ of corners, the deadly-deceiving brace of par-s at   .Naturally he bounced straight back birdies at the new th, and the th brought him back to level.He swapped a birdie for a bogey at  and  to see him home safely.Only a sht in plate tectonics will see him throw away this lead.Midweek at Stornoway saw the Glennie Trophy claimed by Iain Moir on  Stableford Points. Starting his opening four holes, five-over par, couldn’t have been good for his confidence.He was just one-over for the next .In the Junior section, Calum Gbounced back from his recent humblings at the hands of brother, Geordie H in the Par Bogey competition.Six ahead of the course, he demolished the rest of the field by  clear shots.In the Scarista midweek competition, Billy Fraser kept up his, season-long, decent form, partnering Chris Sutton to a fine win in the Pairs Greensomes.Their  was two ahead of Russell Tennant and Alan Gunn’s, .Benbecula’s finest continue to battle it out for their season-long Order of Merit, Dami Steele ing a semblance of normality, bouncing back from a week out of the top spots to consolidate his lead at the top.His round wasn’t, however, good enough to claim the full points last Tuesday evening, Domhnall MacKay storming to a -pointer and the maximum Point haul.Apparently Donald has been keeping his powderdry and intends, after a decent sabbatical, to make a strong charge over the coming weeks."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/TOURISM-2-copy.jpg","title":"litir do luchd ionnsachaidh","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine.’.

These have been in the following council areas: Antrim and Newtownabbey Borough Council , Ards and North Down Borough Council , Armagh City, Banbridge and Craigavon Borough Council , Causeway Coast and Glens Borough Council , Mid and East Antrim Borough Council , and Newry, Mourne and Down District Council .In addition, there have been  clusters across Northern Ireland with fewer than five people.These figures are up to pm on th August . Cases in a smaller cluster may also be associated with a larger cluster, for example a common geographic location or common social setting.The PHA will be publishing cluster data on a weekly basis each Thursday until further notice.A cluster is currently defined as two or more laboratory-confirmed cases of COVID- among iniduals associated with a key setting, with illness onset dates within a  day period.Key settings which have seen clusters to date since May include workplaces, retail or hospitality premises, domestic gatherings, and sporting settings. COVID- transmission risk is highest in a household setting, and it is to be anticipated that a signicant number of linked cases within households will be identied by efficient contact tracing. It is for this reason that household-linked cases are not reported as clusters.The PHA’s Contact Tracing Servicecontinues to engage successfully with the vast majority of identied contacts and provide appropriate advice to help prevent any onward spread.Over the week up to pm on th August , the number of positive tests reported to the CTS was  – the number of positive cases requiring contact tracing was . There were  positive cases that completed contact tracing, and  contacts identied. There were  contacts successfully contacted and advised. [see Notes to Editors for further explanation of these figures]Since July, the average number of close contacts linked to cases has more than doubled. The rise may be attributed to the gradual easing of lockdown measures, but may also be explained by relaxing of attitudes to social distancing.Dr Gerry Waldron, Head of Health Protection at the PHA, said: “Cases are occurring in communities across Northern Ireland. This is an important reminder that we must not become complacent – coronavirus remains in circulation, so each of us has a responsibility to take steps to help keep ourselves and those around us safe.“Maintain social distancing, wash your hands regularly, and get testedyou display any symptoms of coronavirus. You can also download the StopCOVID NI contact tracing app.“This disease has the potential to make its presence felt in any community, as we have seen with clusters appearing across a number of council districts.“Everyone should act on the basis that it might potentially be in your neighbourhood right now, rather than waiting for it to emerge in your local area or for rumours to circulate before taking steps to help protect yourself and others. That’s why following the public health advice remains vitally important. You can spread the virus evenyou dont have symptoms, so taking these steps and exercising good hygiene practices will help prevent cases and reduce the number of clusters.Our analysis of clusters to date has shown that they have been associated with both workplaces and in the community, such as domestic gatherings and in hospitality and sporting settings.“Clusters are managed through the contact tracing programme, and where we need to advise or inform the public of any increased risk to public health we will do so in a timely manner.Dr Waldron added: “Speculation around current clusters of COVID- across Northern Ireland is not helpful.“We will not be commenting on inidual cases of COVID- or going into the detail of every incident that emerges, as this could lead to people being identied, create stigma and focus attention on iniduals, families or groups, and therefore deter others with symptoms coming forward to be tested.”Everyone with symptoms of coronavirus can book a free test. If anyone is concerned that they are experiencing any of the symptoms of coronavirus, they must self-isolate and arrange a test as soon as possible. For further information on the virus, its symptoms and how to book a test, visit www.pha.site coronavirusWe must be aware that COVID- is still a threat and we need everyone to play their part in helping to stop the virus spreading.If you receive a positive test result you will be contacted by the PHA’s Contact Tracing Service from .Members of the public are also encouraged to download the StopCOVID NI contact tracing app on Android or Apple, which complements the work of the Contact Tracing Service.

Three Northern Ireland school principals on the controversy surrounding a covid-hit results day.Amanda McNamee, principal of Lagan College: #We#re dismayed to see our young people unsure of future pathways#Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseAmanda McNamee FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappAmanda McNameeThis year, our school community, like all others, has experienced unprecedented levels of change and disruption since March , but throughout the Covid- pandemic, we have been extremely proud of how our Sixth Form students have coped with the situation that the education system found itself in.Students had their learning disrupted, were denied the opportunity to sit examinations and experienced serious uncertainty about their future, but throughout it all they held an unwavering confidence that their teachers, who knew their learning best, would not let them down.As a centre of learning, Lagan College agrees that statistical modelling has its place in a normal given year.However, we believe more passionately that a teacher#s knowledge of their student#s learning, continuous assessment and potential supersedes this and this has been anything but a normal school year.So, our school community feels extremely disheartened and disappointed that some of our students believe that the education system has let them down.This year, we have recorded a signicant disparity between teacher centre assessed gradesand the final grades awarded by the Northern Ireland examination board.Some % of all A-level grades awarded were reduced, % of AS-level grades awarded were reduced.Unfortunately, until we receive more information and transparency about the awarding process used for an inidual learner, we do not feel confident that grades awarded to every student were a fair reflection of their work to date and potentialthey had been able to sit examinations.We were dismayed to see some of our students upset and disarmed yesterday and uncertain of their onward pathways. However, teachers were on hand to reassure our young people and their families that all of this was simply beyond their control.Let#s now all redouble our efforts in the education system to reflect upon yesterday#s events and ensure that the wellbeing of our young people is not unnecessarily and further impacted upon this year.Alan Hutchinson, principal of Glastry College, Newtownards: #Students# hopes dashed by farce and systemic discrimination#Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseAlan Hutchinson FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappAlan HutchinsonYesterday Glastry College students arrived to collect results full of hope for their future many excited about fulfilling their dreams by accessing higher education courses that will shape their lives and the lives of their families for decades to come. Instead, they were graced with what, at best, can be described as a farce and at worst systemic discrimination.At A-level % of our candidates were downgraded in at least one subject, while % of all Centre Assessed Grades were adjusted downwards.The statistical modelling used by CCEA appears to have taken no account of any work completed, or progress made by students in the seven months they studied during this academic year up until lockdown.Over the last five years our internal tracking data has indicated that we have predicted the overall A-level outcome for students to within -% either way.However, based upon the grades awarded by the examining body this year, our predictions appear to be out by an incredulous %!The question arises, do we trust and value the expert judgment of teaching professionals who have many years# experience, know the students as iniduals and have access to multiple sources of reliable assessment and tracking data, or data scientists who are more interested in decidedly limited and dubious data than the devastation caused to students, parents and teachers Statistics aside, we are dealing here with young people, with human beings, all of whom have hopes and aspirations, many of which are now dashed on a system they were promised would not disadvantage them.Moreover, the policy to go into lockdown appears to have dealt a signicant blow to those deemed to be least in need of the protection afforded by it.On top of this, we must acknowledge the trauma this cohort of pupils has already suffered.The opportunity to showcase their ability, skills, and knowledge acquired and developed over the last seven years was stolen.Their school career abruptly ended with no time for farewells or celebrations.Further anxiety was added by the enforced separation from their peers due to lockdown.Now, instead of aiding and supporting these pupils, CCEA has compounded this emotional distress, predominantly it seems, in non-selective schools by permitting what is nothing short of an incongruous travesty.I sincerely hope that immediate and rectying action is taken in the interests of all the young people unjustly penalised this year by a very flawed system.Gary Kelly, principal of St Kevin#s College, Lisnaskea: #My excitement turned to upset when I saw the pupils# grades#Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseGary Kelly FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappGary KellyWith over  years of teaching experience and  years as principal, yesterday was one of the most upsetting results days I have experienced.After arriving in school on Wednesday excited about downloading the A-level results, this quickly turned to upset when I had seen how many pupils# grades were marked down at A-level.I was expecting, as St Kevin#s College was ranked as the highest performing non-selective school in  and second highest non-selective school in , that this year#s A-level results would follow the student cohort pattern from when these pupils were doing GCSEs one or two years ago. But no - approximately % of Year  A-level pupils had A-levels downgraded with the CCEA exam board. The picture with other exam boards was better than this, down slightly.It was with a heavy heart that I awoke this morning to release grades and speak to pupils and parents.Normally I take delight chatting with pupils and parents on results day and congratulating them, but not this year.I was consoling them and offering a shoulder to cry on and a possible hope of an appeal to help their well-being and mental health, with the knowledge that this could take weeks and months to sort out -ever.In all my years as principal I have never had to deal with so many upset pupils and parents as this year.I understand this is a very dficult process to estimate A-level and GCSE grades with the Covid- outbreak.But why ask teachers to spend days and weeks examining past pupil work, holding standardisation meetings online and socially distanced in school, and entering marks for the majority of the teacher predictions to be downgraded as we did in our school and most schools across Northern Ireland It is not all doom and gloom - the vast majority of our pupils have got their first preference course at university, which is good, our three A*-C pass rate is up on last year.But what we have discovered is that it is the high performing pupils# grades that have been downgraded most and that Northern Ireland CCEA exams have been downgraded more than any English exam board.Pupils are saying you know me Sir or Miss - I am much better than these grades. Look at my exams in school, my coursework, my GCSE results.They say: I might have got into university but I have to carry these results for the rest of my le and put them down on every application form I write - what does this say about me. I have had lots of parents and pupils in tears today - normally we get four to five appeals on a normal exam result day. This year it#s more like  to .I don#t often complain, but when there is such an injustice, I feel we must speak out for our young people both hear and across the whole of Northern Ireland.

teachers’ prediction.The SDLP is seeking the support of other MLAs to secure the  signatures required to force the recall of the Assembly from summer recess.The education committee did sit during recess to question Mr Weir on Friday.During the y hearing, chairman Chris Lyttle urged the minister to intervene and ensure pupils were awarded A-level grades based on either their AS-level attainment or the estimated grade assessed by their teacher.“These are unprecedented times,” said the Alliance MLA.Mr Lyttle said he was aware of a school that had seen its A*-C attainment rate fall from % last year to % under the calculation model.He said the minister was “increasingly isolated” in refusing to use the teacher assessments to allocate the grades.Mr Weir responded by insisting thatteacher predictions were used without standardisation, the results would not have “any level of credibility” because the results would be so much higher than those achieved in previous years.He said that approach would also be unfair on pupils, as some teachers would have been “generous” in estimating grades while others had been “tough” on their students.“There would be no equality whatsoever,” said

acknowledged that the system for calculating A-level results “did not work for everyone”.He said there was no way of creating a perfect replacement for sitting the exams which were cancelled as a result of the coronavirus pandemic.“We were looking to create what was a least-worst solution,” said the minister.Mr Weir highlighted that a fast-tracked appeals process has been established for those students who believe they have been treated unfairly.The standardisation model was developed by Northern Ireland exam body the Council for the Curriculum, Examinations and Assessment .CCEA asked teachers to give a predicted grade for their pupils and then rank them in order within their class.The exams body then used other data to standardise the results.For A-levels, the data included pupils’ AS-level results, making adjustments for those who had applied to take resits.For AS results, the pupils’ GCSE results were also used, as was the performance by their school over the previous three years.Today, SDLP have tabled a petition to recall the Assembly, to urgently address the crisis over exam grading. Many students across Northern Ireland feel robbed of a fair chance. It is not good enough.The Minister for Education and Joint First Ministers must be held to account. pic qsiKOSGK— Social Democratic and Labour PartyAugust , Daniel McCrossan, whose SDLP has urged the Assembly recall, branded the situation a “debacle”.He expressed concern about the mental health impact on children, revealing that a GP had contacted him to alert him that three pupils who had missed out on university places had presented with suicidal thoughts.“This model failed, it failed our children and it failed our young people,” he told the minister.He added: “As the result of this pandemic, they should not pay the price.”Mr McCrossan demanded more transparency on the algorithm used to calculate the grades.In regard to the algorithm, Mr McCrossan said there was a need to “mark the minister’s homework”.Mr Weir said he would make information on the formula public, though he stressed some of it would be technical data.He rejected calls for an independent review of CCEA’s actions.“I think CCEA processes were sound,” he said.“I don’t intend at this stage to have an independent review.”\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland f .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_aac-ac--a-ebcf_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland f .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_aac-ac--a-ebcf_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland f .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_aac-ac--a-ebcf_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland f .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_aac-ac--a-ebcf_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland f .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_aac-ac--a-ebcf_embedded w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeClose\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland f .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_aac-ac--a-ebcf_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland f .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_aac-ac--a-ebcf_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland f .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_aac-ac--a-ebcf_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland f .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_aac-ac--a-ebcf_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland f .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_aac-ac--a-ebcf_embedded w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"CCEA chief excutive Justin Edwards gives evidence to the education committee  FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappCCEA chief excutive Justin Edwards gives evidence to the education committee  Chief executive of CCEA Justin Edwards also faced questions at the committee.He defended the model used, insisting a range of academics and other experts were involved in its development.Mr Edwards stressed the limited time his organisation had to deliver on the minister’s key objectives – to produce a set of results for the  cohort and to ensure standards were in line with previous years.“People have worked inordinate hours in my organisation to deliver a solution,” he said.Mr Edwards added: “I’ve always cited that the best solution was examinations and it was not available to us.“And,it was not available to us, then this alternative approach was the next best operation.”He claimed no better solution had been presented.“If there was a viable alternative to this situation, then let it be brought forward,” he said.PAMost ReadYellow Vests and anti-fascists in Belfast city centre stand-offHugh McWilliams, millionaire Derry businessman, killed in car crashCoronavirus Northern Ireland:  new cases as fundraiser in memory of Andreea Maftei raises thousandsCarl Frampton set for world title fight after easing past Darren Traynor while Michael Conlan stops Sofiane Takoucht despite points deductionsMapping coronavirus in Northern Ireland: Confirmed cases in your council area,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The new centre will be moved a short distance to Anderson House at Altnagelvin. Derry was the first city to set-up a COVID centre back on March  at the out-of-hours Western Urgent Care building. The other Covid centre in the Western Trust area opened at South West Acute Hospital on March . The Trust continues to maintain a state of readiness for admissions of patients with suspected Covid- and a further surge. Speaking at the Western Trust’s monthly board meeting, Dr Anne Kilgallen, Chief Executive, said: “Both centres continue to operate, preparing for a potential second surge. googletag.cmd.push “The Altnagelvin centre will move to Anderson and South West centre will reduce its footprint to free up space in the outpatient department. “Movements are allowing us to recommence our outpatient services.” Antibody testing has been offered in the Trust area as of July , she told the Western Trust board. These tests are used to detect antibodies to the COVID- virus to seeyou have previously had the virus. The test works by taking a blood sample and testing for the presence of antibodies to seeyou have developed an immune response to the virus. A total of  tests were carried out and only  ed as positive, which Dr Kilgallen described as an ‘interesting find’. googletag.cmd.push A Covid swab testing service available to staff, patients pre-operatively and staff in the independent sector continues to operate at C-TRIC at Altnagelvin Hospital and Lackaboy in Enniskillen. However, those services are also relocating in August as part of reset plans. The latest NISRA statistics show that  people have died of Covid- in Derry City and Strabane. In the council area there have been  confirmed coronavirus cases –  in the last  days. In response to the Coronavirus pandemic a network of new Primary CareCovid- centres were then rapidly established to manage the growth of Coronavirus cases in the community. They were seen as an essential part of the fight against this virus.  To ensure vital GP services can be maintained, it is believed to be absolutely critical that those who show symptoms are separated from the patients with nonCovid- related conditions.  These centres are not testing facilities and are only for patients who are very unwell, are suspected of havingCovid- and require medical attention.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

This is unacceptable, has reducedthe future options for many school leavers and caused immense distress. Teachers’ assessments should have been trusted much more than they have been. Education minister Peter Weir must intervene and do so urgently.”SDLP Education Spokesperson Daniel McCrossan MLA also expressed his concern and disappointmentat reports from young people that their grades were unfair and inaccurate. He has urged Minister Weir to ensure a robust appeals process is in place.The West Tyrone MLA added:“This is a highly stressful time for pupils across the North and their families. The failure of CCEA to remove the contentiousstandardisation from the grading process and the subsequent failure of the Education Minister to act has compounded that stress. It is not good enough.“The SDLP first raised these issues with CCEA and the Department of Education many months ago. They have been aware of these issues since April and utterly failed to act, at the expense of our young people.It is unacceptable and frankly disgraceful that our children have been left subject to a postcode lottery in relation to their exam results.This is about the future of our children and there can beno room for inequalityor unfairness.“The grading systemsusedmust not be allowed to disadvantagehigh-achieving pupils fromareas of deprivation.Standardisation cannot be allowed to become a euphemism for discrimination against working class children - even unintentionally.It is a crude and ineffective tool and has no place in a modern, fair education system.“It is clear the Minister should never have let this situation escalate and thestandardisationtool should have been put in the bin many months ago. However, Minister Weir must now act urgently to ensure the appeals process is robust and allows young people the opportunity to challenge grades they are deeply disappointed with.“The Minister must also compel CCEA to publish themodelling and calculation process used to determine grades this year, to allow young people all the information they need to seetheir grade is fair, accurate and reflective of their ability.“I want toapologiseto school children right across the North, particularly those getting A-Level grades today and GCSE grades next week. You have been put in an intolerably dficult position and I am sorry thatthis failure was allowed to happen.This is not your fault and we have got your back.“The SDLP will continue to fight for grades to be restored, based onteachersjudgement, and without the crude bias of thestandardisationstool.” googletag.cmd.push  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Entering the school foyer you’re struck that John Hume sits alongside illustrious company in what must have been a golden age of thinkers and creators. A bust made in the Derry man’s honour rests between two gentlemen who excelled in their own fields in Seamus Heaney and Brian Friel.  Each of these men attended the former Bishop Street school around the same time and went on to become giants in their respective disciplines. googletag.cmd.push John Hume’s own journey at the college began in  . “He told his mother he was going to the College and she said, ‘no you’re not, we can’t afford that’, but he passed his Eleven Plus and got in,” current principal Finbar Madden said. Hume was part of the first generation to avail of opportunities through the introduction of the Eleven Plus. It allowed more young people to continue their post-primary education which may go some way to explaining why men like Hume, Friel and Heaney grasped the opportunity with both hands. There was obviously ‘huge talent and ability’, Mr Madden said, as Hume left the school with a scholarship to study at university. googletag.cmd.push He had ambitions of joining the priesthood at the leading Catholic Seminary in Ireland, St Patrick’s College, Maynooth. Hume didn’t complete his clerical studies but instead opted to serve his community in another way. He graduated from the National University of Ireland in  with a bachelor’s degree in French and history and went on to receive a master’s degree. Returning to Derry, Hume would became a teacher at St. Columb’s. Mr Madden said that career lasted from -. At the time, the history curriculum was limited in schools and Hume taught the subject in a broader sense, keen to instil his vision of Ireland’s place in Europe. As he departed, transitioning into a career in politics, some of the key developments in the civil rights movement were starting to unfold. That, however, wasn’t the end of his journey with the school and his legacy endures. The colleges former pupils association present an annual award - the Alumnus Illustrissimus Award - to a past-pupil who has achieved something of major signicance or has made a considerable contribution in his own field. In , the Most Reverend Dr Edward Daly received the inaugural award and the following year John Hume would be recognised for his contribution to politics and peace in Northern Ireland. Mr Madden said: “The school is able to boast of many exceptional students who went out and made their mark locally, nationally and internationally. “The award recognises achievement whatever the field may be sport, science politics, religion and so on.” A proud College boy, Hume maintained connections over the years and wouldfor prize giving ceremonies. “He presented a facsimile of his Nobel prize to the school,” Mr Madden pointed out next to the assembly hall, “and our politics A-level prize is the John Hume prize in government and politics.” “And for as long as he could, he would come every year to prize-giving, he usually turned up unannounced but we always expected him to come, until unfortunately he wasn’t able to. “He had a very, very clear sense of his connectedness with this school and he never lost that right throughout his le. “In a way that many others weren’t able to do, by his connectedness here, by his presence, he was making it clear that St. Columb’s College meant a huge amount to him. “He recognised what the college had helped him to become.” The school’s principal believes that pupils have looked up to Hume over the years and used him as a source of inspiration in their own studies. Mr Madden concluded: “I think Colum Eastwood said it last night, John Hume was Ireland’s Martin Luther King and we recognise that Martin Luther King had a dream and did all he could to achieve it. “I think John Hume did exactly the same thing here.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Is it any wonder after weeks, months and years of looking out at their peers playing in the middle of the action, many of our players will just throw in the towel. Bulging benches at U level soon subside and by the time minor level comes along, clubs can sometimes be scraping to get  and have to go dipping into the Us. Worse still, some of the star underage players dont cut the mustard at senior level. The bright lights and party scene of university becomes too appealing for some. For others, study and work will take them out of the country, never to . Some may fall out with the club and out of love with sport. googletag.cmd.push The other scenario, one that is all too common, is the man child who relies on power and when everyone  grows up, they havent the skill to offer anything more against players who have caught up in the physicality stakes. At the end of the day, in my opinion, underage is about giving the youth a purpose within a healthy lestyle and a social circle. It needs to provide players for the senior team and strive to pick up some silverware along the way. If a club can do this and win every title along the way, then even better. googletag.cmd.push In an ideal world, the club U championship would be the best barometer of success. By that point, the players have demonstrated a level of commitment to stay on board for the guts of  years and could backbone the senior team for a further . Perhaps with the GPAs new proposal for a split season, county boards will be able to properly schedule their U grade so it gets the proper slot. In recent seasons, Slaughtneil, Glen, Lavey and Magherafelt have pulled out of the competition as their main players were preparing for senior county finals. Its the younger grades that are the concern, as many coaches adopt a win at all costs attitude to their teams. I once heard an U manager talking about needing an extra session per week to prepare for a big game. The fixture in question was a Feacuteile group game. For the love of God, people need to take a step back. If you have a team talented enough to reach a final, then go all out to win it. As a general rule, dont listen to the doting parents chirping over the wire about getting the perceived strongest team out. Most of the time, they only have their sons or daughters interest in mind and not the clubs overall health  years down the tracks. All underage leagues and group games should be treated accordingly, a chance to develop. In any  of players, there will be many dferent levels of skill and physique. Any club serious about underage, will have enough helpers with their teams to cater for it. Set them targets. Condition players to work on their weak sidethey have mastered a skill. Or better still, encourage them to improve the pace of its execution and challenge them to make better decisions when in possession. For players that are struggling with a skill, thats the dficult part. That is real coaching, requiring both patience and dedication, with very little instant satisfaction. The earlier in the players coaching journey, the easier it will be. Break down the skill into manageable chunks. Where possible, link in with parents, so it can be worked on outside of training sessions. Parents have to take ownership as well. Even something as simple as video examples posted in a Whats App group. In many ways, this is where the most improvement will happen. There will be late developers, sometimes ing from other sports, but iniably those who strive to improve will always blossom. If you cant bring them all along with you, then you cant say you didnt try. At the end of the day, GAA is not for everyone. There are other sports and interests out there. The approach to games is the deal-breaker. It will dictate how many players you will retain. Managers should arm themselves with a piece of paper to plot a grid of who starts each game, how many minutesthey play and how long each substitute gets on the pitch for. Make a note of any players who have had school games that week or with the age group above. It will allow you to give more action to those who need it. All through the league, maintain a strong spine to your team so that it can always be competitive, but make some of your key players sit out some action and challenge others to play central roles in the absence of the so called star players. Better still, play them in dferent positions and tinker about as much as you can. Does anyone really care who wins an underage league or blitz game  Give others an opportunity to wear a starting jersey and watch how your grid changes. Make sure everyone gets starting in a number of games and not token five-minute appearances when the game is over. Youngsters are far from stupid. Its amazing what a jersey number below  can do for someones self esteem. It can feed into the development work you have been talking to the parents about. At the end of the day, championship is where the main focus will always be. And rightly so. A competitive edge must also be developed. If you can get a number of challenge games in and everyone gets playing, it will help maintain a bigger squad. This enables your coaching team to ide themselves up to work on dferent players and aspects of play. Take turns to be the stats person for a night to count things like use of weaker side, playing the final pass for a goal or the number of blocks. It is the perfect psychology to get inside the heads of the players in the top bracket of your squad. Also fire in wee reminders to others you see improving. In Thursdays documentary, iconic Meath midfielder Gerry McEntee referred to how Seaacuten Boylan would always have one on one chats and make him feel like he was the most important person in the world. It was a persona that made people want to improve. Mary K Burke snapped this gem of a photofrom a recent Feacuteile final. Look at the joy on the youngsters faces. Victory helps instil that type of emotion, but imagine an environment where everyone felt like that. Coaching sessions where learning overspills into laughter and where every player gets their fair share of game time. Imagine. That world would be a much better place, somewhere nobody would ever want to leave.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Is it any wonder after weeks, months and years of looking out at their peers playing in the middle of the action, many of our players will just throw in the towel. Bulging benches at U level soon subside and by the time minor level comes along, clubs can sometimes be scraping to get  and have to go dipping into the Us. Worse still, some of the star underage players dont cut the mustard at senior level. The bright lights and party scene of university becomes too appealing for some. For others, study and work will take them out of the country, never to . Some may fall out with the club and out of love with sport. googletag.cmd.push The other scenario, one that is all too common, is the man child who relies on power and when everyone  grows up, they havent the skill to offer anything more against players who have caught up in the physicality stakes. At the end of the day, in my opinion, underage is about giving the youth a purpose within a healthy lestyle and a social circle. It needs to provide players for the senior team and strive to pick up some silverware along the way. If a club can do this and win every title along the way, then even better. googletag.cmd.push In an ideal world, the club U championship would be the best barometer of success. By that point, the players have demonstrated a level of commitment to stay on board for the guts of  years and could backbone the senior team for a further . Perhaps with the GPAs new proposal for a split season, county boards will be able to properly schedule their U grade so it gets the proper slot. In recent seasons, Slaughtneil, Glen, Lavey and Magherafelt have pulled out of the competition as their main players were preparing for senior county finals. Its the younger grades that are the concern, as many coaches adopt a win at all costs attitude to their teams. I once heard an U manager talking about needing an extra session per week to prepare for a big game. The fixture in question was a Feacuteile group game. For the love of God, people need to take a step back. If you have a team talented enough to reach a final, then go all out to win it. As a general rule, dont listen to the doting parents chirping over the wire about getting the perceived strongest team out. Most of the time, they only have their sons or daughters interest in mind and not the clubs overall health  years down the tracks. All underage leagues and group games should be treated accordingly, a chance to develop. In any  of players, there will be many dferent levels of skill and physique. Any club serious about underage, will have enough helpers with their teams to cater for it. Set them targets. Condition players to work on their weak sidethey have mastered a skill. Or better still, encourage them to improve the pace of its execution and challenge them to make better decisions when in possession. For players that are struggling with a skill, thats the dficult part. That is real coaching, requiring both patience and dedication, with very little instant satisfaction. The earlier in the players coaching journey, the easier it will be. Break down the skill into manageable chunks. Where possible, link in with parents, so it can be worked on outside of training sessions. Parents have to take ownership as well. Even something as simple as video examples posted in a Whats App group. In many ways, this is where the most improvement will happen. There will be late developers, sometimes ing from other sports, but iniably those who strive to improve will always blossom. If you cant bring them all along with you, then you cant say you didnt try. At the end of the day, GAA is not for everyone. There are other sports and interests out there. The approach to games is the deal-breaker. It will dictate how many players you will retain. Managers should arm themselves with a piece of paper to plot a grid of who starts each game, how many minutesthey play and how long each substitute gets on the pitch for. Make a note of any players who have had school games that week or with the age group above. It will allow you to give more action to those who need it. All through the league, maintain a strong spine to your team so that it can always be competitive, but make some of your key players sit out some action and challenge others to play central roles in the absence of the so called star players. Better still, play them in dferent positions and tinker about as much as you can. Does anyone really care who wins an underage league or blitz game  Give others an opportunity to wear a starting jersey and watch how your grid changes. Make sure everyone gets starting in a number of games and not token five-minute appearances when the game is over. Youngsters are far from stupid. Its amazing what a jersey number below  can do for someones self esteem. It can feed into the development work you have been talking to the parents about. At the end of the day, championship is where the main focus will always be. And rightly so. A competitive edge must also be developed. If you can get a number of challenge games in and everyone gets playing, it will help maintain a bigger squad. This enables your coaching team to ide themselves up to work on dferent players and aspects of play. Take turns to be the stats person for a night to count things like use of weaker side, playing the final pass for a goal or the number of blocks. It is the perfect psychology to get inside the heads of the players in the top bracket of your squad. Also fire in wee reminders to others you see improving. In Thursdays documentary, iconic Meath midfielder Gerry McEntee referred to how Seaacuten Boylan would always have one on one chats and make him feel like he was the most important person in the world. It was a persona that made people want to improve. Mary K Burke snapped this gem of a photofrom a recent Feacuteile final. Look at the joy on the youngsters faces. Victory helps instil that type of emotion, but imagine an environment where everyone felt like that. Coaching sessions where learning overspills into laughter and where every player gets their fair share of game time. Imagine. That world would be a much better place, somewhere nobody would ever want to leave.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Dan McGrellis passed away peacefully at home, surrounded by his family and friends. He was a well-known and much-loved member of the community, parish and local GAA club. At his funeral, Fr McGavigan paid tribute to a ‘good father, grandfather and great grandfather’. “Dan was a remarkable man. He knew from a young age the importance of a father, losing his own father to cancer when he was only twelve,” he told mourners at St Joseph’s Church, Fincarn. googletag.cmd.push “He was the second of nine children, and took on a father’s role, moving to Scotland to work so money could be sent home for his mother and siblings. “Such instinctive sacrice and generosity, learned at a young age, was to be the mark of the man. Dan was to have very soon celebrated  years as a pioneer, the pin proudly worn on his lapel. “He was far from a shrinking violet, though, and was a regular in the pub in his youth, enjoying a game of darts with friends. The soberest, but perhaps the most sociable of all his friends. googletag.cmd.push “The parish of Banagher has lost a faithful friend who was a companion to many people work colleagues, extended family, GAA, pioneers and the community association to name but a few. “He had a huge heart and had room for everyone, so of course we are sad, even though he lived a long and incredibly full le.” Dan and the rest of the St Marys committee pictured at the opening of the new pitch in . The McGrellis family are steeped in the tradition of the club, and Dan’s seven sons wore maroon ties at his funeral in a nod to their father’s deep affection for St Mary’s. Dan was chairperson of St Mary’s GAC, Banagher from  to , having been vice chairperson in  and . As well as his involvement with the GAA, Fr McGavigan told the congregation that Dan contributed greatly to parish and community le in Banagher. “Parish and community were central to his le,” he said. “He lobbied the council for a footpath from Feeny village to the chapel, ensuring access for the local primary school, and was an early member of Feeny Community Association. “Helping to establish the parish bingo, he was involved in the renovation of the parish hall and ably served for many years as a sacristan in this church.”  Dan’s most loyal commitment, though, was to his family and his we Anne. Fr McGavigan told mourners how the couple encountered each other long before they were married. “The story is told of how he, as a young boy, watched a christening pass his mother’s shop on the way to the chapel,” he said. “The baby was a certain Anne Conway, who was brought here to be christened. “He recalled how he wasn’t much interested in a baby at eight years old, but recounted how a neighbour remarked, ‘this could be the girl you marry’. “Years later, they met again at a dance in Aghabrack and they soon married and settled down to begin a family. So began the McGrellis dynasty. “Dan and Anne patiently, generously and faithfully raised their twelve children, instilling in them their own virtues of hard work, kindness, generosity, respect and good humour.” Fr McGavigan concluded by encouraging Dan’s many children, grandchildren and great grandchildren to be inspired by his le. “Dan was a powerhouse of prayer and work and an inspiration for all of the McGrellis family,” he said “To his children, grandchildren and great grandchildren be inspired today by the holy le and death of a good man, and see in his le the virtues you would like to see in your own. “If you do this, Dan will live on in you and future generations. Woven into your sadness, there is a deep gratitude to God for all that this man has been to us. “We are happy, because we know deep down that his le was complete and that he, in the end, was ready for God.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Along with drivers of internal combustion enginecars using EV charge points as makesht parking bays, EV drivers listed poor maintenance of the existing network as a major problem. Phil Gordon, a Donegal resident who works at Altnagelvin Hospital in Derry, said the majority of the city’s charge points are not ing. “It’s been slowly falling apart for years and nobody is doing anything about it. It was developed around -,” he told the County Derry Post. googletag.cmd.push “I got my EV in  and at that point, in Derry alone there were seven standard chargers and one rapid. At the minute there are only two of the slow chargers left working. “There one on Carlisle Road has been broken for as long as I can remember. There is one in the Diamond that has been out of order for about  or  months. “We’ve been told by eCars that it’s beyond repair, they can’t fix it and there is no plan to replace it. The north west in general has been very badly served by eCars for a long time. googletag.cmd.push “You look at how many there are in Belfast. It’s the biggest city and it has four or five rapid chargers. Derry is the second biggest city in the country and it’s only ever had one.” A map showing EV charge points across County Derry. Responsibility for the network across the island of Ireland lies with eCars, a specic section of Electricity Supply Board . The company began charging last year for the use of its rapid chargers in the Republic of Ireland and further pricing for standard network charging points came into effect yesterday. ESB have said they hope to be able to replace broken chargers, but that ‘planning issues’ are causing a delay. “In County Derry, there are  chargers in total each with two charge points. Of these  are working correctly and our systems indicate recent usage,” a spokesperson said. “There are, however, a number of chargers in Derry City which have faults which cannot be resolved, and new chargers are required. “This is due to the age of the equipment and that they are no longer supported by the original charger manufacturer. “In addition, one charger was removed at the train station due to building works and which is due to be reinstated in coming months by the building contractor. “ESB ecars has plans to replace a section of the existing Standard AC network in Northern Ireland including in Derry. “There are a number of planning issues which need to be resolved first and work is on-going with relevant stakeholders in relation to it at present. “It is hoped that these issues can be overcome with a view to beginning to replace chargers in the coming months.” At present, it is free to charge an electric car using the Northern Ireland network, something EV driver Ronan McElholm feels leaves the system open to abuse. “They’re free, and this is half the problem. When you get something that is free, it’s subject to abuse,” he said. “There is a lot of funding from the government in the Republic, but added to that is the fact you’re now having to pay for it and it makes things easier. “It’s not a fortune to charge your car. It’s only slightly more than the day-time rate. It keeps the freeloaders away because it’s now cheaper to charge at home than on the network.” While the lack of maintenance on the network has caused problems, EV drivers are also having to contend with ICE drivers using the charge points as parking bays. “A lot of places, they’ll put a charger in but don’t enforce the parking, so people park an ordinary car in it because it’s a handy space and they leave it there,” said Phil Gordon “There is no punishment for that. In Derry City, you will get a ticketyou’re parked in an EV charging bay, but a in lot of places, that’s not enforced. “It’s ridiculous. They call it ‘ICE-ing’. Internal Combustion Engine. If they’ve parked an ordinary car in your place, you’ve been ‘iced’. It’s such a common problem there’s a term for it. “You wouldn’t park a car at a petrol pump and walk off and leave it. That’s the equivalent.” Ronan McElholm regularly travels from Derry to Belfast and Dublin for work, and has encountered the problem on numerous occasions. “It causes a problem. I was going to Belfast, finding an abandoned car on a charger with no way of knowing when this person is coming back,” he said. “I’ve never had any issues with the rapid charger on the Glenshane, for example, apart from non-electric cars parking in it. One day there was a van parked and left there for three hours. “Once you hit five o’clock, non-electric cars just park in it, which is an incredibly selfish thing for anyone to do. “They can get a ticket for it, but once the traffic wardens go home, there is no one to ticket you, because the police say it’s not their responsibility. “In the Republic, they are upgrading all the street chargers to rapid chargers, which is a good thing, but unless there is proper policing on it, people just pull in and park. “It needs a change to legislation and the police need powers to ticket cars parked on them.” DfI Minister Nichola Mallon arriving for work in her EV. The political lag caused by Stormont’s two-year period of stalemate has resulted in a backlog across all departments which has delayed any upgrade to the EV charging network. Department for InfrastructureMinister Nichola Mallon raised eyebrows when she arrived in an EV on the day Stormont ed in January. “That was a show.

Conor Cahill, a native of Cloyne in the Rebel county, began his trip in Belfast and will make his way down Ireland’s west coast before ing along its eastern seaboard. The walk, which Conor has branded the ‘Camino d’Ireland’ is a huge personal undertaking, but his chosen charity, the Ethiopian Deaf Project , is the priority. “I’m walking anyway, sosomeone  can get the benefit of it then it’s a great story for me,” he told the County Derry Post. googletag.cmd.push “I do this because it pushes my body and resets a lot of my batteries. It’s just like hard training, the benefits are fantastic.” The EDP is a committee of voluntary fundraisers dedicated to supporting deaf children in Ethiopia gain access to formal education. They place a particular emphasis on assisting deaf children from poor rural families or those who are living isolated lives. Fundraising activities, in particular their child sponsorship program, have facilitated the development of a school that is transforming the lives of the children who attend. Miriam ORegan Miriam O’Regan, secretary and founding member of the EDP, said all donations, no matter how small, are helpful. googletag.cmd.push “The money is so hard to raise that we are extremely careful on how it is spent, we know where every cent goes,” she said. “We started my chance I suppose. Myself and my husband, Patrick have two children adopted from Ethiopia, one of whom is deaf. “We then heard of a Dublin priest, Fr. Stephen Monaghan who was trying to do something to help the deaf in Ambo. “We contacted him and said we’d like to help, maybe have a coffee morning or something, the rest is history. “We raised enough to buy land, then with matched funding from Misean Cara to build and extend the school, set up a sponsorship program to support the children and their families. “Now they come with their families once a month to learn sign language and in the next few years we are hoping to get one of the bigger organisations or group to help us establish a much needed boarding house.” Conor stayed in Dungiven while travelling through Derry. Conor feels the experience of being deaf can be a lonely one, but while staying in Dungiven, he was able to meet and talk to a deaf person from the town. “Caroline, my host, took me down to the GAA club and I started talking GAA with a few lads who were down there,” he said. “With social distancing, I was kind of sat in the corner and a deaf lad was brought over by a few of the lads. “I knew straight away he was deaf, so we were signing back and forward and it’s a lovely experience to have. “The other experience I had of that was in a place called Matera, in the south of Italy. I went into a restaurant last year and there were two people signing. “Eventually I went over and introduced myself and signed my name to them. We spent an hour and a half, between signing and texting and talking - communicating. “They told me that, over the three weeks they had travelled from Hamburg, I was the first person that had made any attempt to engage with them. “It’s a tough way to live. Three weeks on holidays and no one making any effort to communicate with them.”  Having already been to Derry City, Conor was keen to experience what rural County Derry had to offer when he was planning his trip. “I had been to Derry [City] before so I decided I didn’t want to go back through the city again, and I wanted to see rural Northern Ireland as much as I could,” he said. “It was great to come through the county and put places to the names, like Slaughtneil from the GAA side of it. “I loved the shared community spirit as that’s dferent in the north. The word ‘community’ is used a lot more. “I did have a chuckle, though, coming through some towns and seeing the signs from winning the  Tidy Towns’ award in . “When you walk Italy, you get an ancient sense of history. When you walk Ireland, our history is a more recent history.” Conor, along with the EDP, is running a ‘Guess the Steps’ competition. Entry is via donation and can be accessed on the EDP website - www.edp-ambo.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Phil Gordon, who works at Altnagelvin Hospital in Derry, says the ‘milk float’ stereotype is outdated and inaccurate. “There are fantastic cars to drive. People have an image that they’re like a milk float, but they’re very powerful cars and fantastic to drive,” he said. “I’ve been saving about pound, a year since I went electric. I do about , miles a year down to Dublin and between Derry and Letterkenny regularly and it suits me perfectly. googletag.cmd.push “I could never go back to a petrol or diesel car. It’s just frustrating they’re not making it easier for more people to get on board.” While the price of EVs is higher than a standard internal combustion enginecar, Derry man Ronan McElholm says the cost of petrol or diesel often means a saving on electric cars. “There is a massive saving. People look at the price of the car and compare it to their petrol or diesel, but you have to factor in the fuel that you use,” he said. “You could easily spend pound, on diesel in three years and then there’s the service costs. The servicing of an electric car is very minimal. googletag.cmd.push “Most of your breaking is regenerative, so it recharges the batteries and brake pads have been known to last , miles on an electric car. “There isn’t as much wear on brakes or tyres, it doesn’t need serviced as much and when you go to sell it, the residual value of the car will be so much more than any combustion engine car. “People have to look at the bigger picture. I would love to see every car become electric.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

To date, that remains the only such cluster in the Causeway Coast and Glens area identied since contact tracing began on May , which is one of eleven identied across Northern Ireland. A Public Health Agencystatement revealed that Newry, Mourne and Down District Councilhad the highest number of identied clusters, while Mid and East Antrimis next highest. Antrim and Newtownabbey Borough Council,Ards and North Down Borough Council andArmagh City, Banbridge and Craigavon Borough Council all have one identied cluster of over five people. googletag.cmd.push There have been no large clusters identied in the Derry City and Strabane or Mid Ulster districts, that cover the remainder of County Derry. However, the PHA have also said they have identied  smaller clusters, of less than five people, across Northern Ireland, and said they would continue to publish data each Thursday. A cluster is currently defined as two or more laboratory-confirmed cases of COVID- among iniduals associated with a key setting, with illness onset dates within a  day period. Key settings which have seen clusters to date since May include workplaces, retail or hospitality premises, domestic gatherings, and sporting settings.  googletag.cmd.push COVID- transmission risk is highest in a household setting, and it is to be anticipated that a signicant number of linked cases within households will be identied by efficient contact tracing. It is for this reason that household-linked cases are not reported as clusters. Since July, the averagenumber of close contacts linked to cases has more than doubled. The PHA say the rise may be attributed to the gradual easing of lockdown measures, but may also be explained by relaxing of attitudes to social distancing. Dr Gerry Waldron, Head of Health Protection at the PHA, said: “Cases are occurring in communities across Northern Ireland. This is an important reminder that we must not become complacent – coronavirus remains in circulation, so each of us has a responsibility to take steps to help keep ourselves and those around us safe. “Maintain social distancing, wash your hands regularly, and get testedyou display any symptoms of coronavirus. You can also download the StopCOVID NI contact tracing app. “This disease has the potential to make its presence felt in any community, as we have seen with clusters appearing across a number of council districts. “Everyone should act on the basis that it might potentially be in your neighbourhood right now, rather than waiting for it to emerge in your local area or for rumours to circulate before taking steps to help protect yourself and others. That’s why following the public health advice remains vitally important. You can spread the virus evenyou dont have symptoms, so taking these steps and exercising good hygiene practices will help prevent cases and reduce the number of clusters. Our analysis of clusters to date has shown that they have been associated with both workplaces and in the community, such as domestic gatherings and in hospitality and sporting settings. “Clusters are managed through the contact tracing programme, and where we need to advise or inform the public of any increased risk to public health we will do so in a timely manner. Dr Waldron added: “Speculation around current clusters of COVID- across Northern Ireland is not helpful. “We will not be commenting on inidual cases of COVID- or going into the detail of every incident that emerges, as this could lead to people being identied, create stigma and focus attention on iniduals, families or groups, and therefore deter others with symptoms coming forward to be tested.” Everyone with symptoms of coronavirus can book a free test. If anyone is concerned that they are experiencing any of the symptoms of coronavirus, they must self-isolate and arrange a test as soon as possible.

To date, that remains the only such cluster in the Causeway Coast and Glens area identied since contact tracing began on May , which is one of eleven identied across Northern Ireland. A Public Health Agencystatement revealed that Newry, Mourne and Down District Councilhad the highest number of identied clusters, while Mid and East Antrimis next highest. Antrim and Newtownabbey Borough Council,Ards and North Down Borough Council andArmagh City, Banbridge and Craigavon Borough Council all have one identied cluster of over five people. googletag.cmd.push There have been no large clusters identied in the Derry City and Strabane or Mid Ulster districts, that cover the remainder of County Derry. However, the PHA have also said they have identied  smaller clusters, of less than five people, across Northern Ireland, and said they would continue to publish data each Thursday. A cluster is currently defined as two or more laboratory-confirmed cases of COVID- among iniduals associated with a key setting, with illness onset dates within a  day period. Key settings which have seen clusters to date since May include workplaces, retail or hospitality premises, domestic gatherings, and sporting settings.  googletag.cmd.push COVID- transmission risk is highest in a household setting, and it is to be anticipated that a signicant number of linked cases within households will be identied by efficient contact tracing. It is for this reason that household-linked cases are not reported as clusters. Since July, the averagenumber of close contacts linked to cases has more than doubled. The PHA say the rise may be attributed to the gradual easing of lockdown measures, but may also be explained by relaxing of attitudes to social distancing. Dr Gerry Waldron, Head of Health Protection at the PHA, said: “Cases are occurring in communities across Northern Ireland. This is an important reminder that we must not become complacent – coronavirus remains in circulation, so each of us has a responsibility to take steps to help keep ourselves and those around us safe. “Maintain social distancing, wash your hands regularly, and get testedyou display any symptoms of coronavirus. You can also download the StopCOVID NI contact tracing app. “This disease has the potential to make its presence felt in any community, as we have seen with clusters appearing across a number of council districts. “Everyone should act on the basis that it might potentially be in your neighbourhood right now, rather than waiting for it to emerge in your local area or for rumours to circulate before taking steps to help protect yourself and others. That’s why following the public health advice remains vitally important. You can spread the virus evenyou dont have symptoms, so taking these steps and exercising good hygiene practices will help prevent cases and reduce the number of clusters. Our analysis of clusters to date has shown that they have been associated with both workplaces and in the community, such as domestic gatherings and in hospitality and sporting settings. “Clusters are managed through the contact tracing programme, and where we need to advise or inform the public of any increased risk to public health we will do so in a timely manner. Dr Waldron added: “Speculation around current clusters of COVID- across Northern Ireland is not helpful. “We will not be commenting on inidual cases of COVID- or going into the detail of every incident that emerges, as this could lead to people being identied, create stigma and focus attention on iniduals, families or groups, and therefore deter others with symptoms coming forward to be tested.” Everyone with symptoms of coronavirus can book a free test. If anyone is concerned that they are experiencing any of the symptoms of coronavirus, they must self-isolate and arrange a test as soon as possible.

Stendhal Festival Presents: Unlocked, due to take place in Limavady in the last week of August, would have been the first ever series of socially distant outdoor music gigs in Northern Ireland. However, after receiving advice from the Chief Medical Officer and Chief Scientic Advisor, organisers have had no choice but to cancel the event. The advice said the festival was likely to cause a signicant risk to public health. A statement from the festivals Board of Directors said they were disappointed with the decision, but that it left them with no choice. googletag.cmd.push As a result of this advice from the CMO and CSA and due to the fact that the R rate is on the rise along with the number of localised clusters and confirmed cases across Northern Ireland, we have no alternative but to make the decision to cancel all of the proposed events, a spokesperson said. From the outset we said that while we would do everything within our power to get the events approved, we would always put public health first and act on guidance provided by Government. We are disappointed for all the acts on the bill who were hoping to get back on stage doing what they do best, for the people who supported us and believed in us by purchasing tickets, for those who were to be involved in the production element of the festival, the traders and the event staff who were hoping to secure some income from the events. googletag.cmd.push We would like to thank everyone who supported us on this quest to get festivals back on the agenda post lock-down, in particular our amazing team of volunteers and our local Councillors in Causeway Coast and Glens Borough Council, who made a brave decision to support our endeavours in June. We await more detailed feedback on our Risk Assessment and Event Plan from the Department of Health in the hope that further clarity can be gained on the specic threats outdoor gatherings may pose to the public. These documents can still help be a factor in getting outdoor gigs back on the agenda,not for us now, for others in the arts and music industry going forward. The organisers said refunds for tickets would be available on the website by the end of the week.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Ryan OrsquoHiggins opened the scoring early on before Jerome Johnston and Marty Devlin replied for the Ulster champions.The industrious Paddy Sheridan levelled matters in the tenth minute with Martin McCourt giving the Magpies the slightest lead by the water break.Both sides continued to probe before half time with scores hard to come by. Miceal Rooney put Kilcoo two clear five minutes from the short whistle, while OrsquoHiggins scored a beauty right on half time to leave it - to - to Mickey Moranrsquos side.The lsquoFord got the best possible start to the second half with Conor Maginn and substitute Cathal Burns finding their range to put them ahead. It was tit for tat for the next phase of the game and with ten minutes left Kilcoo lead by one thanks to scores from Jerome Johnston, Paul Greenan and Conor Laverty.The games turning point came on the rd minute. A brilliant move involving Darragh OrsquoHanlon, Ryan Johnston and Miceal Rooney placed the ing Ceilum Doherty in and he palmed home from close range.The home side never gave in though and showed great resolve, Marc Reid even coming up to point from distance in what was a superb inidual score and one of the highlights of the game.But the Magpies held out, Doherty adding a good score to seal the three-point victory margin.Bryansford: Marc Reid , Stephen Toner, Ryan McDonald, Aaron McDonald, Timmy Hanna, Conor Maginn , Danny Savage , Fintan Canavan, Conor Devlin, Corey Laverty, Ryan OrsquoHiggins , Paddy Sheridan , Thomas McAnerney, David McKenna, Daniel McDonald.Subs used: Cathal Burns , Chris Clarke , Jack Maginn, Niall OrsquoHiggins, Lewis Casement.Cill Chua: Martin McCourt , Niall Branagan, Ryan McEvoy, Tiernan Fettes, Miceal Rooney , Darryl Branagan, Eugene Branagan, Darragh OrsquoHanlon, Paul Greenan , Shealan Johnston, Jerome Johnston , Conor Laverty , Martin Devlin , Ryan Johnston, Niall McEvoy.Subs used:Ceilum Doherty , Felim McGreevy.Referee: Neil Cousins .Bryansford -Cill Chua -ACFL DIVISION A.prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/5th August 2020 Downpatrick.jpg","title":"Downpatrick motorists facing further disruption  ","story":"MOTORISTS are bracing themselves for five weeks of town centre disruption in Downpatrick.Work on a pound, sewer improvement scheme starts next week, with NI Water contractors focusing on key areas.They include New Bridge Street, Church Street, Bridge Street, Saul Street, Saul Road, Marian Park, Drumlin Park, Scotch Street, Market Street, Market Lane, Stream Street, Racecourse Hill, Ardglass Road, Edward Street, Knocknashinna Road and the Knockchree Road.A number of short lane closures are expected, with two-way traffic maintained at all locations using temporary traffic controls.Vehicular access for residents and businesses will also be maintained as far as possible but there may be some slight delays according to NI Water which has confirmed that pedestrian access will be available at all times. Parking restrictions will also be in place around the working areas.Ni Water says the investment is part of a programme of work to improve the existing sewers in Downpatrick, which will enhance the local sewerage infrastructure and reduce the risk of out of sewer flooding.It has confirmed that the essential work will involve repairing existing sewers and will mainly be undertaken using underground trenchless techniques, which will signicantly reduce the duration and disruption of the programme.But NI Water is warning that it will be necessary to undertake lsquoopen-digrsquo repairs at some locations due to the condition of the existing sewers.The organisation says that this particular aspect of the work is expected to last just one or two days with contractors also working in the evening, with every effort being made to minimise disruption.ldquoAppropriate traffic management and signage will be in place as the work progresses, said a NI Water spokeswoman.ldquoThe majority of the works will be undertaken during normal working hours. However, to reduce disruption to businesses and the public, some night-time works will be required at key locations.The work will take place at ious locations around the Downpatrick area, including some of the main streets within the town centre.NI Water has confirmed that the contractor working on the Downpatrick scheme mdash Geda Construction mdash will liaise with any affected businesses and properties.The spokeswoman added: ldquoWe appreciate that this work is disruptive and would like to thank the public in advance for their patience as we complete these essential improvement works.ldquoWe are all practising social distancing and our priority is to keep customers and colleagues safe. Please keep your distance and our workers will carry on with their essential work for you.South Down MLA Colin McGrath has met with NI Water officials ahead of work starting in Downpatrick, highlighting the need for communication with the community and the need to complete the scheme quickly.He said it was imperative that consideration was given to the works being done in the evening and at weekends to ensure that the level of public disruption was kept to as low a level as possible.ldquoI canrsquot think of a time in recent memory when Downpatrick has suffered road works after road works than has happened over the past few years, the MLA continued. ldquoIf the public is frustrated by this, it is entirely understandable and entirely justied.ldquoThe past few months have been incredibly worrying and stressful and people are finally able to step out of their homes. Shielding finally came to a end last week and the most vulnerable in our society are able to take those first tentative steps out of their homes again. It would have been altogether unacceptable for them to have to navigate this with works going on in their town.Mr McGrath said that having raised these issues with NI Water, the organisation is planning to use underground trenchless techniques, with contractors also working in the evening.He added: ldquoI will be in regular contact with the project manager to ensure that these works are completed as quickly as possible and due consideration given to the public.Downpatrick area councillor Dermot Curran has appealed to residents and the business community to remain patient as the work progresses.ldquoThis is an important scheme for Downpatrick and, as such, there will inevitably be disruption. NI Water intends to keep this to a minimum and it is important that this is the case, he continued.ldquoThis is a signicant investment in a much-needed scheme to not only upgrade the existing infrastructure, but also prevent so-called out-of-sewer flooding. Upgrading town centre sewers is an important scheme and NI Water must honour its commitment to keep disruption to a minimum.Cllr Curran said improving the town centrersquos waste water infrastructure was good news for residents and the business community.He added :ldquoThe suggested timetable to complete the work is five weeks and I hope that every effort will be made to ensure that back-to-school traffic is not impacted as the start of the new term is less than one month away..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/5th August 2020 Downpatrick Cricket.jpg","title":"Downpatrick see off Saintfield by four runs in close contest  ","story":"WHAT a dference  hours makes in the game of cricket.Downpatrick, who had been humbled by Ballymena on Thursday, got back to winning ways at Saintfield with the batsmen showing some pride and application.Ross Boultwood won the toss and decided to bat first.

The original proposal was to end the scheme on August .Downpatrick councillors Gareth Sharvin mdash who initially proposed the free parking initiative ndash and Oonagh Hanlon have welcomed the extension of the free parking scheme.Cllr Sharvinrsquos suggestion was tabled at the June meeting of the local authorityrsquos Strategic, Policy and Resources when it was also agreed to review the decision in early August.ldquoI proposed the initiative to encourage shoppers back into Downpatrick to provide a boost for our local businesses who have continued to provide key services during the pandemic and the easing of lockdown restrictions, Cllr Sharvin explained.He revealed that when he used the Irish Street, Scotch Street and Church Street car parks theywere extremely busy and he was heartened by the usage, admitting that he did receive some feedback that there were some all-day parkers taking up vital spaces which would have had a negative impact on our local businesses.Agreement to extend the free parking initiative was accepted by the local authority on Monday following a proposal by Cllr Sharvin.ldquoThe near eight weeks of free car parking have been a great benefit to Downpatrick and in my proposal to extend the scheme until August , I have asked that the car park strategy the council is completing is fast tracked.ldquoThis is important to ensure equality across the district and to review the car park tarf of p an hour, with a reduction in the hourly rate being considered.Cllr Sharvin said while shoppers will not have to pay to park for almost two more weeks, he has vowed to continue working with local businesses to ensure that the local authority is doing everything it can do to support them.He added: ldquoWith this feedback from local businesses, I would not hesitate to call on the council to reconsider the car parking charges again,traders feel it is impacting on them signicantly during this continuing pandemic.Cllr Hanlon said while free parking had been extended, it was important that the public remembered that charges would be introduced shortly.However, she expressed disappointment at the lack of signs informing people that parking is free which confused some shoppers.Cllr Hanlon said a number drivers contacted her regarding the issuing of enforcement tickets whilst using the car parks for minor offences.She continued: ldquoThis, in my opinion, was counter productive to the reason why councillors had agreed to the extended free parking to encourage people to shop locally and provide businesses with some breathing space to adapt to the new way of working.She also highlighted the need for the local authority to press ahead with its car parking strategy and for an equitable charging system across the

Hanna settled into the next bunch, finding his climbing legs quickly and reached the summit in fourth place over half a minute clear of Martin Dematteis.One of the best climbers in the field, Hanna continues to hone his descending skills too and he held on for a long time on the descent in fourth before being caught by Dematteis.However, he achieved a brilliant fth place finish, taking the scalp of the Aymonod, the winner the day before, and many other top runners..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/5th August 2020 United.jpg","title":"United front in drive to restore Downe services  ","story":"HEALTH campaigners have welcomed the new united front in the campaign to restore key services to the Downe Hospital.Politicians, trade unions and the Down Community Health Committee worked alongside each other in lobbying the South Eastern Trust to restore emergency services at the Downpatrick hospital which is scheduled to happen on October .In a throwback to previous campaigns, all of the districtrsquos political parties and trade unions are now working alongside hospital campaigners to secure the future of the Downe and to argue for a range of new services.Campaigners say while they will be keeping a watching brief to ensure that the hospitalrsquos AE reopens in October as planned, they are also conscious of the ongoing province-wide review of urgent and emergency care.The review mdash commissioned by the Department of Health ndash aims to establish a new regional care model for Northern Ireland with any future proposals subject to public consultation.At a socially distanced meeting of the community health group in Killough last week, campaigners said that future proposals for the Downe arising out of the review could be crucial and potentially be the launchpad for a major new battleground.Confirmation of theof emergency services in October comes after it was revealed that over the past five years there has been a % increase in AE attendances at hospitals across Northern Ireland.Signicantly, Department of Health figures reveal that the biggest increase mdash .% mdash was at the Downe, with the number of patients increasing from , to ,.Health campaigners say the figure represents another ldquostrong, persuasive reason why they must continue to fight for a local emergency department which is valued and needed.They are delighted with the plannedof AE services, suggesting that with the fastest growing emergency department in Northern Ireland, there is a ldquostrong, logical statistical argument for not only retaining the service, but enhancing it.Health committee chairman Eamonn McGrady,revealed that analysis of increased attendances at emergency departments shows that the growth area is not Belfast, but at hospitals in the Southern , Northern , Westernand South Easternhealth trusts.He added: ldquoWe know we are not home until the Downersquos emergency department is reopened in October and and we will all be keeping a watching brief.Mrs Anne Trainor said she was ldquomore prepared than ever to work harder for the Downe as she will never be able to repay the debt of gratitude that she owes the hospital and its excellent staff for helping her ill husband.She also described a recent meeting with senior officials from the South Eastern Trust to discuss theof emergency services to the Downpatrick hospital as ldquorobust and revealed she was left perplexed when health minister Robin Swann said health officials would ldquoexplore the feasibility of reopening the department.ldquoThis particular service has been part of the Downe Hospital for years. Its need has been proven. There was no need to explore the feasibility of anything, she said.Mrs Trainor said the outcome of the meeting with health officials was that politicians, the community and trade unions stood together in demanding theof AE provision.She added: ldquoThis very much reminded me of the early days of the hospital campaign where everyone was saying the same thing. We won the case for the Downe but, from day one, administrators started to strip services from it.ldquoOver recent days what has given me the greatest heart has been the reaction of the politicians, the community and trade unions on the Downe Hospital issue.Mrs Trainor said she hopes that the unity will continue, insisting that when it comes to hospital services, the people of Downe are asking for nothing more than parity with those in other areas.ldquoThere has been substantial underfunding in this district for many years and we need parity with everyone  alongside rural proofing as, for those in authority, the centralisation of services is still very much alive. Their attitude is that everything stops in Belfast, she continued.ldquoBut everything does not have to be centralised in the city. The Downe is a beautul hospital but is being totally underused, yet it is one of the most modern of its kind. There is room to expand to increase service provision and we also want more consultants and staff alongside increased investment for student nurses.Mrs Trainor added: ldquoThere is total unity across the community on these issues and a strong defence of the Downe Hospital.ldquoThe hospital is the single biggest issue in our district. There is strength in our unity and togetherness. Itrsquos said that lsquounited we stand, ided we fallrsquo but we have no intention of falling anytime soon..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.impartialreporter.com/news/resources/images/11687172.jpg","title":"news","story":"As a subscriber, you are shown % lessThose ads you do see are predominantly from local businesses promoting local servicesThese adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Since nobody is happy with the system the planners could argue that they must have got the balance right, but a report into planning in Northern Ireland recently published by Queen’s University and Cardf University found that roughly % of people using the system believe that it does not look after the public interest, and that only % of citizens using the system feel that their views are taken into account — so something is very wrong. One might start by asking why we have planning at all.  \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues. Please try again later.Submitting...Marcus Patton is an artist and architectWhen the modern planning system was introduced after the war in  its main priority was to stimulate redevelopment of areas that had been damaged by bombing, and to build an infrastructure that would revive the economy. In England that was counterbalanced by the introduction of the system of listed buildings and recognition that there should be a balance between development and the protection of amenity.In Northern Ireland we got the development bit, but listed buildings were not provided for until , and the preliminary survey of our historic buildings was not completed till around . In the meantime we had the Troubles and many of our buildings were damaged or demolished before they could even be considered for listing. With that on top of the usual depredations of developers and roads engineers what has been left is particularly precious to us. It could be argued that in the present day, far from stimulating development, the planning system should be there primarily to protect our environment and to deal with climate change. Developers will always want to develop, andthey are prevented from developing one area they will move to another. If planners stick to their guns in protecting conservation areas and listed buildings, developers will turn their attentions to less salubrious areas where their investment could be genuinely beneficial. Unfortunately we have a system which clogs up development by trying to tweak it instead of refusing it outright when it is inappropriate and yet which eventually approves some % of applications. So essentially we have a bureaucratic system which ultimately rubber stamps almost everything put in front of it. On the rare occasions when an application is refused the applicant can withdraw it and try again with some modications, or he can appeal to the Planning Appeals Commission, where over % of appeals are successful and the planners are overruled. One curiosity of the planning system is that while the developer has this right of appeal, a person living beside the development - who it might be argued is more signicantly affectedby it than the developer is — has no such right. While you wouldn’t want the planning system to be clogged up with vexatious appeals about minor alterations, the householder who finds a tower block going up at the end of his street has a genuine grievance — and it is one that will be shared by many others. Third party right of appeal — as this redress is called — exists in many parts of Europe, including Ireland, but not in the UK whose systems we generally follow. It seems a natural balance of legal rights to give the people affected the same rights as the perpetrator, particularly when the appeal is supported by environmental groups acting purely in the public interest. Planning often came in for criticism when it was carried out by the centralised DoE with a series of codes and standards that were applied unormly across the province. But we now have a dozen planning authorities, with each council devising its own iation on planning codes. Add to that the role of councillors who may be lobbied by developers, and council officers who are anxious to increase potential rates income and attract businesses to their area, and we have a recipe for bargain-basement planning. There are of course councillors who support their constituents in trying to protect the environment, but too often they are a small minority. The recent case ofthe Westminster housing secretary Robert Jenrick overruling a local council to grant permission for a multi-million pound scheme by a Tory donor shows how easily even a government minister can be persuaded to make decisions that favour wealthy developers rather than protect the interest of people living in an area..We need a planning system that protects the environment, is not afraid to refuse unsuitable applications, and enforces breaches of planning law promptly and fearlessly. If it is a toothless bureaucracy then there is very little point in having it. If you have a planning system — and most people would agree that there should be one — it must be seen to be fair and to act in the public interest. It is not easy, but our planners should not allow the degradation of our built or natural heritages, should not pander to developers, and should valiantly seek to make Northern Ireland a better place in which to live and work. • Marcus Patton is an artist and architect——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityAs reported in the Penarth Times on Thursday, the town councilsaid the results show ldquowidespread backing for changes.The survey, which attracted  responses, showed  per cent of people thought there should be more outdoor space for pedestrians and businesses.Seventy-five per cent thought parking arrangements needed to change, and  per cent said the town needs to ldquoprepare for the future.Some traders, who oppose the changes ndash specically a one-way traffic system around the town and making Windsor Road and Lower Glebe Street a traffic free zone, have said the questions in the survey were too generalised and misleading.As a result of the survey, Penarth Town Council have proposed the following changes to the original ideas:Windsor Road from Arcot Street to the roundabout as a ldquoshared space for delivery vehicles and buses, with a mph speed limit.Lower Glebe Street as a ldquoshared space for delivery vehicles and disabled bays. Other vehicles should not use Lower Glebe Street as a through road.Bus stops will remain as they are. There were concerns over the impact of a bus stop on Hickman Road for traders, due to air pollution, noise pollution and congestion.A two-way system to remain on Stanwell Road from the library to the traffic lights, to allow easy access to the bus stop on Rectory Road and to prevent congestion and ldquorat running through Hickman Road and Arcot Street. A two-way system to also remain from Windsor Road to Railway Terrace.The number of parking bays has also changed. There will now be  extra bays proposed, with  of them on Plassey Street.The leader of the town council, Cllr Rhiannon Birch, explained the findings and what happens next.ldquoEven before Covid-, town centres across the country were facing issues, including the need to modernise infrastructure, and the impact of online shopping, she said. ldquoThe current pandemic has added to the scale of the challenge.ldquoThe consultation shows that a clear majority recognise the need for a degree of change in the town centre, both for it to survive in the present and to thrive in future.ldquoThe results call for the establishment of a greater degree of safe space and proposals which increase a degree of pedestrianisation whilst also increasing parking spaces.ldquoThe results show substantial agreement on these aims. Reflecting this widespread and clear response, Penarth Town Council calls on our partners in the Vale of Glamorgan Council to embrace the results and recommendations.ldquoSpecically, Penarth Town Council believes that creating a safer environment through the closure of Windsor Road to traffic for part of the day, between Arcot Street and the roundabout, including the Lower Glebe Street, would be the best way to ensure that people can feel confident about shopping safely. It would allow safe use of the space in front of shops, bars, cafes and restaurants.ldquoIt also lessens the need for one-way systems on pavements for pedestrians, which are perplexing for many and hard to implement. These proposals can be achieved in a way which also increases the amount of parking spaces available.The results will now be put to the Vales Planning Committee for consultation.For more information, visit https:www.penarthtowncouncil.gov.uk news survey-results Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.
