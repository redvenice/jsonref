What this company has done very recently is it has gone on and sold all your DNA data to a pharmaceutical company.\u0027She said the pharmaceutical firm had \u0027obviously paid quite a lot of money for this\u0027, adding that many \u0027positive things\u0027 could spring from data being sold on.\u0027You can get more personalised medicine from it.

That was the last straw. I cleaned it up myself.’Last week, the farmer decided ‘enough is enough’ and decided to fill in the access tunnel. He said: ‘Thirty years ago they respected the place.

They say my hands were forced.’Leigh Pocock, 20, a student living nearby who regularly visited the lake to swim and walk, told how its closure was ‘quite gutting’.

Aged seven, he said he wanted to become a missionary and he achieved his dream in sorts when he taught in Bangladesh after graduating from Oxford.Another of the Seven Up subjects, Symon Basterfield, who was in a care home from a young age, said he felt he and the other children were expected to fit the mould of their backgrounds, when they were first filmed.\u0027We (the children in care) were supposed to have aspirations to what we wanted in life, but the boys from wealthy backgrounds were encouraged to say their lives were plotted and planned. It was all hopes and dreams for us, but their lives were mapped out.\u0027         When I grow up: Charles Furneaux, left, went on to make documentaries of his own                     Giving back: Symon was in care when the show first aired and is now a foster parent himselfSymon\u0027s life began turbulently, he never knew his father and as a child of a mixed race relationship, he was often exposed to prejudice. He married and had five children but was orced by his thirties and badly affected by the loss of his mother, who died when he was 35. This meant he didn\u0027t take part in the documentary 35 Up. \u0027It\u0027s a period I don\u0027t want to talk about,\u0027 he said.He has since gone on to remarry and have another child and now works as freight handler. He and his second wife are foster parents at their home near Heathrow and have cared for more than 60 vulnerable children over the years.Like Symon, the life of Neil Hughes has taken turns that could never have been predicted. When he first featured appeared on television as a bright seven-year-old at his suburban school in Liverpool, he endearingly said: \u0027When I grow up I want to be an astronaut but if I can’t I think I’ll be a coach driver.\u0027                     Ups and downs: Neil Hughes had dreams of becoming an astronaut. He was a university drop out and homeless before turning his life around and running as an MPLater documentaries showed Neil had failed in his dreams to reach Oxford University and by his early twenties, he had dropped out of Aberdeen University and lived in a squat. Throughout his 30s, he struggled to earn a living and spent time homeless or on council estates in Scotland. However, he has since turned his life around and became a district councillor in Cumbria before standing as the Liberal Democrat candidate for Carlisle in the 2010 general election, where he finished third.Meanwhile, other participants did achieve their dreams. Tony Walker, who came from London\u0027s East End, did manage to become a jockey, albeit briefly, and raced against Lester Piggott before becoming a taxi driver.

Their destruction, fuelled by rampant consumption and obsession with economic growth, is accelerating.“The evidence is crystal clear: nature is in trouble. Therefore we are in trouble,” declared Sandra Díaz, who co-chaired the completion of a global assessment of bioersity published this week.There is a dual threat to life on Earth: species loss and climate change. The Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Bioersity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES) ranked the main factors causing species loss: changes in land and sea use exploitation of organisms climate change pollution and invasive alien species.These are “eroding the foundations of our economies, livelihoods, food security, health and quality of life worldwide”, and climate breakdown could soon become the main driver.Nature is being destroyed at such a rate that a million species are at risk. On the day the IPBES report made headlines, Dr Allan Mee of the Golden Eagle Trust checked for sightings of the Ring Ouzel in the MacGillycuddy’s Reeks in Co Kerry, one of just two of its remaining habitats in Ireland. “No birds located. Sad but likely witnessing local extinction of the species, once found in 28 Irish counties,” he tweeted. Pádraic Fogarty of the Irish Wildlife Trust replied: “This is mass extinction unfolding before our eyes.”How is the potentially lethal cocktail of bioersity loss and climate disruption going to impact on coming generations in contrasting parts of the globe? Equally, what does it mean for an animal that dominates the Irish landscape (the cow), and the majestic lion, not critically endangered yet rapidly disappearing?The baby born in IrelandConscious of what the next generation is facing, Australian Jim Scheer helped set up the FridaysForFuture climate action movement in Ireland, which is driven by young people. As for the babies of today, “their freedom is limited”, he believes. As a child, “the most I had to worry about was, ‘is there air in the tyres of my bike?’” he says.They are facing a whole different world of realities, a place where the First World problem of “where will I go on my holidays?” may be replaced by “where is my next meal coming from?”The issues weigh heavily on the current generation of young people, he believes, which is why “coming together to grieve” – a feature of recent protests – matters, and is part of telling the truth. There is much frustration too at the inaction of elders.“Uncertain” is the future of that child, says climate activist Dr Lorna Gold. Hope is emerging through the climate movement but, looking at the timelines required for transformational shift, there is “more and more uncertainty”.Children growing up in Ireland will be relatively protected, by location, wealth and assets they will have access to, “but even in the best-case scenario, it will be a diminished world.”This will be due to loss of species and a more complicated world, disrupted by climate and associated conflict, where Dr Gold fears the freedom to explore and travel in relative peace is undermined. It’s a place of learning from the internet rather than real life. The pluses will be better local connectedness with “their own earth” and nearby food production.That Irish child will never hear the corncrake or the curlew, says climatologist Prof John Sweeney, and, as they grow, they will be confronted with hard choices on lifestyle and mobility. The fossil fuel-driven car will be forced out by regulation, he says, but different ways of getting off the island, for example, will be needed if aviation does not overcome its emissions issues.By mid-century, most will live in green cities with an almost total absence of the private car. The transport revolution will be in urban areas but slower to come to the countryside until battery technology improves, Sweeney notes.A near zero-carbon world will mean less air pollution. Clean energy in their home and workplace will mainly come from offshore wind.A downside will be more extreme weather events attributable to climate change more intense storms and rainfall, increased flooding with sea level rises – and yet water shortages in summer.The child born today in Ireland – and the adult they become – will cope far better than their counterpart elsewhere.The developing world babyA baby born today in a developing country, on the other hand, will be at the frontline of climate disruption, says Christian Aid Ireland policy and advocacy adviser Jennifer Higgins. They will have to contend with stronger cyclones, warmer days and nights, more unpredictable rains and longer heatwaves.“Here in Ireland we will have the resources and ability to adapt and deal with these unprecedented weather events, but in many parts of the world, going to Tesco to stock up on sliced pan won’t be a possibility.”They will be the ones who will suffer the worst consequences of our inaction on climate change. “Sustained periods of unseasonably heavy rain can have a damaging impact on agriculture, causing the loss of topsoil and serious nutrient leaching,” says Higgins.In Ireland, save for the odd hosepipe ban, water is always on tap for domestic, industrial and agricultural use. “But in the developing world, where most people depend on agriculture to earn a living or just stay alive, it’s a scarce and precious resource.”Those living in coastal regions will suffer a loss of coral reefs, which half a billion people rely on for fish. For those born among indigenous communities in tropical rainforests, not only will they lose their homeland – already being eroded by increasing industrialisation – but there will be loss of habitat that acts as the lungs of the earth and regulates rainfall.Children will be most susceptible to the increasing diseases that a changing climate will leave in its wake, she adds. Their education may be disrupted when schools are used as shelters when disaster hits their communities.If temperatures increase in already hot areas, it will diminish scarce resources to sustain life and will force many to become refugees.But this may “dwarf numbers caused by conflict or political and economic necessity. When their land becomes uninhabitable because of drought, flood or sea-level rise, they will have to seek a safer place to live,” Higgins predicts.It may be a world where techniques such as conservation agriculture transform crop production and smartphone technology helps drive rural economies backed by deployment of cheap solar PV. But extreme weather events will continue to threaten food production, as seen with recent cyclones in southern Africa.Gold fears a business-as-usual approach means such circumstances can become an intractable problem very quickly, and says solutions are beyond most communities on cost grounds. Therefore the child is facing increased malnutrition, chronic hunger, dependency on external aid, and political instability – an existence marked by inequality and injustice.The IPBES report starkly outlines how indigenous peoples and the poorest are most reliant on land and sea for survival. The combination of land grabs by multinationals facilitated by corrupt governments, extreme climate events and bioersity loss add up to a very bleak future for their offspring, Gold concludes.The future of the cow Humans are not the only beings whose lives will change. The IPBES report emphasises that the effects will be felt first among animals and other living things.In Ireland, there are currently more cattle than people, and they are the most common large animal. For many, the cow (for beef and milk) is the bellwether of Irish agriculture and rural life. For others, it’s the problem because of associated carbon emissions.Teagasc’s head of communications, Eric Donald, says cattle numbers are currently a matter for inidual farmers. With no quotas, no policy instruments are in place. In future we are likely to have fewer beef and more dairy cattle.On emissions, Donald says there is wide acceptance of the need to implement mitigation measures – a process is already in train.Having a grass-based system to feed those cattle will be critical to sustainable farms from an environmental, economic and social perspective, Donald adds. Ireland will need to find export markets for 80 to 90 per cent of its product. Meat consumption may decrease on an inidual basis and there may be a shift to plant-based diets, but increased population growth will mean “demand won’t drop significantly”.But cattle will have to compete for space due to a more erse range of crops, land being used for bioenergy and afforestation (increasingly native woodlands and not just on marginal land) that will act as important carbon sinks, and hedgerows ensuring better bioersity and pollinator capacity.To question beef consumption may currently be an Irish “no-no”, but the reality is the consumers of tomorrow will be confronted by a wide range of new plant and synthetic proteins that will taste surprisingly good and be cheaper, which is likely to mean less red meat is consumed – in line with health guidelines.Eric Donald defends the pursuit of higher genetic quality as a means of increasing efficiency and lowering emissions, especially “because lifetime productivity is better”. With extending grazing seasons, it’s the key measure in improving farm sustainability guidelines. It also complements changes in fertiliser use and slurry management.But John Sweeney says the Irish cow is “reaching limits in terms of genetics”. Like pedigree dogs, they are less able to cope with change and stress compared with native species.Unquestionably, there will be fewer of them, he believes, “if we want to maintain bioersity for future generations”.Expansion in the cattle population has coincided with deterioration in water quality, with widespread glyphosate contamination (one study has found 20 per cent of Irish adults have traces of the herbicide in their urine), nitrates pollution and an emerging ammonia problem.“Continued expansion of the national herd is not compatible with this report. That’s where the crux comes.”The future of the lionJennifer Higgins joins in a lament for so many endangered mammals.Of all species threatened, IWT campaign officer Pádraic Fogarty is shocked by the latest indicators for hippos, giraffes and lions. In particular, “it would be an absolutely travesty if lions were to go extinct . . . The magnificent animal has permeated our culture and imagination, from children’s stories to the pillars on Trafalgar Square.”But maps don’t lie. In 1950 there were 400,000 lions in the wild. Today there are 23,000-39,000 lions in all of Africa, which is “extremely low” in global terms, when once they lived in Ancient Greece and North Africa, and became extinct in Greece only around 100BC.Outside of southern Africa, numbers of lions in 23 unfenced reserves in 11 countries are estimated to have dropped by 62 per cent between 1993 and 2014. Asia is home to a small subpopulation in the Indian state of Gujarat, where numbers are growing, but it’s just a pin on the globe.“There is no data to say that lions are about to disappear, but their populations are shrinking fast,” he explains. The species is classified as vulnerable but the slide into the “endangered” and then “critically endangered” categories looms, while “threatened with extinction” is applied to its current status.For Fogarty, the same pressures apply to other mammals, but the lion’s wellbeing is further undermined by gametrophy hunting and false western-world notions that it is somehow good for population numbers. All told, we are facing a scenario where lions will “shrink to a few corners of the planet”.What to doThis is not going to be sorted by putting bird tables in back gardens. The Ipbes report shows nature-based solutions can help bring “transformative change”, but there is a greater systemic problem.In the past 50 years, the human population has doubled, the global economy has grown nearly four-fold, and global trade has grown tenfold, together driving up the demands for energy, food and materials.Thinking that endless economic growth is possible and not valuing the essential services provided by nature is a delusion leading to catastrophe, Sweeney believes.“Until we get away from euros and cents and GDP, we will be in a cul-de-sac . . . Unless we rethink how we value the services provided by the natural world and include them explicitly in a wellbeing measure, we delude ourselves that a sustainable future is possible.”That was the core message in a submission this week to EU leaders meeting on the future of Europe by the European Environmental Bureau (EEB) and more than 200 academics, including John Sweeney, policy experts and civil society groups.There is an onus too on iniduals to act, according to EEB vice president Attracta Uí Bhroin. “It’s not enough for us to sit on the sofa and watch David Attenborough’s latest breathtaking and terrifying documentary and shake our heads. Every politician coming near your front door needs to know environmental sustainability is your priority, and must be Europe’s priority.”Fogarty hopes people now see the connections between climate breakdown and mass extinction, that they are two sides of the same coin. “We have all of the solutions to hand, but what we’ve been lacking is any sense of urgency to get on with it.”He senses momentum moving in the right direction, though the lack of a response from the Taoiseach or any Government minister “makes me feel that they are still hoping it’s an issue that will go away. We can’t really afford this level of disengagement when we need to be getting on with things.”Scheer is brutally frank about future voters born today. “I don’t think people get a choice of what games they play.”They will have to be focused on survival. “It feels as we have handed them a shitstorm.”As for the current generation, too many are stuck in business-as-usual mode. There is a need to raise consciousness quickly. “Ignorance is not a choice” given the IPBES report. “It’s not an opinion, it’s scientific. It’s happening.”Kevin O\u0027Sullivan is Environment and Science Editor and former Editor of The "},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3906835.1559046463!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"irish rail 20 000 commuters affected by major signal fault","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tDelays on trains in and out of Heuston Station in Dublin due to an earlier major signal fault.

Irish Rail spokeswoman Jane Cregan told RTÉ radio’s Morning Ireland earlier the, “the major signal fault has still not been rectified. A manual signalling system is now being operated... it took some time to get up and running as “signalling is extremely safety critical”. There will be knock on delays into and out of Heuston until mid morning.”In an earlier tweet, the company warned of disruption to all services in and out of Heuston, including NewbridgeHazelhatch to Grand Canal Dock trains and Portlaoise Commuter services. Dart, Commuter and Intercity services into and out of Connolly were not impacted except for the Phoenix Park tunnel service. Irish Rail admitted that there were “thousands and thousands” of commuters affected by this morning’s signal failure at Heuston Station.‘Thousands and thousands’Speaking to RTÉ radio’s Morning Ireland, Ms Cregan said the volume of passengers impacted made it impossible to provide a substitute bus service as is normal practice.“Thousands and thousands are impacted, there wouldn’t be a sufficient number of buses in the country to transport those passengers.”Ms Cregan acknowledged that some passengers were effectively stranded on trains that had already left their stations of origin, but the majority had not yet left the stations.People intending to travel with Irish Rail are being asked to monitor Irish Rail’s social media accounts for updates.Refunds  compensationIrish Rail has said passengers should look at the passenger charter to see if they are eligible for a refund. According to the charter, passengers are entitled to a compensation if they have been delayed for 60 minutes or more. Under EC regulation 1371, passengers will be offered discount vouchers to use for future tickets or the company can issue cash compensation.In delays of 60 to 120 minutes, weekly, monthly or annual ticket holders are entitled to 25 per cent cash refund for that day pro rata, based on cost of ticket.Intercity Single or Return ticket holders can choose between a 50 per cent in vouchers or 25 per cent in cash refund.If there delay is longer than 120 minutes, weekly, monthly or annual ticket holders can claim 50 per cent cash refund for that dayIntercity Single or Return ticket holders will receive 100 per cent in vouchers or 50 per cent in cash refund.To claim any discounts or refunds you’re entitled to, you need to fill in an application form, which is available from the ticket offices in main stations or from the PDF on Irish Rail’s website."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3906295.1558989088!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"dublin likely to back barnier as head of european commission","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tEU chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier: set for Government’s support in part because he has “done right by Ireland” during the Brexit negotiations. Photograph: Costas BaltasThe Government is likely to back Brexit chief negotiator Michel Barnier as the next head of the European Commission if, as expected, the bid of German Manfred Weber falters in the face of French opposition.EU leaders meet in Brussels on Tuesday to discuss who should lead the commission and also the Council of EU leaders for the next five years, while the next head of the European Central Bank will also be discussed. No decisions are expected that evening.Officially, the Government is backing Mr Weber “to the hilt”, says a spokesman, and the Taoiseach Leo Varadkar has repeatedly expressed his support. But privately senior officials acknowledge that his chances are falling away.Mr Weber is the candidate of the European People’s Party, to which Fine Gael is attached, and under the system known as “spitzenkandidaten” the largest group in the European Parliament should nominate the incoming head of the European Commission.However, it is the Council of EU leaders which actually makes the appointment – to be confirmed by a vote of the parliament – and French president Emmanuel Macron has made his opposition to Mr Weber clear. Weak candidateThough the EPP remains the largest party in the new European Parliament, it suffered significant losses in the elections – a development which will damage Mr Weber, already considered a weak candidate to head the commission, when current president Jean Claude Juncker retires in the autumn.The commission is the EU’s civil service and its policymaking engine. It is also charged with protecting the treaties.Mr Macron has been lobbying EU leaders on appointments to the EU’s top jobs and dined in Paris last night with the Spanish prime minister, Pedro Sánchez.Though other candidates, such as current competition commissioner Margrethe Vestager, the Dutch socialist Franz Timmermans or Belgian prime minister Charles Michel may be considered, Mr Macron is expected by many to back Mr Barnier, who is also French and a former EPP politician.Sources in Dublin and Brussels say they expect the Government will back Mr Barnier, who has “done right by Ireland” during the Brexit negotiations, according to one person familiar with the issue, if Mr Weber’s candidature falters.Two senior officials echoed this view, though another Brussels source said no decisions would be made on Tuesday. It is more likely, the source said, that it will become clear that Mr Weber will not be approved by EU leaders.Lobbying and jockeyingDocuments published by the European Council show the leaders expect to consult with each other over the coming weeks before reaching a decision at the council meeting in Brussels on June 20th-21st.Intense lobbying and jockeying for the senior EU roles is expected. The decision will be made by the leaders alone. Reports in Brussels said Mr Macron had been in contact with several EU leaders in recent days while, significantly, German chancellor Angela Merkel has remained silent on the issue since the election results, reports said.The EPP insisted after the elections that Mr Weber would have to be appointed, saying it had won the elections, but this was immediately disputed by the Alde group in the new parliament, which is allied to Mr Macron’s party. No party had won a majority, Alde said.Once the presidency of the commission has been decided, countries will begin to nominate their commissioners (there is one from each member state). The Irish commissioner, Phil Hogan, who holds the powerful agricultural portfolio, is expected to be reappointed for a second term.Full profiles and in depth analysis of the European election"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3906952.1559046110!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"european elections recount begins of 14th round of votes in dublin","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tFianna Fail candidate Barry Andrews (left) during the count of the Dublin Constituency of the European Elections at the RDS. Photograph: Niall CarsonPA WireThe 14th round of votes was the count on which Fine Gael’s Frances Fitzgerald was elected on the distribution of Labour candidate Alex White’s votes.The distribution of Mr White’s votes is now being recounted.The dispute could have a bearing on who takes the third and fourth seat in the constituency. Independents for Change candidate Clare Daly and Mr Andrews are in a fight for the third and fourth seats following the election of Ciarán Cuffe and Ms Fitzgerald.The fourth seat is effectively in limbo because of the Brexit impasse.Counting of votes in the Dublin constituency was suspended last night following a row over how votes should be distributed.Minister of State for Local Government and Electoral Reform John Paul Phelan said on RTÉ’s Today with Seán O’Rourke show he made a mistake in an earlier comments about the legislation.“It will be necessary to redistribute them ... Apologies for my misunderstanding. It was a real mea culpa moment.”“I doubted myself last night when I was reading the reports, mostly on social media, about what had happened, the law that was quoted actually wasn’t the updated law.“The updated law was amended by the 2019 Act which does require the distribution of both to determine the order of elections, because the order is important. Now, luckily it seems from the Tallymen, and this comes with the Tallymen kind of health warning, that the next announcement will be about the distribution of Gary Gannon’s vote, it seems likely to put Clare Daly ahead of Barry Andrews any way, I’m told.... But that comes with the usual caveats that apply.“It will mean it will be necessary to distribute surpluses that are remaining if they can affect the ranking of the candidates, but also the votes of the Sinn Féin candidate who will be the last man standing, if you like .“In order to determine the positioning of candidates that has to be done for the first time in this particular European election.Earlier on Monday the Minister of State had said on Morning Ireland that Ms Boylan’s votes should be excluded.Speaking at midnight, after the Dublin count was suspended, Ms Daly indicated the issue may end up in court.“Clearly they want time to think on it and not rush it. There was an issue when Fianna Fáil swept in here, that’s when an issue arose.”Ms Daly demanded to see the returning officer after being told that Fianna Fáil representatives were speaking to official staff about the distribution of votes.“I wasn’t the one who started this. I am not the one arguing. I would like the outcome of the election to reflect the way in which the voters of Dublin voted.“What I want to see is consistent and fair procedures across the board. I will do everything I have done to fight for this seat. I would like to take up this seat now, of course I would.”She said the Brexit situation is what makes the count potentially different.“It is an unusual scenario. Normally when people are elected, all seats are equal once people are elected. In this scenario they are not because the last recipient may never get that seat so there is a contest still ongoing. It is how you adjudicate on that, so it is new territory for everybody.”Asked whether the issue could be referred to the courts, she said: “Anything can, can’t it. When you are down to such small numbers, I would imagine that is the thinking behind the suspension. People are tired, the staff are tired, let them sleep on it.”Counting in the Ireland South and Midlands Northwest constituencies resumed at 9am.Green Party candidate Ciarán Cuffe was elected following the 13th count with 73,028 votes.Ireland SouthIn Ireland South no candidate reached the quota on the sixth count. Sitting Fine Gael MEP Sean Kelly is on 119, 380 votes just shy of the quota of 119,866. He is expected to be elected mid afternoon. Mr Kelly may well be the only candidate elected today in the constituency.Fianna Fail TD Billy Kelleher is on 84,803.

Five seats are up for grabs in Ireland South with a fight to the finish expected for the last spot.Seán Kelly said he was pleased to top the poll particularly given that his party fielded three candidates.“I didn’t really expect it. What you have to consider is that we had three Fine Gael candidates,” said Mr Kelly. “It is the only place where you had three candidates from one party so to head the poll in that circumstance is pretty satisfying alright.”Mr Wallace, a TD for Wexford, said he will remain “a thorn in the side” of the Government even if he wins a seat in the European Parliament.“If I go to Brussels I guarantee you will remain a thorn in the side of the Government here. I promise you that.”Mr Wallace said he expected to pick up a lot of votes on transfers. “I would expect to do well transfer-wise.

I think I have garnered respect for that from the people.”Midlands North West\u0026nbspIn Midlands North West Luke Ming Flanagan is on course to take the second seat in Midlands North West constituency but it could be tomorrow before he’s elected.\u0026nbspAfter the fifth count he’s on 87,333 - more than 20,000 short of the quota but he continues to stay ahead of Matt Carthy, Maria Walsh and Peter Casey.Armed with a clip board and the figures Mr Flanagan said he was sure he would be taking a seat.“I am probably the most transfer friendly along with Mairead McGuinness. I will be in line to get 27 per cent of Peter Casey’s number twos, 19 per cent of Saoirse McHugh’s numbers twos - I know these off my heart because we did the figures over the last few days and basically I will get elected to the next parliament,” he said.Matt Carthy, on 78,653 votes after count five, is predicting “a battle to the end”.“It’s going to go down to the last count with Maria Walsh, Saoirse McHugh, Peter Casey and Brendan Smith all there,” he said.After a dismal weekend for his party across the country it was no surprise that his first preference vote was down but few could have predicted that it would only be 77,619 - almost a 40,000 drop since 2014.“The big question is where did the Sinn Féin vote go? We have to ask ourselves big questions and more importantly find the answers,” said Carthy.He’s depending on transfers to get him across the line ahead of his nearest rival - Mayo’s Maria Walsh on 64,500.Peter Casey has 58,212 votes and Saoirse McHugh is on 53,068.Both Olive O’Connor and Dilip Mahapatra were eliminated after the fifth count and their votes will now be distributed but it won’t be sufficient to get anyone across the line.We’re looking at a long day of counting ahead.On Monday, Fine Gael’s Maireád McGuinness was the first of 13 Irish MEPs elected. The 59-year-old sitting MEP, first elected to the European Parliament in 2004, received 134,630 first preference votes, exceeding the quota by some 16,000 votes in the four-seater constituency.She came in well ahead of Independent Luke “Ming” Flanagan, who received 85,034 first preference votes, and her running mate Maria Walsh, the former Rose of Tralee, who received 64,500.MayorsElsewhere, Limerick carried proposal to directly elect mayors while both Waterford and Cork have rejected the proposals. The proposal was defeated by just 983 votes in Cork.Local electionsIn the local elections, just six local seats remain to be filled, one each in Cork County and Wicklow, and four 4 in Longford.The Green Party was the big winner having recorded its best ever election results while Sinn Féin was the big loser of the weekend.Sinn Féin lost seats on councils all over the country - and was wiped out on some local authorities - in a major reversal of fortunes compared to the last such elections five years ago.Party sources were braced to lose a huge number of seats.

Photograph: Niall CarsonPA WireThe Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has called the results of the European elections in Scotland an “emphatic rejection of Brexit” after talks in Dublin with Taoiseach Leo Varadkar.Ms Sturgeon said she was “pretty jubilant” about the results of the European elections in Scotland, where her party the SNP took three of the six seats, an improvement of one, and 20 per cent ahead of its nearest rivals.She met Mr Varadkar for talks that covered Brexit and other issues at Farmleigh today during a one-day visit to Dublin.She said the two leaders also discussed health policy, the citizens’ assembly and the economic links between the two countries.“But inevitably discussions were dominated by Brexit,” Ms Sturgeon told The .“The chances of a no-deal Brexit have increased but the chances of no Brexit have also increased,” she said. “And it’s hard to predict which one of those will be the outcome. But there’s every reason to believe the good outcome will prevail over the bad outcome.”Does she think the UK will leave?“I don’t know . . . but what I would say is I’m more hopeful than I’ve been up until now that there is a path to remaining through a second EU referendum,” she said. “I think there’s everything to play for.”Brexit a ‘disaster’Is Brexit an opportunity to push the SNP’s independence agenda?“I don’t see Brexit as an opportunity because I think it’s a disaster for Scotland. I think Scotland will become independent even if Brexit never happens. It may become independent a bit more quickly now because of Brexit, and I think what Brexit has exposed in the UK – the democratic deficit, the way Scotland’s interests have been so easily disregarded – has been eye-opening to a lot of people in Scotland. So I do think that the Brexit experience makes Scottish independence even more likely, and probably more likely to happen more quickly,” Ms Sturgeon said.She will introduce legislation in the Scottish Parliament this week to put the rules in place for a referendum to take place, she said. It is likely to take place next year. She is convinced it will pass.“In no small measure what we’ve witnessed in the past three years of Ireland’s experience of being influential and being supported by the European Union, while Scotland has been treated rather contemptuously by Westminster – I think that starts to shape people’s opinion and demonstrates to people the benefits of being, yes, a small country, but an independent country within the European Union,” she said.Full profiles and in depth analysis of the European election"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3906946.1559045209!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"germany s cdu leader finds election scapegoat a 27 year old youtuber","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tA clip from Rezo’s “The Destruction of the CDU” – an energetic, 55-minute slice-and-dice of 14 years of what he terms CDU’s “gross incompetence” in power. Screengrab: YouTubeChancellor Angela Merkel sparked snorts of derision for suggesting, in 2013, that “the internet is new terrain for all of us”.But nothing like the snorts directed at her successor as leader of Germany’s ruling Christian Democratic Union (CDU).After her party’s disastrous Sunday’s disastrous CDU European election result, its worst-ever result in a nationwide election, Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer appeared to shift part of the blame on to a video by “Rezo”, a 27-year-old YouTuber with blue hair.“The Destruction of the CDU”, is an energetic, 55-minute slice-and-dice of 14 years of what he terms CDU’s “gross incompetence” in power: on climate change, security, intellectual property rights and drugs policy that are “destroying our lives and our future”.One week and 12.7 million views later, support doubled for the Greens and slumped in the European election for the CDU. That party was never the first choice of young German voters but Kramp-Karrenbauer said the YouTube intervention raised questions about “whether analogue rules apply to the digital sphere, yes or no?”“What would be up in this country if, let’s say, 70 newspapers had said, ‘Let’s have a joint appeal: please don’t vote for the CDU . . ?’” she asked. “That would have been a clear influencing of opinion before the election.”German newspapers don’t make political party endorsements, out of tradition rather than legal impediment, though many have a clear editorial line favouring a spot on the political spectrum.Days after Germany marked 70 years of the Basic Law, its postwar constitution, even teenage bloggers are up in arms against the CDU leader, citing article five’s guarantee of the universal right “to express and disseminate one’s opinion in word, text and image”.Her political rivals have accused her of being a bad loser, and a senior Greens politician expressed hope “it’s just an expression of helplessness” towards politics in the digital age.Blistering broadsideWith jump cuts, high-speed rhetoric and a flood of charts and statistics, Rezo’s video is a blistering broadside against Germany’s dominant, self-described Europe party: “You say that young people should be political, then you have to handle it when they think your politics are shit.”The CDU leader’s first response to the video was sarcasm: “I asked myself why we weren’t for that matter responsible for the seven plagues in ancient Egypt. ”After her initial intervention struck a dud note, CDU digital producers spent a day working on and filming a reply video fronted by its youngest MP, also aged 27. But it was canned, with the rattled CDU afraid it couldn’t win on Rezo’s home turf, the “new terrain” of the internet. Instead the party invited the vlogger for a face-to-face conversation, an invitation he may not refuse after the CDU leader’s post-election intervention.As things spiralled out of control online, Kramp-Karrenbauer went online to dismiss as “absurd” claims that she was trying to strangle free discussion, a crucial part of democracy.“What we have to talk about are rules that apply in elections,” she wrote on Twitter.That triggered a fresh wave of sarcastic responses. News channel N-TV argued the video by Rezo, a vegan musician and son of two Lutheran pastors living in the southwestern city of Aachen, was “unfair and defames . . . but is completely free, permissible democratic opinion-shaping”. Through her response the CDU politician, meanwhile, looked like an “amateur province politician”.None of this would have happened to Angela Merkel: five years after discovering the “new terrain” of the internet, the chancellor still has no social media accounts."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3906991.1559044322!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"alastair campbell expelled from labour party after voting for lib dems","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tAlastair Campbell: “hard not to point out difference in the way anti-Semitism cases have been handled,” he said on YouTube.

Video: US defence department\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tLt Ryan Graves, one of five US navy pilots who said  they saw unidentified flying objects in 2014 and 2015 during training manoeuvres off the aircraft carrier USS Theodore Roosevelt. Photograph: Tony LuongThe New York TimesThe strange objects, one of them like a spinning top moving against the wind, appeared almost daily from the summer of 2014 to March 2015, high in the skies over the east coast of American. Navy pilots reported to their superiors that the objects had no visible engine or infrared exhaust plumes but that they could reach 9,000 metres and hypersonic speeds.“These things would be out there all day,” said Lt Ryan Graves, an FA-18 Super Hornet pilot who has been with the US navy for 10 years and who reported his sightings to the Pentagon and Congress. “Keeping an aircraft in the air requires a significant amount of energy. With the speeds we observed, 12 hours in the air is 11 hours longer than we’d expect.”In late 2014, a Super Hornet pilot had a near collision with one of the objects, and an official mishap report was filed. Some of the incidents were captured on video, including one taken by a plane’s camera in early 2015 that shows an object zooming over the ocean waves as pilots question what they are watching.“Wow, what is that, man?” one exclaims. “Look at it fly!”No one in the defence department is saying that the objects were extraterrestrial, and experts emphasise that earthly explanations can generally be found for such incidents. Graves and four other navy pilots, who said in interviews with the New York Times that they saw the objects in 2014 and 2015 in training manoeuvres from Virginia to Florida off the aircraft carrier USS Theodore Roosevelt, make no assertions of their provenance.The sightings were reported to the Pentagon’s shadowy, little-known Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Programme, which analysed the radar data, video footage and accounts provided by senior officers from the Roosevelt. Luis Elizondo, a military intelligence official who ran the programme until he resigned in 2017, called the sightings “a striking series of incidents”.The programme, which began in 2007 and was largely funded at the request of senator Harry Reid, the Nevada Democrat who was the Senate majority leader at the time, was officially shut down in 2012 when the money dried up, according to the Pentagon. But the navy recently said it currently investigates military reports of UFOs, and Elizondo and other participants say the program – parts of it remain classified – has continued in other forms.Giant Tic TacThe programme has also studied video that shows a whitish oval object described as a giant Tic Tac, about the size of a commercial plane, encountered by two navy fighter jets off the coast of San Diego in 2004.Leon Golub, a senior astrophysicist at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, said the possibility of an extraterrestrial cause “is so unlikely that it competes with many other low-probability but more mundane explanations”. He added that “there are so many other possibilities – bugs in the code for the imaging and display systems, atmospheric effects and reflections, neurological overload from multiple inputs during high-speed flight.”Graves still cannot explain what he saw. In the summer of 2014, he and Lt Danny Accoin, another Super Hornet pilot, were part of a squadron, the VFA-11 “Red Rippers” out of Naval Air Station Oceana, Virginia, that was training for a deployment to the Persian Gulf.Graves and Accoin spoke on the recordabout the objects. Three other pilots in the squadron also spoke about the objects but declined to be named. Graves and Accoin, along with former US intelligence officials, appear in a six-part History Channel series, “Unidentified: Inside America’s UFO Investigation”, to air from this Friday.The pilots began noticing the objects after their 1980s-era radar was upgraded to a more advanced system. As one fighter jet after another got the new radar, pilots began picking up the objects but ignoring what they thought were false radar tracks.“People have seen strange stuff in military aircraft for decades,” Graves said. “We’re doing this very complex mission, to go from 30,000 feet, ing down. It would be a pretty big deal to have something up there.”But he said the objects persisted, showing up at 9,000 metres, 6,000 metres, even sea level. They could accelerate, slow down and then hit hypersonic speeds. Accoin said he interacted twice with the objects. The first time, after picking up the object on his radar, he set his plane to merge with it, flying 300 metres below it. He said he should have been able to see it with his helmet camera but could not, even though his radar told him it was there.A few days later, Accoin said, a training missile on his jet locked on the object, and his infrared camera picked it up as well. “I knew I had it, I knew it was not a false hit,” he said. But still, “I could not pick it up visually.”At this point the pilots said they speculated that the objects were part of some classified and extremely advanced drone programme. But then pilots began seeing the objects.Look of shockIn late 2014, Graves said, he was back at base in Virginia Beach when he encountered a squadron mate just back from a mission “with a look of shock on his face”. He said he was stunned to hear the pilot’s words.“I almost hit one of those things,” the pilot told Graves.The pilot and his wingman were flying in tandem about 30 metres apart over the Atlantic east of Virginia Beach when something flew between them, right past the cockpit. It looked to the pilot, Graves said, like a sphere encasing a cube. The incident so spooked the squadron that an aviation flight safety report was filed, Graves said.The near miss, he and other pilots interviewed said, angered the squadron and convinced members that the objects were not part of a classified drone programme. Government officials would know fighter pilots were training in the area, they reasoned, and would not send drones to get in the way.“It turned from a potentially classified drone programme to a safety issue,” Graves said. “It was going to be a matter of time before someone had a midair” collision.What was strange, the pilots said, was that the video showed objects accelerating to hypersonic speed, making sudden stops and instantaneous turns – something beyond the physical limits of a human crew.Asked what they thought the objects were, the pilots refused to speculate. “We have helicopters that can hover,” Graves said. “We have aircraft that can fly at 30,000 feet and right at the surface.” But “combine all that in one vehicle of some type with no jet engine, no exhaust plume.”Accoin said only that “we’re here to do a job, with excellence, not make up myths”.In March 2015 the Roosevelt left the coast of Florida and headed to the Persian Gulf as part of the US-led mission fighting the Islamic State group in Iraq and Syria. The same pilots who were interacting with the strange objects off the US east coast were soon doing bombing missions over Iraq and Syria.The incidents tapered off after they left the United States, the pilots said. – New York Times"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/05/17/TELEMMGLPICT000147339863_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfy2dmClwgbjjulYfPTELibA.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"judges given new expenses policy telegraph discovers judiciary","story":"The Ministry of Justice approved expenses including shampoo and crockery.  Lord Chief Justice, Lord Ian Burnett, pictured, claimed for multiple journeys to and from his homeMinistry of JusticeThe judiciary are to be given a new expenses policy after The Daily  found that Britain\u0027s most senior judges have claimed for crockery, shampoo and a taxi to transport ceremonial robes on taxpayer-funded expenses.Expenses data released under the Freedom of Information Act shows how some of the most high-profile members of the judiciary in England and Wales have had claims for everyday items as well first-class trains approved, even though they receive a salary of at least £180,000.At present, judges are encouraged to follow the expenses policy for Ministry of Justice (MOJ) civil servants, and the judiciary has also set out specific guidance relating to travel, accommodation and relocation....To continue reading this articleAccess all Premium articles then only £2 per weekRegister for freeRegister or subscribe to continue readingAlready a subscriber?Newsletters and daily briefings30 days free, then £2 per weekUnlimited access to Premium articlesExclusive subscriber events and rewardsThe daily newspaper on your smartphone or tabletMinistry of JusticeHuman rights watchdog launches statutory investigation into Labour anti-SemitismBrexit latest news: Alastair Campbell expelled from Labour Party after backing Lib Dems at European electionsDoctors install replica bus stop inside hospital\u0026#39s emergency department to help dementia patients feel more relaxed Vince Cable now wields more power and influence in Brussels than Theresa MayComment: Tory leader hopefuls still don\u0026#39t get that being ready for no-deal is the only way out of this messLondon Bridge attackers did not become more aggressive through steroids, inquests hearComment: An underestimated Corbyn has just outfoxed Labour Remainers once againInheritance tax soars: seven vital (and legal) loopholes that can cut your billWife of Azeri banker spent £53k in one day at Harrods sandwich bar as part of £16m spreeComment: The next Tory leader faces a Brexit Catch 22 that could destroy the partyAustralian man jailed for 10 years over British backpacker gunpoint road trip ordealTrooping the Colour 2019: How the November weather brought about the Queen\u0026#39s summer birthday celebrationsRamadan 2019: Fasting, prayer and how Muslims celebrate the revelation of the KoranFar-right parties didn\u0026#39t surge in the European elections - but they are strong and stableHow a triumphant Matteo Salvini plans to build a new coalition of eurosceptics with Nigel Farage and Marine Le PenRare albino panda caught on camera in China for the first time everGavin and ​Stacey to return for Christmas specialBritish personal trainer \u0026#39found dead on lawn of house\u0026#39 in the BahamasGerman government U-turns to urge solidarity in wearing of Jewish kippa ahead of anti-Israel protestsThe \u0026#39s commemorative D-Day project - tell us your storyWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/technology/2019/05/13/TELEMMGLPICT000196956429_trans_NvBQzQNjv4Bq6B56EokmwVz8yO1uUcPB99UIvfx6lPoez-YFK6IWJbE.jpeg?imwid","title":"rollout facial recognition technology has terrifying implications","story":"San Francisco has banned the use of facial recognition technology by police – should Britain follow suit?Our MPs have some front.

By 2000 this figure dropped to almost 28,000.The country has now seen no new infections since 2013 and is the first nation in WHO Africa region to be declared malaria-free in more than 40 years – only  Mauritius, which achieved the goal in 1973, has also eliminated the disease in the region. “Algeria is where the malaria parasite was first discovered in humans almost a century and a half ago, and that was a significant milestone in responding to the disease,” said Dr Matshidiso Moeti WHO regional director for Africa.“Now Algeria has shown the rest of Africa that malaria can be beaten through country leadership, bold action, sound investment and science. The rest of the continent can learn from this experience,” she said. War on malaria | On the brink of a breakthrough?Algeria\u0027s success has been due to a combination of free malaria diagnosis and treatment and a well-trained health workforce. Similar factors have helped Argentina eradicate the parasitic disease – the second country in South America to do so following Paraguay last year. “Argentina reported the last indigenous case in 2010 and has demonstrated the commitment, the capacity within its health, laboratory and surveillance systems, and the necessary financing to prevent the re-establishment of malaria within the country”, said Dr Carissa F. Etienne, director of the WHO Pan American Health Organization.“I am sure that Argentina will serve as an inspiration and as an example for other countries of the Americas to achieve the elimination of malaria in the coming years,” she added. India and Rwanda have made huge progress in tackling malariaAccording to the 2018 World Malaria Report, China is also close to eradicating the disease and Rwanda, Ethiopia and Pakistan have reduced infection levels. The countries are a highlights in an otherwise gloomy global picture.

where the animal was spotted - told AFP it had no further details about the albino panda.More than 80 percent of the world\u0027s wild pandas live in Sichuan, with the rest in Shaanxi and Gansu province.There were about 548 giant pandas in captivity globally as of November, reported Xinhua.The number living in the wild has dwindled to fewer than 2,000, according to the World Wildlife Fund.Famed for its panda diplomacy, in which China dispatches the rare animals to other countries as a symbol of close relations, Beijing has invested in different programmes to protect its furry ambassadors in recent years.In 2018, China announced plans to create a bastion for giant pandas three times the size of Yellowstone National Park to link up existing wild populations and encourage breeding of the notoriously slow-reproducing animal.At least 10 billion yuan ($1.45 billion) had been budgeted for the Giant Panda National Park in mountainous southwestern China state-run China Daily reported.Pandas are currently listed as a vulnerable species, which means that while their survival is still threatened, conservation efforts have helped reduce their danger of extinction.Brexit latest news: Alastair Campbell expelled from Labour Party after backing Lib Dems at European electionsHuman rights watchdog launches statutory investigation into Labour anti-SemitismDoctors install replica bus stop inside hospital\u0026#39s emergency department to help dementia patients feel more relaxed Vince Cable now wields more power and influence in Brussels than Theresa MayComment: Tory leader hopefuls still don\u0026#39t get that being ready for no-deal is the only way out of this messLondon Bridge attackers did not become more aggressive through steroids, inquests hearComment: An underestimated Corbyn has just outfoxed Labour Remainers once againInheritance tax soars: seven vital (and legal) loopholes that can cut your billWife of Azeri banker spent £53k in one day at Harrods sandwich bar as part of £16m spreeComment: The next Tory leader faces a Brexit Catch 22 that could destroy the partyAustralian man jailed for 10 years over British backpacker gunpoint road trip ordealTrooping the Colour 2019: How the November weather brought about the Queen\u0026#39s summer birthday celebrationsRamadan 2019: Fasting, prayer and how Muslims celebrate the revelation of the KoranFar-right parties didn\u0026#39t surge in the European elections -

It would become the largest seaborne invasion in history.The military operation was years in planning, lasted over twenty days and gave the Allies a foothold that ultimately led to the liberation of Western Europe from Hitler’s rule. The beaches along the Normandy coastline are still referred to on maps and signposts by their invasion codenames and numerous cemeteries marking the sacrifices of the men and women who gave their lives in the conflict can be found in the surrounding area.  To mark the D-Day landings, former Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson earlier this year wrote an open letter to veterans inviting them to take part in the 75th anniversary commemorations. In the letter, he wrote: “It is our intention that this June we show you, our special generation, that we will never forget the debt we owe for the peace and freedom we now enjoy.”It is of the utmost importance that we, the British public - as friends, relatives and descendants of the many brave soldiers who served our country - pay tribute to them and take the opportunity to celebrate their history, through stories and physical artefacts from the time, to understand those who lived through it and how it has impacted not only British, but world history.With that in mind, and to mark the 75th anniversary, the  is asking its readers to send us their stories passed down from D-Day. Many of our readers will have had relatives and loved ones who also worked, fought and lived through the battle, while others might even be survivors.It’s these stories we want to hear and to tell. Using your letters, keepsakes and memories we hope to create a snapshot of life during the conflict and a worthy tribute to those who fought, lived and made the ultimate sacrifice on those fateful days in history.Send your D-Day letters, documents and memories in text or image format to yourstory@telegraph for a chance to be featured in our commemorative project.

This represented a 1,300 per cent increase from its price at the start of the yearWhatever the cause, analysts believe bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies will continue to see more price gains in the coming months.A panel of cryptocurrency experts put together by finance firm Finder predicted bitcoin would be trading at around $9,659 by December 2019.Nearly half of the panellists also forecast that bitcoin’s current surge would see its price exceed its record high of close to $20,000, which it reached in December 2017.However, half of the panellists said the market surge would be followed by a similar price crash that occurred in 2018.\u0026nbspFor more than 12 months following its record high, bitcoin saw its price fall and stagnate before finally showing signs of recovery earlier this year.For bitcoin to maintain such a high value it will need to see advances in its usability as a form of mainstream currency, according to Fred\u0026nbspSchebsta, co-founder of cryptocurrency brokerage firm HiveEx,.While I believe bitcoin will rise a little further this year, usability still has a long way to go before real value will exist, he said.It is also possible that we may see another crash like what we saw in December 2017, when bitcoin dropped by roughly 40 per cent within a few days. But long-term, bitcoin and other digital currencies are very likely to stick around and change the way we do banking.The cryptocurrency may face competition from other digital currencies, rumoured to be in development by major tech companies like Facebook.Last week, details about Facebook\u0027s GlobalCoin cryptocurrency were revealed, pointing to a potential launch date of 2020.Why is Facebook launching its own cryptocurrency to rival bitcoin?If successful, Facebook would be able to use its user base of more than 2 billion people to\u0026nbsppush its growth to levels never seen by bitcoin.The launch of GlobalCoin is all about Facebook monetising its huge user base in a new way, Simon Peters, an analyst at the online trading platform eToro, told\u0026nbspThe Independent.What Facebook will charge in terms of fees remains unclear, but if it is cheaper and easier to use than traditional payment methods or even certain cryptocurrencies, it could reinvent itself as the go-to place for online payments.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

This new small team is exploring different applications.How would GlobalCoin work?It is understood that the value of GlobalCoin will be pegged to a handful of established currencies, like the US dollar and euro, in order to avoid the price volatility issues that continue to plague bitcoin.It remains unclear whether Facebook\u0027s cryptocurrency will be decentralised like bitcoin. Industry experts have questioned whether the social network would launch a digital currency that was out of its control, despite advocates considering decentralisation a key tenet\u0026nbspof cryptocurrency.Bitcoin now accepted at Starbucks and dozens of other shopsMark Zuckerberg doesn\u0027t have an idea how to implement it where Facebook doesn\u0027t own it, Phil Chen, who masterminded the HTC Exodus blockchain smartphone, said in March.Cryptocurrencies are open, decentralised, censorship resistant and borderless – this is completely antithetical to the current business model of big technology companies, whose walled gardens mean they essentially own their customers.Facebook is also currently planning a merger of its other social media platforms, which include Instagram and WhatsApp, meaning GlobalCoin could be transferred between\u0026nbspa variety of apps. Both the merger and the cryptocurrency launch are expected to take place at some point in 2020.Rival messaging apps are also working on their own cryptocurrencies, with Telegram expected to launch its so-called GRAM cryptocurrency later this year.Competing with ChinaOne explanation to why Facebook feels the need to have its own currency lies in a country where Facebook and its various apps aren\u0027t even allowed: China.In order to compete on a global scale with the social networks and messaging apps spreading out of China, its own form of currency could give Facebook the upper hand.Corporate lawyer and fintech expert\u0026nbspTim Bird, who has worked closely with Facebook in the past, said he believed\u0026nbspGlobalCoin\u0026nbspwould give Facebook a new hold over advertising revenues thanks to the massive amounts of data it could generate.Ever since I spent a day working in Facebook HQ in Menlo Park, California, three years ago, it has been evident that they feel the need to challenge China, Bird told\u0026nbspThe Independent.To do this, Facebook needs a currency or payment platform of its own.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

David Barnett reports\u0026nbspClick to followThe IndependentJoy Division: (left to right) Ian Curtis, Bernard Sumner, Stephen Morris and Peter HookIt’s a big year for fans of Joy Division and New Order. This summer marks 40 years since the former’s debut album Unknown Pleasures, their only LP released before the suicide of lead singer Ian Curtis, aged 23, in May 1980. The surviving members – bassist Hook, guitarist Bernard “Barney” Sumner and drummer Stephen Morris – transformed themselves into New Order that year, joined by Gillian Gilbert on keyboards, with Sumner taking over vocals. It’s 30 years since the band released Technique. It was their their fifth album, but the one that propelled them to the top of the charts and into proper stardom, influenced by the Balearic sound of house music.Everybody, it seems, has a Joy Division or New Order story to tell, as evidenced by the books released this year. Jon Savage’s This Searing Light, the Sun and Everything Else is an “oral history” of Joy Division, published by Faber in April. Drummer Stephen Morris has his memoirs, Record Play Pause, out this month. Dave Haslam, one-time DJ at Manchester’s Hacienda club, the focal point of the so-called Madchester scene of the late 1980s and early 1990s, mentions his love of both bands in his recent autobiography, Sonic Youth Slept On My Floor.“Hooky”, you might be unsurprised to hear, doesn’t have a lot of truck with any of them. We meet in a Costa in Alderley Edge, a leafy little town in Cheshire, only 20 miles away, geographically, from Salford, where Hooky and Bernard Sumner grew up, but half a world away in other respects.He’s lived here for 20 years, and as we find a quiet corner of the coffee shop, I mention in passing that I took my 14-year-old daughter to listen to Haslam reading from his book a few weeks ago. “Well, when she grows up she’ll never forgive you,” he says.Created with Sketch.Caught on film: Joy Division on tour in 1979 Show all 13Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Hooky perhaps has a reputation for abrasiveness, for speaking his mind, for not taking any crap. He and New Order parted ways in 2007 and don’t appear to be on good terms. I mention that Haslam had spoken fondly of him, which he finds hard to believe. Has he read Haslam’s book?“I haven’t read many good Manchester books,” he says. “I think my favourite is Bez’s. I’ve got Mark E Smith’s on my shelf but not got round to it yet.”Peter Hook to perform Joy Division albums in full at UK showsJoy Division’s Bernard Sumner’s memoir recalls the death of bandmateHooky himself wrote Unknown Pleasures: Inside Joy Division, published in 2012, and he says he did so as a direct response to the author and journalist Mick Middles’ 1996 book, From Joy Division to New Order. “That Middles book was a crock of f**king shit but he inspired me to write my own,” he says. “I suppose I’m in the unenviable position of being too close to the whole thing.”I wave Jon Savage’s book at him and he shakes his head. “That is particularly annoying that one, it’s Joy Division in their own words but a lot of it’s just lifted from when we did the Joy Division documentary. Those interviews were from the Control interview, Faber bought them lock stock and barrel without our permission, without even a f**king charity donation. He had access to the whole transcripts. Didn’t make sense to me, especially from Jon Savage who you’ve known for 40 f**king years. We weren’t party to how it was done in any way shape or form so it’s just another annoyance.”Does a lot of stuff annoy Peter Hook generally? He shrugs. “It’s not that bad after a while. You just get used to it. You get to that bit where nothing surprises you. I mean, I’ve had a few fracas with Jon because he sided with them lot and excluded me which I felt was really unfair, especially when I used to tow his f**king car back so our kid could fix it. So yeah… people have short memories.”There’s a chapter in Dave Haslam’s book where he details being commissioned by NME to interview New Order, a band of which he describes himself as “a devotee, bewitched by them”. Haslam interviewed the band in 1986 at their recording studio in Cheetham Hill afterwards, Hooky gave him a lift back into Manchester city centre. Haslam had taped the interview but something went wrong his tape was blank. In a panic, he sat down in a cafe and tried to write down everything again from memory, commenting:\u0026nbsp“No one knew how I’d crafted the quotes by New Order.”Tales grow in the telling. Legends get embellished. Stories take on a life of their own. “Yeah,” concedes Hooky. In 2010 he wrote a book called The Hacienda: How Not to Run a Club, and says he initially wanted to do it on interviews with the principal characters. “What I found which was really weird, when I started talking to a few people I very quickly realised that everybody had a different memory of the single occasion, so I thought f**k this, I’m going to have to do it on my own. And you find even though you think something is true you can be contradicted by people.”As an example, Hooky cites his auctioning off earlier this year of all his old Joy Division and New Order memorabilia, to raise money for the Epilepsy Society (Ian Curtis suffered from it) and Calm, the charity aimed at tackling suicide, especially among men. He put a bell tree percussion device in the lots, saying it had been used on the Joy Division track Atmosphere. Drummer Stephen Morris, who would have used it, disputed the fact.Hooky says, “I think you’d have to be deaf not to realise that a bell tree made the sound and it wasn’t a tambourine stuck on a pair of scissors. But that is an example of how people can remember completely different things. Normally it doesn’t lead to that level of aggro but it is quite shocking really because there is no truth, the only truth really is your truth. You’re not gonna lie. I’m sure Stephen Morris thinks it was but, y’know, in my opinion he’s wrong, and you have to go with your own truth otherwise you’d never get through life. It is interesting the way you can have completely different ideas.”V97 with Monaco (PA)There’s a sense when talking to Peter Hook that his often cutting remarks about the people he’s shared some of the last 40-odd years with are, in a way, a defensive tactic, that there’s been so many wars of words since New Order split that he’s getting his jabs in first. At one point I ask him what would happen if Bernard Sumner walked into the Costa we were sitting in, and he laughs uproariously and says, “You’d need your camera, mate!”But it’s obvious he loves the music. He’s rarely been without a band or project since he started while New Order were still going he worked with another Factory band, Ad Infinitum. When New Order had their first break-up in 1993, he started two new bands, Revenge and Monaco. New Order reformed for almost a decade from 1998, during which time Hooky began to develop his DJing career, which now sees him about to embark on a tour with Hacienda Classical, kicking off on 8 June at Scarborough’s Open Air Theatre.Classical accompaniment to pop and dance music is something of a thing right now, but this is the fifth year of the Hacienda Classical concept, which combines the live orchestral music of the Manchester Camerata with DJs recreating the sounds of the nightclub’s heyday. If you think that sounds a bit weird, then you wouldn’t be on your own.Camerata Orchestra performing Hacienda Classical (Rex)The idea had been pioneered by DJ Todd Terry in the States, and British DJ Pete Tong had started doing it over here. “Pete Tong was doing it more as a concert, songs finishing and starting. Graeme’s idea was to do it as a DJ mix, just the same as it would be in a club, so once you started you didn’t stop,” says Hooky.That caused some problems with some venues because they wanted an intermission in which to make up the takings on the bar. “But we felt it was more intrinsic to the spirit of the Hacienda to be complete it starts and it finishes, you’re f**ked and you go home and you recover. It was that depth of feeling that you wanted from what we were doing.”The orchestra plays live and the sound is mixed by the DJ in to the classic Hacienda club tracks, with live vocalists. Hooky gets a bit of fire in his eyes that’s impossible to fake just for PR purposes as he waxes lyrical over the gigs. “A lot of these songs you’ve grown up with and they’ve marked many, many special occasions in your life… death, kids, meeting the missus, losing the missus … it’s very charged, it’s very physical, and people f**king love it. And it gives all us old people the excuse to live our youth again, get a babysitter, have the kids tucked up at home, and fearing what you’re going to feel like the next morning.”Hooky started DJing in 2004, doing it full time in 2007 when New Order split for the second time. He says, “I started doing it out of necessity because I had no money at that point, as New Order we’d not worked for a bit. I mainly do dance music and I get in a lot of trouble because everybody expects you to play the f**king Stone Roses and the Happy Mondays ad infinitum.Madchester’ hub\u0026nbsp(Rex)“The other fantastic thing is most DJs are sober and they’re always on time, which is f**king fantastic. If I’m on at 9 o’clock I know the DJ before me will finish at 8.59.59. You play with groups and they’re always f**king late, nobody arguing about who goes on last and all that crap. It’s very courteous. The rivalry comes with you wanting to play a better set.”So he’s looking forward to hitting the road with the Hacienda Classical Tour, which takes in the Royal Albert Hall and the Isle of Wight Festival among its dates. But Hooky has a special soft spot for the tour opener, Scarborough.“Scarborough is a great place,” he enthuses. “I DJ’d in that old place on the pier the last time I was there. They were nuts. And I never realised how beautiful Scarborough was. Scarborough actually reminded me insanely of Palma, Majorca. I couldn’t believe how beautiful it was. All that European money, innit? And they won’t be getting that any more.”Ah, here it is. We look at each other cautiously over our coffee cups. Ageing rock stars and Brexit. You never know how that one’s going to pan out, do you? Morrissey calling the referendum result “magnificent” and Johnny Rotten in a “make America great again” T-shirt.“Look,” says Hooky, who lives in Majorca for half the year and has ambitions to do that full-time. “I’m a traveller. I go all round the world all the time and I do think it’s important in this day and age for us all to stick together, and not to be fragmented. I think that’s the worst thing that could happen to anybody and I think it exacerbates differences and things like immigration and racism.“I just think it’s the wrong way of pursuing a modern life. It’s old-fashioned, and honestly if you found someone who still thought it was a good idea then they’re a f**king idiot because it’s been proved that our government can’t handle it, which is an embarrassment. I was sat there last week doing a Euro news interview and the guy’s going, ‘What’s happening with Brexit?’ and I haven’t a f**king clue but there’s one thing I do know that if I was doing my job as shit as them I’d be stood on me own in a concert hall. There’d be no audience, right, and that’s what makes me laugh about it. Our government is selfish, it’s only interested in power, personal power, personal politics, and the country is just an absolute f**king embarrassment.”He pauses, then shakes his head and adds, “David Cameron should be torn apart by an angry mob. Theresa May had\u0026nbspthe balls to try to stay in office and say I’ll see it out, not like that shithouse.”Though DJing with the Hacienda Classical tour will dominate this summer, Hooky does of course still keep his bass arm working, primarily with Peter Hook and The Light. That started in 2010, around the 30th anniversaryof Ian Curtis’s death, the same year he opened a new nightclub, The Factory, in the old\u0026nbspoffices of Factory Records\u0026nbspin Manchester. The Light performs Joy Division and New Order tracks, as they were meant to be heard, faithfully following the order of the songs on the albums.“I literally only booked one gig, which was at The Factory, and it was supposed to be a one-off celebration and we ended up doing two nights and we started getting loads of interest,” he recalls. “We hadn’t booked anything until we played, it all came out as a result of that and it was wonderful. I’d not played Joy Division songs for 30 years ... to actually start playing them was absolutely fantastic because we hardly ever did them as New Order.”According to Hooky, New Order “buried Joy Division along with Ian”, and they would only very occasionally revisit the old stuff, such as when manager Rob Gretton asked them to play Love Will Tear Us Apart “because it’s f**king so-and-so’s birthday”. He says, “I think we played in our whole career of New Order about three Joy Division songs.”That changed in 2006 when New Order played the first Manchester Versus Cancer gig, an initiative set up by Andy Rourke of The Smiths. They played a full set of Joy Division tunes. “It was absolutely fantastic, it was delightful, absolutely delightful to do,” says Hooky. “But I don’t think Barney liked doing it and I understand that. He wanted to do his own lyrics, he wanted to do his own songs, which makes perfect sense. But it was a frustration, because you’re sort of given something back for a moment and then it’s snatched off you again.But Hooky had developed a taste for performing the Joy Division songs he hadn’t played for 30 years, and The Light was born. In May 2020 The Light will perform the two Joy Division albums, Unknown Pleasures and Closer, in full, at the Manchester Apollo and the Brixton Academy. Again, they will be benefiting the Epilepsy Society and Calm. It will be 40 years, almost to the day, since Ian Curtis died.Without taking anything away from any of the musicians Hooky has worked with (his own son Jack has played with Monaco and The Light), I wonder if it wouldn’t just be simpler – and more satisfying for fans – to get the old band back together again to play these classic songs?We’re just a bunch of old men who are arguing, and we seem happy to keep doing that. But I do feel more and more that... well, life’s just too short, isn’t it?Hooky thinks for a long moment before musing, “With any group you’re always going to get a problem if the members of the group don’t get on. Look at The Smiths the only two that make most money out of it are Morrissey and Marr. It’s a great shame.”I wonder out loud what The Smiths would be like if they were still together as a band today. Hooky looks at me. “Well, what would New Order be like if they were going today?”And could that be a thing?“What happened at the end of New Order was that Bernard and I had completely different ideas about the group, the music, the attitude to business, and they were that far apart,” he says holding his hands wide. “And the only thing in the middle was Stephen. I had the opinion that Steve agreed with me and then found out afterwards that he seemed to agree with Bernard so I’m looking forward to his book for an explanation of that.“Then they reformed behind my back, and licensed the assets to themselves. Which is not exactly the most honourable thing to do but...” He shrugs. “It’s survival.”There was a long-running court case over Hook’s claim of lost royalties after the band’s “restructuring”, which was settled out of court in 2017. Bernard Sumner, Stephen Morris and Gillian Gilbert continue under the name New Order.Three decades since Technique, 40 years since Unknown Pleasures. Next year will be the 40th anniversary\u0026nbspof Ian Curtis’s death. Is there any change of a reconciliation on the horizon at all? Over the course of the interview, Hooky seems to have mellowed away from his initial defensive-offensive tactic of getting his attacks in first, albeit done with wry humour as they were. Now he seems almost reflective.“You asked me earlier what would happen if Barney walked in here,” he says. “We’re just a bunch of old men who are arguing, and we seem happy to keep doing that. But I do feel more and more that... well, life’s just too short, isn’t it?”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Kind of (barely), because it’s a lyrical tribute to “straight-talking London town”, which suited the group just fine. The vivacity of these five young women is arguably only more forceful on “Wannabe”. “Spice Up Your Life” was clumsy in its approach as “a song for the world”, with Latin influences and a Bollywood-inspired video, but the energy of the song is what makes it – the result of the five members recording the track in one chaotic afternoon.Despite the rather bizarre safe-sex disclaimer (“Be a little wiser, baby Put it on, put it on”), “2 Become 1” boasts a beautifully textured arrangement and unpolished vocals that capture the group’s unique character. On Spiceworld, “Viva Forever” was a surprisingly moving ballad that reflected on a past love. With the context of Baby Spice (Geri Halliwell) departing from the group with little-to-no warning for fans, many now use it as a fond reflection on what the Spice Girls contributed to pop culture.

A war cry that heralded the dawn of the Girl Power movement, and one of the most enduring pop songs of all time. “Wannabe” is the catchiest of all the Spice Girls songs, and through those defiant, half-laughing spoken word moments you understand why so many fans were desperate to be part of the gang.

They appear to be able to execute manoeuvre\u0026nbspthat human pilots would never be expected to pull off: rotating in the air, and accelerating and stopping at possibly fatal speeds.The latest reports are just the latest in a series of mysterious and unexplained reports of UFOs by US pilots. They have become so prevalent – and so little appears to be understood about where they have come from – that the US Navy has changed its reporting procedures in an attempt to learn more about where they are coming from.The pilots involved have said they will not speculate on the origin of the aircraft. We’re here to do a job, with excellence, not make up myths, one told the New York Times, which interviewed five pilots about their previously undiscussed experience.Created with Sketch.Gadgets and tech news in pictures Show all 40Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Samsung will cancel orders of its Galaxy Fold phone at the end of May if the phone is not then ready for sale.

Experts say that any alien explanation is unlikely, though they have not yet been able to rule it out, but it is more likely that it is the result of more mundane effects like bugs in the tracking systems and cognitive overload from such intense flights.US Navy unveils major response to UFO sightingsThe new reports come from pilots who had been flying through 2014 and 2015 over the East Coast of the US.Pilots first became aware of the craft when it showed up on radar tracking systems, they said, and initially thought it was the result of a secret drone programme. But they became more mysterious when they started seeing them in real life.One pilot said that he had almost crashed into one of the objects, which was described as looking like a sphere encasing a cube. Because the pilots were in danger of hitting the objects, they complained that if the craft were part of a secret programme it could be putting their lives at risk.In one of the sightings, which was captured on video, a pilot said he had nearly crashed into an object that was flying at a shocking speed. In the footage, pilots express wonder at the objects\u0027 flight, exclaiming:\u0026nbsp“Wow, what is that? and Look at it fly!”One of the pilots said that the planes appeared able to stay in the sky far longer than any known aircraft would normally be able to.“These things would be out there all day,”\u0026nbspRyan Graves, a pilot who has flown with the Navy for more than 10 years and reported his sightings to the US government,\u0026nbsptold the NYT. “Keeping an aircraft in the air requires a significant amount of energy. With the speeds we observed, 12 hours in the air is 11 hours longer than we’d expect.”And they were flying in ways that could kill a human crew, seeming to accelerate, stop and turn almost instantly.The pilots, who all refused to comment on what the craft could be, said the reports stopped after they moved out of US airspace.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

We now request the EHRC to look at all the evidence and investigate this matter with great urgency.”The complaint includes allegations of Islamophobia among MPs, an “atmosphere of hostility” against Muslim Conservatives, failed complaints processes and an overall denial that Islamophobia is a major issue for the party.Miqdaad Versi, of the MCB,\u0026nbspquestioned whether any of the contenders in the Tory leadership race would “prioritise dealing with the sheer scale of Islamophobia that has consumed the Conservative Party”.Tory Party faces 110 allegations of Islamophobia and racismWatchdog gives Tories one month to respond to Islamophobia complaintsGovernment rejects proposed definition of IslamophobiaThe Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC), requested more information from the Conservatives on the issue earlier this month.The watchdog, which enforces equality laws, has the power to take action in court.The call for an Islamophobia probe came as the EHRC announced a formal investigation over antisemitism in Labour on Tuesday.\u0026nbspIt will determine whether the party “has unlawfully discriminated against, harassed or victimised people because they are Jewish”.The government was accused of disregarding the “safety and security of British Muslims” after rejecting a definition of Islamophobia put forward following a parliamentary inquiry.\u0026nbspJames Brokenshire pledged to “arrive swiftly at a collective position” earlier this month, after senior police officers raised concern about the potential impact on counterterror powers.Labour MP Wes Streeting, co-chair of the All Party Parliamentary Group on British Muslims said the government has “no more credibility to define Islamophobia than the Labour Party had to redefine antisemitism”.“I have watched, with some amazement and even greater despair, the Conservative Party making exactly the same mistakes over Islamophobia as my party has with antisemitism,” he told the House of Commons.The decision came days before research found that more than 100 people claiming to be Conservative Party members had posted Islamophobic or racist comments online.The MCB has repeatedly called for an independent inquiry into prejudice and the handling of complaints within the party.Conservatives risk repeating Labour’s mistakes on antisemitismDozens of members have been suspended for posting Islamophobic comments on social media, including many directed at leadership contender Sajid Javid.The Conservatives were condemned after reinstating some councillors who had been suspended over racist or prejudiced social media posts.​The government’s commitment to combating anti-Muslim hatred was questioned in the wake of the Christchurch terror attack, when mosques revealed they had been refused security funding.\u0026nbspWhile the government doubled the pot open for bids from different places of worship, it did not bring the funding up to the £14m awarded specifically to Jewish institutions.Muslim worshippers outside a mosque were targeted in the Finsbury Park terror attack and a man who planned to bomb another mosque in south London was jailed in April.Other incidents have seen women wearing headscarves run over in “revenge” for Islamist atrocities, and a man plough a car into an Indian restaurant because he wanted to “kill a Muslim”.Since the Westminster attack in March 2017, 14 Islamist and five far-right terror plots have been foiled in the UK.\u0026nbspLast week, the Home Affairs Committee was told that more than half of rising hate crime offences recorded by police in England and Wales are committed against Muslims.Muslim Council of Britain\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspEquality and Human Rights Commission\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspThe latest news on Brexit direct to your inboxThe latest news on Brexit direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

I\u0027ve always argued that it\u0027s perfectly possible that Leave would win again, but we\u0027re supporting a People\u0027s Vote strongly now because it\u0027s the right thing to do and it\u0027s the democratic thing to do.Pressure on the Labour leadership ratcheted up several notches after\u0026nbspthe party lost supporters to the Liberal Democrats and Green Party in the EU elections, leaving Labour with just 14 per cent of the vote.Hours after the results were announced, Ms Abbott tweeted: We have to take the time to analyse the EU vote. But, when we come in third after the Brexit Party, that is a clue something is wrong with our strategy. We need to listen to our members and take a clearer line on a public vote.Created with Sketch.

Kissing the crucifix attached to the beads, he hailed what he claimed was a ine intervention.\u0026nbsp“I thank those above, not for helping Matteo Salvini and the League\u0026nbspbut for helping Italy and Europe to rediscover hope, pride, roots, work and security,” he said.To the irritation of the church hierarchy, the interior minister and deputy prime minister has frequently invoked Catholic symbols at rallies, casting himself as a defender of Europe’s Judeo-Christian roots against mass Islamic immigration, and the champion of conservative family pro-life values.This core message seems to have paid off with voters, with his right-wing Lega Nord (Northern League)\u0026nbspparty bagging 34 per cent of the vote –\u0026nbspdouble their haul at national elections a little over a year ago. In contrast, the League’s partners in the coalition government, the anti-establishment Five Star, received only 17 per cent, an almost exact reversal of fortunes for the two parties.While the election outcome doesn’t change the make-up of the Italian parliament, it marks a seismic shift in power between the coalition partners, and underscores Salvini’s position as Italy’s most influential politician.Created with Sketch.

From today he will be even stronger, a prime minister in all but name,” says Pierluigi Testa, director of the Trinita dei Monti think tank in Rome.Salvini’s success is in part down to widespread approval of the tough stance taken by his ministry on immigration, closing Italian ports to migrant rescue vessels and passing restrictive asylum legislation. The policy changes have been accompanied by fiery and unapologetic rhetoric from Salvini, who has cultivated his strongman persona effectively via social media.The League’s dominance in the European elections is all the more remarkable given their origins as a regional movement campaigning for the secession of the north of Italy from the south, which its leaders (Salvini included) characterised as lazy and venal, sponging off the industrious north.Votes for the League increased threefold in the south, twice in the centre and 1.5 times in the north, according to calculations of official data by Lorenzo De Sio, professor of political science at Luiss University in Rome.\u0026nbsp“The League has gained consensus in the south\u0026nbspwhere he has managed to appear plausible and acceptable,” says De\u0026nbspSio.How Silvio Berlusconi has managed to re-enter politicsSalvini also benefited from Five Star Movement’s failure to deliver the revolution they had promised their voters. Both\u0026nbspregarded as “insurrectionist”,\u0026nbspthe parties have made for uneasy bedfellows. But in terms of perception, Five Star have come off worst, having reneged on key environmental pledges one after another – such as the cancellation of the high speed railway line between France and Italy, and the closure of a toxic steel plant in Taranto. They also failed to do away with making vaccines obligatory.For me our government allies are friends, and from tomorrow we will get back to work with serenity and softer tones\u0026nbspThere had been speculation in the run-up to the vote that a decisive League win could shift the balance of power and undermine the year-old coalition. The election campaign became acrimonious, with the League and Five Star fiercely attacking each other. But Salvini on Monday appeared keen to stress that the government would remain unchanged for now. “For me our government allies are friends, and from tomorrow we will get back to work with serenity and softer tones.”It is unclear how he will capitalise on his new momentum: he could demand a reshuffle of the cabinet. His hand has been decisively strengthened in negotiations over government policies, giving him more leverage to fulfil his ambitions to curb illegal immigration and introduce a flat tax in Italy.In fact, Salvini has wasted no time flexing these muscles. The League’s success will ensure\u0026nbsptheir flagship policies – tax cuts, financial autonomy\u0026nbspand the fight against immigration – will all be carried out, said\u0026nbspon Monday morning. The Italians have given us “a strong mandate to go and get things done”.The risk for Five Star is that concessions wanted by their League partners, such as tax reductions for the wealthy, will be difficult for activists to digest, further eroding grassroot support and fuelling internal dissent. But as intolerable as Salvini’s posturing might become, Five Star’s internal rules mean politicians are allowed a maximum of two electoral mandates, giving their MPs a powerful reason to make their term in office last as long as possible.Salvini could be tempted to force new elections, with the aim of forming a centre-right coalition with Giorgia Meloni’s far-right Brothers of Italy and Silvio Berlusconi’s Forza Italia. But Berlusconi would find it hard to accept Salvini’s leadership.“His presence would also dilute the League’s anti-establishment message of renewal,” says De Sio. “In the short term, it’s not in either side’s interests to break up the government, and they will try to find stability,” says Alessandra Lanza of the Bologna-based economic consultancy Prometeia.A moment of reckoning is likely to come in the autumn when, with the economy almost stagnant, the government must put together the 2020 budget, which keeps the League’s promises of tax cuts while keeping public accounts within European constraints.\u0026nbspWhen the time comes,\u0026nbspFive Star could be useful scapegoats for Salvini for failing to resolve Italy’s economic problems the question remains whether the coalition can last that long.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

This is just the beginning.In a warning to the Westminster parties, he said: If we dont leave on October  then the scores you have seen for the Brexit Party today will be repeated in a general election, and we are getting ready for it.Mr Farage repeated his demand for the Brexit Party to be involved in the negotiations ahead of the Halloween deadline.All EU citizens, as long as they are registered to vote, have the right to vote in the European elections.The UK uses the D’Hondt system of proportional representation which means the number of MEPs a party wins is directly related to the percentage of votes it receives.Voters choose a single party instead of an inidual candidate.This means all political parties have the chance to send representatives to the European Parliament.The proportion of seats given by a party directly reflects the proportion of votes won.In the first round of counting, the party with the most votes is allocated a seat for the candidate at the top of its list.Under the D’Hondt method, each party’s total number of votes is repeatedly ided – until all seats are filled – by isor  + the number of seats already allocated.If it is still top it gains another seat. If not, whichever party has the most votes then gets the seat instead.The original vote count of the largest party in each round is ided by one plus the total number of seats they have already been allocated, until all the seats for the region have been handed out.Although the method is considered to be one of the most constant and representative forms of voting, the results do not exactly reflect the votes, as this would lead to parties winning fractions of seats.EU voters go to the polls every five years to elect Members of the European Parliament .Each country has a specic number of seats based on their population size.The smallest is Malta and they have six seats, whereas the largest is Germany with .There are  MEPs in total and the UK has .Candidates can stand independently or with a party.They will represent a region of their country, and the number of MEPs for each region depends on population.The government confirmed the country would be taking part in the EU elections in early May after May administration was forced to push back the date it was leaving the bloc because MPs could not get a majority for her withdrawal agreement.As the UK was still in the EU at the time of the elections it is forced to take part even though the majority of voters said they wanted to leave in the referendum vote.The UK went to the polls to elect MEPs on May , .The vote is said to have cost around £million to hold.If a Brexit deal is agreed before the election date or soon after then the UK’s MEPS will not take their seats.Butthat doesn’t happen then the newly elected MEPs will take their place in the European Parliament – which sits in Brussels and Strasbourg - in early July.European Council President Donald Tusk has said that MEPs could sit for “months or even longer”the negotiations drag on.At this stage, how long the UK MEPs will continue to sit is anyones guess.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It will be ungenerous not to remember too her unshakeable dedication to her country and remarkable perseverance against what became insurmountable odds.She is a good person. She did her best.But she is a poor Prime Minister and the author of her own downfall. She appointed a Cabinet of loyal friends largely devoid of talent.She credulously swallowed bad advice from a staunchly europhile and dysal civil service.She lacked vital traits for a leader: core beliefs, confidence, decisiveness, mental agility, communication skills and a willingness to trust and delegate.These failings, and a suicidal manesto, were exposed at the  election. Stripped of her majority, she foolishly tried to pretend “nothing has changed” and made promises she couldn’t keep.She negotiated a Brexit deal which was bad enough even before Monday’s final, fatal compromises.Mrs May described what she sees as her legacy. It is thin gruel. The economy is doing fine, the job market booming. But she did next to nothing for Sun readers, for the “just about managings”.Brexit is undone, like her “social justice” agenda. Our democracy is in disarray, Britain ided, her party at historic poll lows. She leaves her successor an even more colossal task than her own.Whoever that is must, above all, stop Corbyn’s thuggish extremists winning power.That can only be done by delivering Brexit — yes, with No Dealneed be — and somehow seeing off the Brexit Party whose surge could let Corbyn in.Winning the battle of ideas against the Marxist Left will be far simpler. Who is best placed to do it It must be a Brexiteer ready to appoint a younger, fresher, far more talented top team. There are plenty of able Tories in the ranks, their paths blocked by ­Cabinet duds who must be swept away.Leave-backing MPs must avoid splitting their vote and letting another Remainer into No. The party may not survive it.Nor, we believe, will its members tolerate any attempt by MPs to block their favourite candidates. They now have Nigel Farage’s party to join.Mrs May has left the Tories in dire straits and with one chance to survive.For their sake — and Britain’s — they had better make the right choice.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Andyou are paid less than someone  because they are better than you then that is OK. But that is apparently not the case here.“Despite being awarded the same job, on the same day, after the same board, during the same recruitment process, BBC News asked me to accept a considerably lower salary than my male counterpart. A lot less,” Karen told colleagues by email.“I’ve been assured our roles and responsibilities are the same. I’ve also been told my appointment was ‘very well deserved’. It’s just that I’m worth £, less.“Over the past four months I have asked BBC News to think again. And they’ve inched their offer up . . . now the gap is nearer to £,. But for me it has never been about the actual salary. It has been about equal pay.”She also said she had turned down the job on principle after discussing the matter with her young daughters, which led her to conclude that she must “stand up for what is right”.And, to my mind, that is the real nub of this story.Her two daughters, aged seven and , said this to her: “You always tell us to stand up for what is right. If it means less pocket money or not going on holiday, we don’t mind.What matters to us is that when we grow up, we want to be paid the same as a man for the same job.”How poignant — and how powerful. Sometimes you have to see things through the eyes of children to realise there is only one course of action.It makes me think of that phrase: Strong women — may we know them, may we be them, and may we raise them.Well, Karen is certainly raising them. And her brave decision means that her children won’t be as subservient as the women of our generation.To an extent, women have always just accepted the status quo when it comes to men being paid more. But that’s changingStill, what Karen did by refusing the job and sending that email is brave. Most people don’t like to rock the boat, which sometimes means we accept things that should be unacceptable.And women, especially mothers, are often so grateful to have a job that they don’t question it. That’s especially the case for single working mums, as Karen is.Most single working mums simply can’t afford not to work, so they put up and shut up. But that expectation that women should accept less than they are worth makes my blood boil.Can you imagine, by the way,it had emerged that men were routinely being paid less than women  Would we ever hear the end of it Not until equality came. So maybe we all need to think like men for a bit.By rocking the boat, Karen is taking one for the team. She will be no doubt be seen as a troublemaker by some potential employers. But it’s not until people make stands like this that change happens.Despite the furore, the gender pay gap is still everywhere, and it’s not until people say, “No more” that things will change. The bottom line is that women need to start feeling a bit more entitled.We need to know our worth and not be afraid to ask for it. Because the sad truth is that people will pay you less than you are worththey can get away with it. So let’s not be muggins enough to accept it, eh HAVE you been following the story of chef Gary Usher, who was asked by a homeless man called Derickhe had any jobs in his restaurant He offered Derick a job as a kitchen porter. And then tweeted about it because he was happy to have done a good deed.His tweet then went viral. And then suddenly people started accusing him of exploiting homeless people to publicise his restaurant.But given the fact that Usher has declined every single one of the many invitations he has had to go on TV to talk about this story that is so patently untrue.And also, regardless of whether he publicised it or not, there is no doubt that he did a good thing.Still, he has been roundly vilied for what was evidently a kind-hearted gesture.Social media has made us into a nation of cynics and critics. The saying “no good deed goes unpunished” seems very true on this occasion.LOTS of teenagers will no doubt be envious to hear about Benjy Fish, the -year-old from Middlesex who has dropped out of school after being encouraged by his mother – to become a professional gamer.Benjy, who has so far earned £, playing Fortnite, is ranked among the best in the world.And he has guaranteed himself another £, by qualying for this year’s Fortnite World Cup, which boasts a prize pool of £million.He’ll be competing at the event in New York this July, which may sound like the dream for some, and I wish him all the best.But has any parent ever uttered the words: “I hope my son quits school at  to become a professional gamer”  I seriously doubt it.NO doubt the critics will line up to bemoan the fact that Davina McCall is dating again after her orce from Matthew Robertson.She is seeing her long-term friend and hairdresser, Michael Douglas, who she has known for more than  years.All I can think about is just how daunting it must be to put yourself “out there” and start dating again after  years of marriage and three kids.Add to that the burden of being famous, which makes it hard to join Tinder .But we should all wish Davina well – good for her for giving herself another chance at happiness and finding love again. She turned  in October and has got a whole new chapter of her le to live. Why should that be alone Divorcees out there should take heart. You are entitled to happiness. You might just want to go and have a bit of fun by putting yourself out there without waiting for Mr Perfect.Or the love of your le might already be under your nose, like Davina’s hairdresser.What could be better than getting together with an old friend, because he knows the real her. But also, possibly best of all, no more bad hair days.I HAVE no idea what is being shown at the Cannes Film Festival­ – these days it’s much more about the red-carpet dresses than the actual movies.And wow, were there some dresses this year.Alessandra Ambrosio, , and Sharon Stone, , dazzled in little red numbers.The most amazing thing is that there is  years between them. What is Sharon Stone’s secret  She never ages.SO sad reading about Jasmine Bush, the -year old schoolgirl who threw herself in front of a train on the day she was due to receive the grades for her GCSEs in .She had been suffering with ious mental health issues, including anxiety, and had been on medication to help control the symptoms.But she had also been smoking marijuana to relieve anxiety symptoms. Except it clearly had the opposite effect. This story is every parent’s nightmare.Smoking weed is seen as innocent and has been normalised by the fact that “everyone does it”. But it is illegal for a reason.Marijuana is known to make people paranoid and, far from curing anxiety, it exacerbates it.

Since March , the day the UK should have left the EU, there has been a growing sense of political crisis.Brexit wasn’t happening and the government’s impressive achievements were being lost in the fog. If government was telling people about the growing economy, unemployment falling to its lowest since  or the UK attracting more inward investment in the last year than any other country in the world – no-one was listening.Theresa May was rightly committed to building a majority in parliament for something that would at least complete the first stage of Brexit and allow a new leader to negotiate the future relationship without constant battles in parliament getting in the way.But when she started offering concessions to Jeremy Corbyn’s far left outfitt, the mood in the Tory party darkened.As Chairman of the Parliamentary Conservative Party - the “ Committee” - I had to balance two very strong demands from my colleagues.Firstly, with the failure to exit the EU and the loss of so many brilliant councillors in local elections at the beginning of May, a majority of Conservative MPs had decided that a change of leader was essential.Secondly, most of my colleagues also took the view that Theresa should be allowed the space to leave the stage with dignity.However disappointed or angry people are that we are stuck in a logjam, they know that Mrs May has given it her all. Her dogged determination and absolute commitment to the service of our country have been obvious to everyone.It was sad and painful to be there at the moment that she said she would resign as leader of the party and no one could fail to be moved by her parting words outside No. The ConservativeParty knew that change was needed but I am glad that the process has begun with decency and respect.Some people inside and outside parliament have talked about me being a candidate for leader. As Chairman of the  Committee I would have been in charge of the election process so I stood down with immediate effect so that everything can be seen to be above board.I can now consider my position unconstrained. Whoever stands – and whoever wins, the task is a big one. It is nothing less than restoring the broken trust in British politics.We have to leave the EU as we promised we would and then get back to a radical agenda to let people take back control of their lives.

And the lessons the parties should learn are equally obvious.For the Tories, it is that they have no God-given right to power. And their failure to deliver Brexit could be their death knell unless they get on the right track, sharpish.The leadership battle is already doing them serious damage as it turns all too quickly into a circular firing squad.We’ve got nothing against bright youngsters like Rory Stewart taking a punt at the premiership, but having a pop at colleagues on day one won’t help rebuild the party’s battered reputation.But that’s nothing compared to the current Chancellor threatening to bring down the Governmenta new leader pushes for a clean-break Brexit, evenhis party’s MPs and members vote for exactly that.If Hammond hasn’t clocked that failing to deliver the referendum result isn’t endearing the party to voters, these European results are a blunt reminder.Everybody who fancies the top job needs to explain, in detail, their Brexit plan. Andthey win, the party MUST deliver it. No s, no buts.Winning back Brexit Party voters is vital, but so is moving on from the referendum and pushing forward with a revitalised domestic programme.As for Labour  All that game-playing in Westminster hasn’t done them much good.But they still haven’t learnt.Emily Thornberry’s reaction to the Brexit Party’s streaking triumph around the country was to come out in favour of a second referendum.Working people have abandoned this prehistoric party and their dinosaur leader in droves.The European elections should never have happened. We should be out of the EU by now.For the Government, time could not be more pressing. A new leader can restore some faith in our politics, and take on Corbyn’s Marxists.The Tories need a quick contest, and a leader with a proper mandate. Anything  risks annihilation. But that doesn’t mean you can just abandon personal responsibility and demand taxpayers will bail you out.On that point, Paul Mason has pushed our sympathy to breaking point.And we worry the sense of entitlement that he displays when he opens his mouth is becoming st century Britain’s disease. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

On Sunday it took several minutes to establish whether or not one of them, Wheeler Dealer, could impersonate an animal.When it does get going the show can very occasionally feel like arriving two hours late at the pub. Everyone’s laughing but you’ve no idea why.For the most part, though, The Ranganation belongs to the same comedy applause school as The Last Leg, Mash Report and New World Order.They’ll clap anything here, in fact. Romesh’s mum admits taking a curry to the cinema . Nigel Farage gets covered in milkshake . The Dogfather telling us to: “Stop raping the planet,” .Although, I say anything, the moment it broke down was when half a dozen people applauded the idea of Boris Johnson becoming Prime Minister and, woah!, Romesh had to threaten them, jokingly, with ejection.They’d broken the rules, you see. Shows like The Ranganation like to think of themselves as edgy, but they’re very tightly governed by the laws of political correctness.This means you no longer have to be funny to be a stand-up or comedy host, but you must be on-message, which is why, paradoxically, we’ve never had more comedians on telly but so few actual laughs.Flogging them to death doesn’t work either. You may have found Katherine Ryan and Romesh funny the first time you saw them, but you’re probably fed up with the sight of them by their thousandth appearance.As for the actual process of this show The Ranganation wasn’t sure dating apps worked and milkshake throwing was also a grey area, but the host definitely thought we could save the planet by not flushing our toilets.“So do you mindI come round your house and p*** like a horse ”It’d be appreciated, ta.Good Morning Britain, Piers Morgan: “I am not morbidly obese.”Good Morning Britain, Kevin Maguire: “There are quite a few Leave voters at the BBC.”And Good Morning Britain, Susanna Reid: “Honestly,Andi Peters was in  Hunks, which he should be, he’d be scoring .” Out of what, Susanna OVER on BBC’s look-into-the-future drama Years And Years, all-out nuclear war between China and America seems to have fizzled out after one episode.The good news, though, is it seems to have released enough radiation poisoning to kill off Jessica Hynes’s character, Edith, the campaigner, activist and all-round pain-in-the-ar*e, within the next couple of episodes.If you think that’ll be the end of the political lecture, however, you couldn’t be more wrong.Writer Russell T Davies is far too hot under the collar about America, Israel, “the West”, bankers, privatisation and “NHS cuts” to get off his high horse any time soon.Weirdly, he also wants Years And Years viewers to try and believe that, in the not-too-distant future, a Christian regime, in the Ukraine, will be torturing gay people.Which, given that homosexuality is currently and exclusively a death penalty offence in ten Islamic states, has to be one of the most cowardly distortions of reality I’ve ever seen on a television drama.Far less sinister, but almost as tiresome, is the continued presence of Alexander Armstrong on Years And Years.He turned up hosting a  edition of Have I Got News For You in the first episode, and then reappeared fronting Pointless Celebrities, in the year , last week.So don’t expect any sympathyhe reappears tonight on Best Ever Christmas , still murdering Fields Of bloody Gold.You’ve been given your four-minute warning.Michael Owen: “It was great opportunityism from the striker.”And Neil Lennon: “It’s a once-in-a-letime opportunity that’s come round again.”Victoria Coren Mitchell’s nauseating love-in with MP Jess Phillips on Have I Got News For You.Piers Morgan telling Le Stories guest Mel B The Spice Girls were “the female Beatles”, when they weren’t even the female Tremeloes.Hollyoaks actor Maxim Baldry attempting a Ukrainian accent in Years And Years.Every bone-idle chancer in Britain interpreting “Bank Holiday Monday” as “Take Friday off as well”.And Britain’s Got Talent auditions getting lost in sob stories, sentimentality and all those magical charisma voids who begin by announcing: “I need someone to come up and help me.” BZZZZZ, “Next ”B “Form a conga with Seumas Milne and start celebrating.”C “We don’t know.”Tipping Point, Ben Shephard: “In  Serbian Branislav Ivanovic joined which London-based football team ”I’d have had these people housed in the sort of lodges we give away on this programme.”But you weren’t, so stop playing the hero and just link to your rip-off phone-line competition. Picture research by Alfie Snelling.NEVER a good sign, is it, when you vomit up your own decomposed internal organs, have to be buried in a zinc coffin and a cement mixer turns up to your funeral That’s the thing about Sky Atlantic’s Chernobyl, though, it spares you no details about the greatest technological catastrophe of the th century.

Tory MEPs were almost wiped out.It was expected, but that cannot hide the seriousness of the Conservatives’ crisis. Not only did most voters abandon them — even the majority of their own members voted for the Brexit Party.Many others, including me, refused to take part in a ballot that should never have taken place, for an organisation that we should not be part of.No party can last for long with its vote in freefall and its activists staying home or supporting a rival.The Tories must find a way to regain trust, inspire their troops and win back millions of lost voters.That means being completely honest and clear about why this happened. It is human nature to look for comforting excuses to explain away shocking news. But that would be no use.This crisis is entirely self-inflicted. The Conservatives gave the people a referendum and promised, before, during and after, to do as voters decided.Theresa May pledged scores of times that we would leave the EU, deal or no deal, in March.She broke that promise and her Cabinet colleagues let her do it. As Daniel Hannan, one of the Party’s surviving MEPs, put it: “People voted to leave three years ago and we haven’t left, it’s as simple as that.”Many voters were already deeply unhappy about the way the PM kept watering down and abandoning her negotiating red lines. Ditching the Brexit deadline was the last straw and pushed them over the edge. Step one of recovery is clear: Brexit must happen.If there’s a glimmer of hope it’s that May has agreed to resign. Imagineshe was still barricaded in Downing Street — more time would be wasted on the struggle to prise her out of the building.Instead, the race to succeed her has begun. No more politely pretending that “there’s no vacancy”. Instead, the MPs who hope to be the next Prime Minister can openly set out their stalls.There is no time to waste. This has got to be a proper contest, to produce a leader whose abilities and ideas have been thoroughly tested. The stakes are as high.Tory members, disillusioned, frustrated and bruised, want totheir party to winning ways. Democrats want the Leave vote to be honoured.And everyone wants to hear the proposals put forward by those who want to govern.The only option is to get this right and keep that essential promise. The future of the Conservative Party rests on it, but far more importantly so does the future of our country. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The Tories were expecting to be punished for having failed to deliver Brexit.In contrast, Labour seemed set for a comfortable,modest second place.Instead they found themselves overtaken by the Liberal Democrats, who can now claim to be the most popular party among Remain voters.Labour now seems set for a row about a second referendum that could every bit as intense as the Tory leadership battle.Could Farage make a similar impact in a general election No. That said, his party is standing as high as % in polls of Westminster vote intentions. Past experience suggests that such rises often disappear within weeks.However, Brexit is not going to disappear from the political agenda any time soon.If the Brexit Party support continues to run at anything like %, the Conservatives are likely to struggle to regain a lead in the polls.How do these results play into Tory  Labour leadership battles The Tory contenders will have to convince MPs they can win back the votes lost to the Brexit Party – and that, in turn, will ensure a lively debate about whether the government should embrace leaving without a deal.Jeremy Corbyn, meanwhile, seems set to face severe pressure from within his party to sht in favour of a more avowedly pro-second referendum, pro-Remain stance.It is a step he has repeatedly seemed reluctant to take – but maybe this time his party will overrule him What do the results tell us about support for Brexit Many voters lined up behind Remain and Leave parties.But some voted out of traditional loyalty or on the basis of other issues, such as the environment.And many voters were willing to leave behind their traditional party loyalties in order to express their view on Brexit.The results reveal a country polarized between leaving without a deal and wanting a second referendum, though neither options is necessarily backed by a majority.So, no mandate for no deal No. Only % of voters supported a party that was willing to contemplate leaving without a deal. That is well short of a majority.Is a general election this year now more or less likely A general election isn’t going to be attractive to the new Tory PM.They would be worried that those who voted for the Brexit Party would be reluctant to switch back to Tory until Brexit is delivered.That said,the new Prime Minister decides the pressure from the Brexit Party means the UK should crash out without a deal at the end of October, they could well find themselves facing a confidence vote in which some Conservative MPs fail to back the government.That could lead to an unwanted general election.Do we now know how a second referendum would go No better than we did already. The opinion polls do give us a clue.They have long suggested that Remain enjoys a consistent but narrow lead – currently, Remain , Leave .However, much of this lead rests on the views expressed by those who did not vote three years ago – and who perhaps cannot be relied upon to vote a second time around.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

LOOK! a button battery! That is so dangerous!’Looking around I saw an opened packet on the shelf that obviously a shopper had left there - did they not understand how incredibly dangerous these items are I decided that we needed to show what damage these batteries can do, so I put some chicken fillets in my trolley and my daughters and I did the time-lapse photos that afternoon.”To carry out the experiment, Sarah - a paediatric nurse - placed a battery inside a chicken fillet for a total of four hours and monitored the level of damage done during that period.The first image was taken after  minutes showing some noticeable black marks, while the third image was taken after four hours with clear burning to the chicken.It represents the similar damage that could be caused to your little ones stomachthey swallowed one.For more information and advice visit the Child Accident Prevention Trustwebsite.Sarah said: “Even though I have seen first hand the damage that a button battery can do, I was still shocked at the immediacy of the burns.According to The Battery Controlled campaign, when a coin-sized lithium button battery gets stuck in a child’s throat, the saliva triggers an electrical current.This then causes a chemical reaction that can severely burn the oesophagus in as little as two hours.If this has happened to your child, they will likely start coughing, drooling or complain about discomfort.Sarah hopes that her experiment will help parents visualise the dangers button batteries present.She said: “In my career as a paediatric emergency nurse I have cared for children who had swallowed or choked on button batteries.“A few were lucky because it was witnessed by a parent and they knew to seek immediate emergency help, however, most ended up with horric injuries, sometimes requiring years of ongoing treatmentthey survived.”She added that prevention is the best cure and urged parents to have a scout around the home to get rid of any button batteries that might be lurking around."},{"url":null,"title":"us navy pilots spot ufos","story":"The daily sightings came over the course of  and  and were reported to the Pentagon and Congress.Lieutenant Ryan Graves said he saw “strange objects” with “no visible engine or infared exhaust plumes” reaching at least , feet and flying at hypersonic speeds almost daily while training off the aircraft carrier Theodore Roosevelt.Graves, an F A- Super Hornet pilot who has been with the Navy for  years, told The New York Times: “These things would be out there all day.“Keeping an aircraft in the air requires a signicant amount of energy.“With the speeds we observed,  hours in the air is  hours longer than we’d expect.”The unidentied flying objects were seen performing manoeuvres that were “beyond the physical limits of a human crew,” like stopping rapidly, turning instantly or immediately accelerating at hypersonic speeds, the pilots said.The sightings were reported to the Pentagon’s shadowy Advanced Aerospace Threat Identication Program, which confirmed earlier this month they still investigate claimed sightings of alien spacecraft.In late , a Super Hornet pilot said he almost hit one of the objects — which he said looked like a sphere encasing a cube — and an official mishap report was filed.Another pilot, Lt. Danny Accoin said he could identy a flying object on his radar, missile system and infared camera but couldn’t actually see it in his helmet camera.A minute-long video appears to show two encounters with the enigmatic phenomena where the pilots talk to each other about what they see on the radar screens.“Look at that thing. It’s rotating,” one of them said.“Wow, what is that, man ” another exclaims. “Look at it fly!”At first the pilots interviewed in the report thought the objects were part of a top-secret drone program.But after the near-collision they reason that government officials knew there were fighter pilots in the area and would not send drones to get in the way.Navy spokesman Joseph Gradisher said it’s unclear what caused the sightings detailed in the article.The Times report comes after the Navy in April sent out a new classied guidance for how to report the “unexplained aerial phenomena.”A number of reports ensued but some cases could have been commercial drones, Gradisher said.But, in other cases: “We don’t know who’s doing this, we don’t have enough data to track this. So the intent of the message to the fleet is to provide updated guidance on reporting procedures for suspected intrusions into our airspace.”Neither Graves nor the other pilots or the Department of Defence would speculate on what the objects were.“We’re here to do a job, with excellence, not make up myths,” one pilot said. The Department of Defence went as far to reveal they will continue to probe such reports in a bid to keep the nation safe.A spokesperson for the the Department of Defence was forced to admit that reports, claiming their investigations were stopped in , were not true.OFFICIAL STATEMENTSpeaking to the NY Post, Christopher Sherwood said in a statement: The Department of Defence is always concerned about maintaining positive identication of all aircraft in our operating environment, as well as identying any foreign capability that may be a threat to the homeland.“The department will continue to investigate, through normal procedures, reports of unidentied aircraft encountered by US military aviators in order to ensure defense of the homeland and protection against strategic surprise by our nation’s adversaries.”WHAT IS THE ADVANCED AEROSPACE THREAT IDENTIFICATION PROGRAM The investigations are part of the US governments, Advanced Aerospace Threat Identication Programme .The program began in  and was run by military intelligence official, Luis Elizondo.The existence of the AATIP was revealed in , along with a -second DOD video that shows an airborne object being chased by two Navy jets off the coast of San Diego in .Defence experts across the world have been left shell shocked by this bombshell revelation.Nick Pope who launched secret probes into UFOs for the UK during the s said this new admission makes it clear that they really did study what the public would call UFOs.UFOs have been repeatedly investigated by the American military, including a study code-named Project Blue Book which started in .A version of this story originally appeared on the NY Post."},{"url":null,"title":"remainer flybe remove brexit beanie","story":"IT consultant Derek Knowles claimed he was told he wouldnt be allowed to sit on the flight from Knock, Ireland to Manchester due to the bright yellow hats offensive message.It comes after the Brexit Party had a sweeping victory in the EU Parliament elections this weekend - leaving the Tories and Labour in its wake.And leader Nigel Farage was forced to fire back over claims that pro-Remain parties received a larger percentage of votes in the recent elections.Derek said his own beanie was the latest casualty in the Brexit chaos - asked to take it off after a fellow passenger on the BE flight had taken offence.Speaking to The New European, he said:just took exception to it.She was polite but firm, saying it might be offensive to other people and Im not allowed to wear it on the plane.Derek said he had sat down on the flight while wearing the hat, but removed it when asked by the pilot.He said: I didnt want to delay the flight or get thrown off. I felt like Id taken it far enough.But he has since written to the airlines CEO to complain.He said: It always raises a laugh at Manchester Airport, the security guards give a little chuckle as I go through.A FlyBe spokesperson said: Flybe’s Terms and Conditions, to which passengers must agree prior to an online booking being confirmed, clearly state that when on board, passengers ‘should not behave in a way which causes discomfort, inconvenience, damage or injury to the crew or other passengers’.If this is deemed to have happened, ‘we may take any measures we think reasonable to prevent you continuing your behaviour’.In this particular instance, having received a complaint from another passenger that they found the message it communicated ‘offensive’, the crew members concerned acted accordingly by asking the passenger wearing the hat, to remove it.The passenger who was offended by the message on the hat subsequently followed this up in writing directly to Flybe.It comes after Mr Farages Brexit Party swept to victory in the weekends EU elections after promising to deliver a massive wake-up call to the Tories and Labour.And he today hit back at Good Morning Britain host Charlotte Hawkins question over claims the Remain parties had won a majority.Ms Hawkins challenged Mr Farage about the argument, saying: If you add up all the pro-Remain parties they did get a bigger percentage - . per cent versus the Brexit Party . per cent.So the pro-Remain parties altogether did get a bigger percentage.But she left out the Tories and Ukip from her calculations - even though both parties are committed to quitting the EU.Mr Farage was quick to fire back, saying: Im sorry this is absolute tosh. It is not a fact.Add up the Brexit vote, add up the Ukip vote, add the Conservative vote, who are still a party that says we are going to leave, and you will find that Leave beat Remain.In fact what you will find is that overall the country is - in favour of leaving.We are supposed to be a democracy. We were promised this would be implemented.The BBC was also slammed for publishing a graphic showing that anti-Brexit parties had beaten pro-Brexit ones - again by leaving out the Tories from the Leave column.Even Beeb presenter Andrew Neil criticised the decision, saying: This is dodgy. And probably not a worthwhile exercise.Farage promised to deliver a massive wake-up call to the Tories and Labour as he led the Brexit Party to a historic win in the European elections.Millions of voters deserted the two main parties and flocked to Mr Farage in a bid to send the message that its time to quit the EU at last.The Brexit Party swept the board - winning every single region of Britain except heavily pro-Remain London and Scotland.

This has led to our current terrible mess.The time has come for an end to policies of damage limitation.The Prime Minister will formally stand down as party leader on June  - but will stay in place while the new PM is being chosen.The leadership contest, overseen by party chairman Brandon Lewis, will take around six weeks and conclude in late July.Any Tory MP can enter the race, and the list of contenders is then whittled down by the parliamentary party.MPs vote in multiple rounds, eliminating one candidate each time until just two are left.With at least ten declared candidates, it could take a couple of weeks to get through the rounds - although contenders who perform poorly early on may drop out.The partys , activists then choose behind the final shortlist of two, with the winner declared leader and Prime Minister.When Mrs May became leader, she didnt have to submit to a vote of members because Andrea Leadsom pulled out of the race.So the last time activists have had a say on the leadership was , when David Cameron defeated David Davis.The next leader must respond to this electoral kicking by making our policy on Brexit crystal clear by giving a concrete promise that Britain will leave the EU by October  - deal or No Deal.Mrs May will formally step down as Conservative leader next Friday, kicking off the contest to replace her.Tory MPs will vote in multiple rounds to reduce the number of candidates to a two-person shortlist for activists to have the final say.EUROPEANS living in Britain should be allowed to get a UK passport for free, Michael Gove says.The would-be PM wants to make it easy for EU citizens to become British after Brexit.The policy would apply to million European migrants who were living here at the time of the referendum in June .They would be able to get citizenship without paying the £, fee.Mr Gove wants to show the UK wont become more hostile to Europe after Brexit.Theresa May has set up a settled status scheme allowing EU citizens to stay here indefinitely - but its been criticised for adding an extra layer of bureaucracy."},{"url":null,"title":"jeremy hunt brands no deal","story":"NewsJeremy Hunt brands No Deal Brexit suicide in first shot of Tory leadership warThe Foreign Secretary launched into battle with rivals by warning No Deal could make the Tories \"extinct\" - and put Corbyn in No by ChristmasShareCommentsByDan BloomOnline Political Editor:,  MAY Updated:,  MAY Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news politics video jeremy-hunt-warns-no-deal-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news politics  , theme : # , title : Mirror Politics , options :,bundledCss:,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,externalBrandCSS:true,irisTvEnabled:true,imaVersion:,modularCss:true,nativeAppBanner:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,mvtTests:,video.suppressDates:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news politics  , theme : # , title : Mirror Politics , options :,bundledCss:,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,externalBrandCSS:true,irisTvEnabled:true,imaVersion:,modularCss:true,nativeAppBanner:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,mvtTests:,video.suppressDates:true\"\"Get the biggest politics stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailJeremy Hunt today said pushing for No Deal Brexit would be political suicide as he fired the first salvo of the Toriesapos leadership war.The Foreign Secretary warned prompting no deal could lead to extinction and a general election - putting Jeremy Corbyn in Downing Street by Christmas.He said any bid to crash out without a deal would be blocked by Parliament, forcing the new PM to call or bow to a catastrophic general election.Trying to deliver no deal through a general election is not a solution it is political suicide, Mr Hunt - one of  leadership candidates - wrote in the Daily . He said no deal is better than no Brexit , but added: A dferent deal is the only solution and what I will pursueI am leader.He was instantly attacked by hardline rival Esther McVey who tweeted: Political suicide actually lies in not having a clean break from the EU and not leaving on October .   The move means Mr Hunt is staking his claim as the moderate candidate while his nine rivals line up to back crashing out without an agreement.The aggressive intervention singles him out as an alternative to Tories like Esther McVey, Boris Johnson and Dominic Raab who urged a no-deal exit on October .

And he said going to Brussels with a hardline stance will only provoke a “hardline response”. Mr Hunt confirmed he would serve under Boris Johnsonthe Tory frontrunner becomes Prime Minister.

At least  MPs have already chucked their hats in the ring to replace her in a contest dominated by Brexit. By the end of July we could have a hard Brexiteer Prime Minister who wants to crash the UK out with no deal. Or it could be a more moderate candidate, a continuity May option of entering yet more negotiations with the EU. So who is bidding to replace Theresa May  Hereaposs a full rundown of the candidates with profiles, odds and how much of a True Blue Tory Warrior™ they are. How does the election work   Unlike Mrs Mayaposs election in , where Tory members never voted, this race promises to be the most bruising in years. And just like her election, it will have profound consequences for Brexit - with a hard-right, Hard Leaver likely to take the reins. Under the rules of a Tory leadership race, candidates bidding for the crown must be nominated by two or more fellow Tory MPs. A series of knockout ballots is then held among MPs to whittle down the wide field of candidates to just two.  Those two preferred candidates go to a run-off of the wider Conservative Party, with its , members eligible to vote. The candidate who wins the most votes becomes the leader.  All the Tory leadership contenders Declared openly that they will run Odds retrieved from Paddy Power, May Boris Johnson -   Dominic Raab -   Michael Gove -   Jeremy Hunt -   Andrea Leadsom -   Rory Stewart -   Sajid Javid -   Matt Hancock -   Esther McVey -   Kit Malthouse - not listed on Paddy PowerReported, hinted - or refused to rule outSteve Baker Graham Brady   James Cleverly Penny Mordaunt  Mark Harper David Gauke James BrokenshireLeading Tories who WONaposT be runningAmber Rudd Liz Truss Justine Greening David Lidington Jacob Rees-Mogg Johnny Mercer Tobias Ellwood David Davis Victoria Atkins Ken Clarke Dominic Grieve Tom Tugendhat   Profiles of the candidates Boris Johnson VOTED: Leave TRUE BLUE RATING:    Brexiteer and former foreign secretary Mr Johnson, , has been a leading voice against Theresa Mayaposs Brexit plan - and heaposs been preparing for this for years. The Old Etonian was one of the key players in the  Leave campaign after a last-minute decision to back Brexit. He resigned from the Cabinet in  in protest at Mayaposs plan. He was tipped as a successor to David Cameron but ruled himself out after Michael Gove stabbed him in the back with a last-minute bid for the top job. Since then heaposs lost weight and had a haircut in what many argued was a pre-leadership bid upgrade. Sure enough he confirmed by telling a business conference: Iaposm going to go for it! Selecting the former mayor of London for eight years would enrage Tory Remainers, who believe he is in this game only for himself and his ego. He became notorious for his attention-grabbing offensive comments, when he called black people piccaninnies, said Barack Obama was part-Kenyan and compared the EU to Adolf Hitler. Heaposs also criticised for vast sums of money he rakes in alongside being an MP for speeches and a £,-a-yearcolumn - which was rapped for inaccuracy by the press regulator. Meanwhile, heaposs been rapped for showing a lack of respect to Parliament by repeatedly breaking Commons rules. Supporters say that since splitting with his long-suffering we Marina Wheeler and shacking up with ex-Tory head of press Carrie Symonds, heaposs mended his ways and become more serious. But scores of Tory MPs would vote for Anyone But Boris and a Scottish operation to stop him was nicknamed Operation Arse. Dominic Raab VOTED: Leave TRUE BLUE RATING: .   During his four-month stint as Brexit Secretary, ultra-hard Leaver Dominic Raab suggested he would use leaving the EU to slash business taxes. Now heaposs running for leader heaposs hinted p could be slashed off income tax - cutting billions from the public purse. And that wasnapost all that would anger left-wingers. The -year-old sparked fury in  by saying most food bank users are not languishing in poverty. He claimed: The typical user... is someone who has a cash flow problem. When a disability activist told him people are dying under Tory austerity, he described her calls for cash as a childish wish list. And he put out a pamphlet in  that suggested exempting small firms from minimum wage laws for workers under . Mr Raab positioned himself early on for the leadership, setting out his plans to tackle kne crime with “robust policing” and community work. He also paraded in his home in a cringeworthy interview with his we. And he attempted to outflank hostile competition by addressing claims he used a gagging order, to silence a former colleague who accused him of bullying. Mr Raab told The Sunday Times the claims, which date back to  before he was an MP, were completely ”. Michael Gove VOTED: Leave TRUE BLUE RATING:    The Environment Secretary had a bruising experience in the last Tory leadership race stabbing Boris in the back before finishing third. And he kept his powder dry in the days immediately following Theresa Mayaposs announcement she would quit. But behind the scenes his allies, including Treasury minister Mel Stride, have been approaching MPs in the most unlikely positions to seethey will join his slate. One former Cabinet minister told the Mirror Mr Gove was one of the most likely to be elected. Despite infuriating teachers when he was Education Secretary, and stabbing Boris Johnson in the back for leadership in , the -year-old is seen as a competent media performer and has won plaudits as a campaigner for environmental issues. He has already paraded with his Scottish parents as part of the proxy leadership contest in the party. He was a prominent face in the Brexit campaign, but he isnapost wildly trusted by other figures on the Conservativesapos eurosceptic wing.    Jeremy Hunt VOTED: Remain TRUE BLUE RATING:    Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt was a prominent Remainer in the  referendum. And despite a sht towards Eurosceptic views heaposs now even more prominent - warning deliberately causing No Deal would be political suicide and put Corbyn in No. Mr Hunt has marked himself out as the more moderate candidate against hard Brexiteers but could risk being seen as the continuity candidate for Theresa May. As Health Secretary, Mr Hunt, , fought a long battle with the medical profession over a new contract for doctorsapos working conditions. The -year-old became Foreign Secretary in July following the resignation of Boris Johnson. He chose not to run in the  leadership contest and instead gave his full support to Mrs May, saying it was not the right time to put his hat in the ring.    Andrea Leadsom VOTED: Leave TRUE BLUE RATING:    The -year-old, grammar-school educated former bank executive is about as true blue Tory as you can get. She survived to the final two of the  Tory leadership race, pitching herself as the Hard Brexit, blue alternative to Theresa May with a cringeworthy march in Westminster. But she infamously pulled out after making controversial remarks about motherhood and trying to deny them. She was loyal in public for two years of Cabinet office while furiously working to push towards a harder Brexit in private, through the pizza club of Tory ministers. She played a crucial part in forcing Theresa Mayaposs resignation announcement, resigning from the PMaposs cabinet and blasting her plan hours before the EU elections.    Rory Stewart VOTED: Remain TRUE BLUE RATING:    The Hong Kong-born son of a diplomat, an Old Etonian, once admitted his career gives the appearance he was a spy. The -year-old delivered his own child after a career as a diplomat in the Foreign Office. He was elected MP for Penrith and the Border in  and joined the government in . The International Development Secretary wasted no time after being promoted to the Cabinet in May . He announced his pitch to be PM within hours. He has since travelled to Leave-voting areas such as Barking to put himself out in the faces of the public. Yet his approach - blindly following the PMaposs Brexit deal and saying it might even be worth splitting the party for - has made him wildly unpopular among Tory Brexiteers.    Sajid Javid  VOTED: Remain TRUE BLUE RATING:       It’s widely expected the next Tory leader will be a Brexiteer. That means Mr Javid, , who backed Reman but now supports Leave, would have a real fight on his hands to win round Tory members. He took over at the Home Office after Amber Rudd was forced to quit over the Windrush scandal - and has picked public fights with Mrs May on key issues like immigration and police funding. But his star has fallen over chaotic handling of migrants crossing the Channel. He was accused of stoking tensions by declaring a national emergency to deal with a few hundred migrant crossings over a period of months. Mr Javid, the son of Pakistani bus driver, would be the first non-white Prime Minister. Matt Hancock VOTED: Remain TRUE BLUE RATING: .     The ambitious -year-old entered politics as George Osborneaposs adviser and was in the inner circle of the famously cliquey ex-Chancellor. The parkour- and karaoke-loving Conservative entered Parliament in , Government in  and joined the DCMS in July  after Mrs May took over as Prime Minister. He was swtly promoted to Culture Secretary and then Health Secretary. But he came under fire for accepting thousands from the boss of a think tank which wants to scrap the NHS. Within days of the PMaposs announcement, he somehow found his way onto the Good Morning Britain sofa, where he said of leadership: I think you don’t rule out these things.” Laying out his policy stall beyond Brexit he said he wants to make Britain a high-tech economy exporting to the global middle class. And he said the UK needs to drive up the minimum wage at the same time as slashing tax. Esther McVey    VOTED: Leave TRUE BLUE RATING:   The hardline Brexiteer confirmed she will be running for the Tory leadership with a pledge to slash £billion from foreign aid, and spend it on schools and the police. The former welfare-slasher and rank outsider said: Iaposve always said quite clearlyI got enough support from colleagues then yes I would, and now people have come forward and I have got that support. But former GMTV presenter Ms McVey became notorious among benefit claimants after working as a Minister and later Secretary of State in the Department for Work and Pensions. Her blunt style drew floods of criticism even when she managed to secure limited extra money for cash-starved Universal Credit, and U-turned on a benefit cut for the disabled.  Over the years, she made a number of controversial comments which turned her into a lightning rod for anger about benefits. She was ousted from her Wirral West seat in  after a sustained campaign against her, but ed in George Osborneaposs ultra-safe Tatton seat in . She made clear that under her leadership Britain would leave the EU on October  - deal or no deal. Kit Malthouse    VOTED: Leave   TRUE BLUE RATING:   The former Deputy Mayor of London under Boris Johnson threw his hat in the ring, clearly deciding he could do a better job. The -year-old was an accountant before joining Tory politics and winning the safe seat of North West Hampshire in . He quickly rose through the ranks, joining the DWP as a junior minister before being made Housing Minister where he had the tough task of dealing with fallout from the Grenfell Tower disaster. He ingratiated himself with Brexit-backing MPs by devising the aposMalthouse compromiseapos - a plan for high-tech border checks and other features to solve the Irish border issue. Critics say the plan is unworkable. He openly admitted making le uncomfortable for the homeless as part of a zero-tolerance crackdown when he was on Westminster City Council. Under his watch, the council was accused by one London Assembly member of adopting a ruthless policy towards homeless people that included hosing them out of doorways. Asked in he was behind such a hosing policy, Mr Malthouse replied: We certainly instituted a policy of making le - it sounds counterintuitive and cruel - more uncomfortable that is absolutely right. Still uncleartheyaposll run Penny Mordaunt VOTED: Leave TRUE BLUE RATING:    Recently promoted to Defence Secretary, Penny Mordaunt is a -year-old Royal Navy reservist whoaposs only been an MP since  - but has a rich slew of headlines to her name. From bellyflopping on TV ing show Splash! to slashing billions off benefits and lying about Brexit, sheaposs often been famous - and only sometimes for the right reasons. The daughter of a paratrooper and special needs teacher, who has a twin brother, the Portsmouth North MP went to her local comprehensive. She worked in a factory and as a magicianaposs assistant to save up for Reading University, which she was the first member of her family to go to. The PR supremo was director of communications for the National Lottery, head of campaigns for Diabetes UK, head of foreign press for George W Bush’s  and  election campaigns and chief of staff for former MP David Willetts.    Graham Brady VOTED: Leave TRUE BLUE RATING:    The -year-old, made a Sir in , holds Theresa Mayaposs fate in his hands as chairman of the  Committee. The august body runs leadership challenges in the Conservative Party and could change the rules to force Mrs May out. Heaposs currently its premier diplomat in the Tory war, but could reportedly sacrice his immunity to run for the top job himself. The grammar-school-educated MP for Altrincham and Sale West is a former PR man who turned MP in  and was the chief aide to former Tory leader Michael Howard. James Cleverly VOTED: Leave TRUE BLUE RATING:    The -year-old Brexiteer is a tub-thumping Tory whoaposs not afraid to go into battle on social media. The MP for Braintree has repeatedly got into spats with Labour since taking his job as Tory Vice Chair. Heaposs a boisterous character at social events and in the bars of Parliament, making up for a lack of Westminster experiencewith fierce public loyalty. David Gauke  VOTED: Remain TRUE BLUE RATING:    The pro-Remain Justice Secretary is highly unlikely to be putting his hat in the ring. But there is some suggested he could team up with fellow Remainer Amber Rudd to run on a joint ticket. He also gave a wide-ranging speech on Thursday  May straying beyond the confines of his brief. Mr Gauke took a swipe at populists like Boris Johnson saying: Populism would undermine the United Kingdom.  In the context of the United Kingdom, right-wing populism means English nationalism. The biggest problem with populist policies is that too often, they’re just plain wrong. Big hitters who ruled themselves out Amber Rudd VOTED: Remain TRUE BLUE RATING:    Amber Rudd was previously seen as a favourite to replace Mrs May. But as the party has drted to the right the moderate Remainer Ms Rudd had fallen out of favour. She was forced to quit as Home Secretary during the Windrush scandal. But after eurosceptic Esther McVey quit the government, remain-supporting Ms Rudd, , ed to government as Work and Pensions Secretary. She has a tiny majority in her seat of Hastings and Rye, which would make her vulnerable to any co-ordinated insurgency from local Labour backers. The Work and Pensions Secretary gave a wide-ranging speech on  May that called for a st Century approach to work in what many will see as a pitch for the Tory leadership. She said I hope a softening of benefit sanctions show her credentials as a so-called aposOne Nationapos Tory. And she admitted sanctions may have damaged the Tory brand, saying: If there has been damage I hope we can reverse that.  She dodged questions on whether she would throw her hat in the ring for the Tory leadership, saying: “I’m committed to the DWP”. But she later pulled out accepting the Tory party would want someone fully behind Brexit. Liz Truss  VOTED: Remain TRUE BLUE RATING:    The Chief Secretary of the Treasury is about as right wing as they come when it comes to economics. The -year-old also loves to tell a joke and hasnapost really hidden her ambition to one day hold the top job. She even posed in Westminster for a photo shoot and an interview with the Sunday Times, calling for £bn to be spent on tax cuts. And she appeared in a series of hair-raising photos with wide-bottomed trousers before giving a speech that ranged far beyond her brief. But disappointing performances in high profile jobs like her time a Justice Secretary left some MPs questioningshe has what it takes for the top job. She voted to Remain in the referendum - and since said she would change her mind and became a born-again Brexiteer. But she dropped out saying the leader had to be someone who voted Leave in .

Dylanaposs stepdad Adrian Bodden said he was attacked by seven youths as part of a long running feud.The -year-old said l : We heard a commotion outside.

He was caught on CCTV racing around a roundabout before mounting a pavement towards the two men in a park. The Southampton Crown Court has heard the student started the argument with his two victims after they accidentally stepped out in front of his car.    Prosecutor Rob Harding said Quartermaine got out of his car to shout at the pair outside a Debenhams store and got back behind the wheel again. But instead of driving away, Mr Harding told the court Quartermaine raced around a nearby roundabout and ed to try to run down the two men. He said: A member of the public had to jump out of the way to avoid being hit. The prosecutor added that when he was arrested, Quartermaine had cannabis in his system and he also attacked two police officers, scratching at oneaposs neck and hitting and kicking another.    Quartermaine, a health and fitness student at Southampton Solent University, admitted dangerous driving, drug-driving and assaulting a police officer during the incident in November last year. He was ordered to carry out  rehabilitation activity requirement days and  hours of unpaid work. He was also given an -month sentence, suspended for  months. Judge Power told him: You should quite rightly be ashamed of yourself for this dangerous behaviour, which showed little regard for the safety of others.

The Edinburgh Food Project had issued an urgent appeal for donations, saying it only had enough food for this week, while hitting out at the benefits systems. It warned that it may not be able to provide complete food parcels to its clients beyond this week - but it has since been overwhelmed by the response to the emergency appeal. The charity - which has helped more than , in the last year, a rise of  per cent - said it isnapost receiving enough donations of food to meet rising demand.    Amid the food bankaposs struggles, operations manager Bethany Biggar told the Independent: “Until we have a benefits systems that’s caring, compassionate and supportive, a minimum wage covering the essentials, and a workforce that is reliable and secure, we will continue to support those who need us. We will not allow people in Edinburgh to starve.” The Trussell Trust food bank network said a record .million parcels were given to UK residents between April  and March this year, an increase of  per cent from the previous year.    It said food bank use in its network has soared by  per cent since . Ms Biggar said the Edinburgh Food Project, which has seven food bank centres in the Scottish capital, relies on donations from the public. Without them, she said, it “simply would not be able to help people living in poverty”. She said the food bank has helped , people over the last  months, a  per cent increase on the previous year.  Between January and April this year, there have been , food parcel requests – a rise of  per cent up on the same four-month period in . Food parcels contain three daily meals with three days of supplies. Of those helped by the Edinburgh Food Project, which is part of the Trussell Trust network,  per cent have suffered changes to benefits and delays to benefit payments, the charity said. These reasons were the most common ones for their dependence on food banks. One case involved a mum-of-two whose housing benefit was cut because her elderly parent was living with her until she moved to a care home, the charity said.  More than halfsaid low income was the reason they turned to a food bank for help. Other reasons included homelessness, debt, sickness and domestic violence. After donors answered the call to Fridayaposs urgent appeal, the Edinburgh Food Project wrote on Twitter : We are overwhelmed with the response to our emergency appeal on Friday! Thank you to everyone who has liked, shared and commented on our post. The more people who see it, the more help we receive! Food banks across the UK have reported a rise in demand this year. The Trussell Trust said it gives out more food parcels in the North West of England than anywhere  in the country, and demand has gone up by  per cent this year alone, ITV News reported.  The North West was followed by Scotland, London, the South East of England and the West Midlands. A spokesperson for the Department for Work and Pensions told : The reasons for people using food banks are complex.Meanwhile for those who need extra support, the UK Government spends over £ billion a year on support for those who need it, including those who are on a low income. “In addition, Scotland has signicant welfare powers and can top-up existing benefits, pay discretionary payments and create entirely new benefits altogether.” According to new figures released earlier this month, the number of people in work continues to reach near record levels, and the unemployment rate has fallen to its lowest level for more than  years.

June will get off to a scorching start with the welcomeof hot and humid weather after days of rain, cloud cover and cooler temperatures. The Met Office said the post-Bank Holiday conditions will be rather cool and showery for a few days before it becomes increasingly warm and humid after Friday. Most of the country will enjoy balmy weather over the weekend and Britain could see its hottest temperatures of the year with forecasters predicting highs of C just a few weeks before summer officially arrives. But the conditions could prove to be deadly for Britainaposs asthma sufferers, and they have triggered a thunder fever warning.    Until then, Tuesday will bring a mix of sunshine and showers, with the heaviest and most frequent rainfall over eastern and central parts of the UK. Thunderstorms are possible in those areas. It will be largely dry and sunny with just the odd shower where as highs range between C in the north and C in the south, the Met Office said.    In the evening, showers will gradually fade and make way for a dry and chilly night. Rain will move into Northern Ireland, Wales and southwest England overnight. Heavy bursts of rain will hit on Wednesday as showers spread east and much of the country remains under grey skies.  It will be a touch cooler with highs of C in the south and C in the north. Thursday and Friday will be largely cloudy with outbreaks of rain mainly in the north and west, the Met Office said. But temperatures will start to climb in the south - hitting C - and gradually in the north to C.  Forecasters are predicting long sunny spells in many sheltered central and southern areas as it becomes increasingly warm and humid on Saturday. The Met Office said temperatures could hit -C in those areas on Saturday, and the humid conditions could spawn thunderstorms over the weekend. Highs of C are possible on Sunday, making the UK several degrees hotter than traditional sun destinations in Spain, including the party island of Ibiza and Barcelona, where -C is expected over the weekend.    The Met Office said: The weekend will be much warmer than recently and locally very warm in the south and east where brightest conditions are likely. It could also be quite humid. Scattered thundery showers may break out, with cooler conditions spreading southeast to most parts by Monday.  Met Office meteorologist Aidan McGivern added: “Further south, [there will be] sunny skies through Saturday and Sunday and temperatures climbing into the mid or even high s. A very warm weekend to come in the south [with] hot sunshine developing in the far southeast. The conditions could prove to be deadly for Britainaposs asthma sufferers. Dr Andy Whittamore, Clinical Lead and GP at Asthma UK, said: “The deadly combination of hot weather, widespread thunderstorms and rising levels of grass pollen this weekend could put more than three million people with asthma at risk of a potentially fatal asthma attack. When pollen is in the air it can inflame people’s airways, triggering asthma symptoms. Stormy weather can make it worse as it breaks the pollen into much smaller particles, which are then inhaled more deeply into the lungs.“If you have asthma and are already noticing more symptoms because of hay fever, such as coughing, a tight chest or breathlessness, make sure you keep your blue reliever inhaler with you at all times.Take hay fever medicines and your preventer inhaleras prescribed. Thunder fever - a sort of extreme hay fever - occurs when there are thunderstorms and a dangerously high pollen count. Thunderstorms can absorb pollen grains and cause them to explode into tiny particles that are breathed in. Met Office five-day weather forecast Tuesday Sunshine and showers today, these most frequent and heavy across eastern and central parts, where a rumble of thunder is possible. Elsewhere it will be largely dry and sunny with just the odd shower. Tuesday night Showers gradually fading through the evening to leave a dry night for many and turning chilly. However, more persistent rain will gradually spread into Northern Ireland, Wales and southwest England. Wednesday Cloud and rain will slowly spread east with some heavy bursts possible. Grey skies for many in the afternoon with drizzle. However, sunshine and showers are likely in northern Scotland.

Sophie Wardle, , underwent her first craniotomy in August  - where part of the skull opened up and removed. Since then, Sophie, from Birmingham, has undergone numerous brain surgeries - despite initially being told her seizures and breathlessness was anxiety, stress and panic attacks. The mum-of-five was unknowingly suffering from seizures in the lead up to her diagnosis, but thought they were anxiety attacks as she battled to complete her nursing degree. However, after suffering a seizure while visiting her doctor, Sophie was quickly referred for an MRI scan which finally detected the cause of her problems.    She underwent surgery to remove the huge mass and despite being re-diagnosed with another tumour last August, she is sharing her story in a bid to raise awareness. The full time mum said: I thought I was suffering from university stress, I never imagined it would be a brain tumour. I began battling with what doctors thought were symptoms of anxiety such as the seizures and struggling to breathe, just seven months after starting my course to become a nurse. I started to worry when my muscles went stf and began to shake also but doctors reassured me that it did appear as though it was stress related. I described the seizures as not being able to breathe, and they said that because I was a new mum, it sounded more like a panic attack, and wouldnapost take me to hospital.    It wasnapost until the doctors witnessed a seizure in the corridor after an appointment, that they began looking into it more seriously. I then had an MRI scan which detected the huge tumour in the frontal temporal lobe of my brain. I was told I would need to be awake as surgeons removed it which was terrying. Sophie was diagnosed with a cancerous grade  tumour in August,  after her initial diagnosis in  and remained awake for six hours of brain surgery. She added: It was heartbreaking when I was told my tumour ed last year shortly after the birth of my youngest Tommy-Jay, now two.    But I knew I needed to be strong for my children, Grace, , Millie, , Paige, eight, Erin five , and my baby Tommy-Jay two, and I knew I had to continue to fight. My eldest struggles a lot as there isnapost much help for children trying to understand losing a parent so young. I had the first craniotomy on the th March , and the second one awake on the h August  and have since been struggling with my speech and movement. Having to be awake during the second surgery was the worst experience of my le - but the team were amazing.    It was knowing that one wrong move could cause a stroke or a brain bleed. I know Iaposll never be completely free of my tumour, who I have named Timmy, but I intend to enjoy every moment with my kids. My mum always said this quote to me that made me feel braver about how I was having to withstand a storm. These experiences have made me become the storm - Iaposm determined and Iaposll enjoy the le I have.

She ate an olive and commented that it tasted metallic, but her husband Patrick and eight-year-old daughter Lola didnapost notice the same taste. The following morning, Shayna woke up with a numb chin, and by the end of that same day her lips had become numb too. Things quickly spiralled further when Shayna got up the next day and her entire face was paralysed. The -year-old went to an Urgent Care centre where they ran tests to rule out a stroke.    Further tests revealed that Shayna had a rare form of Bellaposs Palsy which affected both sides of her face. Doctors believe that Shayna, from New York, USA, never fully recovered from a virus in November, which, coupled with the busy holiday period played havoc with her weakened immune system. For five weeks, Shaynaaposs face was paralysed which stopped her from being able to eat or drink normally, she couldnapost talk properly and was unable to blink as her left eye wouldnapost close. Shayna hated how the paralysis changed her physical appearance, causing her face to droop slightly and stopping her from being able to talk to people. Shayna even compared herself to Quasimodo from the Hunchback of Notre Dame because she felt like a aposmonsterapos at the time. Shayna said: We went right into Thanksgiving and Christmas and all the chaos of the holiday season. My doctors think that when I got sick, I never fully healed, and my immune system was weakened.  After doing tests to make sure it wasnapost a stroke, they told me I had Bellaposs Palsy and I had the rare form on both sides of my face. They told me it shouldnapost get any worse, butit did, I needed to go to the hospital immediately because then it may actually be a stroke. They prescribed me steroids to reduce the swelling around my nerves and basically told me it was a waiting game. They estimated anywhere from two weeks up to two months or, in extreme cases, two years. Shaynaaposs facial paralysis lasted for five weeks and then she began to gain back some movement of her features. I felt like a monster. Most of the time I tried to laugh it off, comparing myself to Quasimodo from the Hunchback of Notre Dame, but as the weeks went on it got harder to laugh, said Shayna.  Because of my age, I think seeing my face like that made people wonder what it could be. People donapost really understand Bellaposs Palsy until it happens to them or someone they know.

The defendant took advantage of them emotionally and sexually, Assistant US Attorney Tanya Hajjar said.He sold himself as the smartest, most ethical person in the world. He compared himself to Einstein and to Gandhi. But defence lawyer Marc Agnilo told jurors all the women joined Nxivm voluntarily and that Raniere was merely a tough taskmaster, not an abusive criminal mastermind. Raniere has pleaded not guilty to charges of sex trafficking, child abuse imagery and other crimes and faces le in prisonconvicted.  Naked meetings where only aposslave masterapos was clothed Raniere allegedly held meetings in which female aposslavesapos gathered naked on the floor around him while he sat in a chair and lectured them on philosophy, one of the women testied at his criminal trial. The former aposslaveapos, Lauren Salzman, told jurors in federal court in Brooklyn that he would preside over the meetings fully clothed. When he was unable to attend the meetings in person, the women would take a naked photo and text it to him - making sure he could see where they had been branded with his initials, Salzman said. We were to look unorm and happy, said Salzman, .  Belief he could affect weather, technology and heal sick with his aposenergyapos Witnesses at Raniereaposs trial have detailed how Nxivmaposs teachers portrayed him as some kind of god who would unlock a more fulfilling le for his followers.Salzman said some believed he could affect the weather , echoing the testimony of another former member. If he released a new curriculum, for instance, that might create a big storm, Salzman said.People also believed technology acted funny around Keith because of his energy, Salzman added. Raniere, who presented himself as a genius whose unique insights would lead to deeply fulfilling lives, enjoyed a near-mythical reputation among his acolytes, according to witnesses. There were rumblings about abilities he had among Raniere’s closest associates, including healing people and influencing the weather, one witness said. aposSlavesapos restricted to near-starvation diet of a few hundred calories a day Several female members of the alleged New York sex cult, including Smallville actress Allison Mack, became dangerously thin after following near-starvation diets at the direction of the groupaposs leader, a -year veteran of the group claimed. The longtime member, filmmaker Mark Vicente, is a key prosecution witness at the criminal trial. Vicente, who left Nxivm in , said he told Raniere that Mack seemed aposbrokenapos, and Raniere responded: I’m trying to break her. Mack, who starred in the television series Smallville for a decade, was one of five co-defendants, including Seagram liquor heiress Clare Bronfman, who previously pleaded guilty to Nxivm-related crimes. Vicente told jurors that the women would push their diets even further, limiting themselves to a few hundred calories a day, as penancethey slipped up. There seemed to be kind of a club of young women gathering around Allison Mack, and they just didn’t look healthy, he said. Salzman testied that one young woman, identied as Daniela, was confined to a bedroom for two years because she gained weight.  Women branded on pelvic area with aposleaderaposs initialsapos Members of the group were allegedly branded with Raniereaposs initials using a cauterising pen, often on their pelvic areas, in ceremonies which were filmed by members. According to court documents, Nxivm slaves were forced to undergo branding ceremonies, a process that would take up to thirty minutes. The women were forced to stand fully naked while a master ordered another member to film. Some of the victims were told that the brand stood for the four elements - air, earth and water - with the cauterising pen representing fire. But prosecutors allege the shape is a composed of Mr Raniereaposs initials.  , fee to celebrate leaderaposs aposbirthday weekapos Every August, Nxivm members - called Nixians - would dole out ,or more to gather in Silver Bay, New York to celebrate Raniereaposs birthday week, according to court documents. A former member testied that the week included tribute ceremonies to Raniere.The celebration, known as Vanguard Week and centered around Raniereaposs birthday on August , reportedly drew members from across the US and Canada.There was always sort of entertainment or dferent kind of tribute ceremonies to Keith from the dferent centres, or there would be like performances of singers, the witness said in court, according to the Times Union.But it was kind of all centred around the idea of a tribute to Keith and celebrating Keithaposs work. Sort of like summer camp for adults.  Dad of apossex slaveapos finds nude photos taken for aposmasterapos A British woman described her involvement in the alleged sex cult after her dad found nude photographs on iCloud that she had taken for aposgrand masterapos Raniere.The woman, who only used her first name in court, took the stand as the first witness in the federal criminal trial.Sylvie, a -year-old British woman, said she sent naked photos of herself until one day her father called her and suggested she get her own cloud-based storage account, telling her: I found your medical pictures. I felt shame, a tearful Sylvie said, telling jurors she did not want to engage in sexual acts with him but she said she felt she had no choice. The aposcultapossapos participants were allegedly forced to provide potential blackmail material, or collateral, such as explicit videos or damaging information. Raniereaposs lawyer, Marc Agnilo told jurors the collateral was used to confirm the womenaposs commitment but was never intended to be released. Nxivm aposcult leaderapos accused of raping sex slave, , and taking sick photos Raniere is accused of raping a -year-old girl and taking indecent photographs of her.He allegedly convinced the teenager and her three sisters to travel from their native Mexico to New York City. A court heard the -year-old began to rape the girl in the city and made her pose for nude photographs, one of which was shown to a jury.It is alleged Raniere imprisoned one of the older sisters in a room for nearly two years after she showed affection for another man.  She was made to write how sorry she was hundreds of times in letters, the jury heard.The -year-old was allegedly once ordered to enter a room and perform oral sex on a woman who had been blindfolded and tied-up as an offering to Raniere, the court heard. Marc Agnilo, defending, said Raniereaposs sexual encounters with women were consensual and he denied child abuse imagery and sexual exploitation accusations. This is something these people signed up for, the lawyer said. Control can be very bad. Control can also make Marines. Control can make gold medal winners.

When the cousin heard the baby name, her mind instantly went to the numerous jokes online involving the name Karen, meanwhile Stephanie was clearly oblivious. To make matters worse, she claims the other women they were with soon began mocking and gossiping about the name as well.    She wrote: When Stephanie was out of the room, everyone was immediately like, aposOMG that poor kidapos, and aposWhy would she pick Karen of all names apos I was uncomfortable about this conversation, given that everyone had been so positive about the name to her face. I thought more about it over the next couple of days and just felt really weird about the whole thing. The name is really loaded, to the point it could be detrimental to the baby, and she had no idea of the connotations to make an informed decision. So a couple of days later I tentatively brought it up. I told her I was so excited for the baby and just wanted her to have all available information when picking a name. I then started to explain that Karen has some negative connotations and has become sort of an internet joke to describe a specic kind of entitled middle aged woman.    She says her cousin was instantly furious and told her she was just being mean. The pregnant woman really didnapost understand the situation, so the other decided enough was enough and Googled aposKaren know your memeapos on her phone to show her what she was talking about. But Stephanie was still having none of it and stormed out. They havenapost spoken since and her cousin claims to have been berated by family members for mocking the baby name. So she decided to ask the people of the internet whether she was wrong for bringing the meme stuff up in the first place.    More than  people responded to the post, with many branding her an a**hole. One person said: You are the a**hole, You really think itaposs going to matter when this kidaposs older  Itaposs a meme. Oh and for anyone pregnant or planning to have kids, this is why you donapost reveal the name until theyaposre born. Someoneaposs always got something stupid to say, no matter what. Another person commented: Internet memes come and go in a flash, I think [youaposre] massively exaggerating the likelihood that associations will stick around. However others just didnapost like the name and a third added: To be fair, Karen is a pretty crappy name.

The seven-month-old pooch was left abandoned in a ditch by roadside and starved to death with duct tape wrapped around its mouth. Luckily, a cyclist spotted the puppy thrashing around as he drove past a side road in Chainat, central Thailand, on Saturday. The terried puppy had thick black duct tape wrapped several times tightly around her jaws preventing her from eating, drinking, or breathing properly. The cyclist called for police and nearby residents to help rescue the dog.  The volunteers are seen bringing a grilled chicken skewer in a bid to lure the distressed puppy out of the bushes. They spent about  minutes looking around before the hungry brown Aspin traced the smell of the meaty chicken. Villagers had to approach to the dog from behind and covered her head gently before they removed the tape from her mouth.    As soon as the rescuer took off the tape, the puppy quickly ran away into the field while the group cheered each other for saving the stray dog. Resident Apichet Somboon said: We never saw her around before and she didn’t seem to know where she was, so we believed that someone had been cruel and tied her mouth and randomly dumped her here. Luckily, we found her just in time or  she may be starving to death. We wish we could feed her before she ran off, but at least we were very happy to see that she was still healthy.  Police in the Baan Kuay district are now investigating to try and find the owner of the animal. Anyone found guilty of of abusing the dog could face up to two years in prison. A spokesman said: We have spoken to citizens in the area but nobody knows who owned the dog and nobody saw anything suspicious. Those who carry out cruelty to animals without reasonable cause shall be liable to imprisonment for a term not exceeding two years or a fine not exceeding , Baht or both.

One thing I’m certain on is that I want to be a manager but not for a long time.“The workload of a manager is massive. Coaching the team is probably the easiest part and I can’t even do that just yet.“I am very clear that I don’t see going from playing to coaching as natural.

He wanted a change and to test himself in another country.Aberdeen skipper Graeme Shinnie rejected the offer of a lucrative long-term contract from Aberdeen to move to Derby County on a three-year deal.Dempsey said: “I can understand why people leave Scotland to go down to England.“A lot of people think that players leave the Scottish top flight for the money, but I was actually on less money at Yeovil than I would have been at Aberdeen.“It was nothing to do with the money at all, I just fancied a change. That was my reason for leaving.“Jimmywanted to keep me and there was an offer of a two-year extension.“I had been playing in the SPFL at that stage for seven seasons and you play every team four times and on top of that you can also face them in the cup.“You can end up playing a team five or six times in a season.“Whilst it was great playing against Celtic and Rangers, it started to get a bit monotonous.“I just felt I needed a change of scenery. I went down to Yeovil and there were a lot of big teams in League One at that time.“When people ask why players leave the Scottish Premiership for the English League One or Championship, sometimes all they want is a change of scenery.“They want to play against dferent teams and experience dferent stadiums. A lot of the time there are bigger crowds down there as well.”Aberdeen have lost a number of players to the English lower leagues in recent years.Scotland international Kenny McLean joined Norwich City last year and this season won promotion to the top-flight, having played a key part in the Canaries winning the Championship title.Anthony O’Connorand Ash Tayloralso rejected new deals to sign on at League One sides.Taylor is set toto Pittodrie, having had the final year of his three-year contract at Northampton terminated recently by mutual consent.Dempsey said: “I decided to go to England and give it a bash even though I loved Aberdeen.“I went down to Yeovil and stayed for only eight months before getting the chance to go back home to play.“We had been away from Ireland for  years and we had just had our son, so we decided to go home where I had five good years before I retired.“My time at Aberdeen was amazing and I probably shouldn’t have left when I did.“I probably should have stuck around because we had European football the following season.“However, you live and die by your decisions.”Dempsey opted to leave Pittodrie in summer  when the club had secured qualication for the UEFA Cup.Under manager Calderwood, the Dons would qualy for the group stages where they faced La Liga side Atletico Madrid and secured a memorable - win over FC Copenhagen at home.That win secured qualication from the group and a last- showdown with Euro giants Bayern Munich. Following a - draw with Bayern at Pittodrie, the Reds lost - in Germany.Dempsey would, however, go on to star in Europe with St Patrick’s Athletic, his home city club.He said: “Missing out on that European campaign with Aberdeen was a regret because you want to play in those big games against the big teams.“However, when I was with St Pat’s we had a really good Euro run and played teams like Steau Bucharest and Hertha Berlin.“It would have been good to stay on at Aberdeen and in hindsight I probably should have.”Aberdeen secured European action for a sixth successive season under Derek McInnes at the weekend.They will enter the Europa League at the first qualying ruond stage on July .Dempsey said: “To qualy for Europe for six successive seasons is absolutely huge for Aberdeen.“I believe there is a new stadium in the pipeline as well, so there are lots of good things happening at the club.“They have a good manager and a good group of players.“The league is getting very competitive again as Rangers are back and Kilmarnock were strong in the recent season.“It will be a very competitive league# which makes a change.”Dempsey, who now runs his own fitness company, was back in Aberdeen for the first time since leaving the Dons in  as he participated in a charity match at Cove’s Balmoral Stadium.The event, which finished -, raised vital funds for Cash For Kids.“I keep an eye on Aberdeen’s scores,” he said.“One of the things you miss when you retire is the dressing room and the banter.“I hadn’t seen some of them in  years, boys like Kevin McNaughton and Darren Mackie.“Seeing them again was brilliant.”Survey: Chance to have your say on Evening Express sports coverage\" src\"https:www.eveningexpress fp sport survey-chance-to-have-your-say-on-evening-express-sports-coverage embed # secretbKGiLhmrYZ\" data-secret\"bKGiLhmrYZ\" width\"\" \"\" frameborder\"\" marginwidth\"\" margin\"\" scrolling\"no\""},{"url":"https://www.eveningexpress.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2019/05/5ceccfd2aa0631.69272444-132x84.jpg class=attachment-small size-small wp-post-image ","title":"mcinnes niall needs to get head down","story":"Winger Niall McGinn is set to miss Aberdeen’s opening European fixtures as he recovers from ankle surgery.The Dons are set to enter Europa League at the first qualying round stage on Thursday July  with theleg on July .McGinn will be ruled out for both those ties as he continues the rehabilitation from recent surgery on ankle ligament damage.Dons boss Derek McInnes confirmed the Northern Ireland international will notto training until mid-July at the earliest.McInnes also confirmed McGinn is targeting a competitivefor the beginning of August.Should Aberdeen progress to the second qualying round, the -year-old winger would also be ruled out for those ties on July  and August .McInnes said: “The best case scenario for Niall to be back into training with us is the second or third week of July.“Niall has a long road ahead of him but will have to get his head down and work away throughout the summer.“Sometimes it is not until you get right into the rehabilitation that you can knowthere are going to be any upsets.“However,everything goes according to plan then I am pretty sure Niall will be back available to play competitive football again in early August.”That means McGinn could be battling to be match fit and sharp for the third qualying roundthe Dons were to progress to that later stage in the Europa League.The third qualying round is played on Thursday August  and Thursday August .The draw for the first and second qualying rounds will be made at the UEFA headquarters in Nyon, Switzerland, on June  and .Aberdeen will be seeded for both rounds, which should make potential progress easier.Last year the Dons were not seeded when entering at the second qualying round stage and they landed English Premier League side Burnley.The Reds lost out -

This area of Argyll is the most fragile in the region. The people of Argyll, businesses and visitors deserve no less.Forget the squandering of £m on unreliable, mitigation measures trying to justy a flawed decision made many years ago to use the Old Military Road as a ersion which has failed on many occasions and now has a landslip between the two roads. Forget the expensive excavation of pits by the A rather use the cuttings into the hillside to form a two lane road protected with a flow over canopy with closed outer edges at the four problems gullies. If the contractors on the present scheme can work without any road closures then the flow over canopy option would not lead to closures as many officials and some politicians claim.This is a red herring postponing #a proper solution#. When this is option is completed it will save on the expense of manning the ersion route involving - personnel and - vehicles, replacing expensive nettings, delays whilst the farmer clears his animals and collect his fees. A scandalous waste of public money. Solve The Rest Landslides and stop wasting on mitigating measures.Like Brendan O#Hara I#m neither an engineer or geologist but both of us are blessed with plain common sense. If the Faroese can build a tunnel at £.m per kilometre surely a simple open sided m canopy would cost considerably less. In  at Dawlish .km of double tracked railway and .km of sturdy seawall was built at a cost of £m in eight weeks.

Thank you Inveraray and District Accordion and Fiddle Club and Margaret Mather our secretary for this request.So I won#t forget my th in a hurry, but such kindness and friendliness cannot be forgotten ever.My thanks to you all,Niall Iain MacLean, InveraraySir,I read with great interest the letter in the March  edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser from C Rees, Lochgilphead.In addition to all that was mentioned I wonderyour readers are acquainted with the McCrone Report which was written in the s As I’m sure your readers are aware this was when oil had just started flowing from the North Sea. Mr Gavin McCrone was, at that time, a civil servant instructed to write a report on the possible effects of North Sea Oil on the argument for Scotland’s devolution.This quote comes from a letter written, by Mr McCrone, in April : #The Paper was written over a year ago in the weeks immediately before the February  election. This will be particularly apparent on page  where, of course, the ministerial pronouncements referred to relate to the Conservative Government.#So he was instructed to write this report by a Conservative Government but was reporting to a Labour Government.This quote comes from the end of the letter: #When my paper was written it was classied “secret” and given only a most restricted circulation in the Scottish Office because of the extreme sensitivity of the subject.#The report discussed the possibility of Scottish Independence and came to the conclusion: #What is quite clear is that the balance of payments gain from North Sea oil would easily swamp the existing deficit whatever its size and transform Scotland into a country with a substantial and chronic surplus.#Now, this is a very tiny segment from a document that could have changed our history but that’s in the past and we must now look to the future.What is upsetting is thatthis wealth had been invested in an oil fund or more fairly distributed by the  British Government # either Conservative or Labour # there might not, now, be an upsurge in support for separation from Westminster.Wilma Watts, TarbertSir,With Theresa May’s Brexit deal yet again failing to get through the House of Commons and a delay to the date the UK is due to leave the EU, it is clear that we are simply lurching from crisis to crisis.One wonders what good an extension will actually do given the negotiating position of both the EU and the UK. The UK is deadlocked, in terms of its people, Parliament and Cabinet and the likelihood of any semblance of a deal that command the majority of the House of Commons is unlikely. This is especially true given the deep isions within the Tories, both Remainers and Leavers, as well as opposition from the DUP.Given this situation those like myself have long argued that a UK-wide referendum on the deal, a so-called ‘People’s Vote’, with the option to remain in the EU, is the only credible way to break this deadlock. For those who argue that this would damage our democratic process, I am not sure we can slump any lower than the situation we are currently in.As David Davis, the former Brexit Secretary and an ardent Leaver, pointed out before the EU referendum: #If a democracy cannot change its mind, it ceases to be a democracy.#There are few I know who voted for Brexit in the belief it would make them poorer, and it is up to the public to give its view on whether the deal, and more importantly its implications, are what it wants.For once I agree with Jacob Rees-Mogg who previously supported a vote on the renegotiated settlement. A statement he now curiously seems to have forgotten.The Scottish Parliament has led the way in backing a People’s Vote and now that we know the precise nature of the deal, it is up to the public to have its say.Alex Orr, Edinburgh"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column week 13","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsWe could be wrong, but the confusion over Minard war memorial seems to be nothing a sit-down over a cup of tea couldn#t fix.It#s a pity the community missed out on the centenary fund, but there are general UK funds available for war memorials.

An implementation plan was produced in December  to cover the years -. Who in Argyll and Bute is responsible for this plan  How many of the outcomes have been achieved As someone who has been involved with autism personally and professionally for many years, I find it extremely disappointing there seems to be an inability by those in authority to get organised enough to address the issues and provide services for autistic people and their families.There is no need for further drafts and consultations.Someone in the authority needs to take responsibility for the existing strategy and implementation plan and get on with it.Maureen Mackintosh, Ardrishaig.Sir,Scotland’s small building firms had a strong start to , in contrast to the UK construction small and medium sized enterprisesector, according to the Federation of Master BuildersScotland.The FMB State of Trade Survey for the first quarter of , the only quarterly assessment of the UK-wide SME construction sector, showed SME workloads declined for the first time in six years.In Scotland, however, there was a jump of  per cent compared with the previous quarter. Thirty per cent of weighted responses were positive, up from  per cent from the fourth quarter of .It is encouraging the Scottish construction industry is bucking the wider Brexit trend with workloads and enquires in rude health. The UK-wide picture is very dferent, with the construction SME sector overall contracting for the first time in six years.Scotland’s good fortune could be due to fewer EU workers being based north of the border compared with other parts of the country, like in London where one in three construction workers are from the EU.Relying less heavily on migrant workers has meant the Scottish construction industry hasn’t fallen foul of thousands of EU workers ing home during the long march to Brexit due to no longer feeling welcome in the UK or sure of their future here.Scotland’s builders, however, must not be complacent. Looking ahead, the First Minister has indicated thatthe UK does leave the EU later this year, she wants a second independence referendum before the next Scottish Parliament election in . This additional political uncertainty, on top of the continued uncertainty stemming from Brexit, could impact on the construction sector in Scotland.The fear is a looming second referendum could test consumer confidence this year and next. For construction SMEs, this is particularly concerning as their prospects are vulnerable to dips in consumer confidence as so much work comes from the private domestic sector.Gordon Nelson, Director of FMB Scotland.Sir,I was joined by my fellow Conservative councillors in Kilmory recently as we discussed atthe numerous challenges facing Argyll and Bute.Ferry sailings, roads, education and the SNP#s late single farm payments were all mentioned.With the SNP hammering local authority spending and cutting our budgets, challenges in delivering services will become more prevalent.Despite this climate of cuts from the separatists, Conservative councillors are delivering for Argyll.

The weather was a challenge in itself due to the bitter cold, but the young people rose to the challenge and coped admirably.The climax of the weekend was the presentation of six Gold Chief Scout Awards to group members who have been working hard for four years to gain the highest achievement possible for a Scout. All six Scouts who gained the award have now started their careers in the Explorer section of the group.In late March members of the Scout and Explorer section joined with the Heart of Argyll Wildle Organisation to undertake an Earth Hour Camp. During the camp the group discussed how the unit could reduce its impact on the environment and how these changes could be implemented. Plans are now afoot for a further event in May to create an installation that looks at the impact of plastic on the countryside.Most recently three of the leaders, David Smart, Anne Smart and John McCartan took the chance to abseil  feet off the Falkirk Wheel. This event had been organised by Scout Scotland and gave a chance to meet up with other participants from all over Scotland.Looking to the future the group has exciting plans for the summer. The Beavers will be attending a district fun day in May and the Cubs will be participating in a district trophy event in June.The Scouts are heading to a national Scout adventure camp in May and the Explorers are organising an adventurous activities camp in June.Scout leader David Smart said: #In late June th Argyll Scout Group is expecting to host two Norwegian Scout visitors and in July,  members of the group will be heading off for international adventures. Six young people and two leaders are travelling to Malaysia to undertake community projects in a remote northern village and two Explorers will participate in the th World Scout Jamboree in the USA.He continued: #We are sad that our Beaver leader Eli is leaving us for pastures new.

It is obvious to everyone that the pier not being open is a resource wasted.#Inveraray Pier has been in existence since . Comprising an older stone-built section and later timber structure, it was once a thriving hub for Inveraray#s herring fleet and a popular destination for passenger steamers. It was used by everything from pleasure craft to puffers, with the military also making good use of it over the years.In more recent times it has fallen into disrepair and was closed off to public access in the last decade.#When we heard it was for sale we decided to make a bid,# continued Mr Byrne.#It would have been a shame to see it fall into the hands of someone who would want to use it just as a private pier. It#s about securing its future.#The Byrne family intends to re-open the pier for public use # but Mr Byrne is keen to dampen speculation about the potential future uses for the structure.Before anything  happens, the condition of the stone and wooden sections must be assessed, and reports have been commissioned from engineers and conservation architects.#I don#t want to raise expectation unnecessarily, but the most likely scenario is that we look to re-open the stone pier first of all,# explained Mr Byrne.Repairs would be needed to the stone structure and ironwork. New handrails and safety equipment would be needed along with lighting and basic security measures such as CCTV.Beyond that, the future of the wooden pier looks less certain.refurbishment is not an option, alternatives might include floating pontoons, while the potential for dredging around the pier and harbour might be considered.Through an agent, The Argyll Partnership, the Byrne family has contacted the Clyde Marine Planning Partnership with a view to having Inveraray included in the fledgling Clyde Regional Marine Plan, stressing that the pier #represents a great opportunity to contribute to the economic, social and environmental needs of the Clyde Marine Region#.And the new owners have said that the community council, Inspire Inveraray and others from the area will be fully involved as the redevelopment takes shape. The plans are also said to have the backing of the Duke of Argyll.Mr Byrne concluded: #Hopefully local people will want to help and come forward with ideas.#I don#t want to raise hopes at this early stage, but I hope that buying the pier is a good thing to do.#"},{"url":null,"title":"sports club lotteries 24 5 19","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThe numbers drawn for the Kilmory Camanachd Club lottery draw on Monday May  were ,  and .

revealed that the council paid the sum over the last six weeks, in order to get a former employee to sign a non-disclosure agreement.The request has also revealed that Scottish Borders Council has spent pound, of taxpayersrsquo money on so-called lsquogagging ordersrsquo since April .Non-disclosure agreements are contracts which are signed by both employee and employer, and which typically prevent staff or ex-staff from publicising certain information.That information can range from commercially sensitive details, such as innovations or company finances, to anything likely to damage an organisationrsquos reputation.Non-disclosure agreements have also infamously been used to prevent employees discussing allegations of misbehaviour, with a number of high profile cases in the UK making national headlines.A Scottish Borders Council spokesperson said: ldquoNon-disclosure agreementsare included in ious types of agreement entered into by the council to resolve a situation.ldquoNDAs are included for the benefit of both the council and the other party parties.ldquoIt is important to note that an NDA is one part of an overall agreement to settle a dispute, and the majority of any costs will be met from within the relevant servicersquos budget.The contracts are sometimes used when employees and their organisations have reached a settlement to a dispute, such as a claim of wrongful dismissal, without going through a full employment tribunal hearing.Reacting to the payouts, Hawick and Hermitage councillor Davie Paterson said: ldquoI am a bit concerned at the use of no disclosure agreements, surely council tax payers are entitled to a full and comprehensive explanation as to why the council them ldquoThe public, quite rightly, will be asking why do the council have to pay out this money, they may be asking is there something wrong with the management at the top ldquoThe public would love to know why pound, has to be spent to keep a former employee quiet when this admin are making cuts left right and centre, but yet they can find pound, to give to former employees.However, the councilrsquos leader of the opposition, Tweeddale East councillor Stuart Bell, urged a more even-handed approach to non disclosure agreements.He said: ldquoSecrecy by a public authority is sometimes necessary, but any overuse does not reflect well on a public authority which should be committed to openness and transparency. ldquoI read of growing concern about the use of non disclosure agreements across a range of public bodies with Westminster MPrsquos, for example, calling for these to be made lsquoa thing of the pastrsquo.ldquoThat said I donrsquot currently think that Scottish Borders Councilrsquos use of these agreements is particularly out of line with their use by other Scottish local authorities. ,params: .pushldquoInformation is limited by some, for example Edinburgh and Aberdeen cities, refusing to respond to freedom of information requests for details. ldquoBut Glasgow City, who have responded to an FOI, and are a much larger local authority than the Scottish Borders, have applied non disclosure agreements more than six times as frequently as Scottish Borders Council over the last five years.ldquoI am minded, as chair of the councilrsquos audit and scrutiny committee, to discuss with colleagues on this committee whether to suggest we should scrutinise the councilrsquos use of non disclosure agreements. ldquoThis would, of course have to be done in strict privacy, but it might allow some reassurance to the public that these agreements are not being overused."},{"url":null,"title":"gearing-up-to-get-more-girls-on-their-bikes","story":"A PROJECT aimed at wooing women onto the saddle is ing for a second year.Following the

He goes to bed with his T rex, plays with dinosaurs constantly and knows even the complicated names of lesser-known dinosaurs.However, we have tried very consciously to allow our kids to be who they are and resist the gender stereotyping that defines what a girl should be and what a boy should be.But here was my youngest daughter, at the age of five, clearly articulating the ision between girlsrsquo and boysrsquo toys.Her list was in line with the way toys are still marketed. Often there are two versions of the same thing, one for girls and one for boys.Even some story books are defined in this way, with images and colours which are used to reinforce the gender identity of the object evengender is not specically mentioned.Donrsquot get me wrong, I have no problem that my son loves dinosaurs.But I do have a problem with marketing directed at my children to force them into a narrow definition of what toys they should like based on a patriarchal version of gender.In truth, itrsquos not so much the toys themselves but the emotions and ways of being that are deliberately connected to them.Itrsquos the idea that boysrsquo stuff promotes bravery, toughness, being fierce and adventurous, while girlsrsquo stuff promotes cuteness, romance, beauty and love.It is changing and itrsquos much better than it used to be because there is so much more awareness and debate about this issue. Gender neutral marketing is more common now, mainly as a result of public pressure.But as the conversation with my daughter shows, we still have a way to go.But does it really matter  Is it just a politically correct obsession that is making a mountain from a molehill ldquoBoys will be boys, after all, and ldquogirls are all sugar and spice, and all things nice.It really matters, of course, and I think it matters just as much for my son as my daughters, perhaps even more so.That may be controversial, but I believe that as gender stereotyping is being challenged, it is often more dficult for boys to free themselves from the traditional definition of male identity than it is for a girl.I say this as a father of four girlsand one boy.Perhaps part of the reason for this is the fact that being male is still in many ways the privileged gender, and so there is an understandable focus on removing the restrictive definition of female roles which limit opportunities for women.But the struggle for gender equality has to be a two-way processit is to be ultimately successful.We must also unshackle our boys from the narrow definition of what it is to be male, a definition which still remains powerfully entrenched in our mindsets and the way society works.I personally suffered from this when at school. I was ldquosoft, sensitive, a daydreamer. I was often made to feel I was not a proper boy. There was no space for me to realise that the lsquoladdishrsquo way of being male was not the only way.Irsquom not advocating taking the dinosaurs away from my son and forcing him to play with a unicorn or Barbie doll. Even I loved dinosaurs when I was young. But it does mean allowing him, and yes encouraging him, to explore sides to his nature that society would still label as feminine: nurture, co-operation, make-up, dresses, dancing, looking after dolls and toys, and feeling vulnerable and being allowed to express it.The best way to encourage boys to express this part of who they are is through role modelling by other men, especially in the early years of childhood when a childrsquos brain is forming, and the childrsquos view of how the world works is being created.This includes how to treat others on a personal level.So nurture and care by male family members can be a crucial part of this. But one gender inequality we rarely hear about is the fact that men make up only two per cent of early years childcare workers. And this is an inequality not just for adults, but for our children.It conveys the message to young children that caring and nurture is not a manrsquos job or a male quality. So we grow up believing this is lsquonaturalrsquo.And this idea is so entrenched that there have even been examples of parents complaining that a man is working in a nursery!Looking after children is as much a manrsquos job as it is a womanrsquos. Or it should be, and seen to be. But itrsquos not just about work, or even childcare or parenthood. Itrsquos about ways of being and understanding that there are hundreds of ways to be a man or woman and we all have the right to make our own path.Thatrsquos why itrsquos important from the beginning to show that therersquos no such thing as boysrsquo toys or girlsrsquo toys: there are childrenrsquos toys.Or perhaps more accurately, to show the emotions and qualities traditionally associated with them are not gender specic.As always, children teach us. When we got home, Lewis put his T rex to bed. ldquoHersquos tired, he said, ldquoand hersquos a nice T rex.This was my lesson from my son: a T rex can be nice.He summed up the issue as only a child can."},{"url":null,"title":"looking-back-25-years-since-east-lothians-independence","story":"Twenty-five years ago this week, the Courier proclaimed the news with the headline: ldquoItrsquos independence for East Lothian.This week, East Lothian Council chief executive Angela Leitch said: ldquoThe Local GovernmentAct of  saw the abolishment of the two-tier Region and District Councils to be replaced with  unitary authorities across Scotland.\"I believe this has greatly benefited East Lothian communities, as responsibility for major services including education and social work were decentralised from Edinburgh and instead became the focus of political decisions at a more localised level.\"Over the years, our politicians have ensured ongoing investment in all of our towns and villages, providing facilities for local people, developing our infrastructure and continually working to improve the services we deliver. This has been recognised in a iety of inspection reports that have confirmed that East Lothian Council is a high performing council and has an ethos which recognises the importance of working closely with its residents and communities.\"Our elected members all live within the county, understand local issues and can ably represent the views of communities.\"Previously, some political decisions about our county were approved by people who had no real knowledge of East Lothian.\"Local government reorganisation has improved both local democracy and the ability of local people to hold the council accountable for the decisions it takes.Here, we take a look back at how we reported the news that the county had secured its place as a stand-alone local authority in the upcoming local

can stand on its own two feet.From , the district will once again become master of its own house as an all-purpose local authority.It means East Lothian councillors will be responsible for running a full range of services ndash from education and social work to rubbish collection and recreation.The Local Government Bill which will end the -year lespan of Scotlandrsquos network of region, district and island authorities is currently going through its final stages in Parliament.And earlier this week, Mr Lang ndash supported by local Labour MP John Home Robertson ndash tabled an amendment to give East Lothian the go-it-alone status it wanted.It was the high point in a hard-fought campaign by angry locals which began last year when the Government announced its original intention to lump East Lothian in with Berwickshire.But their success in fighting off that idea was not the end of the battle ndash they still had to persuade Mr Lang and his local government minister Allan Stewart that East Lothian was NOT too small to become an authority in its own right.They had also to force them to give up alternative plans to create an East Lothian-Midlothian-West Lothian authority ndash and

are absolutely delighted with the outcome.He said it was dficult to say what eventually changed the minds of ministers.ldquoBut I have no doubt that the campaign the district council fought had a lot to do with it.He added: ldquoIf I was being charitable, I would say it was a case where the Scottish Office actually listened to the people for a change...It was, however, a ldquogreat decision for the people of East Lothian, who had supported the campaign from the start.ldquoI would like to thank all those who came out on the streets and took part in demonstrations in the early days of the campaign ndash and all those who wrote to Ian Lang in support of the idea that East Lothian should be an all purpose authority.Councillor Wanless totally rejected the previously-held Government view that East Lothian was too small to stand on its own.ldquoWe currently have a population of something like , and growing.ldquoBy the year  we could have at least , and my colleagues and I along with our officials are confident we can handle all the services that the new council will be responsible for.And he insisted: ldquoWe will do so in the same economic and efficient way the electorate have been accustomed to over the years.MP John Home Robertson said the White Paper to reform local government could have been the ldquodeath knell for East Lothian.ldquoBut people all over East Lothian fought back in a massive local campaign and we have won a magnicent victory.He paid tribute to Councillor Wanless and others who took part in the campaign, saying: ldquoWe have shown that public pressure can move even this Government.ldquoHowever, we are not out of the woods yet.ldquoLocal government is all about providing important services to local communities and we must continue to fight to ensure that East Lothian is properly provided with the funds it requires through revenue support grants.The councilrsquos Conservative group leader, the Rev Dr David Whiteford, said: ldquoI am very pleased that the Scottish Office ministers have listened to the electorate.ldquoThe view of the electors all along has been consistent ndash that East Lothian could and should be an all-purpose authority.ldquoI believe East Lothian has the capacity and potential to become an authority on its own and its staff are well capable of serving very well the needs of all the people.He added: ldquoI am very pleased that that message has now been accepted by the Scottish Ministers and that they have departed almost entirely from their original plan.ldquoLarge is not always beautul and I think we can do better on our own.He believed the transition to a stand-alone East Lothian council would be fairly simple.ldquoThe staff structures are already on the ground and all you really need to do is build on that.ldquoI do not anticipate a great deal of dficulty.ldquoIt is a challenge.ldquoIt is something that we should think through.ldquoWe have a new council coming into being and we should try to run it in a new style way.ldquoI hope councillors will concentrate on the needs of East Lothian people and will try and make that their main concern.Said SNP councillor George Thomson: ldquoEast Lothian has a growing population.ldquoWe have a good district council which is well capable of becoming a single tier all-purpose authority."},{"url":null,"title":"worlds-best-young-golfers-about-to-descend-on-east-lothian","story":"They will battle it out for top spots in the tournament, which will be played at Musselburgh GC,

Trees emit chemicals too, and darken the land, thus absorbing heat. But letrsquos not quibble. The Committee on Climate Changewhich inspired last weekrsquos landmark target, is in no doubt that mass reforestation ndash and wersquore talking billions of trees ndash will be one of the major methods of scrubbing CO from the atmosphere.Scottish Greens: How you can help fight climate changeScotland is well placed to deliver on this at least. Those barren hills and glens used to be under a dense covering of foliage. The forests were cleared for agriculture and charcoal in the south, and latterly for sheep and deer in the north. So mass forestation is only restoring the ecological default in Scotland.Nice to know, too, that Scotland, on paper at least, is leading the way on meeting climate change targets, having reduced emissions by a creditable % since . This is better than the UK as a whole, which is itself a world-leader in climate control. Scotlandrsquos abundant renewable energy is going to play a major role in transforming the UK economy.Transport is one of the main areas yet to be decarbonised, and every watt of that green energy is needed to make the switch from petrol and diesel in the next decade. Itrsquos long overdue. The internal combustion engine is th-century technology, horribly complex, unreliable and inefficient. Future generations will be astonished that we allowed our city streets to remain sewers of toxic chemicals.Mind you, the Scottish Government needs to put its foot on the environmental accelerator pedal. It is three years since I wrote a series of articles on electric cars after being allowed to drive some of them around Scotland. There were precious few charging points back then, and therersquos scarcely any more now. Yet, the electrication of transport should be a relatively simple exercise.Every petrol station should be a charging station, every supermarket car park, every school and hospital. Wherever cars congregate, in fact. The good news is that no-one who tries a modern electric car will want to drive anything , because they are faster, cheaper, safer and more reliable.Of course, manufacturing any car uses prodigious amounts of energy too, requires many costly materials and produces toxic waste. Electric cars arenrsquot a solution to climate change, but electrication of transport must be, especially micro-transportation. Every city in Europe seem to be turning to those electric scooters ndash except in the UK where they are illegal. Half of the bicycles sold in Germany now are electric. People are turning naturally to more energy-efficient transport so why not give them a push :Climate clock is ticking and now is time for politicians to fightThe CCC report was rather benign on flying. Yoursquoll be pleased to know that itrsquos not being phased out. This is probably because reducing aviation requires international agreement. However, cuts in air passenger duty seem dficult to justy. The Scottish Government wants APD cut by % to attract more business and tourists to Scotland. But Nicola Sturgeon is going to have to bite the environmental bullet here. The optics are wrong. It looks too much like a middle-class subsidy, even though many working-class people swear by Ryanair.Then therersquos the nuclear conundrum. Scotlandrsquos nuclear power stations account for % of electricity generation ndash a large proportion of our nominally clean energy. But they are old and unreliable and in need of replacement. However, nuclear power stations are regardedas a safety issue following Fukushima. They are also ruinously expensive and damage the environment by producing toxic waste which needs to be stored for thousands of years.The nuclear industry leapt upon last weekrsquos CCC report as a vindication of nuclear as part of the de-carbon equation. Big money is going into painting the atom green. But the prospect of the Scottish Government commissioning a new nuclear plant, given the explosive cost of Hinkley Point C, Englandrsquos first new nuclear power station in decades, seem remote. Renewable energy is much cheaper, joule for joule,it can be brought to grid fast enough. We are in a race against time to seeTorness and Hunterston can be made redundant before they fall apart.There are other issues too. Homes need to be insulated, gas boilers are going to have to go. Wersquore told to keep our home thermostats at  degrees, when most of us donrsquot have them. Itrsquos all expected to cost -% of GDP. But what was remarkable about last weekrsquos much-anticipated report was how doable it all appeared. By comparison with the apocalyptic forecasts of the climate Cassandras, like -year-old school striker Greta Thunberg, the CCC sounded like a walk in the environmental park. Nicola Sturgeon insists that cutting carbon will improve our health and wellbeing and the quality of le. Wersquoll all be happier, cleaner and probably working less in our new habitable planet.I hope shersquos right. There was an air of wishful thinking about last weekrsquos pronouncements. But therersquos nothing wrong with accentuating the positive. The problem with the more alarmist forecasts of Extinction Rebellion, who want net zero by , is that they induce not willingness to change, but a sense of futility and public apathy. If addressing climate change is going to involve banning travel, eating no meat, digging for vegan victory and plunging the economy into a biblical recession, as we close down whole sectors of industry, then people will not buy into it. The Yellow Vest movement was ignited by an environmental tax.Scottish Greens: How you can help fight climate changeIt may well be that the climate change targets are still too conservative. According to the UNrsquos International Panel on Climate Change, CO emissions need to be cut faster to prevent the planet warming by more than .C ndash the new tipping point. But the Scottish and UK governments have consistently outperformed their targets since they started making them seriously over a decade ago. They can do so again.Much of climate hygiene is self-evident. The public are morally signed up to it, and while abandoning their petrol and diesel cars may seem a grim prospect now, in practice it is likely to be a liberation. Most cars spend their lives sitting near a pavement losing value through depreciation. With proper public transport and urban alternatives, everyone wins.Vested interests are always a block on progress, but there is now a remarkable consensus, from the CBI to the GMB, BP to the NFU, the BMA to BMW. Addressing climate change need not take us back to a pre-industrial world of squalor, disease and hardship.

As he saw it, they were to celebrate Scotlandrsquos strengths in arts, comedy, science and ldquothought. To reflect the countryrsquos ersity. To allow audiences ldquoto interrogate the things that matter to them and, along the way, to ldquoreinvent public service broadcasting. BBC Scotland, he stressed, would offer space for discussion and debate alongside opportunities to ldquokick back and have fun. It would be about the country speaking to itself but also to the world. It would be local, national and global.In other words it would be a lot of things to a lot of people. Or it would try to be. So, three months after its glitzy birth and with the numbers soon to roll over to Day  of its existence, how is BBC Scotland bedding in  What do audiences think of it  And how well is it measuring up to Hallrsquos lofty claims Steve Carson, BBC Scotlandrsquos Head of Multi-Platform Commissioning, is predictably bullish about its prospects and its track record. To his mind the station is about trying to take risks, giving a  to ldquoa strong range of voices and communities and doing ldquonew things and dferent things. So far the strike rate is good, he thinks. Among the successes he points to are Getting Hitched Asian Style, a documentary series following a wedding planning company in Glasgow, the opening night screening of Nae Pasaran , and Last Breath, a drama documentary about a North Sea er stranded on the sea-bed.Identying a stand-out is ldquolike naming your favourite child, he says. ldquoBut I think Asian Weddings is something I was pleased to see hellip It was quite straightforward but it got into communities you donrsquot often see and certainly donrsquot often see in that sort of context.For an example of risk-taking that paid off he points to Sink Or Skim, which took a fond look at the World Stone Skimming Championship held annually on the isle of Easdale in the Firth of Lorn.ldquoThatrsquos not a subject many channels would have commissioned, but it was a beautully made piece and it was funny watching it go out and looking at social media because people were going lsquoI canrsquot believe theyrsquore doing something about stone skimming. Is this part of their sport portfolio rsquo. But by the end of it the same people were going lsquoThat was really goodrsquo.Sink Or Skim was a one-off but The Peoplersquos News is a weekly discussion of topical events in which ordinary Scots go in front of the camera and have their tuppence-worth on topical events. Those featured might not have the political contacts of a Laura Kuenssberg, say, but they have something just as important: context. They represent the social and political views of people in a spread of communities distant from London and far removed from the Central Belt. Itrsquos another example of the channelrsquos guiding principle that BBC Scotland should be a  for discussion and debate and again itrsquos a programme that wouldnrsquot have aired anywhere .ldquoWe could have done a dferent version of this channel which would have been a lot less risky and done a lot more of what other channels do, says Carson. ldquoA Scottish version of BBC Four, for example, would have been a less risky proposition. But we already have that, so we felt it was important to try new things, go for harder to reach audiences and deliberately take risks knowing that not all of them ndash in fact many of them ndash wonrsquot pay off. Thats what wersquore about.So which risks havenrsquot paid off ldquoThatrsquos like naming your least favourite child, he says. ldquoI think the programmes that we have originated between pm and pm have had a tough time, but again our medium term strategy was not to originate as much there. The Nine has had ratings which have gone up and down, but wersquove always said thatrsquos a competitive slot. But on a digital channel ndash and wersquore already the biggest non-terrestrial channel in Scotland with a three per cent share, which is well ahead of projections ndash audiences will go up and down across the night and the week.:  years of rock and roll - and all that jazzIf therersquos a lightning rod for criticism, The Nine is it. An hour in , staffed by a team of presenters and journalists that numbers  ndash at least in the publicity shots ndash and fronted by Rebecca Curran and award-winning former ITN journalist Martin Geissler, itrsquos the stationrsquos flagship news programme.A lot rides on its wellbeing and it seems a little peaky. It was reported that on one day in late April viewing figures dropped to just . They picked up the following day, to , but even on April , the first day of the inquiry into the Clutha disaster, they couldnrsquot quite hit . From a first night high of ,, thatrsquos a signicant drop.ldquoThe Ninersquos average is signicantly higher than that figure and its reach, which is really important in news, is reaching a quarter of a million a week, Carson counters. ldquoItrsquos offering something dferent. If you wanted to point at a show which is something we wouldnrsquot have otherwise done, The Nine is it ndash an hour long news and analysis programme which looks at Scotland, the UK and the world through Scottish eyes.So is it simply the right show but in the wrong time slot ldquoWersquoll see. Nine orsquoclock is a competitive slot but there is a demand there and people are turning to it. The appreciation for The Nine is very strong and wersquore finding that across the board. You might get some programmes that donrsquot have huge average audiences but the appreciation is strong.In a front page story earlier this month, London-based broadsheet the Sunday Times quoted a BBC source who called The Nine ldquoa turkey. The same source added: ldquoYou canrsquot have a channel that nobody watches. Journalists like their output to be watched and it wonrsquot be long until some of the channelrsquos main talent head for the door. Another source spoke of a ldquopoisonous atmosphere in the newsroom causing behind-the-scenes tensions which could cause key staff to walk. True or   ldquoThat is not the case, Carson says bluntly.Among the keenest watchers of how BBC Scotland has fared over these first three months is Dr Lisa Kelly, a lecturer in television at Glasgow University.ldquoIrsquove been pleasantly surprised, she says. ldquoI think I probably wasnrsquot holding out much hope at the beginning, primarily due to the budget ndash pound million for programming isnrsquot much to play with in the television landscape.To put the budget in context, the BBC is spending nearly three times that amount on the new EastEnders set. But funding aside, Kelly is excited by the apparent focus on nurturing and showcasing new talent. Shersquos also impressed by the choice of programmes and pleasantly surprised at the internationalism of its outlook. One innovation she particularly welcomes is the Next Big Thing strand, which screens short films such as as Meet Me By The Water by Scots-Asian writer-director Raisah Ahmed.ldquoI think therersquos been quite a range of programming. It seems like they are trying to be erse in terms of their representation. So obviously you have Getting Hitched Asian Style and The Nine, which is trying to tackle current debates around issues of representation. So I think it has been quite successful so far.And does it matterratings are low for some programmes ldquoI donrsquot know that it does this early on. I think itrsquos important that we have access to original Scottish programming at a local and national level.There are other challenges, she thinks, besides ratings. One is establishing the channelrsquos identity. ldquoIrsquom not quite sure what its brand is yet in terms of how itrsquos selling itself. I noticed that before the launch it was targeting young people with this notion of fresh and original ideas, but I donrsquot know whether theyrsquoll be able to sustain that.Another is proving that the bold talk ndash of nurturing young talent, giving voice to dferent groups and communities, taking risks and tackling ersity ndash will be backed by bold actions.Wherersquos the Scottish Phoebe Waller-Bridge, for example  And how embedded is the commitment to ersity and inclusion, to actually hearing new voices and seeing dferent stories rather than it just being rhetoric with no change Theyrsquore questions for which Steve Carson has a ready answer. Sothe Scottish Phoebe Waller-Bridge was out there with a project she was aching to make, is he convinced he would find her and commission it ldquoI hope so. And I think we are finding quite extraordinary talent at all levels and also stretching people who might already have done one thing but are now doing something . Like State Of It, which is Robert Florence [co-writer of sketch show Burnistoun] doing quite a scabrous satirical show. Itrsquoll be coming out in the autumn.There is data which can help, however. A measuring system known as ldquosocial listening can analyse social media responses to any subject and from that gain an insight into how that subject is viewed, expressed as the over-riding emotion associated with it.:  years of rock and roll - and all that jazzBBC Scotland set the algorithms running at launch and four weeks later the results came back. ldquoThe strongest emotion in social listening was surprise, says Carson. ldquoThat was really encouraging. So modern Scotland, outward looking, surprising and focussed on new talent ndash thatrsquos the core identity of the channel. SoBBC Scotland is a keyboard emoji, itrsquos a colon and a zero.Three months ago, the channel launched with a Miracle. Whether itrsquoll need another one to make it sing in the long term is harder to judge. As they probably donrsquot teach you to say in continuity announcer school, watch this space.BBC Scotland: The Good, The Bad And The NineGetting Hitched Asian StyleA behind-the-scenes documentary following Glasgow wedding planners Saffron Events as they prepare for a succession of glamorous weddings, Getting Hitched Asian Style proved so successful that it received a repeat run on BBC One and has been re-commissioned for a second series on BBC Scotland. Produced by the Scottish ision of London-based Firecracker Films itrsquos a good example of the channelrsquos stated commitment to programmes which reflect Scotlandrsquos ersity. Verdict: funny, interesting, occasionally jaw-dropping but ultimately humane.A View From The TerraceBorn out of The Terrace, a long-running podcast, AVFTT is fronted by four young presenterswho sit on sofas and talk engagingly about Scottish football. Refreshingly free of Old Firm bias itrsquos fast becoming a Friday night staple for those fans of the Beautul Game who think subjects such as the on- and off-field shenanigans of Partick Thistle legend Chic Charnley or how Eriskay has one of the best pitches in the world are as worthy of discussion as whorsquoll be the next manager of Real Madrid. Verdict: a great signing.Sanjeev Kohlirsquos Big TalkA weekly show in which the comedian is joined by a  of guests for a ldquosideways look at the big issues of the week, filmed in what looks like the foyer of the BBCrsquos Pacic Quay HQ in Glasgow in front of what looks like a smattering of audience members. ldquoI never in my le want to endure another excruciatingly mirthless hour of supposedly witty commentary on the weekrsquos news, wrote one Herald critic. ldquoIt was so awful the only way to hang on to consciousness was to watch what was happening outside the glass-fronted studio. Less trenchant criticism has concentrated on the showrsquos stfness and its uneven format. Verdict: could do better.WonderballItrsquos probably destined for cult status among Generation Z-ers as an endless source of memes, but in the here and now BBC Scotlandrsquos flagship gameshow hasnrsquot been exactly showered with love. Letrsquos not take it too far, though: Wonderball is not, as right-leaning tabloid the Daily Mail has suggested, the worst show of its type ever aired, eventhat paper might like it to be. But you canrsquot say that those who have pointed out its flaws ndash the somewhat complicated rules, say, or the unintentional snigger value of two young men being instructed to play with the blue balls ndash donrsquot have a case. It hasnrsquot been a ratings hit either, with viewership dropping as low as  for one episode. Verdict: not utterly pointless, but not likely to become the next Pointless.The NineA team of talented and accomplished presenters, a  minute running time and a news agenda that blends hard-hitting investigations with quirky or thought-provoking items hasnrsquot stopped BBC Scotlandrsquos flagship news programme taking considerable flak from some quarters. Earlier this month one newspaper talked of a ldquotalent exodus from the channel and quoted a BBC insider who called The Nine ldquoa turkey. Damage has undoubtedly been done as a result: negative news stories about behind-the-scenes tensions and potential resignations may not be true, but they contribute to a narrative of failure which becomes hard to shake over time. What is true is that ratings for The Nine have been disappointing on occasions, though in mitigation its time slot doesnrsquot help. Verdict: a rocky start for a potentially stellar offering that may flourish in a dferent time slot."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/9892229.jpg?type=article-full","title":"how-to-plan-your-perfect-tailor-made-holiday","story":"Bespoke luxury holidays are a dominant force within the current climate, with more and more travellers setting their sights on worldwide locations and unique pursuits.

The evidence is still here from over-priced housing to the infestation of x vehicles designed to combat kangaroos in the Australian outback, but now choking city roads.The bonanza brought personal prosperity to many.

There is little evidence of a coherent economic strategy when the well runs dry. The regionrsquos economy is still very much a one trick pony and to date there is little sign of the forward thinking and ersication evident on Tayside.Aberdeen has been poorly served by administrations of ying political hues. The Scottish Government however, is not blameless for the lack of a Plan B for the Granite City. Aberdeen has been consistently short-changed by central governmentrsquos annual funding allocation.

The fund has enabled Norwegians to invest their metaphorical and literal fortune for the benefit of present and future generations.The Scottish Government is failing to secure the future of the Aberdeen area. Millions have flowed from the area to fund developments in the central belt and beyond. Damnably little has been re -invested to prepare Aberdeen for le after oil.

However, there is evidence to suggest that traditional loyalties to mainstream political groups have experienced a signicant sht as voter frustration with the perceived torpor of the historic two main partiescontinues to grow.Regardless of why they voted for the Brexit Party, I presume that those who did are aware of the partys broad aims and policies, even although they have no manesto.The Brexit Party is essentially a company that masquerades as a populist group centred on a leadership cult. Many media outlets believe the group is funded by dark money with the businessman, Arron Banks, acting as puppet master to the narcissistic Mr Farage. The original leader, Catherine Blaiklock, resigned in March of this year after posting Islamophobic comments online. Shortly afterwards, the party treasurer Michael McGough also resigned following anti-Semitic and homophobic social media posts.Though Mr Farage attempts to adopt a veneer of respectability, the party is essentially xenophobic and racist, mirroring much of the European far-right parties at present. He is an opportunist with short-term soundbites but no long-term economic or social strategy. Mr Farage thrives on chaos and disorder and, like most extremists, only presents as a solution in times of desperation and despair.The partys constitution advocates lowering of taxation for the wealthy and a desire to diminish the role of the state, in short, a dismantling of the NHS, the eradication of or swingeing cuts to benefits and an Americanisation of workers rights.If you did decide to vote for the Brexit Party under the disingenuous guise that the referendum result must be honoured above all commonsense then so be it. However, those who live by pseudo-democratic principles may also die by them.Owen Kelly, Stirling.PARTY in government in Westminsterndash fth in the EU elections party in government in Scotlandndash first in EU Elections.

The council’s Infrastructure Services Committeedecided on Thursday, May  to introduce alternative arrangements to push up recycling rates and reduce materials sent to landfill. They approved an option to use households’ existing bins in a three-weekly collection cycle while officers continue to work to explore funding opportunities for further changes. One bin and a food waste caddy will continue to be collected every week meaning week one will start with general waste binsand food waste collected, week two will see Recycling binand food waste collected, and week three will also be a recycling bin and food waste collection.The materials that can be recycled on the kerbside remain the same - the only dference is that the blue-lidded recycling bin is emptied more often.The new service will be piloted in some areas in  and rolled out to the rest of Aberdeenshire in .Households will be contacted in advance by post.As over % of the waste produced in Aberdeenshire is recyclable using the existing recycling services, this change should allow an increased recycling rate, while work continues to seek other ways to push that up even further using kerbside services. ISC chair Peter Argyle said: “Clearly the decision by Zero Waste Scotland not to consider our funding bid has had a negative effect on our well-developed plans to push up Aberdeenshire’s recycling rate and send less recyclable materials to landfill.“This was not our first choice as a solution, but this is the position we find ourselves in and we feel that this option makes the most of a dficult situation and will help push up recycling rates. “At present, we see this as an interim measure, while we work to deliver a permanent scheme which provides a service for our residents which enables them to recycle as many materials as possible.data-src\"https:images-e.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.ellontimes webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Meldrum Library is located at the Academy campus\"  Help Doctor Who by visiting library viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"ELLO | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"ELLO | Article Teaser\"“One of the key things we continue to try to impress is that we want residents to simply think for a second about how they dispose of the waste they generate, then use the services we provide as best they can.” Vice chair John Cox said: “It can come as no surprise to anyone that councils are trying their hardest to offer services which push up recycling rates and make the most of recyclable materials. “I’m pleased officers have been able to come up with an interim alternative which keeps us moving in the right direction. “Although landfill capacity is essentially reduced,recycling services are used to their full capacity most households should be able to cope and the use of the food waste bin means there should be no additional hygiene issues either.”Other changes to be introduced under the new Waste Strategy are still going ahead – including improvements to Household Waste Recycling Centres from this month and an increased number of garden waste collection points across the area this summer.Over half the materials in local non-recyclable waste bins are recyclable through existing services – equating to around , tonnes of recyclable materials being landfilled at a cost of £.million a year.Not only does maximising the value of a material benefit the environment, it also frees up money for other essential council services."},{"url":null,"title":"changes to come at aberdeenshire hwrcs","story":"As part of Aberdeenshire#s sht towards greater recycling rates and sending less materials to landfill, tyres and asbestos will no longer be accepted at any of the area#s Household Waste Recycling Centresfrom Monday, June .The change, which also applies to four of the council’s waste transfer stations, is expected to save around £, a year and have minimal impact on householders. The money saved will be used to employ extra staff at recycling centres, who will advise customers how best to dispose of materials, helping to increase recycling rates and reduce disposal costs. Tyres are not classed as household waste and the council has no legal responsibility to deal with them – anyone buying new tyres can pay for disposal of the old ones at the same time. Although one of the lowest tonnages of any materials handled at HWRCs, tyres are one of the most expensive to dispose of. With very limited options to recycle or reuse them, they are currently sent to a cement kiln for use as fuel, at a cost to the council. Asbestos, only currently accepted by the council at four sites under limited circumstances, is currently sent to a specialist landfill site for disposal at signicant cost. Although tyres and asbestos together only account for less than .% of the waste handled by the council each year, neither method of dealing with these materials is classed as recycling. Waste Manager, Ros Baxter, said: “We know a very small number of Aberdeenshire residents bring tyres or asbestos to the council for disposal. This service is an expensive one to provide and only benefits a few residents. “Neither of these materials contribute to the council’s recycling rate, but they do cost signicant amounts of money to deal with and take up space at the facilities where they are collected. “Requiring the person or company which generates this type of waste to ensure it is disposed of correctly at their expense not only saves the council money which is being reinvested in better services, it also frees up space for the recycling of other materials in future.“Many tyre retailers offer a disposal service for old tyres for a small fee and vehicle users should make use of this service where possible, as most people do.“There are commercial companies who will accept asbestos waste for disposal at two licensed landfill sites for a fee and anyone disposing of this material is advised to contact them.” Signs will be in place at facilities which have accepted the materials in the past advising of the change. Information on alternative disposal will also be available at HWRCs, service points and libraries. data-src\"https:images-o.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.inverurieherald webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Some participants of this years Twilight Walk make use of a photo prop at the event\"  Twilight Walk marks th anniversary viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"While the facility to recycle these materials is being removed, the council continues to offer recycling for more than  dferent materials at HWRCs and is constantly seeking to expand this number, providing better services to Aberdeenshire residents, recycling more, protecting the environment and saving the council money on waste disposal.Clearly some people may consider disposing of their tyre or asbestos waste by illegally fly-tipping it, butyou see someone dumping waste illegally, or you come across fly-tipped materials, please contact Wasteline with as much detail as possible on  ."},{"url":null,"title":"north east producers join gin festival","story":"A supermarket giant will stock Aberdeenshire-based gin distilleries for the first time as part of its popular Scottish Gin Festival.From Thursday, May , both House of Elrick’s Artisan Gin and Old Tom Coconut Gin will be available at Lidl stores across Scotland alongside a ready-to-drink GT can from BrewDog’s sister company, Lonewolf.The local distillers’ gins will be among a line-up of ten spirits from around the country.Nestled in the lowlands of Aberdeenshire, House of Elrick Gin was built around the history of the house and its surrounding estate.

To enter the competition, members of the public should post a portrait photo celebrating walking in some way, on Twitter or Instagram, using the hashtag #HumansOfTheWalk. Multiple entries are allowed with the competition running until Friday, May , next week. Those who take part are in with the chance of winning a Nikon B Coolpix camera.Ian Findlay, chief officer at Paths for All, said: “Orkney has a number of great walking routes — whether it’s residential streets or local paths and green spaces — and we’re keen for the community to celebrate how they make these part of their daily routines.“We want the photos to be a true reflection of everyday walking — walking that builds friendships, gives you headspace and gets you feeling fitter and out enjoying nature.“Walking can help prevent ill health, build communities and create a happier, healthier, greener Scotland and we know that people can demonstrate just that with their Humans of the Walk photos. “We want to revolutionise the way people use their cities, and stop our spaces from being dominated by cars. Scotland’s towns and cities should be a backdrop for people walking, scooting, cycling or simply spending time enjoying cleaner, quieter, calmer streets.“Paths for All is looking forward to seeing them all and wish everyone who enters the competition the best of luck.”Paths For All#s aim is to signicantly increase the number of people who choose to walk in Scotland, whether it’s walking for leisure, to work, to school or to the shops. The charity works to create more opportunities and better environments for walking, as well as cycling and other activities to help make Scotland a more active and greener place.For more information on Humans of the Walk and the competition, visit: https:www.pathsforall.org.uk humanscopy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

As well as the closure of Kirkwall Airport, Inverness — a hub for flights from Ireland and England, before the final hop up to the islands — is also shut. With just a fortnight’s notice,  inbound arrivals originally scheduled for today, Thursday, have been rerouted, leading to early arrivals for most.Those already enjoying Orkney’s famed hospitality will soon be joined by fellow headliners including the groundbreaking Scottish three-piece, Lau a newly formed trio of celebrated Irish musicians John Doyle, Dermot Byrne and Éamonn Coyne and internationally renowned Hebridean vocalists, Julie Fowlis and Kathleen MacInnes, who visit Orkney as part ‘Between Islands’ # a collaborative project led by Stornoway’s An Lanntair, uniting musicians from Orkney, Shetland and the Outer Hebrides. Emerging artists are also prominent in this year’s festival programme, with appearances from BBC Radio Scotland’s Young Musician of the Year , Benedict Morris new Scottish six-piece Heisk and Helensburgh fiddler Ryan Young, whose accompanist, Jenn Butterworth, will work a double-sht across the next four nights, also playing with the high-spirited Glasgow group Kinnaris Quintet. In total,  acts will meet in Stromness — with the  visiting acts welcomed and outnumbered by Orkney’s thriving local folk scene, which itself features internationally renowned artists such as Saltfishforty, The Chair, The Wrigley Sisters and Gnoss, alongside local favourites including Hullion, the Kirkwall City Pipe Band # currently celebrating their centenary year # and many more. This amounts to an estimated  featured musicians # though many more will meet in Stromness, with the town’s pubs and hotels bursting with informal pub sessions from opening to closing time across the four days, alongside the ticketed programme. As well as Stromness, this year the festival reaches out to communities in Birsay, Burray, Finstown, Kirkwall, Orphir, Quoyloo, Sanday, Sandwick, St Margaret’s Hope, Stenness and Tankerness.In order to stage such a large event, the festival gratefully receives generous support from public bodies and corporate sponsors, from throughout the local and national business communities. This year’s principal supporters are Orkney Islands Council, Creative Scotland, NorthLink Ferries, Loganair — who also facilitated the rebooking of all those affected by the air traffic strike at zero cost, the Pier Arts Centre, and EIS, alongside many more inidual event sponsors and corporate patrons. The festival also benefits from many thousands of hours donated by hundreds of volunteers, who give their time freely to bring the world-renowned event together. From the twelve-strong year round management committee, to those who might work on just one event in their local community hall, each one of the festival’s community team is vital to its long standing, continued and increasing success.Festival director, Bob Gibbon said: “After many months of preparation we are delighted to be welcoming visitors and artists from far and wide, friends old and new, musicians from across the globe, to Orkney for what is set to be a memorable weekend of fun and good times. #Everyone has come together create a magnicent programme of events, and the festival just gets better and better. Orkney should rightly be very proud of what we can share, and this weekend is about sharing music, memories, time and happiness. Enjoy it everyone!”The festival’s chair, Elaine Grieve added: #I say this every year but I#m really excited about the programme for the weekend. There#s something for everyone fabulous visiting acts and a great number of local artists — and that#s something we really want to share with audiences. #It#s such a lovely time with many familiar faces ing and new joining the fold # a bit like a huge family reunion!#Alan Morrison, head of music at Creative Scotland said: “There are few places in Scotland with a more magical atmosphere than Orkney, where the stones of past civilisations sit alongside the buzz of the modern world. That’s also true of the Orkney Folk Festival, where the island’s heritage is woven into music being made by some of our best standard-bearers and rising stars. #It’s great to see so many brilliantly talented artists sharing a bill with musicians from far and near – andsome of them had to arrive a day early, well, that just means the sessions are already underway.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

But with the deadline for the UK’s exit from the European Union now officially extended until October , parties have sprung into action to try and make sure they are represented at an EU level.In the European Parliament, Orkney is represented within the Scotland region, which has six seats. Each of the eight parties running in the elections for this area have unveiled a list of six candidates, with the hopes of occupying as many of these seats as possible. At the polls, the electorate will be asked to select which party they wish to represent them in the EU. When the votes are counted, the six Scottish seats will be split proportionally between the parties, depending on the total of votes they received. Scottish voters can,they wish, cast their vote for one of two independent candidates who are not affiliated with a political party.Polling stations across the county will be open from am until pm, today. The correct station for your area will be listed on your polling card, which should have been delivered to your address within the last few weeks.

The final, which was held in Essex on Saturday, May , saw the finalists complete five tough physical challenges, as well as an interview with judges focusing on mental health.The competition was launched to promote mental and physical health in agriculture in a fun and engaging way.Mr Cursiter was announced as the men#s winner today, with -year-old Fiona Penfold, from the West Country, announced as the women#s winner.Asked about the importance of fitness to both mental and physical health, Sean said: #Farmers are constantly being required to produce cheap food while input costs rise. In Orkney there are a lot of farmers on their own, with  cows, living a lonely existence — they might not see another person for weeks.#He said that#s why he makes a conscious effort to socialise with others. Playing rugby for Orkney#s first team is a big part of this.#If folks close themselves in and just farm, then that#s not a good state of mind to be in. It#s hard to come away from the farm and be social, but it does have its benefits, and sometimes the lack of time is over-used as an excuse.##There are  hours in the day, so you need to give one to yourself.

When attracting talent in a fast-moving and constantly evolving sector like fintech, deep and detailed knowledge of market dynamics is absolutely essential.Edinburgh-based firm Carlyle, which has signicant experience of hiring senior iniduals for both the financial services and tech sectors, is the leading search and interim specialist in Scotland’s fintech space, and the firm understands the need for “intimate market knowledge”, as managing partner Carol-Ann Searles describes it. “We have been the go-to search partner for some time for a number of large financial services institutions in Scotland and further afield,” she says.“We also have great strength in technology, working with the likes of FreeAgent, ZoneFox [bought last year by cyber security giant Fortinet] and CodeClan. We worked closely with the board at CodeClan to secure Melinda Matthews-Clarkson as their new CEO, and we are currently in the process of recruiting a CEO to succeed Polly Purvis at tech trade body ScotlandIS.” Searles continues: “Because we have real strength in tech and financial services – from start-ups to big banks – we have a unique view across both environments.“Also, having built a firm reputation in Scotland over more than a decade, our London office is now providing a very effective talent bridge.“There is real interest from our clients in London-based talent  per cent of the people we are engaging with for senior roles in Scottish-headquartered businesses are in the London area, so it’s very important for our clients that we have a presence there.”Carlyle’s presence in the UK Capital could go some way to resolving one of the conundrums faced by fintech in Scotland – how to recruit the thousands of skilled people needed by the rapidly growing sector north of the Border.Carlyle’s founding partner Duggie Carlyle thinks that part of the answer could be “fintech figureheads” – high-profile and highly-skilled people who can attract talent pools around them.“The research done by industry bodies such as Scottish Financial Enterprise says we need thousands of new people in the next ten years,” he says. “It’s a real challenge, but what we have clearly observed is that by introducing one or two highly respected leaders into a geography, other talent inevitably follows. “Ten influential people could be the catalyst to attracting thousands more, which is why we feel our responsibility as a firm is much greater than simply recruiting for senior roles.”DataFiona James-Martin, a fellow Carlyle partner, agrees. “In the data age, we can more accurately track not only the number of senior placements, but their success,” she says. “We’re beginning to collect more data which shows that precision hiring, ensuring the right person in the right role at the right time, has signicant long-term effects on our clients’ businesses.” The erse skill sets required in fast-growth businesses are increasingly being provided by experienced figures who want to work in disruptive and fast-paced environments.Carlyle explains: “There are growing numbers of senior, highly skilled executives who want to work at an impactful level, but who don’t necessarily always want to undertake a permanent role. “Many have had successful executive careers but now choose to work in shorter-term engagements. Others have four or five consultancy assignments running at the same time. “These people are providing cross-fertilisation between financial services and technology, which is really valuable. One of the results of this is that large companies are increasingly supportive of their leadership teams having outside interests.”James-Martin adds: “We’ve seen numerous positive commercial outcomes when a large business brings in talent from a smaller and more nimble company, and vice versa.”The emergence of this group of skilled iniduals with a broader industry perspective– and a desire for complex challenges – is driving growth in Carlyle’s sector-leading interim practice.In a world where, in the words of Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, “The pace of change has never been so fast, yet it will never be this slow again”, the speed of hiring talent can be make-or-break for a business. However, Carlyle provides a solution via its senior interim practice, which enables the short-term placement of experienced executives. “We responded to client need by developing a senior interim offering that can bring people in very quickly on a non-permanent basis,” says James-Martin. “Fast-moving businesses simply cannot wait six to nine months to get someone into a key role and large businesses are realising the opportunity cost of not having the right person in post right now. “We can also help address this through our trademarked Parallel Search offering, which enables us to recruit an interim inidual quickly while searching for a permanent solution.”James-Martin goes on to add that this challenge can be easier to overcome for small fintech businesses: “They are more agile, with less laborious processes, and can make faster decisions and faster hires.”Cross-fertilisation between young, agile fintechs and larger, established financial services institutions is maturing and Carlyle is seeing this across its three key business areas – its core executive search practice, interim practice and board practice. Duggie Carlyle believes there is a real opportunity for smaller fintechs to attract heavyweight senior talent, in both executive and non-executive roles.He says: “What a lot of smaller firms don’t realise is that,they have a strong business, they can attract some hugely experienced names on to their board who have decades of expertise in relevant sectors. “[Smaller firms] first instinct is that such iniduals would not be interested, but often these people want to give something back and do something dferent.“We can act as a conduit for scaling companies to engage with senior people who can make a substantial impact on their business. That’s the real value inherent in our knowledge and expertise across both financial services and technology.”©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"brexit could change uk politics as we know it professor john curtice","story":"Could Brexit break the mould of British politics  That is central question facing politicians after the results of the European Parliament election were unveiled on Sunday night, writes Professor John Curtice.The two parties that are meant to dominate the country’s politics – the Conservatives and Labour – between them secured less than one in fourof all votes cast. This tally has never been anything like this low since the s when Labour displaced the Liberal Party as the principal opposition to the Conservatives.Of course, in Scotland, their dominance has long been eroded away. That was more than amply confirmed in the Euro-election by the fact that the Conservatives came fourth while Labour trailed in fth place. But in England and for the most part in Wales, their grip on Commons representation has seemed secure – until now.: Scottish Labour MPs slam leadership for EU vote failure: Jeremy Corbyn handed victory to Nigel FarageIn truth, voters do not behave in European elections in the same way they would in a general election. They tend to be more willing to cast a protest vote against the incumbent vote, to vote for smaller parties, and to support credible Eurosceptic parties. Last week’s ballot provided an environment in which a mass voter defection away from the two largest parties was most likely to occur.The Conservatives and Labour would not have fared so badly in a general election. Moreover, once a Euro-election is over, any surges of support during the campaign often seem to disappear as rapidly they arose.But this does not mean we can simply dismiss what happened last Thursday.For a start, this Euro-election might well not be forgotten as quickly as its predecessors. The issue that seems to have most influenced voters in deciding how to vote – Brexit – is not going to be forgotten very quickly. : EU election results: Blackford says SNPcements case for independence voteMeanwhile, more than one of the parties that would love to end the Conservative-Labour duopoly performed well. Not only did the Brexit Party come first, but the Liberal Democrats displaced Labour from second place, while the Greens overtook the Conservatives in the battle for fourth place.This is the first occasion when the duopoly south of the border has faced a two-pronged attack. The Liberal Democrat challenge fizzled out after the party entered into coalition with the Tories in , while only then did Ukip become a serious force.The initial signs, at least, are that this rather dferent challenge to the traditional party system might yet prove a more formidable one.John Curtice is a professor of politics at Strathclyde University and a senior fellow at ScotCen Social Research©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"eu election results find out who won all of the seats for scotland","story":"Sorry, were having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...With almost all the results in from Scotland, the SNP seems likely to win three of the six Scottish MEP seats, with Scottish Labour losing its two MEPs.window.twttr Results from the  councils across Scotland showed the SNP, who fought the election campaign on a strong pro-European , had polled . per cent.The partys previous best Euro election result was . per cent in .: EU Election results: Scots reject Brexit as Labour and Conservatives humiliatedMs Sturgeon tweeted: \"Formal declaration to come, but clear now that @theSNP has won the Euro election emphatically - we are on course to take  out of  seats.

They were among the first pioneers in planting English and Scots settlers in Ireland. But by , Smiths settlement failed and the lands reverted to the crown.On  May , King James I granted the Ballymena Estate to another native Irish nobleman, Ruairiacute Oacuteg MacQuillan. The estate passed through several owners, eventually passing into the possession of William Adair, a Scottish laird from Kinhilt in southwestern Scotland.The estate was temporarily renamed Kinhiltstown after Adairs lands in Scotland. The original castle of Ballymena was built in the early th century, situated to take advantage of an ancient ford at the River Braid.In  Charles I confirmed the grant of the Ballymena Estate to William Adair, giving him the right to hold a market at Ballymena on every Saturday. He hired local Irish as workers on the estate they served as tenant farmers for much of the next two centuries and more.And from those early days, Ballymena became a commercial hub for central Co. Antrim, steadily growing in prosperity through the years of the linen boom in the th century.Until recent years, the traditional market had been held at the area known as the Fair Hill on lands bordered by upper Broughshane Street, William Street and Thomas Street.When the area was sold for the development of what is now the Fair Hill Shopping Centre, the Saturday market was moved to its current venue near the Seven Towers Leisure Centre.And that is pretty much where the whole tradition kicked off nearly  years ago as the site is pretty much right in the front garden of what used to be the Adair familys residence in Ballymena!Mid and East Antrim Borough Council is urging you to come enjoy, explore and love your local market this May as part of UK wide campaign to support our local traders. ‘Love Your Local Market’ runs from - May.

The urban beach has been designed by award winning designer Ian Price, who has devised a space which will accommodate a number of community activities planned for the Ballymena beach this summer.It will be a flexible area that has plenty of space for laying out the beach towels, a dedicated sand sculpture section, and a jetty style promenade.The main feature of the urban beach will be a lighthouse, which is something that Ballymena residents will not be used to seeing in their People’s Park.The space will also be used to host an outdoor cinema and other public s throughout the summer.

Alec is one of  plus people who will be taking part in the exhilarating annual cycling and running event on June  to help raise funds for Cancer Focus Northern Ireland.Alec formerly played for Ballymena United and, back in the s and s, he also played gaelic football at inter-county and provincial level. As well as gaelic football and soccer, he also found time to play rugby for Armoy RFC. He continues to be involved with the local Con Magees, Glenravel Gaelic Club.GOLFERHis main outdoor pastime now is golf and he is a member of local Ballymena Golf Club.While not a regular cyclist, he has taken part in the FROG for many years.Alec is the chairperson of the Glenravel Community Development Association, which is responsible for the operation of the Glenravel Sports and Community Complex – which hosts the FROG event.The complex includes sports facilities, a health and fitness suite, a community play group and has become established as the social hub for the local community.

They do a tremendous amount of work supporting local cancer patients and their families, doing cancer prevention work in the community, funding research at Queen’s University and advocating for better health policies.“Cancer touches so many of us. My brother, Liam, was diagnosed with cancer back in  and had to have a kidney removed. “This was a very challenging time for him and the family. I can fully appreciate the impact that a cancer diagnosis can have on a family. “Thankfully, he has recovered well and has been participating in FROG for the past  years and fully intends to take part in FROG again this year,” he added. “FROG has grown tremendously since it began  years ago and now attracts over  cyclists. We are also building up the number of runners taking part, which is an exciting development.“A lot of preparation goes into organising FROG and the event runs like clockwork. “Organiser Paul McToal and his team deserve a tremendous amount of credit for the work they have put in over the past  years. The event has now become established as a firm date in the cycling calendar for many cyclists and cycling clubs. “While we are well supported by other cycling clubs from right across Northern Ireland, we’d love even more people to join in.“The glens is a fantastic route, so much scenery to enjoy, and there’s a real feel-good factor and tremendous buzz. “The weather has also been very kind to us over the years. What better way to get fresh air, exercise, meet people and help an extremely worthy cause ”COURSEEntrants can choose the FROG cycle, either a mile, mile or  mile route, or FROG legs, a km or  mile run – there’s something for everyone.Participants who raise a minimum amount for Cancer Focus NI will receive a special commemorative top.

Farm attacks in South Africa are reported almost on a daily basis to the rest of the world and must be condemned. There is no denying they happen, the tragic results are plain to see. But what can be done about it  How does this affect how other farmers get on with le and their daily work I’ve been fortunate enough to visit and report from South Africa on five separate occasions now over the past  years and come away each time with a sense of dismissal but also hope.South Africa is a beautul country, physically, and produces some of the best food and wine demanded by consumers around the world.Politically, it’s a dferent place. A place where the state is not in charge. A state that cannot even control its basic power supply, without some form of corruption.But where does that leave agriculture and the farmers  No matter what political persuasion anyone holds, everyone must eat. Over the years of visiting farms in South Africa I noticed farmers becoming despondent, feeling let down, feeling a sense of ‘what’s the point of it all ’I’ve talked to farmers who were attacked, who lost loved ones, and who gave up.However, during my latest visit in early March this year I witnessed a positivity among farmers that really I never experienced before.Yes, nothing politically has changed, except for the worst, but farmers are more defiant, more ambitious and are investing to make their farms more efficient in order to give them a future.During the big livestock equipment show EuroTier in Germany last November I talked to a few South African farmers interested to see how technology could make their farms more efficient. It was really comforting to visit a number of farmers on this trip who are putting new technology to play in order to improve their businesses. Visiting Greenway Farms Ltd with headquarters at Tarlton to see how business partners Vito Rugani and Vincent Sequeira handle over , tonnes of carrots per year grown on , hectares was really inspiring.The passion and ambition shown by these leading vegetable farmers has resulted in a range of Rugani juices that are now being exported across the world. They have invested heavily in new state of the art equipment to extract juice from vegetables. The science is baffling, the set-up is extremely professional and as for the juice, well…..I have to admit this was the first time I ever tried carrot juice and it was absolutely delicious. The knowledge I gained from Vito and his team will stay with me for a long time. I just hope he finds a way to export the range to the UK!Next visit was to Corne Nel’s Doornfontein Melkery in Randfontein where they milk  cows. Dairy unit manager Pieter Barnard gave me a very informative tour around the farm.Having been brought up on a dairy farm myself in Northern Ireland this visit was particularly interesting and I was also impressed to see more investment in equipment to make le easier. A new rotary parlour installed two years ago certainly speeds milking time up and perhaps investment into robotic milkers will help too with the dferent milking groups in the future. The sun can be a challenge where livestock are concerned and it was good to hear plans to build new housing in the corals to keep the cows cooler. With excellent production figures and a sound understanding of the cows, this farm is certainly gearing up for an exciting future.Before travelling across the border to visit farms in Botswana I went to see Sarel Haasbroek’s grain farm in the Carletonville area of Gauteng. Again this is another progressive farmer positive about the future and was excelling in importing the Horsch machinery brand into South Africa. Up in Francistown, eastern Botswana, I was warmly hosted by the Munger family at Wayside Brahman Stud Ltd for four nights. During my stay there I was given a comprehensive run down of the breeding herd, commercial herd, game farm, and the egg laying enterprise. What a farm! Rowland and his son Rowly are certainly well respected in the area and for the cattle they produce. Wayside was started by Rowland’s father Keith who was also present during my visit. And then it was off to see another beef farmer, this time with Bonsmara cattle, Calla Visser, for a very early start checking his cattle. Every night Calla has to go and round up over  cattle on his farm and herd them into outdoor corals for the night to protect them against theft and predators such as hyenas or leopards!And, every next morning Calla and his staff start very early going around the five dferent corals on his , hectare farm counting all the cows, calves and bulls hoping they all made it through the night alive.This, of course, is a new line of management for me but was nonetheless interesting to learn. A visit to Bobbsies Chickens Ltd based in the east at Tshesebe guided by general manager Gerhard van der Merwe was another super visit. Botswana, too, impressed me, as did the farmers there. I received detailed insight into the beef and poultry industries there and look forward to the next time I can visit.Some of the Botswanans though need to learn how to drive!

Over the years my da became sole owner of the butchers, it was always called A’town Meats,” he said.Gerald said his father was the eldest of five children and that Tom’s three brothers and late sister all emigrated to Canada, with his father opting to stay in Ireland to raise his young family.“At one stage he had opened up a butchers shop in Poleglass, inside a group of shops at the time and a shop in Ladybrook which my brother Vincent ran. Dad sold the business in September  and stayed on because it was coming up to Christmas, up to the Christmas club and what is a very busy time. After Christmas he stayed on, right up until around March, April time when he started to feel unwell. He was told it was cancer and started radiotherapy in October last year.”Gerald continued: “The Christmas period was very bad as he was very anxious waiting on results following the treatment. It wasn’t that he got the all clear, but he was told everything seemed ‘positive’. He knew by the end of January, early February something wasn’t right, the pain started coming back and he was told that ‘it’ was back.“A week or so later he was told that it was terminal.”“He was in hospital about a fortnight and we took him out to bring him home. He was only out three weeks and one day when he passed away.”Gerald spoke poignantly of how A’town Meats was known as a “meeting place, a place for people to come and talk”.“People would come in for a yarn, for many it was their way of getting out of the house and a chance for conversation.”Gerald said his father was a founding member of the Donegal Celtic Football Club and loved the GAA, especially local clubs Lamh Dhéarg and Rossa.“Last year was the best year of his le as he got closer to his kids. He was always working. His kids, his grandkids,you wanted to go see him you went to the shop. Eventhe children were being baptised, made their communions, their confirmations, you brought them to the shop. He was there six-days a week. I would have seen him on Christmas Day going into the shop and getting burgers, getting whatever was needed for restaurants who would’ve contacted him needing food. He went round, opened up and made sure they were catered for.”As well as a prominent businessman, Gerald said his father was a “bookmaker as well”.“He applied his trade at Celtic Park, Drumbo, Dundalk and Dunmore, it was a hobby as much as anything . He loved to see people winning.”He added: “One of the first times he ever done the book, a fella ended up owing him over £, and he said he would have it up to the shop that Tuesday. When the guy came up to the shop, my da was still meeting and greeting the customers, they came first, they were the be all and end all.“Dad gave the man a large meat parcel and said to him ‘take that down to the house with you’. The fella said it was the first time he had owed someone money, paid it and actually left ‘with a smile on his face’. The fella brought it down to his family and they were saying how nice the meat was and he replied: ‘Well of course it is, it cost me £,!’”Gerald said his father could pick up on when his customers were going through hardship.“He knew without them having to say anything. He would give them some food just to help them out, he never spoke of it, it was the people who would come in and tell you how he had helped.“A wee woman came into the shop one Christmas and she couldn’t afford the turkey so she said she was just going to take a ‘wee chicken this year’ and offered a ring as a means of payment. He wouldn’t hear of it but the wee woman insisted on giving over the ring. The wee woman passed away and her daughters came into the shop months later and he said he had something belonging to them and brought out the ring.“He was a very private man and religious in his own ways. He would’ve walked from his house in Donegall Park to Clonard, walked down for the Rosary and to St Paul’s as well. He always kept himself fit, he did Slimming World in his ’s and went out of his way to get the accreditation to sell the Slimming World endorsed food in the shop. He had people coming from all over to buy it.“He was always reading and went back to get his Degree in History. He loved the horses, he was always saying I would ‘scud’ his bets, that I was the worst ‘picker in the world’.“At the end of the day he was a very hard working, very generous, honest man. All his le he would’ve said ‘I’m doing this for you, I’m doing this for you’, in terms of working so hard at the business. He loved his family.”Gerald’s daughter and Tom’s granddaughter, Charleen Straney, described her “granda” as “a much loved man and very highly thought of by everyone who got to know him.”Tom Straney’s Requiem Mass will take place todayin St Agnes’ Church at noon."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"its second time out for the adventures","story":"ONE of the big hitters of the s pop scene, West Belfast’s very own The Adventures, will bring their back catalogue of melodic classics to County Down next weekend as part of the Harmony Live festival.Fans will be able to hear familiar singles Your Greatest Shade of Blue, Feel the Raindrops and of course ’s cracker Broken Land – the ‘most played song on Radio ’ during that particular year.In between rehearsals at Springfield Road’s Blackstaff Mill, lead singer Terry Sharpe told the Andersonstown News that the band aren’t going to be stepping away from the stage anytime soon.“We did a couple of shows at the Empire in January, all the lyrics, the cords, the tunes are hard wired into my brain. It’s like getting a record out again, all you have to do is just dust it down a bit.”Terry stressed that their Harmony Live performance, along with Irish duo Aslan and The  Of Us, definitely won’t be their last following speculation that circulated at the start of .“We didn’t say anything about final shows, I’ve actually discovered how this happened and it’s usually the venue or the agent who come out with the story. The next thing I was doing a radio interview with Johnny Hero and he was asking ‘is this going to be your last show ’ I said, ‘Johnny I don’t know, it was out of my hands’. Even when you deny it, it appears in the papers as well, but it’s not the case,” he said.Terry spoke of how nowadays outdoor festival gigs are planned to within an inch of their le – unlike back in the ’s.“Back in the day the first thing you did when you arrived at an open air thing, was the itinerary would be on the door, first thing you’d do is take it down as it had no resemblance to reality because everything then would run half an hour, to an hour late.”With the Spice Girls set to appear at Croke Park this weekend, Elton John taking two years to complete his ‘farewell’ tour and a Let’s Rock ’s festival set to set out its stall this summer in Boucher Road, Terry spoke of how nostalgia is a “new aspect” of the rock ‘n’ roll industry.“There is a big nostalgia industry, people who might have bought a record of ours when they were teenagers are now in their ’s. People want to go out and see what they spent their money on in their youths. Nostalgia is not part of the rock ‘n’ roll business, it’s a new aspect. Now rock ‘n’ roll is old enough to be nostalgic. It’s good for us, it’s good for everybody who was around at that time.”As the band fine tune their set list, Terry said that he along with songwriter Pat Gribben have been talking about making “another record”.“We’ll see,there is a demand there. We have talked about it.”A limited number of tickets for Harmony Live are still available. Tickets for the Friday May  line-up which includes Aslan, The Adventures and The  Of Us are priced at £..

The couple has moved there after the loss of the family home, Belle Reve, to creditors. Stanley’s suppressed rage at his lot in le finds an outlet when Blanche turns up.Through “nips of whiskey”, “sips of Bourbon” and card games, Blanche’s dreamy posturing and posingcollides head-on with Stanley’s rage and the anger boils over as the play reaches its brutal, violent climax.The production is spot on in its timing, debuting as the fall-out from the#MeToo campaign around the abuse of women continues to gather pace. Key contemporary issues of PTSD, mental health and gender equality are brought into sharp and devastating focus and we are forced to confront the question of how much –anything – has changed in  years.Emma Jordan’s sure-footed direction, Ciaran Bagnall’s atmospheric set and lighting design, Enda Kenny’s exquisite costume design and Carl Kennedy’s sound design interweave to bring us an utterly convincing sense of place and mood and combine with an absolutely outstanding cast to make this production the best I have ever seen at the Lyric.The audience were on their feet at the end to gave a well-deserved standing ovation to all involved in a play that will stay with you for a long time to come.A must-see.

However, the stadium could be used as a training base.The Casement Park report, which appeared in yesterdays Sunday Times, would appear to pour cold water over plans which emerged earlier this year for a new football stadium to be constructed here as part of the bid.The DfC told the Sunday Times that Casement Park was central to the proposed bid, expected to be made later this year.\"The English FA, FA of Wales, Irish FA, Scottish FA and FA of Ireland are all in discussions about the feasibility of bidding to be the European candidate to host the  FIFA World Cup,\" it said. \"The governments of the UK, Republic of Ireland, and the devolved administrations are all active participants in those discussions. Currently Casement Park is the only regional stadium in or near Belfast that there are plans for.\"The £m proposed redevelopment of Casement Park has suffered a series of delays in recent years, and faces a revised planning application which will be considered by the Department for Infrastructure in the ongoing absence of a Stormont minister.The decision to choose Casement Park may be viewed as controversial in some political and sporting circles.However, high-profile GAA members have already hailed the cross-community potential.Antrim GAA chairman Ciaran McCavana told the Sunday Times he supported the facility being used for the impending World Cup bid and other big-capacity matches.\"If we in the GAA can help another sporting organisation and also help the community economically with the money that the games would bring into Belfast and also reach out to sections of the community in the north that naturally wouldnt go to GAA grounds, wouldnt it all be positive \" he said.England hosted the  World Cup and bid unsuccessfully for the  tournament, which was staged in Russia.The next two tournaments are due to be held in the Gulf state of Qatar in , and a joint United States, Canada and Mexico tournament four years later.

fairness to the Alliance Party, they have a clear message and have done well,\" he said.Very quickly, a first preference vote of over , looked inevitable, and so it proved.Where there are winners, so there are losers, and the biggest on the day was the Ulster Unionist Party as veteran Danny Kennedy was swept away by the Alliance surge.He was the first of the big guns to fall, in just the second count, as his bid to replace long-standing party MEP Jim Nicholson fell flat.As he conceded it had been a disappointing day, the result appearing to herald the end of Mr Kennedys political career.\"Its fair to say my days as an elected representative seem to be numbered,\" he admitted.Dignied in defeat at the polls, party leader Robin Swann remained defiant that no obituaries should be written for his party yet. \"The Ulster Unionist Party isnt going away,\" he insisted. \"We know that narrative is already being put out there, but were here to stay for a lot more elections to come.\"SDLP leader Colum Eastwood hung in a bit longer, remaining low-key, although the writing was on the wall from near the outset.\"If unionist votes werent going to the UUP, they werent going to go to us,\" he admitted.In the end no one was going to get close to ruining Mrs Longs day and the expected three-way battle for the third seat became a one-horse race as two of the contenders barely got out of the starting gate.While DUP leader Arlene Fosters wish for two unionist seats to be delivered didnt materialise, she still made the point that not much has changed.\"The UUPs Jim Nicholson voted as a Remainer so in that respect we still have two Remainers and one Leave in Europe,\" she said.The problem for unionism, however, is that the Remainer in question now is the Alliance Party leader.Sinn Fein and the DUP will both claim victories, one topping the poll and one first to be deemed elected, but the real winner on the day was a triumphant Naomi Long."},{"url":null,"title":"northern ireland traffic alerts latest updates","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsEU

Mr Finucanes deputy for the next  months will be Alliance councillor Peter McReynolds. Another Sinn Fein council newcomer, Sean Bateson , is the youngest person heading up a Northern Ireland council for the next  months.He was selected to be mayor of Causeway Coast and Glens Borough Council with DUP councillor Sharon McKillop to serve as his deputy. Fellow first-time Sinn Fein councillor Siobhan Currie has been appointed the new chairperson of Fermanagh and Omagh District Council with Diana Armstrong of the UUP named the new vice-chair.In Derry City and Strabane District Council, Sinn Feins Michaela Boyle, who gave up her seat as an MLA to contest the May  council vote, has become mayor. The SDLPs Cara Hunter, another newly-elected councillor, was chosen as deputy mayor.History was also made in Armagh City, Banbridge and Craigavon Borough Council when SDLP councillor Mealla Campbell was elected lord mayor with the DUPs Margaret Tinsley selected as her deputy.Councillor Campbell is the first SDLP elected representative to hold the senior civic role with two women now at the helm.Meanwhile women remain in the top spots in Mid and East Antrim Borough Council where Ulster Unionist member Maureen Morrow has been named mayor and will be assisted in her role by her DUP deputy Beth Adger.In contrast with Derry City and Strabane, it is Sinn Fein and SDLP men who take the top two roles in Newry, Mourne and Down District Council.Sinn Fein veteran Charlie Casey was elected as chairperson and the SDLPs Terry Andrews as deputy chairperson.In Antrim and Newtownabbey Borough Council, John Smyth of the DUP will serve as mayor for the   year and Anne Marie Logue of Sinn Fein, will be deputy mayor.On Ards and North Down Borough Council, the DUPs Bill Keery is the new mayor while Alliances Karen Douglas is his deputy.SDLP councillor Martin Kearney has been elected as the new chair of Mid-Ulster District Council with his deputy named as the DUPs Clement Cuthbertson.Lisburn and Castlereagh was the last council to elect its new mayor and deputy on Friday with the roles going to the DUPs Alan Givan and Johnny McCarthy of the SDLP respectively."},{"url":null,"title":"united ireland acceptable to eileen paisley if there is freedom of religion","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsEU Elections Top  CompaniesNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The parties are currently engaged in talks attempting to restore devolved government with civil servants responsible for running the country.Asked about her message to the local politicians, Baroness Paisley said they needed to \"lay aside their baggage and face facts\".\"So many petty things, they dont see the big picture,\" she said.\"So many people are crying out for help and they are failing them by not taking responsibility.\"It is going to get worse and that leaves us open to all sorts of trouble.\"She added: \"I would say to them cut out the petty things and dwell on things that matter - think of the people.She said she was \"aggrieved\" the  MLAs were still taking a salary and it was not fair on civil servants to be doing the job of elected representatives.\"It is abominable for people to take money for nothing,\" she added, \"they are not doing the job they were elected to do.\"Baroness Paisley also said the parties needed to be more open with the public, adding: \"There is nothing in the open, what goes on is hidden.\"We are all sinners no matter who we are or what we are.She was asked about the DUP fielding its first openly gay candidate, Alison Benningtion and the subsequent resignations from the party after her successful election, including her late husbands brother in law and how some have said the late Ian Paisley would be \"turning in his grave\".\"We are all sinners no matter who we are or what we are.. that girl may not know Christ died for her,\" she said.\"I do not hate Ms Bennington, I dont know the girl. I dont hate anybody no matter who they are or what they have done against me.\"But we have to love Christ first and what He says we have to obey his word. These things are written for our benefit.\"Baroness Paisley said she hoped the party was not making a move away from the ethos her husband established the party under.\"It was a decision taken at the time and I think it was taken as a defiance to see what would happen.\"And I think it should be put to the whole party and a proper decision made on what should be done.\"Turning to Brexit and Arlene Fosters comments on leaving the countrya united Ireland came about, Eileen Paisley said it would take an \"awful lot\" for her to move saying so long as their was freedom of religion she would remain.\"I would not like a dictatorship or someone whatever their religion was to be persecuted because of that.\"It is a big question. If we go right back to the beginning, the iding of Ireland. The people or Ireland, north, south, east and west, I think are a great people.\"No matter what part of Ireland a person is from.. they are a fellow country man or woman.\"I just wonder why it had to be ided at that time and I think that was the wrong ision. It is too big an issue for me to ponticate on.\" I dont want my mind and soul to be poisoned with an unforgiving spirit.Baroness Paisley said she missed her late husband more, and more every day and she was told many times by others across the political ide and the communities his leadership was missed.She recalled how her husband wanted to be a farmer when he was a young boy and it was when sowing corn he heard the call from God that it was not he seed He wanted Ian to sow.She said in his first sermon in Sixmilecross in Co Tyrone he spoke for only  minutes before running out of material and immediately vowed to never speak again.\"And the man that was taking him told him youll speak all right, and so his words were fulfilled,\" she said.In his final years the Free Presbyterian Church ostracised its founder. Baroness Bannside said it was \"very callous\" but pointed to Jesus and how despite all he had done for his people, was crucied.Baroness Bannside said she no longer worships at the Free Presbyterian Church as it would \"leave her open\" instead going to her granddaughters husbands baptist church.\"I just put it away, I dont bother... I live my own live with my own family and I am content to do that,\" she added.\"It was dficult to forgive them but I have to get on.

Most Northern Ireland voters voted Remain in , have backed Remain parties since, elected two Remain candidates at this election and support the backstopthey cannot stay in the EU. So good luck to the next Conservative leader explaining to Brussels why it is in Northern Irelands best interests that a Withdrawal Agreement signed off across all member states be renegotiated. Barnier will bin Boris, not the backstop. Then the Conservative government may have the stark choice between a plea for another delay to departure - which party leadership candidates are ruling out - or leave the EU with no deal. And the DUP will inhibit any backsliding from a new Conservative leader who, like the outgoing one, concedes that there really is no alternative to the backstop.Please log in or register with belfasttelegraph for free access to this article.Sign InNew to Belfasttelegraph  window.gigyaIntegration  window.gigyaIntegration  gigyaIntegrationmand  gigyaIntegrationmand  gigyaIntegrationmand.push gigyaIntegrationLoginScreenSet gigyaIntegrationRegisterScreenSetAlliance surge Phase  wont sht the DUP. Its vote share rose again, with Diane Dodds cantering home. Meanwhile, the UUP is now bereft of representation everywhere except on local councils. Given that most Northern Ireland voters want to remain in the EU, the logic of the UUP in switching sides to supporting leave was questionable. This was another very weak election performance. The unionist leave-the-EU market was already a crowded marketplace in which it made little sense to jostle with the DUP and TUV bruisers. Having cautioned in  against Brexit on the grounds of economic damage, the UUP now advocated its implementation on the basis of popular UK sovereignty - which is not the easiest canvass. A personable candidate like Danny Kennedy was always up against it taking on the committed Brexit true believers. Does this result hasten a possible referendum beyond Brexit - a border poll  In this European contest, % of voters backed unionist parties, % backed nationalist organisations and % backed others. Thats nowhere near dramatic enough for the Secretary of State to fire the starting pistol, but it does indicate that a border poll,ever called, is not quite a foregone conclusion for the unionist cause. To be safe, unionists would have to attract the backing of at least one-third of those supporting Alliance or the Greens - and many of those supporters are utterly alienated by Brexit and its backers. Otherwise, unionists might need Seamus Mallon to do the counting. Alliances success also brings into question the political structures which have so prioritised unionism and nationalism within the Assembly. Parallel consent rules framed around those two minority identities - when the largest category of people, albeit not among those bothering to vote, say they are neither, may need revisiting. Northern Irelands party system is changing, with single big parties dominating the right, left and, finally, the centre. Brexit continues to transform politics - and we are far from done yet.

Never could it have imagined three weeks later that it would secure a staggering % vote, the highest ever since its formation almost half a century ago.The person who has made it all possible is Naomi Long.Before her leadership, the party was seen as worthy but dull - dominated by do-gooders who, no matter how well-meaning, would bore you to death. Long has impressively rebranded Alliance and brought passion and fire to the middle ground.The party is now facing a problem caused by its own success - it is losing its greatest asset to Brussels. Mrs Long will have to resign as an MLA with another member co-opted into her seat.While Alliance has very competent performers in its Stormont ranks, none possess its leaders star quality.Please log in or register with belfasttelegraph for free access to this article.Sign InNew to Belfasttelegraph  window.gigyaIntegration  window.gigyaIntegration  gigyaIntegrationmand  gigyaIntegrationmand  gigyaIntegrationmand.push gigyaIntegrationLoginScreenSet gigyaIntegrationRegisterScreenSetAlthough it goes entirely against its ideological grain, a speedy Brexit which sees Mrs Long home by the end of the year and back in the front-line in a restored Assembly would be no bad thing for the party.Once Brussels was a place for the men in grey suits but for the first time ever Northern Ireland ed three female MEPs.The election was an absolute disaster for the Ulster Unionists, with Danny Kennedy losing their seat. The party was in trouble when Mike Nesbitt resigned as leader in . It had two MPs, an MEP, and  councillors then.Now, it has no representation in Westminster or Brussels and  councillors - reduced to just two membersin the Belfast City Hall it ran in its heyday.It lagged in sixth yesterday, behind the TUV. Its EU campaign unfortunately summed up the party - lacklustre and with no clear message.It is almost impossible to see the UUP becoming competitive again. It has oftencomplained that elections here are just sectarian headcounts which favour the two big beasts. Yet this months council and EU polls were far less that than any others in recent decades, and the UUP still lost signicant ground.Robin Swann cant be blamed for the problems his party is facing because he inherited them. The UUP shied away from taking bold decisions about its political direction in , preferring just to stick with the old familiar, failing approach.But it seems apparent that Mr Swann has no clear road map for the way ahead. Indeed, one likely doesnt exist. Traditional unionists will continue to stick with the DUP, liberal ones wont be leaving Alliance now. Despite two poor elections, he is unlikely to be challenged for the leadership because nobody in their right mind would want it.It was a good election for the DUP. Diane Dodds reduced Sinn Feins lead from , to , votes and was elected two counts ahead of Martina Anderson. Mrs Dodds has never had the spectacular victories that her predecessors, Rev Ian Paisley and Jim Allister, enjoyed. Yet she still increased the vote and her party will be well pleased with the result.The sharpest minds in the DUP realise that the biggest threat to it in future isnt from a disorganised, dwindling UUP, but from a youthful, energetic, hard-working and well organised Alliance Party.They realise that unionists, especially young ones, do increasingly vote Alliance and that constantly bashing the party as crypto Provos just wont wash.Expect those in the DUP who favour a more secular and liberal approach to make their voices heard internally over the next few months.Coming in comfortably ahead of the UUP was a very good result for Mr Allister who may have initially regretted running for Europe after the TUVs council results. He clearly still has a real future in politics here, although his party is destined to remain largely a one-man band.It wasnt a bad election for Colum Eastwood who managed to finally halt the SDLPs terminal decline and actually increased its vote, albeit by .%.Yet disappointment was written all over its leaders faces yesterday. They genuinely expected to be in the running for the last seat and will be concerned at Alliance overtaking them to emerge as the third largest party in the poll. By common agreement across the political spectrum, Mr Eastwood ran the best campaign of all the candidates. Yet the message from the result has to be that, unlike Mrs Long, his personal appeal is not greater than his partys.Martina Anderson may have topped the poll but dont be fooled into thinking it was a good day here for Sinn Fein whose vote was down %. The party is losing votes to Alliance and the Greensin middle-class areas while under pressure from People Before Profit and independent republicans in working-class areas. It will now be keener to restore devolution.In the Republic, Sinn Feins council vote decreased by a third to just under % and its likely to lose an MEP. The shine is rapidly coming off Mary Lou McDonalds leadership and expect Gerry Adams to start popping up more in an effort to reassure the base. Further reversals in a Dail election would put the Sinn Fein president on very dodgy territory indeed."},{"url":null,"title":"tom kelly naomi long is proving popular as voters long for change","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsEU Elections Top  CompaniesNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

And it works.In particular, for those tens of thousands of pro-European unionist voters who were all but abandoned by the mainstream unionist parties, who saw a new political home provided by Naomi and Alliance.Naomis performance means she could be in co-pole position with Claire Hanna of the SDLP to take a Westminster seat from the DUP - but with the caveat that she cant hog all her partys opportunities. But May  is like having a second birthday and only a curmudgeon wouldnt wish her well.So Northern Ireland now has three female MEPs, but with the exception that two of the three MEPs are now solidly pro-European.Under the current demographics, the expectation of two nationalist pro-European parties going to Brussels was too big an ask.

The DUP, TUV and Ukip have lost tens of thousands of votes since the last EU elections. Diane Dodds remains the DUP standard-bearer, solid and dependable, though the voting highs of both Ian Paisley and Jim Allister are now well beyond her reach. Dodds can be content with being the first to hit the quota on transfers.However, the big losers are the Ulster Unionists - neither fish nor fowl under the leadership of the hapless, but nice Robin Swann, the party have finally plummeted to new lows.Swann has not cut any clear path for his party. His instincts to do the right thing are often undermined by his near-hypnotic behaviour to ape the DUP.The party need a new leader - a Nesbitt-type leader who understands pluralism and appeals to younger voters. Robin Swann is the political equivalent of Coronation Streets Norris Cole.Danny Kennedy was placed in an impossible position, as a border unionist who supported Remain, but had to defend the ridiculous pro-Brexit position of his party grandees.The SDLP campaign team will be disappointed by the strong performance of Naomi Long, but should not be too despondent.Colum Eastwoodran a positive and energetic campaign - the best the SDLP have had in years. The SDLP percentage of the vote increased from the local government elections and the wider voter haemorrhaging seems to have been cauterised.There was also clear evidence that Sinn Fein opted for a deliberate tactical policy of encouraging transfers to Alliance over the SDLP as a way of limiting any surge in the nationalist vote - a first for Sinn Fein since .The SDLP leader has proven his party isnt going away and, unlike Robin Swann, his voter base is not deserting him.Martina Anderson, the Sinn Fein MEP, has given a solid performance for her party against a calamitous election in the Republic of Ireland. That said, the Sinn Fein EU vote is down by .% in Northern Ireland from the last EU election, which in voting terms is just under a whopping , voters who have either stayed at home, or opted for an alternative.No party can seriously have a strategy which purposefully reduces their share of the vote. Anderson is, though, comfortably ahead of Dodds in topping the poll.The DUP versus Sinn Fein tussle is a long way off the gladiatorial contests between the DUPs Ian Paisley and the SDLPs John Hume, who in their last outing against each other got a staggering , and , first preference votes respectively.That Sinn Fein dropped over three percentage points in Northern Ireland is signicant, because they appeared to have nationalist voters in a semi-permanent electoral lockdown since .Sinn Fein are at their electoral best when agitating and Brexit in some ways preserved their base in Northern Ireland in a way that it couldnt in the Republic.Mary Lou, the Sinn Fein president, is making no great shakes of her leadership the presidential election results, along with the local government and EU results, show that Sinn Fein under her are on the slide. In , they secured an impressive % of the vote in the Republic today its just over %.Sinn Feins vice-president, Michelle ONeill , has been sheltered from the voting collapse because of the dominance of identity politics over issues and policies within the north.The uncompromising attitude of the DUP towards all things Irish also shores up Sinn Fein in Northern Ireland. That said, the Sinn Fein leadership have some serious thinking to do - something acknowledged by senior TDs. The invincibility of Sinn Fein has been pierced and it is not going to be contained at the border for much longer. Sinn Fein cant cope with a buoyant Irish economy and record levels of employment.Its hard to believe they couldnt politically capitalise on the housing crisis in Dublin. They are being challenged in Dublin working-class areas by a resurgent Fianna Fail and now the Greens.Independents and People Before Profit are to the left of them. Even in West Belfast and Derry, People Before Profit are proving better street agitators than Sinn Fein.In Northern Ireland, a Sinn Fein supporter informed this writer that former senior republicans had told him that they would prefer to support Alliance over the SDLP, because of the SDLPs decision to abstain on the Spad Bill taken to the Assembly by TUV leader Jim Allister in .If true, this would be ironic, as it was Alliance voting with the other unionist parties that delivered the Bill and it was the Greens who voted with Sinn Fein against it. It would seem some in Sinn Feins old guard cant rise above grudge revenge politics even within the wider nationalist family.With the revolutionary days over and the smell of sulphur a distant memory, Sinn Fein need to find a new purpose and champion issues beyond the politics of protest. It remains to be seenthat can be delivered by the current duo. But, north and south, change is definitely a-coming and parties should be prepared to be blown along with the change, or be swept away.Tom Kelly is a writer and commentator"},{"url":null,"title":"floating dragonshaped island proposed for swansea","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsEU Elections Top  CompaniesNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Many also work shorter hours during the day.All that translates to % more time spent on Facebook’s s, or what is nearly  million more hours, Mr Shehadi said. Put another way, there are almost two million hours of additional time spent daily on Facebook in the Middle East during Ramadan.Ramadan is also the peak season for advertising in the region, as TV dramas and soap operas get a % increase in viewership on YouTube during the holy month, according to Google.“Our revenue is aof people’s engagement,” Mr Shehadi said. “The more that they engage on our s, the more that advertisers want to be able to reach those that are engaging. That’s what drives our revenue.”So much ad revenue is spent during Ramadan that Google launched The Lantern Award to celebrate the most creative and engaging ads of the month.Yet Ramadan is not just about abstaining from food and drink, including water, during the day. It is also about disconnecting from vacuous distractions and focusing on contemplation, introspection, acts of good, charity and connecting with God.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  A woman looks at a Ramadan-related page on her mobile phone in Dubai It can appear then as a contradiction that this is also when companies ramp up their efforts to get people to buy more, view more and engage in excess consumerism.Google does not disclose total watch time for YouTube during Ramadan, but says that in Egypt, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, for example, viewing of sports videos jumps by %, travel videos by %, and action games, simulation and video games by -% during the holy month.People also spend % more time watching religious content on YouTube in Ramadan.“To us, YouTube brings people together.

This translates into a % spike in beauty product searches and an % spike in searches for beauty tips on YouTube, compared with the rest of the year. Also, according to Google maps, trips to shopping centres increase by more than % in the last weeks of Ramadan in preparation for the Eid al-Fitr holiday, which ends the holy month.Fatima el-Barbar, an Egyptian mother living in Dubai, said she searches more for recipes and watches her favourite TV dramas online during Ramadan. But she said that between her job, taking care of the children, preparing tar each night, her daily prayers and reading the Koran, the Muslim holy book, there is little time for the internet.“I actually have less time for the internet in Ramadan than in other days of the year,” she said.To help companies better understand consumer habits in Ramadan, Google identied six categories of audiences: dedicated watchers, devoted fasters, foodies, groomers, travellers and shoppers.“YouTube is a companion during Ramadan, a  where viewers can watch what they want, whenever they want throughout the day,” Google says in its own pitch to advertisers.To more authentically connect with roughly  million users in the Middle East, Facebook and Instagram launch special Ramadan icons to give people more customised ways of expressing themselves online. \" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  A woman uses her mobile phone at the Facebook office in Dubai, United Arab Emirates Instagram also has a campaign to promote acts of kindness during the month.“We’re trying to be magniers and propagators of goodness as opposed to what might seem on the surface like an extension of consumerism,” Mr Shehadi said. “It resonates with the ethos of Ramadan and certainly the ethos of Facebook, which is around bringing people together around things that matter to them.”Haitham el-Ghoneim, a Jordanian resident in Dubai, the United Arab Emirates, said he uses Facebook to connect with friends during Ramadan, sharing traditional greetings for the holy month and checking on his family in Jordan.But he does not think the rest of it – all that time spent online, on games, scrolling and ads – is a good thing. “It’s not being spent in a useful way.

The Montgomery County sherf’s office initially said the Northridge High School gym would serve as an emergency shelter in Dayton but later said it was not useable.An Indiana town was also heavily damaged by storms, including reports of two tornadoes."},{"url":null,"title":"derry tourism service industry blasted poverty wages","story":"Businesses within the tourism and service industries in Derry have been strongly criticised for paying staff “poverty wages” despite a recent upsurge in visitors.The comments were made by the Derry Trades Union Councilwhich met with delegates from the Aegis union and representatives from the Low Pay Commissionin the city.The DTUC has called on the local tourism and services sector to justy its low pay policy which is forcing families to foodbanks and leaving greater numbers in poverty.Last year leading accountancy firm, ASM Chartered Accountants, published a bellwether report on the tourism industry in NI which described Derry as the “star of the show”.It said the city had turned a corner through growing occupancy rates which brought about improved profitability of .% in  compared to .% in .With that increase in demand came a very substantial improvement in room rates which increased by .% year on year to an overall average of £..A record number of cruise ships are also set to dock in the city this year, according to Visit Derry.Commenting after the meeting on the need to hold large employers to account, Aegis Divisional Secretary, Gareth Moore, said: \"We welcome the visit from the LPC and the opportunity to highlight the damage that poverty wages has on workers, their families and their communities.“In the current economic situation where record levels of employment coincide with record levels of foodbank use and workers in poverty, there is a necessity for wages to be increased to a real living wage.“We cannot accept the current situation where full-time workers are struggling to survive from month to month, falling further into debt and relying on foodbanks to get by.“Aegis, along with our comrade in the DTUC, will be very active this year in challenging large employers who refuse to pay a real living wage to their staff while those at the top live lavish lestyles.”ExploitationThe Low Pay Commission is an independent body that advises the government about the National Living Wage and the National Minimum Wage.Niall McCarroll of Unison and Chairperson of Derry Trades Union Councilhas thrown down the gauntlet to local businesses to end exploitation and urged them to pay workers a living wage.He said: “DTUC officers along with our colleagues from UNISON Community Branch, Foyle Health Branch, Derry Education and Aegis collectively provided a voice for local workers when we met the Low Pay Commission in Derry.“DTUC used the opportunity to impress upon the LPC the precarious and unstable nature of employment across the City and District and how the scourge of low pay leaves workers and their families struggling to have any decent standards of living.“These demoralising standards of living are no more prevalent than within the localtourism and service industry where basic minimum wage and zero hour contacts are used by commerce groups and employers to maximise profits at the expense of local people.”Mr McCarroll continued: “How can this be justied when local hotels are regularly at full capacity and restaurants and cafes also busy and yet poverty pay is the dish of the day.“The LPC assured DTUC that they would report back to government, presenting their findings which included the call from DTUC for a minimum living wage of £ an hour for all workers, no matter what their age.“DTUC are committed to building on our campaign to stand in solidarity with local workers, whilst exposing bad employers and we will be engaging with all newly elected DCSDC councillors to end the exploitation of local workers.”DamagingThe Northern Ireland Hotels Federationis the representative body for the hotel sector.NIHF Chief Executive, Janice Gault, described accusations of low pay as \"very damaging\" to an industry which has \"done much to improve its image\".She said: \"Our members are subject to the same legal and employment framework as other sectors. Hotels currently have a wage content of around % of turnover.\"The sector has a iety of roles from entry level at the appropriate national minimum wage level of the candidate through to supervisory, management and executive roles.\"The Federation has not seen the evidence that the LPC received last week and therefore is not in a position to answer the specics. Nor have the NIHF been made aware of working conditions contra to current national minimum wage levels by any trade union official or employee in the Derry-Londonderry area.\"Ms Gault added: \"Allegations of this nature are very damaging and without having specic examples are impossible to abate.\"As an industry we have done much to improve our image: improving working hours, providing strong and well rewarded career paths and supporting qualications that give employees the opportunity to have greater skills to work globally.\"googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refreshPhoto: Niall McCarroll, chairman of the Derry Trades Union Council, and members of Aegis in meeting with the Low Pay Commission."},{"url":null,"title":"foyle hospice weekly draw results winner","story":"Winners in this weeks Foyle Hospice Weekly Draw are - st prize: £,, Paul Breslinnd prize: £,, Rollover : rd prize: £, Terry Monaghanth prize: £, Diarmuid Campbellth prize: £, William Linton .googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refresh"},{"url":null,"title":"draft wales rally gb 2019 route","story":"Lights, cameras, action ndash the Wales Rally GB ceremonial start will be stagltspan classtruncategtltspan classtruncate-previewgted in Liverpool for ltspan classtruncate-full-screengtthe first timelt spangtlt spangtlt spangt\" Major innovations add to Wales Rally GB as  draft route is releasedHuge crowds are expected at this year#s Wales Rally GB\" Major innovations add to Wales Rally GB as  draft route is releasedA new street stage in Colwyn Bay is on the  schedule\" Major innovations add to Wales Rally GB as  draft route is releasedLocal hero Elfyn Evans makes a splash on Wales Rally GB.

Some say while those carrying out the work are obliging, they are not responsible the delay or the lack of communication.Businesses are also hoping that customers they have not seen for some time willwhen Irish Street s to a sense of normality.They say the loss of parking spaces has impacted on trade with the work forcing people not to use one of the townrsquos main car parks nearby.During last weekrsquos protest, one trader revealed that her business has been forced to go mobile, visiting the homes of elderly people who cannot safely access her premises in the town centre due to the public realm scheme.Restaurant owner Mizba Uddin says things have been ldquoterrible for his business since work on the project began.ldquoThe business has literally collapsed, he declared, standing outside his restaurant surrounded by barriers used by contractors.ldquoThe situation is very, very bad and we have even have people driving down the one-way system the wrong way. Parking spaces have been lost as a result of the work and not all will be ed when the scheme is completed. People are going where as we do not provide a delivery service.Mizba said one of his main concerns has been the lack of communication from those overseeing the project. He also urged those in charge of the scheme to talk to traders to let them know what is going on.He added: ldquoI was told that the scheme would end in March and have heard nothing since. I am relying on other people to tell me what is going on but it should not be like this. I cannot even clean my windows because there is so much dust everywhere.ldquoSummer time can be quiet for me. Everyone in Irish Street wants this project completed as quickly as possible. As the work continues, there are simply no customers going to any of the shops. The work is killing businesses..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Ballygalget woman’s two week walk meeting inspirational people  ","story":"A BALLYGALGET woman is one of two volunteers who are spending a fortnight walking in towns and villages around Northern Ireland meeting inspirational people who are improving their communities.Patricia Fleming, a former camogie player with Ballygalget John Mitchelrsquos GAC, called into her old club last Sunday accompanied by Rory Mullan from Derry.They were hand-picked from a raft of candidates to be Big Lunch walkers for this year.Starting last Friday, they are visiting dferent places in Northern Ireland ahead of the Big Lunch weekend on June -.The Big Lunch event is where over six million people through the UK will meet to share food and eat together.Patricia and Rory visited Ballygalget to hear about all the great work the club does in the surrounding area.Patricia, who now lives in Belfast with her family, told the club how its community work was inspiring.ldquoThe reason I picked Ballygalget is that Irsquom from here, Irsquove played on that pitch many times, but I also know the community spirit that exists within Ballygalget. It blows me away when I come home and hear all the things that are happening.ldquoWhen I went for my interview after applying to be one of the Big Lunch walkers, I said thatI was chosen I would like to bring the Big Lunch community walk into rural areas and to Ballygalget.ldquoPeople here are very community oriented. That is not the case everywhere. A lot of people donrsquot feel able to knock on their neighboursrsquo doors.The club hosted a Big Breakfast fundraiser on Sunday towards sending the clubrsquos U- boys and girls to next monthrsquos Feile in Cork.However, the club is also trying to gather support for a huge number of projects, including cross-community work and is also going to host its own event over the Big Lunch weekend.A new cross-community gym opened in the club grounds a year ago, which has proven immensely popular with all sorts of people in the local area, including many who had no links with the GAC.The new building also has space for social workshops and some of the wider community schemes the club wants to pursue.Last year, Ballygalget won an Alzheimerrsquos Society Diversity Award for its work in the community.Club member Roisin Coulter said: ldquoWe are working to become a dementia-friendly community. The idea is to educate people about dementia: what are the signs and symptoms, and how to support someone living with the condition.ldquoEvery month we run a free two-hour workshop, with materials supplied by the Alzheimerrsquos Society.ldquoOur club is very much affected by dementia. Quite a number of people in the club are living with a diagnosis within their families. We want to reduce stigma and the social isolation people can feel.Aoe Savage, Ballygalget GACrsquos Health Club Officer, added: ldquoWe are working against social isolation within our area.ldquoWe are trying to improve health and wellbeing ndash both physical and mental health ndash of people who live nearby, on a cross-community basis.Ballygalget was the walkersrsquo third stop on their tour around Northern Ireland. They have already visited Belfast and Balmoral Show.Over the next two weeks will visit other places including Lisnaskea, Portadown, Ballymoney and Derry.There is still plenty of time to sign up at www.edenprojectcommunities thebiglunchhomepage..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Businessman calls for work to be completed quickly  ","story":"IRISH Street businessman Darren Trainor said the public realm scheme needs to be completed quickly for the benefit of everyone in the town.He saidthose in charge of the scheme told traders that they planned to deploy more men to finish it earlier they would put up with the disruption for a just a little longer.And asking for businesses to be provided with up-to-date information, Mr Trainor appealed to those in charge ldquocome and talk to us.He continued: ldquoWe received a letter informing us that the work would be completed on March . We are all so frustrated that this scheme has taken so long and we have lost regular customers which over a month or two would be fair enough, but over six or seven, you are not going to get them back.ldquoWe have been in business for over  years andit was not for that we probably would have closed by now. The first plan I viewed showed two parking spaces outside my door but they have been taken away.Businessman Francie Young, who is also upset about the y delay, also questioned the design of the scheme, pointing to a wide footpath at the top of Irish Street, close to the John Street junction.ldquoThe road will be considerably narrower at this point and can anyone tell me the reason for this  he asked, while Maurice Massey was critical of the lack of communication with Irish Street business owners, particularly in relation to the delay in completing the work.He said the business community should have been much better informed, with greater account taken of the impact the delayed scheme was having on trade.Alan Oakes said ldquocustomers have gone with businesses unsurethey will . He also appealed for better lines of communication between traders and those in charge of the scheme.It has also been confirmed that the work in Irish Street is impacting on patients attending a dental surgery, with those most affected the elderly and those with mobility problems.Traders say they are simply asking for communication and to be told what is happening, with the major concern that a project scheduled to last a few months had now entered its fth month, with work on only one side of the street largely completed..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Charity concert  in Seaforde  ","story":"A CONCERT takes place in Seaforde tomorrow night in aid of a Parkinsonrsquos charity.The locally-based Harmonic Progression womenrsquos community choir will be presenting their spring concert, entitled Makers of Music and Dreamers of Dreams, in Seaforde YFC Hall at .pm.Rehearsals are well underway for the concert which is inspired by the first line of Arthur OrsquoShaughnessyrsquos Ode.One of the choir members, Heather Knipe, and her husband, John, are climbing Mount Fuji in Japan for the Cure Parkinsonrsquos Trust and all donations at the door and from a raffle will be presented to this charity during the concert.Harmonic Progression.

The video was well received and no doubt there will be more versions in the future.Bruce Grobbelaar then rose, to a rapturous reception to deliver one of the slickest and wittiest after dinner speeches the club has heard.Stories from his early days as a  year old lsquokeeper with Highlanders FC, a Zimbabwean football club based in Bulawayo, to an eventual move to Vancouver Whitecaps and subsequent transfer to Crewe Alexandria until the legendary Bob Paisley signed him for Liverpool in .Grobbelaar played  times for the Reds in a trophy-laden career. Among the stories he told were e the events of May , , when his antics in a penalty shoot out against Roma helped Liverpool to win the European Cup.He also talked about his career after Liverpool and working with Alan Ball at Southampton at the height of the match fixing allegations that were made against him.When Ball was asked by the media why he was playing Grobbelaar in goal ahead of England international Dave Beasant, Ball reputedly said: ldquoI would rather have Bruce in goal trying to throw the game than Dave doing his best to save it.By common consensus, Bruce was one of the best speakers the club has had and has whetted the appetite for the future to renew the clubrsquos tradition of bringing over guest speakers.Bruce was presented with a small gt from the club by youth team coach Simon Thornton, a set of golf balls and towel from the Royal County Down Golf Club.Club secretary Andy Hall then spoke for a few minutes to highlight some of the highs and lows of the last  years and to thank IFA regional development officer Seamus Heath for all the work he does in promoting football across the Newry Mourne and Down Council area.Andy then invited IFA vice-chairman Jack Grundie to say a few words with Jack presenting the club with a gt to mark the occasion.County Antrim FA president Jim Jess also spoke warmly about the club and presented a memento to mark the occasion with Maurice Johnston, vice chair of the Mid Ulster Football League, congratulating the club on their th anniversary and presenting Tollymore chairman John McIlvenny with a gt to recognise the achievement.Newcastle League secretary Alan Craig was unfortunately taken ill before the dinner and was unable to attend and the club sends its warm wishes to him for a speedy recovery.The final official speaker was Elaine Junk, the former chair of the NI Womenrsquos Football Association during the period when Tollymore had a successful ladiesrsquo side.Elaine congratulated the club on its th anniversary and encouraged them to get a ladiesrsquo team back up and playing.With the official proceedings drawing to a close there was one last surprise with Adrian Howard presenting a le time achievement award on behalf of players and members to Andy Hall in recognition of all his work for the club.It was a wonderful gesture by the club and much appreciated by Andy.The evening concluded with dancing to the wonderful Fth Avenue with Bruce continuing to sign autographs and pose for pictures into the wee small hours..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Locals flying high in F15 championship  ","story":"ROGER Chamberlain and Charlie Horder won the Northern Ireland Flying Fteen Championship on Strangford Lough at the weekend.It was a deserved triumph for the Whiterock duo and also for Strangford Sailing Club, which hosted the event less than a month after the re-opening of its clubhouse which was gutted by an accidental fire in September .The five-race championship attracted a -strong fleet, which included a sizeable contingent of southern visitors, mainly from Dun Laoghaire.After three races on Saturday Chamberlain and Horder were in third place, behind Killyleagh pair Andrew McCleery and Colin Dougan mdash who got off to a flyer by winning the opening race mdash and overnight leaders Brian McKee and John Gibson, also from Whiterock, who were second and seventh in the first two races before winning the final race of the day.Chamberlain and Horder came out of the blocks early on Sunday and comfortably won the fourth race before sealing the championship with fth place in the final race.McKee and Gibson were a disappointing th in the fourth race, but with the discard brought into play, they still had a chance of outright victory.

beyond his power’ in Loughinisland report  ","story":"NORTHERN Irelandrsquos Police Ombudsman went beyond his legal powers in publishing a report ldquoreplete with determinations that RUC officers colluded with loyalists in the Loughinisland massacre, the Court of Appeal heard last week.Lawyers for two retired senior policemen claimed the watchdogrsquos damning findings on the Loughinisland atrocity should only have been releasedit had recommended prosecutions or disciplinary action against any of those under scrutiny.Judgment was reserved in the renewed bid by Raymond White and Ronald Hawthorne to have the report quashed.UVF gunmen opened fire at the Heights Bar in Loughinisland, Co Down as their victims watched a World Cup football match in June .The men killed were: Adrian Rogan , Malcolm Jenkinson , Barney Green , Daniel McCreanor , Patrick OrsquoHareand Eamon Byrne .Five others were also wounded in a sectarian attack for which no-one has been brought to justice.In June  the Ombudsman, Dr Michael Maguire, said collusion between some officers and the loyalists was a signicant feature in the murders.He found no evidence police had prior knowledge, but identied ldquocatastrophic failings in the investigation.Mr White, representing the Northern Ireland Retired Police Officersrsquo Association, and Mr Hawthorne, a former sub-isional police commander, have been involved in a long-running legal challenge to the published findings.A first hearing resulted in a ruling in  that the report was procedurally unfair and had failed to make clear it conclusions did not apply to Mr Hawthorne.At that time the watchdog agreed to remove any references to him to ensure he is not connected to any alleged wrongdoing mdash a move seen as complete vindication for the former police commander.A limited re-hearing before a dferent judge focused only on issues around the extent of the powers to publish the findings.In November last year a High Court judge rejected the retired officersrsquo case that Dr Maguire had exceeded his legal remit.Mr White and Mr Hawthorne are now now appealing that ruling.The former policemenrsquos barrister, David McMillen QC, stressed their complete support for the Ombudsmanrsquos role in scrutinising and holding officers to account.He argued, however, that the watchdog lacked the legislative authority to publish such ldquoconclusive findings in the Loughinisland report.ldquoHe simply does not have that power, Mr McMillen said.ldquoThis is an organ of the state, an important and very public organ of the state finding police officers guilty.Askedhe believed the Ombudsmanrsquos report had concluded police officers may have committed criminal offences, Mr McQuillen replied: ldquoIt was replete with those suggestions.But Mr McMillen rejected suggestions that the document could be amended to state there ldquomay be evidence of criminal or disciplinary offences.ldquoThe report is so infected with conclusive language all the way through, about what he found, that a simple rider would not make sense, he said.Barra McGrory QC, for the Ombudsman, countered that the legislation allowed him to express an opinion on the alleged collusion.He said: ldquoThe definition the Ombudsman has set out on collusion is broad enough to encompass behaviour and actions by police officers which cannot be identied as specic criminal offences which could be referredunder that part of the scheme.Following submissions Lord Chief Justice Sir Declan Morgan, sitting with Lord Justices Stephens and Deeny,

compared to % of those in council areas that did not.Re-Gen Waste Ltd managing director, Joseph Doherty, said the survey results indicated that prioritising simplicity and convenience was the best approach to ensuring a high level of household recycling.He continued: ldquoSince April , glass can now be commingled with household recycling waste in the Down legacy council area, meaning that all householders across Newry, Mourne and Down can now put their glass into their blue bins.ldquoWe should see an marked improvement in recycling figures and a decrease in the percentage of glass placed in black bins across the entire council area.Mr Doherty said local authorities need to encourage the maximum number of people to recycle the maximum volume of materials, weighed against the cost of processing the material, and the potential financial benefits from reducing landfill costs, and selling on recyclable material.ldquoThe councils we with work in Northern Ireland, England and Scotland tell us that household friendly schemes such as commingling recyclables, plastic, paper, card, tins and cardboard and glass in one bin, are much preferable to residents than any pre-sort scheme using

the man tasked with the job of overhauling the countryrsquos ldquoided schools.At an Ulster University event in Belfast last week focusing on sectarianism, the Dundrum man said the segregated education issue needed to be addressed.He also criticised what he described as the ldquocasual sectarianism and ldquotribalism which characterises parts of society.He continued: ldquoI think we really have to address education, segregated education and I think that as a society we kind of have to start calling out that casual sectarianism.ldquoWhenever we had peace here we thoughtwe move on to a Glaswegian level of sectarianism that is fine, so we only hate each other every week when we go to football. That is not good enough. The tribalism of that is not good enough.The comedian also suggested that the integrated education term was ldquoinsulting.He explained: ldquoAround the rest of the world that is called education. What we have in this country is segregated education.The Dundrum man also paid tribute to the ldquobrilliant work of teachers but said people felt those high standards were enough and did not tackle the underlying ision.ldquoThe natural  of mixing and realising that we are exactly the same and having a school that has got a rugby team and a GAA team, you donrsquot have to go to that schoolyou like GAA. There are just certain things that we really need to have a look at and I am not sure that we are necessarily ready for it.Speaking at the Belfast event, Mr Kielty argued that changing the education system would have to be done by an international figure like former US senator George Mitchell.ldquoOnce we actually get through it we will go, lsquogee why didnrsquot we do that before now rsquo, but it is a dficult one, he conceded, suggesting that social media is contributing to the lack of exposure to dferent views.ldquoYour own opinion is folded back into yourself on the screen every day, he said. ldquoMore than ever, we actually have to put the screen down and make an effort to realise that we are the same.ldquoWe talk too much about dference here. You are either a British person living on the island of Ireland or you are an Irish person who is currently actually in the UK. You are actually a bit of both.Mr Kielty added: ldquoThe minute that we accept that that is going to move in a fluid way, and it is perfectly fine to be a bit of both, that is kind of where we need to be.Meanwhile, the charity which has been working for almost three decades to bridge the gap between starting integrated schools and securing full government support has welcomed Ulster University proposals for a concerted effort in Northern Ireland to eradicate sectarianism.The university, supported by the Sir George Quigley Fund, launched lsquoSectarianism in Northern Ireland: a Reviewrsquo at a conference at the UUrsquos Belfast campus last week.The Integrated Education Fundmdash which was established in  mdash praised the conference for addressing the issue and welcomed Patrick Kieltyrsquos comments that educating all children together is the way forward for a shared future.The review contains more than  proposals for how bodies including government, business, education, youth services, arts and sport could work collectively over a sustained period of time to foster greater collaboration and understanding across communities.As well suggesting that a government department should be established specically to tackle sectarianism, the researchers propose establishing a new civic body to help shape community efforts toward reconciliation.IEF chief executive Tina Merron said the organisation ldquoshares the vision, held by the overwhelming majority of citizens, of a united community and a shared future.Ms Merron said that at the signing of the Good Friday Agreement there were , pupils in  integrated schools, compared with more than , attending  integrated schools today.She said that with no government plan for integrated education, the growth was down to ldquodetermined campaigners and pioneering parents.She added: ldquoWe see a reformed education system as an essential ingredient of this future an education system which brings children, staff and governors from Catholic and Protestant traditions, as well as those of other faiths or none and of other cultures, together in schools, an education system which recognises and respects ersity and ensures that all young people feel confident and welcome in their school environment..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Sinn Fein’s Casey chosen as district’s first citizen  ","story":"SINN Feinrsquos Charlie Casey is Newry, Mourne and Down Councilrsquos new chairman.The Newry politicianrsquos appointment was confirmed at the local authorityrsquos annual meeting on Monday night when he succeeded the SDLPrsquos Mark Murnin as the districtrsquos first citizen.The new council vice-chairman is Rowallane SDLP councillor Terry Andrews, who succeeded Sinn Feinrsquos Oksana McMahon, who represented the Crotlieve area but lost her seat in the recent local government election.The new chairman was presented with his chain of office by his predecessor, who also losthis Slieve Croob seat at the recent election.The new first citizen said he was delighted to be nominated for the position by his party and hoped to do the position justice, urging all councillors to unite to protect services under the threat in the council area, particularly those in relation to the health and welfare of all, in particular, the most vulnerable.Cllr Casey also took time to thank Mr Murnin and Mrs McMahon for their work over the past year and the other councillors who were not ing to the council following the election.Addressing members as chairman for the first time, Cllr Casey urged them to fight for lesaving and le-changing services, champion the cause of equality and take forward the councilrsquos commitment of putting the organisation at the heart of everything it does.ldquoNewry, Mourne and Down Councilrsquos mission is to lead and serve the district as a prosperous and healthy area and ensure it is sustainable from an economic, environmental and social perspective.

His heart is working at only % capacity and last week his consultant confirmed to his parents that he was on the organ donation list.There are around  children currently waiting on a heart in the UK.The Grants do not know how long Ollie will have to wait until a suitable one becomes available for him.Like many other parents, the couple were not aware that children could be registered for organ donation.They spoke to BBC Northern Ireland to urge more parents to register their children, although it was not a situation they would wish on any other parent.ldquoItrsquos a hard thing to think about. If you think about it from another aspect mdash of you being the person that had the child that needed the heart mdash you would be wanting people to consider it, said Damien.His we, Riona, said: ldquoWe didnrsquot think that this would happen to us and nobody thinks itrsquos going to happen to them. If a child is to get sick, or an adult mdash it doesnrsquot matter who mdasha heart or a liver or kidney, or whatever the case may be, is their only option, then what would they do Damien said Ollie was currently holding his own, but that doctors were still concerned.ldquoWith Ollie it is very dficult to tellhe is doing well or not, he is still smiling and laughing away, but doctors are concerned that his saturations have been up and down this week and he has been vomiting, Damien told the Recorder.ldquoThis is likely due to the heart failure because so far all other tests have been negative for any viruses.ldquoHowever, itrsquos great to know our message is being heard, raising awareness of the lack of organs available and getting families to bring up the conversation in the house.ldquoReading through some of the online comments to the recent media coverage, it gives us great comfort knowing that so many people have signed up because of Olliersquos story and it will hopefully go on to save so many lives.One woman posted on Facebook after seeing the Grantsrsquo appeal: ldquoSo proud of my  year-old daughter and  year-old son who saw this story, had a long meaningful conversation with their dad this evening and just both signed up on the NI organ donation register.

This is an opportunity for a party that is not run by career, party political politicians.”However, she has no ambitions to stand again.“If I had won a European seat I think my acceptance speech would have been very short: ‘What the heck just happened  I am really keen toto Fermanagh now. The summers in London are just too hot.”Sam McBride: Long’s victory is of historic proportions, and will prompt introspection for rivalsUUP leader Robin Swann says party will learn lessons from disastrous European election Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"try catch  TrendingN.I. motorist crashes car with R plates through clothes shop windowN.I. set to sizzle in long summer of intense heat -

He shook my hand, and showed me some of the facilities.I was shown how the ldquoMagic Carpet works, an interactive board on the floor. It lit up with a flower pattern, that moved and shimmered when stood on.I was then invited to the soft play room, where Elias flung himself over the equipment, scampering above me and the assistant. He grinned for the camera.Ysgol Y Deri particularly shines in the creative approaches it takes to putting its students first.In the big school I was shown to ldquoThe Holodeck, a Star-Trek-esque room filled with projectors and touchscreen sensitive walls.There was a French quiz projected across the walls, and the students jumped around the room selecting the correct words.The sensory experience was not only impressively creative, but vital to some studentsrsquo learning.The school has many similar rooms built to offer a multi-disciplinary team approach to the youngsters and offer a fully holistic experience.They have a large team of therapists on site, including nurses, occupational therapists, speech and language therapists, physiotherapists, music therapists and play therapists.They also offer a huge range of interventions, designed to put their pupilsrsquo happiness and education at the forefront.They offer yoga, mindfulness lessons, climbing, gardening, wood work, pet therapy, rebound therapy and hydrotherapy, as just a small example. Timetables are crafted to suit inidualsrsquo needs, as some pupils respond better than others to certain lessons.I was shown to a classroom where a group of seven students worked on their laptops.These students were proud of their work and excited to talk about maths.We were then ushered through as a group for a photo with next doorrsquos class, a group with physical disabilities.The students waited patiently as overhead cranes helped those who could not walk into position.Everyone smiled. Thumbs and peace signs were flashed.Afterwards, a Learning Support Assistant tapped me on the shoulder and reminded me to take a photo of Caitlyn.I pointed the camera at her, and Caitlinrsquos smile immediately reached her ears.Maxine, a fellow student, told me how proud her family were of her and her work.The happiness of every one of the pupils is palpable, filling every area of the school, as does the pride of the teachers.ldquoWe have our pupils come back in every now and then, said Stacey Long, the schoolrsquos transition officer.She helps pupils move on from the school and into adult le.ldquoThey always tell me how much the school meant to them, how helpful it was in getting a job.ldquoWe try hard to get pupils ready for adult le where we can.ldquoWe have a coffee shop on campus where several students get plenty of work experience.The curriculum covers both the national curriculum as well as general le skills.One interactive quiz I was shown could be rapidly switched from a lesson on the Great Fire of London, to a quiz on which materials go in which recycle bin.There are plenty of extra-curricular activities on offer too, including choir and youth club and regular trips outside of school.I was given a glimpse into a gym, along with a music recording room with plenty of recording equipment, and the school radio room.Outside, pupils are given a huge playground with an outdoor classroom, space to play sport, a climbing wall and little walled off sections for each of the primary classes.Developer Barratt Homes was also on the site, building a sensory garden for students to enjoy.Last week a group of pupils of ying abilities went on a trip to Paris, where they were involved with ious Comenius [European Union education] projects and forged links with numerous schools in other European countries. Several pupils couldnrsquot wait to tell me about it, showing off photos.Chris Britten, the head teacher of Ysgol Y Deri, said: ldquoWe work with every child. They are all dferent and we treat every one as an inidual. We meet their needs so they can flourish, both in school and after they leave. He is immensely proud of his staff and pupils.Itrsquos easy to see why. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Members of local chapels and churches processed from the Twyn through Dinas Powys passed Tesco at Nica, ending at Bethesda Chapel.Fish and chips sustained around  walkers by the end of the evening.Rev Jon Davis of the Baptist Church and the Revs Carole and Phil Challis of the Methodists led the service with the first hymn, Light of the World.

They havenrsquot had any unpleasant encounters.ldquoBut itrsquos inevitable as a person of colour, whether they see something on the news or it happens in a social environment.ldquoBefore it gets to that point they should consciously or subconsciously have enough references to their own self worth in media, be it movies, books, or cartoons to handle it.Mr Banda was spurred into writing by a comment made by Tancho after school. ldquoI donrsquot knowit was a book or a lesson, but Tancho made a very generalised comment ndash he said they have no water in African homes so they have to walk really far.ldquoI told him: lsquoYou know Africa is not a country right  They all have their own experiences the same way Europe is made up of a lot of dferent countries.ldquoIt worried me. Especially being Cameroonian, living in a culture that isnrsquot mine, and with my kids growing up between two heritages.ldquoI didnrsquot want them looking down on one half of their heritage. I wanted to pay them a fuller narrative.No major publishers have picked up the books yet. ldquoI was disheartened early on in the process. One publisher advertised themselves as being very inclusive.ldquoI reached out to them but was disappointed by their feedback ndash all they said was a childrenrsquos book is  pages long. It felt like you can only be a BME authoryou conform to these standards. Really,yoursquore trying to promote ersity in publishing you should look outside the box!The books use the personal experiences of the boys as inspiration. ldquoTwo years ago we travelled around Europe. We found a caravan and went exploring, and the books have been inspired by our adventures ndash the first being Charlie the Fearless and Tancho the Brave.ldquoTheyrsquore all about courage, and being brave enough to admit when something scares you. They focus on looking out for one other, and how love makes you brave.ldquoA Place to Call Home deals with the anxiety of moving, and the unknown, as we travelled and settled in Penarth.ldquoTheyrsquore about making the best of situations ndash there are little anecdotes in every story, like the time we broke down in north France. It was the boysrsquo optimism that helped us through situations like that and I wanted to reflect that.The books are carried in Grfin Books on Windsor Street, Penarth on Amazon. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Unfortunately the swing bridge has been out of commission since June .I have met with residents and local Labour councillors, who have been working closely with residents to discuss their concerns and plans to make the bridge once more available to the public.The bridge is owned by the Vale of Glamorgan Council and leased to Penarth Quays MarinaLTD. It was built to ensure that both residents and boat owners had equal access to land and water.I understand that there are no mechanical reasons why the bridge should not be used.The Vale Council and PQM have agreed that safety upgrades need to be carried out for the bridge to reopen. In October  PQM submitted a planning application for modications to the swing bridge. I have been told that PQM were contacted by the Vale council to mody the current application to include lower intensity flashing lights and lsquosilent alarmsrsquo. Unfortunately PQM felt that the changes would not meet the safety standards they felt necessary and choose to withdraw the application. I understand that the Vale Council is currently awaiting the outcome of a noise report which will feature in future discussions between the Vale and PQM over the future of the swing bridge.The swing bridge has been an integral part of marina le for many years and is enjoyed by both residents and the thousands of tourists to the area. Connecting the two sides of the marina the bridge acts as a short cut for residents, particularly useful for those with walking dficulties. Having spoken to local businesses about the potential for the reopening the consensus seems to be generally positive. Reopening of the swing bridge, customers could use the car park on Llwyn Passat and use the bridge to access Portway businesses.I hope that the Vale council and PQM are able to work together to find a solution. I think we can all agree that the way forward is to ensure safe operation of the bridge while minimising disruption to adjacent properties.Before the Easter recess I met with residents to listen to their concerns over plans to remove Victorian lampposts from across Penarth. The cast iron lampposts, which have been an integral part of Penarthrsquos street scene for a century are being replaced by the Vale council with modern LED lighting. I am disappointed that several lampposts along Cwrt-Y-Vil road have been removed without notying residents.Residents have set up a petition, of which over a thousand people so far have signed asking for the old posts to be left in place with new ones installed beside them.

The only way forward out of this mess is to let the people have the final say on any deal. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

And under my leadership, a Conservative administration will proudly put the people of the Vale of Glamorgan first.ldquoNaturally, we are open to working with other councillors who share those ideals.ldquoOthers - including those who resigned from the Conservative party - will have to explain to voters where they stand on these issues - and I would urge them to back us, rather than propping up a Labour administration that was rejected by the Vale at the last election.Cllr Bailey said he had a six-point plan for the Vale.He pledged to deliver the Dinas Powys bypass stop inflation-busting council tax rises scrap proposed parking charges review the local development planto curb inappropriate development protect rural schools and oppose the Barry Biomass plant.Cllr Bailey said that he was also keen to improve engagement with the public, after a series of hugely unpopular decisions taken by the existing cabinet.He said: ldquoDuring the elections in , we promised to build a stronger relationship with local residents by consulting them on key decisions.ldquoUnfortunately, too many people feel that their views are simply being ignored and that Vale consultations are just tick box exercises. Take the proposals around car parking charges, or the closure of Llancarfan School. I donrsquot think anyone outside of the Civic Offices believes that those decisions werenrsquot already done deals, and thatrsquos simply unacceptable.ldquoAnother good example is the councilrsquos failure to listen to the public over Penarthrsquos original Victorian lamp posts.ldquoIrsquove been criticised for wanting to listen to the people who elected me, and I make no apologies for that. Under my leadership, thatrsquos exactly what would happen and whilst I do accept that there are dficult decisions to be taken, we have to take the public with us - not ignore their legitimate concerns. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Although a relative newcomer to the site, having previously taught in Newport, it is clear he is immensely proud of the students and staff.ldquoVisitors to the school often comment on the warm, friendly and purposeful environment that exists at Stanwell and, despite its size, they see how the school cares about the inidual child and their progress, he said.ldquoThe schoolrsquos Mission Statement is summarised as lsquoLearning to Excelrsquo and this is the vision for every child, whatever their starting points, interests or talents. The school thrives because we have a fantastic team of teachers, teaching assistants, support staff, parents and governors who help make this vision a reality.ldquoThis is what makes the school so successful because everybody gives so much.Wandering through a theatre the school uses to put on assemblies and biannual productions, Mrs Kynaston pointed out a section of floor that moved away to create an orchestral pit. The production value afforded to every department ndash theatre, maths, sports, English ndash was astounding.ldquoWe try to give our pupils the very best, said Mrs Kynaston. ldquoWe want them to truly reach their potential. To excel.Mr Brown agreed. ldquoOur amazing staff believe in every young personrsquos potential to succeed and really do go the lsquoextra milersquo for pupils, he said. ldquoOur pupils flourish academically but also as well rounded, confident young people ready to contribute to society.The extra-curricular provision at the school is broad and this really helps to develop our students confidence and skills beyond the classroom setting.That extra-curricular provision is a key focus for the school.Lessons finish at .pm, earlier in the day than most other schools, but that affords pupils plenty of time to take on other pursuits.The school offers a huge number of activities, ranging from the expected - rugby, football, hockey, theatre and orchestra - to the esoteric, like German Film Club or Cipher Club.School trips in recent years have taken students to such exotic destinations as Costa Rica, Iceland, Borneo, Morocco, Spain, Germany, France, and Italy, allowing students to soak in culture both at home and abroad.Clearly, a huge pupil base allows for a huge number of options.The schoolrsquos ability to bring such a population to the table, and keep them focussed, has produced excellent results.In the last fty years alone, it has produced Olympians, rugby internationals, Members of Parliament and television presenters.It has ties to Nasa, and men who walked on the moon have visited the school for talks.Its most curious claim to fame comes in the form of a mascot painted on a wall.Emma Davies, a former pupil of the school, had a design chosen as the official Welsh Wenlock ndash the Olympic mascot for the London  games.But Stanwell flourishes academically, as well.In its  GCSE results,  per cent of Stanwell pupils achieved at least their expected grades, compared to  per cent of the rest of Wales. The same story went for maths, with  per cent again hitting their expected target or better, against  per cent of Wales.       ,params: .pushAt A level,  per cent of all grades were A* or A, with  per cent of the year group achieving A* to C overall.A level results put Stanwell students amongst the top performers in Wales, with many iniduals securing exceptional grades.  of themachieved the equivalent of three A grades or better.Three of its pupils went to Oxford University last year, while another earned a place at Cambridge University.Mr Brown said: ldquoWe place a large emphasis on listening to our learners and and our pupils make a dference as leaders in the school, whether itrsquos through well established groups such as our school council, eco-committee or charity committee, or in aspects of teaching and learning where we have subject prefects and learner voice groups.ldquoThey help us evaluate our work as a school and plan for the future.ldquoWhat always comes through is how proud they are of their school.Rightly so. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log        ,params: .push-- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work.

We have a business that has very much enjoyed its own expansion and we want to shine a light on our next generation of young professionals”.According to Susan Dunlop, that’s a well refined mantra at GMcG Chartered Accountants. Susan is one of seven directors at GMcG, having joined the firm more than  years ago and who now heads up the firm’s Audit and Business Advisory Services department. Part of planning for the future has been the recent appointment of a new director in Audit and Business Advisory Services, together with an associate director who will head up the firm’s Corporate Finance department. Both are signicant investments at management level and a reflection of the firm’s growth and ambition across its three offices.“As a leading independent accountancy firm, many of our key strengths lie in our ability to get things done, through local decision making, management and accessibility of our people” Susan says.Accessibility is regularly acknowledged as being of great value to the firm’s clients and has become a key component of how the firm does business.“Business owners know they can lt the phone and speak to any of our directors, at any time of the day. For us, that’s just part of our client service, but our clients expect it and they know it can make a huge dference to getting an issue resolved quickly and effectively, allowing them to get on with running their business.”As local businesses face uncertainty and challenges across many fronts, Susan and the management team recognise the importance of being positioned as the complete business advisor and having the expertise, understanding and experience to deliver. “Businesses evolve through dferent circumstances and with dferent requirements. We need to be one step ahead, providing the right expertise at the right time. GMcG can offer this expertise through our service lines which include Audit and Business Advisory, Tax, Forensic Accounting and Investigation, Corporate Finance, GMcG Digital and International liaison, through our TIAG membership.” The firm delivers these services though a team of more than  employees across three offices in Belfast, Lisburn and Portadown. Having initially operated as independent firms in each locationthe GMcG evolution was completed in  when the three firms merged completely under a single GMcG brand. This was a signicant investment and transition for the firm.Gill Johnston, director at GMcG Portadown, says: “It was vital that we didn’t lose focus on the profile and client relationships we had developed over many years in each location. “So we are delighted with the success of the transition and how the shared systems and expertise are adding real value to client service delivery across each location”. GMcG services a broad client base from sole traders to large corporates, including a erse range of businesses and private iniduals, public and not-for-profit sector entities, as well as legal and other professional services practices.For Susan and the rest of the team, the firm’s independence and longstanding client relationships are what bolster the firm’s success.“We have a loyal and growing client base and are particularly proud of the fact that many of these relationships go back decades or transcend generations. We advise many of these clients on succession planning, helping them develop their business through the next stage of its journey. “In our experience, all of this is underlined by the importance of investing in client relationships, getting to know the client’s business, their issues, opportunities and the type of expertise they need.“It can be a long term effort and something that often demands dedication beyond a nine to five working day. But we always view it as a rewarding investment, especially when we see our clients thrive and grow.”As part of the firm’s growth and expansion, GMcG has undergone major investment in its overall strategy, its people, IT systems and recruitment.With no shortage of drive and ambition, it’s very much a case of ‘been there, done that’ for GMcG, having themselves undergone restructuring, appointed new directors, undertaken signicant investment, experienced dynamic growth and transitioned seamless succession planning.“We have done it ourselves, and been through it all,” Susan says. “We have grown our firm and understand many of the challenges and opportunities facing SME clients with real aspirations or plans for business development we have that insight and experience that has really proved valuable in advising many of these clients.”Building on these foundations, the firm today has a strong focus on developing the next generation of its service team. A younger generation of professional advisors are moving up the ranks in the firm, with other new faces joining the expanding management team.Nigel Moore, who started with the firm back in  as a trainee, has been appointed director in the Audit and Business Advisory Services department. Director Stephen Houston also started his career as a trainee and heads up GMcG’s Lisburn office. Robbie Milliken, who has more than  years’ experience across corporate finance and business banking, has also joined the firm to head up its Corporate Finance department.Susan is keen to acknowledge that GMcG is a firm that is proud of its working environment, and that career progression is part and parcel of its ethos.“We give employees every opportunity to progress through the ranks and be rewarded for their success, and we can point to two of our directors who commenced as trainees. We feel this is testament to the experience and environment we offer, and to our commitment to ensuring employees reach their full potential”. “Importantly, achieving the right work-le balance is something we facilitate and promote as much as possible across all grades. We are very aware of the importance of mental health and wellbeing and are delighted to have partnered with a mental health charity for the last two years, with mental health programmes delivered across GMcG’s offices.”GMcG also has the global reach to serve clients wherever the growth of their business takes them, through its membership of The International Accounting Group .Lyn Canning Hagan, who heads up GMcG Tax Services and is one of the firm’s TIAG liaison directors, says:“TIAG, together with its sister alliance TAGLaw, provides GMcG and our clients direct access to accounting, tax and legal expertise across more than  countries worldwide. “This is hugely beneficial to businesses with international markets or operations and many of our clients have already benefited from this global expertise across numerous jurisdictions.”Looking to the Ulster Business Next , which features in this edition of the magazine, Susan Dunlop says many of those small and medium-sized Northern Ireland businesses making the list are exactly the type of clients GMcG is working with.“We’re proud of our track record of helping SME clients across all sectors achieve success through growth, restructuring or expansion, drawing on our own experiences to make a real dference in shaping their future plans.”So, it goes without saying that the future is more than bright for GMcG – a firm with decades of experience, but one which is always looking forward.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/sto1.jpg","title":"ni business rates to undergo full review","story":"Posted on Thursday May  by John Mulgrew There will be a full review of Northern Ireland’s business rates system, a top civil servant has revealed. Sue Gray, Permanent Secretary of the Department of Finance, announced the full review into the taxation system for companies here, during a Local Government conference, with Retail NI and law firm DWF, at Titanic Belfast. The reform and re-examination of business rates has been one of the core concerns among the retail and hospitality sectors for the last few years. It’s one of several key business issues which had been kicked down the road due to the ongoing impasse at Stormont. The news has been welcomed by Retail NI and Hospitality Ulster. In a joint statement, the groups said: “Both our organisations are delighted that the Department of Finance have announced this review into non-domestic rates. We have consistently lobbied for this over a number of years and are pleased that our joint call has been heard” “While this is not an end in itself, it is a means to an end. This review provides us with a roadmap for radical change to an antiquated and not fit for purpose system of business rates which is a major burden for our members “In this review we will be outlining signicant changes to rates, including our proposals for a targeted approach to small business rates relief, a revamp of the rates hardship fund, green rates rebate for business who invest in carbon neutral technology and greater relief for new start businesses. “At the last UK Budget, the Chancellor gave independent retailers and hospitality businesses a third off their rate bills in England. We want nothing less than this for our members in Northern Ireland.\" Ms Gray says that \"in recent years signicant changes have taken place in our high streets and town centres. It is critical from a business perspective, as well as a government funding perspective, that our rating system is capable of responding to this wider process of change. That’s why today I am announcing a full and comprehensive review of business rates. “We must create a rating system which generates the funding our public services need while supporting businesses in all sector and enabling economic growth right across Northern Ireland. “In an environment where we are working without ministers, there are limitations to what we can do by way of policy change. But we need to be ready with updated advice for incoming ministers for theirto office. This fundamental review is therefore a critical part of this process.” And Aodhán Connolly, director of the Northern Ireland Retail Consortium, said: “We wholeheartedly welcome the announcement of this review and it is a credit  the Permanent Secretary’s drive to make positive change. “The fact that retail is % of the economy and pays a quarter of all business rates is simply not sustainable especially give the seismic structural changes going on in the industry. “We have some of the highest business rates in Europe and they are a disincentive to investing in Northern Ireland. We are already playing catch up to the rest of the UK on business rates reform where our businesses pay p in the pound more than the UK average. “This review must look at all aspects of the system. There must be equity in any new system that allows for a widening of the tax base and an audit of the plethora of exemptions some of which have been in place since the s. “If we don’t get business rates right, we risk further shop closures which will  not only cost jobs  but leave a gaping hole in NI finances.” View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/js_1.jpg","title":"could a new dawn boost ni business development","story":"Posted on Friday  May  by Ulster Business While Brexit is still upon us, John Simpson says the business sectors finances have proved stronger than predicted and lending could be boosted on the outside as the veil of uncertainty lts The darkest hour comes just before the dawn: an apt reference to the prospects when Brexit is finally taken out of the daily diet of news, concern about business disruption, and foreboding about dficult trading prospects. Brexit is proving to be a slow departure. This year the economy has proved more resilient than many feared. Employment has remained at high levels, jobs for skilled employees are available, and with less certainty personal incomes have been maintained.Political uncertainty and efficient business management are an uneasy mix. In the recent winter and springbusinesses have had to live with an intense series of destabilising influences. For over  years, businesses in Ireland and the UK have grown accustomed to near frictionless EU market conditions. customs duties had disappeared on all internal EU trading. For businesses on this island, the memory of cross-border customs duties had all been but forgotten.   Looking at the lending performances of some of our own banks, the numbers seem to be adding up. In its full year accounts for , Danske Bank posted pre-tax profit of £.m, while new lending rose % and overall business lending increased by %.Across Donegall Square, Ulster Bank saw its income rising from £m to £m during , while profit after impairments stood at £m. There was a % rise in new corporate lending, while small business rose by %.Meanwhile, across the UK as a whole, Barclays has announced a £bn lending fund as part of a series of initiatives to help small and medium-sized businessesto succeed and flourish through Brexit and beyond.Only older colleaguescan remember the perils of railway journeys interrupted by a one hour stop at Goraghwood station, close to Newry, while all passengers were asked by customs officersthey had ‘anything to declare’. More affluent older travellers would more likely recall the cross-border queuing requirement for the predecessor of the ‘green card’ for cars. Today, the challenge is of how to deliver the political agreement that the border on this island should be either frictionless or non-existent as the UK plans to leave the EU. In the new era there will be redefined relations between NI and the Republic, within the framework of UK-EU relations. The important part lies in negotiations on working arrangements that have not yet officially started.For the remaining part of  and going into , the business scene might be described as getting ‘ready for le after Brexit’.In the last three years the business community which forms the core of the private sector in Northern Ireland has been trading successfully.  The evidence from local reviews of the larger profit making businesses has been encouraging. Year-on-year turnover has been increasing faster than inflation and, even more critically, profitability has been maintained and often improved.Work to identy how well locally owned and controlled businesses have performed has been reassuring. To be included in the review of the Top  more profitable Northern Ireland business, which will be published in more detail, the cut-off point has risen to just on £m annual pre-tax profits. In a further reassuring feature and in contrast to the preceding year, during the year  the number of business casualties fell to a very small number.While the overall performance of businesses in the private sector has been better than is sometimes appreciated, there is a mixture of features in the complex matrix of business performance. The evidence is often from personal subjective sources but the elements do point to a consistent pattern. Businesses have been trading, in general, with improved profits but with turnover rather less buoyant. Employment has been increasing, now more slowly, but pay rateshave not fully recovered from the fall in real earnings in the past decade. Interestingly at a regional and national level, changes in wage rates have not shown the boost of an inflationary increase that might have been expected when unemployment levels have fallen to near record lows.Bargaining in the labour market has been restrained, probably influenced by the siren voices of emerging problems as the Brexit withdrawal agreement has dominated the political and economic policy agenda. This points to the emergence of a contrast between the trend in overall business profitability, which has improved, alongside the trend for inidual personal incomes to lag behind the real levels of the past decade. To a modest degree, business profitability may have improved relative to changes in the costs of the payroll.While the scale of the dference should be treated with caution, as business evolves during the rest of , business finance may be better placed to activate improving investment plans.The post-Brexit business scene should be pointing to reduced uncertainty, even with some predictable new business obstacles, and a helpful change in government economic policy to incentivise faster economic expansion. That prospect, alongside a business sector that has a stronger capacity to invest and grow, makes the months ahead more encouraging than many experts expect.In summary, the business sector is understandably anxious to see aof greater business stability and, for a mixture of reasons, may now be more likely to implement more ambitious investment programmes. Add to this combination the possibility that official Government economic policy will be more flexibleand there is a hope that, out of the recent grey clouds of possible recession, there will be incentives leading to a more buoyant economy here.Just one moment of caution: the brightness of a new dawn in  may be dimmedthe political processes constrain the application of improved economic policies through a refreshed local administration. Business has been performing well, despite the huge levels of uncertainty. However, the political environment could drown out an improving economy. That challenge has not changed.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/graham_11.jpg","title":"word from the wise graham lapsley","story":"Posted on Wednesday  May  by Ulster Business Name: Graham Lapsley, head of private banking, Danske Bank How did you start out in business   Banking has always been in my blood as my father joined Belfast Banking Co Ltdin . As a boy I remember being in Northern Bank branches ‘helping out’ when my father was completing regular evenings doing overtime. This was an environment that I was familiar with, although I didn’t ever think I would make banking a career. In  I found myself in Limavady branch and thoroughly enjoyed branch banking at a time when there were no computers, no autobanks and lots of staff. I’ve benefited from lots of dferent roles at the Bank in my career, each bringing its own challenges. I left my role as head of personal credit last year to take up my current position as head of private banking. What have you found the most challenging during your years of business, so far On a personal level changing job roles always brought new challenges. Change is a constant which I accept and while I’ve worked in Danske Bank for  years I have had senior roles in branch banking, wealth management, business banking, risk management and now private banking.   As an area manager in branch banking, I found the leadership of the transition from Australian ownership to Danish ownership in  a huge challenge. This change was as exciting as it was challenging as we benefited from huge investment and the Dane’s leading edge technology. I didn’t go directly from school to university, but I’ve been lucky enough to have had employer support to complete a business studies degree and a masters’ degree in executive leadership. I’ve also attended business schools in Boston, Lausanne and London, with each giving me new tools to add into my skill set.  How would you describe your management style  I am energetic and enthusiastic. I love working with our relationship managers and customers to build a financial solution. I am very results oriented and prefer a direct style. I am very self-awareand have a positive outlook.  What would you changeyou could go back and do it all again  I’m not sure that I would change anything. I’ve learnt from my mistakes and that made me a better banker in the long term. Perhaps my ambition in my early career took me into roles that didn’t match my skill sets, but I did take away vital learnings from these experiences  Have you done it all on your own  Absolutely not. My we Sonya and family have always been a great support and this enabled me to have a good work le balance. I have a strong network personally and professionally, which is mutually supportive. I’ve also been lucky enough to have worked with many leaders who have greatly inspired me.  What’s more important, your product or your people  In Private Banking, without a doubt our people. We are a people business and our strength in Private Banking rests with the professionalism of the private banking team. We offer premium relationship management to our private banking customers, supported by leading edge digital solutions.

Danske is also the leading corporate and business bank in Northern Ireland, and many of these customers have their personal needs looked after by my private banking team.  What piece of advice would you give to a  year old you  You’ll never be judged on what happens to you, but you will be judged on how you react to it. And you won’t get the experience you need, until the day after you needed it.

I’ve heard employers bemoan the fact that this generation can’t communicate face-to-face or they place more emphasis on their passions outside of work than their own career development.While some of this is no doubt grounded in their experience, employers perhaps need to adjust how they engage with the new generation beyond just offering them quirky perks and trendy working environments. Hays recently sponsored The GoodIdea, the biggest ever AI hackathon in NI organised by AINIand Hackily – a two-day event hosted by QUB School of Computing and Ulster University Magee campus for around  hackers in Belfast and  in Derry.The hackathon provided a welcoming and collaborative environment for hackers to build out brilliant, innovative, and impactful ideas using AI under a theme of ‘AI for good’, where hackers were challenged to utilise open data sources to create an innovative solution to a real-world problem.It was an opportunity for students – who made up % of the attendees – and experienced professionals to meet fellow hackers, learn new technologies, and work alongside seasoned mentors.Far from being underwhelmed by Generation Z, we were inspired by the talent pools from dferent backgrounds such as computer science, physics and maths, coming together to collaborate with each other, learn about bleeding edge technologies and also to put their skills to use in creating something that was a benefit to society. For example, one of the teams invented an algorithm for a computer to read British sign language using a webcam.These were ambitious, driven, competitive young people who worked brilliantly in their teams and certainly didn’t struggle to communicate, eventhey arrived alone and joined a team. A team from Glasgow made the journey across to take part and the hackathon ran right through Saturday night – so we couldn’t fault their work ethic.There were prizes, mentorship and funding available to the winners of the hackathon, as well as recruitment advice and workshops provided to students and professionals by Hays’ own experts across software development, data engineering and cyber security.But the main attraction was undoubtedly in the opportunity to co-create new ideas about how to apply technology to the world they will run in future. That is hugely positive and our challenge as employers must be to make sure the students who will be the candidates of the future in NI’s thriving tech community are encouraged to put that passion into their careers.The undergraduate community is an under-served community of future leaders in terms of recruitment and our desire is to equip undergraduates with the right understanding of what employers in the tech sector want and how they can build their personal brand for the future.Employers need to get past the myths about Generation Z and focus on helping younger employees find meaning in their workthey are to unlock their potential.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/5g1.jpg","title":"belfast to get superfast g mobile broadband this month","story":"Posted on Wednesday  May  by John Mulgrew Suzanne Wylie, Belfast City Council with Karen Dundas, EE Victoria Square store manager Belfast is to become one of six UK cities to get superfast G mobile broadband later this month, it has emerged.
